If you can breathe, you can meditate. Just as water naturally runs downhill and leaves float naturally to the ground, we are all naturally able to settle into meditation. Meditation doesn't require trying; rather, meditation comes out of just allowing--not doing, just being. Whether you're a complete novice or you've \"tried it before,\" veteran meditation teacher Dean Sluyter's relaxed, down-to-earth approach will help you test-drive a variety of meditative techniques, such as breath, sound, the senses, the sky, and the simple sense of \"I\" and discover which ones fit you best. You'll discover that the key to meditation is effortlessness and find all the practical tips you need for adapting these methods to your own life as you live it, even for a few minutes a day. And as your life opens to deep happiness, clarity, peace, and creative energy, you'll be inspired to keep on practicing--naturally.

What made the experience of listening to Natural Meditation the most enjoyable? I generally prefer books read by the author, and in the case of Dean's latest book, it is particularly effective. Dean has been teaching meditation techniques for decades, and it definitely shows in his delivery of his own text, which flows as naturally from his lips as his words flowed from his mind to the page. 3 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Kindle Customer](/listener/amzn1.account.AFISQUWZX23NJGULFFSYD3TJNEYA?ref=a_pd_Natura_c15_rvlsnl_1&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=Y78S5W8ZCCXVK2SR7H6A&pageLoadId=jNI0VR4sOxEQhn4m&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 04-05-16 highly recommend love this book. it gives great insight into the simplicity of meditating. I feel my meditation practice has come a long way since listening and reading Mr. Sluyter's book. Meditation is no longer a scary word or a time to fret. it's now a time to look forward to and enjoy. and relax in. and I find myself relaxing more and more in everyday situations which is pretty fabulous as I gave myself ulcers at the age of 16 because I worried so much. now I just breathe and let things go. and Mr. Sluyter has helped me get better at this. I also have his 10 suggestions book. it's good too. thank you sir for your insight. once again I highly recommend this book. all the best and happy meditating. 2 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Q.
