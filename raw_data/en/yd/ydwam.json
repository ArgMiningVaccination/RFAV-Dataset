Acupuncture can assist the body to heal itself by affecting certain physiological changes. The method of action of acupuncture involves insertion of tiny needles into specific points on the body that can stimulate nerves, increase blood circulation, relieve muscle spasm, and cause the release of hormones, such as endorphins (one of the body's pain control chemicals) and cortisol (a natural steroid). Acupuncture is generally very well tolerated in our companion animals and oftentimes produces a sense of comfort and well-being that cannot be achieved otherwise. The benefits of acupuncture are many, potential side effects are minimal, and treatment is rarely contraindicated. Please contact us today if you feel that your pet could benefit from acupuncture treatment. "}
