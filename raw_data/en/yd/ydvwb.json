Cochrane Database of Systematic Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A B S T R A C T Background Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with women's quality of life, regardless of the absolute amount of bleeding. It is a very common condition in women of reproductive age, aecting 2 to 5 of every 10 women. Diverse treatments, either medical (hormonal or non-hormonal) or surgical, are currently available for HMB, with dierent eectiveness, acceptability, costs and side eects. The best treatment will depend on the woman's age, her intention to become pregnant, the presence of other symptoms, and her personal views and preferences. Objectives To identify, systematically assess and summarise all evidence from studies included in Cochrane Reviews on treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), using reviews with comparable participants and outcomes; and to present a ranking of the first- and second-line treatments for HMB. Methods We searched for published Cochrane Reviews of HMB interventions in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The primary outcomes were menstrual bleeding and satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, adverse events and the requirement of further treatment. Two review authors independently selected the systematic reviews, extracted data and assessed quality, resolving disagreements by discussion. We assessed review quality using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool and evaluated the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods. We grouped the interventions into first- and second-line treatments, considering participant characteristics (desire for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment, candidacy for surgery). First-line treatments included medical interventions, and second-line treatments included both the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and surgical treatments; thus the LNG-IUS is included in both groups. We developed dierent networks for first- and second-line treatments. We performed network meta-analyses of all outcomes, except for quality of life, where we performed pairwise meta-analyses. We reported the mean rank, the network estimates for mean dierence (MD) or odds ratio (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the certainty of evidence (moderate, low or very low certainty).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews We also analysed dierent endometrial ablation and other NREA. Main results We included nine systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Library up to July 2021. We updated the reviews that were over two years old. In July 2020, we started the overview with no new reviews about the topic. The included medical interventions were: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic and luteal oral progestogens, LNG-IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included to provide indirect evidence), which were compared to placebo. Surgical interventions were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of route of) hysterectomy, REA, NREA, unspecified endometrial ablation (EA) and LNG-IUS. We grouped the interventions as follows. First-line treatments Evidence from 26 studies with 1770 participants suggests that LNG-IUS results in a large reduction of menstrual blood loss (MBL; mean rank 2.4, MD 105.71 mL/cycle, 95% CI 10.33; low certainty MD CI 153.82 to 0.05; low certainty evidence), and NSAIDs slightly reduce MBL (mean rank 6.4, MD 40.67 mL/cycle, 84.61 to 3.27; low certainty evidence; reference comparator mean rank 8.9). We are uncertain of the true eect of the remaining interventions and the sensitivity analysis for reduction of MBL, as the evidence was rated as very low certainty. We are uncertain of the true eect of any intervention (very low certainty evidence) on the perception of improvement and satisfaction. Second-line treatments Bleeding reduction is related to the type of hysterectomy (total or supracervical/subtotal), not the route, so we combined all routes of hysterectomy for bleeding outcomes. We assessed the reduction of MBL without imputed data (11 trials, 1790 participants) and with imputed data (15 trials, 2241 participants). Evidence without imputed data suggests that hysterectomy (mean rank 1.2, OR 25.71, 95% CI 1.50 to 439.96; low certainty evidence) and REA (mean rank 2.8, OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.29 to 5.66; low certainty evidence) result in a large reduction of MBL, and NREA probably results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 2.0, OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.53 to 7.23; moderate certainty evidence). Evidence with imputed data suggests hysterectomy results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 1.0, OR 14.31, 95% CI 2.99 to 68.56; low certainty evidence), and NREA probably results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 2.2, OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.29 to 6.05; moderate certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the true eect for REA (very low certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the eect on amenorrhoea (very low certainty evidence). Evidence from 27 trials with 4284 participants suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction (mean rank 1.3, OR 7.96, 95% CI 3.33 to 19.03; low certainty evidence), and NREA also increases satisfaction (mean rank 3.6, OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.33; low certainty evidence), but we are uncertain of the true eect of the remaining interventions (very low certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Evidence suggests LNG-IUS is the best first-line treatment for reducing menstrual blood loss (MBL); antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long-cycle progestogens are likely the third best. We cannot make conclusions about the eect of first-line treatments on perception of improvement and satisfaction, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. For second-line treatments, evidence suggests hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, followed by REA and NREA. We are uncertain of the eect on amenorrhoea, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. Minimally invasive hysterectomy may result in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA also increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true eect of the remaining second-line interventions, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Which is the best treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding? Key results Evidence suggests that the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is the best first-line option for reducing menstrual bleeding, while antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long-cycle progestogens are the third best. Because of some limitations in the evidence, we are not sure what the true eect of these first-line treatments is for the perception of improvement and satisfaction. For second-line treatments, evidence suggests any type of hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, even though this is a major surgery, and resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA) and non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA) are second and third best. We are uncertain of the true eect of the second-line treatments on amenorrhoea (absence of menstrual blood loss). Evidence suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true eect of the remaining interventions.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.2Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews What is heavy menstrual bleeding? Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with the quality of life of people who menstruate. It is very common and can aect 20% to 50% of people who menstruate during their reproductive years. There are dierent treatments available, each with their own pros and cons. The best treatment depends on the person's age, whether they have or want to have children, their personal preferences, and their medical history, among other things. What did we want to find out? We wanted to get an overview of all the published evidence on dierent treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. We were most interested in finding out if the treatments were eective for reducing menstrual bleeding and for improving women's satisfaction. We also wanted to know how the treatment aected quality of life, what side eects it caused, and whether women required further treatment. What did we do? This study is an overview of reviews, which means we looked for published studies that synthesised the results of other studies on dierent treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. Then we tried to give a broad overview of all that evidence. We analysed the certainty of the evidence based on factors like study size and methodological rigour. We categorised the treatments based on patient characteristics, including the desire (intention) for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment or having been referred for surgery. First-line treatment included medical interventions and second-line treatment included the LNG-IUS plus surgical interventions; thus, the LNG-IUS was included in both first- and second-line treatments. We used network meta-analysis, a statistical method that compares all the interventions at the same time, to find out which treatments produced the best results for patients. What did we find? We found nine reviews with 104 studies, involving a total of 11,881 participants. Altogether, the data we analysed came from 85 trials and 9950 participants. The medical interventions included were: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic and luteal oral progestogens, the LNG-IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included only to provide indirect evidence). These were compared to placebo (sham treatment). The surgical interventions included were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of) route of hysterectomy, REA, NREA and unspecified endometrial ablation (EA). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in some evidence is moderate, but for most of it, our confidence is low to very low. The main reasons were because the studies were o:\u00b5\"ten not blinded, which means the participants knew which treatment they were receiving, and that could have changed their perception; the direct and indirect evidence was not similar enough to compare in the network; and the range of the results was too wide. How up to date is this evidence? The last search for reviews was in July 2021.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with the physical, emotional, social and material quality of life of people who menstruate, and it can occur alone or in combination with other symptoms ( Munro 2012 ; NICE 2018a ), such as dysmenorrhoea, fatigue or headache. HMB can lead to other serious health issues, such as iron deficiency anaemia, which occurs in one in four people with HMB ( Morrison 2008 ). Abnormal uterine bleeding is o:\u00b5\"ten used interchangeably with HMB. However, abnormal uterine bleeding is much broader and includes many gynaecological diseases. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classifies the gynaecological diseases related to abnormal uterine bleeding as having structural causes (polyp, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, malignancy, and hyperplasia); being unrelated to structural causes (coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial dysfunction, and iatrogenic); or as not yet classified ( Munro 2012 ). This review will be restricted to HMB. HMB is objectively defined as menstrual blood loss of 80 mL or more per menstrual period ( Cole 1971 ; Hallberg 1966 ), which is not related to pregnancy or any systemic condition (for example, bleeding or thyroid disorders) or gynaecological disease. HMB is also known as menorrhagia. Historically, the gold standard for objectively assessing menstrual bleeding is the haematin alkaline method: this requires the woman to provide all the pads and tampons she uses, and then in the laboratory, a sodium hydroxide solution allows calculation of haemoglobin, and thus of the amount of menstrual bleeding ( Shaw 1972 ). However, in a clinical setting, the objective measurement of menstrual blood loss is impractical ( Edlund 2011 ). Currently, with the clinical diagnosis centred on the women's perception of HMB, the measured amount of blood loss has a secondary role; rather, evaluating the clinical success of treatment should be focused on the woman's perception of improvement. The prevalence of HMB based on objective measurement ranges from 9% to 14%, but in studies that subjectively assess HMB, it is as high as 20% to 52% ( Fraser 2009 ; NICE 2007 ). In England and Wales, every year around 30,000 women undergo surgical treatment for HMB ( RCOG 2012 ). HMB is estimated to account for around 30% of total gynaecological visits in the USA and represents an important encumbrance for more than 10 million women ( Liu 2007 ; Miller 2015 ). Treatment costs ascend to approximately USD 1.3 billion, and lost productivity to around USD 12 billion to USD 36 billion per year ( Liu 2007 ; Miller 2015 ). In Japan, 19% of women 15 to 49 years of age reported HMB ( Tanaka 2013 ). In low- and middle-income countries, the incidence of HMB appears to be similar to that of high-income countries, although data are limited ( Haththotuwa 2011 ). Data from a systematic review in 2004 assessing the epidemiology of menstrual disorders in low- and middle-income countries reported a prevalence of HMB of 15%, ranging from 5% in rural Gambia to 20% in China ( Harlow 2004 ). The prevalence of HMB varies by age. In a population-based prevalence study with nearly 1000 healthy adolescent girls, approximately 40% had experienced HMB ( Friberg 2006 ). The annual rate of presentation to health services with HMB in the UKis around 2% before the age of 40 and increases to 5% between 45 and 49 years of age ( NICE 2007 ). A Swedish study conducted to assess quality of life in women with HMB reported that prevalence in women aged 40 to 45 years was 32% ( Karlsson 2014 ). Adequate assessment, followed by appropriate treatment, considerably improves the quality of life of women with HMB (Hurskainen 2007 ). Description of the interventions Diverse medical and surgical treatments are available for treating HMB, with dierent eectiveness, tolerability, acceptability and cost for the patient. The woman's age, intention to become pregnant, associated symptoms, preferences and values are important for selecting the treatment. First-line treatments for HMB include all medical interventions (non-hormonal and hormonal). Second-line treatments include the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and all surgical interventions; they may be appropriate when previous medical treatment has failed, when women have completed their family or when they are surgical candidates. LNG-IUS is considered both a first- and second-line treatment. Medical interventions Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and mefenamic acid, are a non- hormonal oral medical intervention. NSAIDs have potent anti- inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity and are among the most widely used drugs worldwide ( Bacchi 2012 ). NSAIDs should be avoided in women with severe asthma, gastrointestinal ulceration or kidney disease. Antifibrinolytic agents Tranexamic acid is the most commonly used antifibrinolytic agent. Antifibrinolytics should be avoided in women with thromboembolic disease or a history of convulsions ( Lecker I 2016 ). Combined hormonal contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptive methods contain oestrogen and progestin. There are dierent regimens and delivery routes available, including oral, vaginal, transdermal and intramuscular. Not all delivery routes have been assessed for the management of HMB. Combined hormonal contraceptives have been linked to a higher risk of thrombotic side eects, although the oestrogen dose has been gradually reduced from 150 g in the original preparations to 30 g or less at the time of writing, which has reduced the risk considerably ( Spero 2010 ). Combined hormonal contraceptives are still associated with a small increased risk of venous thromboembolism ( De Bastos 2014 ). This overview included two dierent types of combined hormonal contraceptives: combined oral contraceptive (COC) and combined vaginal ring (CVR). Cyclical oral progestogens During the 1990s, oral progestogens were the most commonly prescribed drug for HMB ( Coulter 1995 ). Oral progestogens can be taken during the luteal phase (day 14 to 24 of the menstrual cycle) or as an extended regimen for 20 to 25 days per cycle. Cyclical progestogens are not contraceptives.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews dose progestogens is associated with side eects, such as weight gain, nausea, headaches and decreased libido. Progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems (Pg-IUS or LNG-IUS) The progesterone-releasing intrauterine systems are small T- shaped systems, inserted into the uterine cavity through the cervix, releasing small amounts of a progestogen (levonorgestrel) locally. The LNG-IUS is available in dierent formats with varying doses of levonorgestrel released over varying periods. Danazol () Danazol is an oral drug that interferes with the pituitary gland, preventing the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone. Danazol is contraindicated in pregnancy and should be used along with safe contraception in sexually active women ( Brunskill 1992 ). Danazol is currently used for a myriad of haematological conditions ( Audia 2016 ), and it used to be commonly prescribed for HMB during the 1990s. However, although its adverse events are infrequent, other safer and fairly similarly eective alternatives are available. Reported adverse events are usually androgenic and anti-oestrogenic, and haematologically can be either anticoagulant or procoagulant (Alvarado 2001 ). In a cohort of 530 patients, 29% reported at least one adverse event: 6% Jick 1995 has to liver damage ( Alvaro 1996 ). () Despite being eective in reducing menstrual bleeding, its adverse events advise against its use for HMB. We included danazol in this overview to provide indirect comparisons in the network meta-analysis. Ethamsylate Ethamsylate is a synthetic haemostatic drug used for capillary bleeding ( Garay 2006 ). It was widely used for HMB in the 1970s and 1980s ( Harrison 1976 ). With less promising results, its use for HMB over the past 20 years has been negligible ( (D) Bonnar 1996 ; Bongers 2004 ). We included ethamsylate in this overview to provide indirect comparisons in the network meta-analysis. Surgical interventions techniques aiming to remove or destroy the endometrium (inner layer of the uterus). They are usually categorised by generation: first-generation techniques require direct visualisation of the uterine cavity, while second- or third-generation procedures do not. Although these categories are widely used in the literature, there is evidence that endometrial ablation started in the late 19 th century with non-resectoscopic techniques ( Famuyide 2018 ). In 1894, Sneguire applied steam to arrest profuse bleeding during the removal of a parasitic liver cyst and then started using it to control surgical bleeding on the lungs, kidneys, long bones and, eventually, uterine bleeding in women ( Famuyide 2018 ). In the late 1890s, the equipment was improved, adding some safety features and defining indications and contraindications ( Blacker 1902 ). Simultaneously, Pincus defined two types of procedures: atmocausis, which used steam directly on the endometrium, and zestocausis, which used metal to provide the heat ( Famuyide2018 ; Pincus 1899a ; Pincus 1899b ). Honouring the first attempts of endometrial ablation, we will use the categories based on the procedures' characteristics ( Famuyide 2018 ablation (REA) involves dierent forms of energy delivered through an operative hysteroscope to remove or destroy the endometrium, such group of devices designed to destroy the endometrium without a resectoscope (not requiring fluid distention of the uterine cavity). Although it is a non-hysteroscopic technique, pre- and postprocedure diagnostic hysteroscopy or intraprocedural ultrasound guidance may be useful for safety and intracavitary device placement ( Laberge 2015 ). Hysterectomy Hysterectomy is a major surgical procedure, consisting of removing the uterus, with or without the adnexa. Some examples of hysterectomy complications are infection, thromboembolic complications, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tract bleeding and vaginal cu dehiscence ( Clarke-Pearson 2013 ). The complications vary depending on the route and the surgical technique. How the intervention might work Medical interventions Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) The endometrium of women with HMB has high prostaglandin levels compared to women with normal menstrual bleeding. NSAIDs (such as mefenamic acid and ibuprofen, among others) reduce prostaglandin levels by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase ( Rees 1987 ; Smith 1981 regularly during menses can alleviate HMB. Antifibrinolytic agents Increased levels of plasminogen activators (group of enzymes that cause fibrinolysis) have been found in the endometrium of women with HMB compared to women with normal menstrual bleeding (Gleeson 1994 ). Tranexamic acid is a true plasminogen activator inhibitor, making it an alternative drug for reducing menstrual bleeding. Combined hormonal contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives contain dierent combinations of oestrogen and progestin. Oestrogen provides negative feedback on follicle-stimulating hormone secretion and prevents the development of a dominant follicle ( Bradley 2016 ), providing endometrial stability and growth, improving the progestational impact. At the same time, progestin impedes the rise of luteinising hormone and consequently prevents ovulation and creates an atrophic endometrial lining. This combination reduces overall menstrual blood loss ( Fritz 2012 ). Dierent routes of delivery have been assessed to manage HMB ( Uhm 2014 ), such as the ( (D) Dahiya 2016 ; Micks 2013 ).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Cyclical oral progestogens The role of progestogens in treating HMB might work \"by stabilizing endometrial fragility; inhibiting the growth of the endometrium by triggering apoptosis; inhibiting angiogenesis; and stimulating the conversion of estradiol to the less active oestrone\" ( Fritz 2012 ). Progestogens can be used in dierent regimens, either during the entire cycle, during the luteal phase only, or for a longer period of 20 to 25 days. When used as a long-course treatment, oral progestogens prevent ovulation and ovarian steroidogenesis. As a consequence, they discontinue the production of oestrogen receptors and the oestrogen-dependent stimulation of the endometrium, leading to an atrophic endometrium ( Bradley 2016 ). Progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems With this device, hormones are released locally into the uterine cavity, resulting in high progestogen levels in the endometrial tissue but low systemic circulation levels. As a consequence of the local action of the progesterone, endometrial growth is suppressed (Herman 2013 ), and in turn, menstrual bleeding decreases. Danazol Danazol is a synthetic steroid ethisterone. It prevents pituitary secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone. Danazol has a weak androgenic influence, producing atrophy of endometrial tissue, which reduces menstrual loss and may lead to amenorrhoea in some women ( (N) Chimbira ablation destroy the endometrium (lining of the cavity of the uterus). They are safe, eective, minimally invasive procedures, performed through the cervix, with dierent methods for removing (resection) or destroying (ablation) the endometrium ( Kumar 2016 ). Hysterectomy Although surgically removing the uterus is invasive, it represents the most definitive treatment option for HMB. It is important to assess the relative risk and the plans for future childbearing before making the decision. There are four dierent surgical approaches: Why it is important to do this overview HMB has a high prevalence amongst otherwise healthy women of reproductive age. Dierent interventions are currently available, including pharmacological treatments (hormonal and non- hormonal) and surgical procedures. This overview aims to assess and rank the safety and eicacy of the treatments with regard to blood loss reduction, satisfaction with treatment, quality of life, adverse eects and treatment failure, and to summarise the data in an accessible way for patients and their families, physicians, healthcare providers and policymakers. Network meta- analysis compares more than two interventions at the same time. This allows the comparison of interventions that have not been compared directly in the studies, as long as they form a connected network, providing a complete summary of evidence. There isan overview of interventions for HMB available during pandemics (Bofill Rodriguez 2020a ), which was developed in 2020 and inspired by the challenges of the pandemic to the health system; it includes only medical interventions that required minimal (or no) face- to-face contact; thus, it did not include LNG-IUS or any surgical procedure. It also only reported pairwise meta-analysis. O B J E C T I V E S To identify, systematically assess and summarise all evidence from studies included in Cochrane Reviews on treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), using reviews with comparable participants and outcomes; and to present a ranking of the first- and second-line treatments for HMB. M E T H O D S Criteria for considering reviews for inclusion We included Cochrane Reviews of interventions for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in otherwise healthy women, which are published in the Cochrane Library; we did not include non- Cochrane reviews in the overview. Not all studies included in the Cochrane Reviews contributed data to the overview, only studies reporting on the overview outcomes. The references to studies contributing with data to the overview are in the ' Additional references ' section and are designated by a (D) for data prefacing the name of the study. We have formulated our overview in the PICO (participants, interventions, control, outcome) format. Type of participants Women in reproductive years with HMB, assessed objectively or semi-objectively, using the haematin alkaline method, pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC), or patient perception of HMB. We conducted a subgroup analysis based on whether the participants were surgical candidates or not. We considered the 'the desire (or intention) of future pregnancy' , 'women or 'medical treatment failure' as inclusion or exclusion criteria to determine if the participants were surgical candidates. According to that, we performed the network meta-analysis for first- or second-line treatment. The progestogen-releasing intrauterine system (LNG- IUS) was part of both groups. Type of interventions We included medical and surgical treatments for HMB that were included in Cochrane Reviews. Medical interventions Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Antifibrinolytic agents Combined hormonal contraceptives divided according to the delivery route in combined oral contraceptives and combined vaginal ring Cyclical oral progestogens, divided by the length of the cycle in luteal-phase or long-cycle oral progestogens (three to four weeks per cycle) Progestogen releasing intrauterine system Interventions for heavy menstrual bleeding; overview of Cochrane reviews and network meta-analysis (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Danazol and ethamsylate (included only to provide indirect evidence) Progestin-only contraceptives, such as injections and implants, usually reduce menstrual blood loss in the general population and can cause amenorrhoea ( Di Carlo, 2015 ; Jacobsten 2014 ). They are commonly used o-label for HMB; we performed a search on the topic. See Appendix 1 for details. Surgical interventions Resectocopic endometrial ablation as transcervical the route: minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic), open (abdominal) and unspecified (or route at surgeon's discretion) Control We compared interventions with placebo or no intervention and with other interventions. Types of outcome measures Primary outcomes Menstrual bleeding reduction Objectively assessed by the haematin alkaline method, mean blood loss during treatment, mean reduction of blood loss from baseline during treatment or mean blood loss at dierent periods Semi-objectively assessed using the PBAC, mean dierence of PBAC at dierent periods or the proportion of women with reduction in bleeding as measured by PBAC under dierent cutos Subjectively assessed patient perception of HMB: participants' perceived blood loss (better, same, worse) Prevalence of amenorrhoea or hypomenorrhoea a:\u00b5\"ter treatment Satisfaction with treatment at one year follow-up, reported as a dichotomous outcome as the proportion of women satisfied with treatment. Some trials reported this using a four-level scale questionnaire, either very satisfied, satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, dissatisfied, or liking treatment very well, well, moderately, poorly; in both cases, we considered the two first categories satisfactory. Secondary outcomes Quality of life improvement: women's perceived change in quality of life, where it was recorded in a reproducible and validated format Adverse eects of any severity recorded within the included Cochrane Reviews Requirement of further surgery or additional medical treatment at one year follow-up.Search methods for identification of reviews We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) in the Cochrane Library for any reviews with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) or menorrhagia in the title, abstract or keyword fields. The last search was in July 2021. Data collection and analysis Selection of reviews Two overview authors (MBR and JB) independently assessed all potentially eligible reviews identified by the search strategy. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. During the first review search, one of the authors was involved in one HMB review (JB, combined hormonal contraceptives for HMB), and the other (MB) was not involved in any reviews. We created 'Characteristics of reviews' tables, including the following information: review title; author team; number of included trials and participants; participant characteristics (inclusion and exclusion criteria); interventions and comparisons; primary and secondary outcomes and date of the last search. Data extraction and management Two review authors (MB and VJ) independently extracted data from each included review, resolving any disagreements by discussion or adjudication by a third overview author. In order to obtain data in a valid format for the network meta-analysis (NMA), we extracted data from individual studies contributing to each of the outcomes. We summarised key information from each study contributing to the NMA on the data extraction form, including participant's details, the interventions, comparisons and outcomes (see Table 1 and Table 2 for the characteristics of studies contributing to the NMA). Outcomes were focused on bleeding reduction, satisfaction, improvement of quality of life and adverse eects. We extracted the following characteristics from each included Cochrane Review. 1. Review title and authors. 2. Date that the review was last assessed as up-to-date or declared a stable review. 3. Number of trials. 4. Number of participants. 5. Participant characteristics. 6. Inclusion criteria. 7. Exclusion criteria. 8. Outcomes. 9. Where available, the GRADE assessment and any relevant comments made in the review's 'Summary of findings' table regarding trial quality and risk of bias (only for pairwise meta- analysis). For the trials contributing to the NMA, we extracted the same information except for the GRADE assessment, as it is not available for individual studies. We solved any disagreements by discussion between the author team. We contacted review and trial authors where necessary to clarify data included in the reviews.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.7Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Where multiple Cochrane Reviews used the same data, we used it only once to avoid duplication of evidence and consequent double-counting of trial data. We reconciled data across the various reviews to ensure that all the information on each arm of the study was included appropriately. If there was any discrepancy between reviews, two review authors reviewed the original publication. As we anticipated in the protocol, we had various trials of treatment for HMB in more than one review. As the Review Manager (RevMan) format for overviews allows the inclusion of reviews only, we added the individual studies providing data for the NMAs in the additional references adding a (D), as in data, for easy access and to dierentiate them from additional references, and with (N) for the studies that were included but did not contribute data to the NMA. Assessment of methodological quality of included reviews Methodological quality of included Cochrane Reviews Two overview authors assessed the included reviews with the AMSTAR 2 quality measurement tool ( Shea 2017 ). SL assessed all of the reviews, MW assessed five reviews, MB assessed three reviews and VJ assessed one review (to avoid review authors assessing the quality of their own reviews). The overview authors solved any discrepancies by discussion; when necessary, a third overview author was included to adjucate (CF). The original AMSTAR tool included 11 items ( Shea 2007 ); the new AMSTAR 2 tool includes 16 items in total, and the response categories are simpler with a more comprehensive user guide, including reasons for the final assessment. The final assessments are rated 'yes' , 'partial yes' or 'no' . The overall rating is based on weaknesses in critical domains ( Shea 2017 ). See Appendix 2 for AMSTAR 2 details. Quality of trial evidence included in Cochrane Reviews We did not reassess the risk of bias for trials included in reviews, as they were assessed in the original reviews. Studies in the danazol review (which has not been updated) were also included in fully assessed reviews. There were only a few inconsistencies between reviews in the risk of bias assessment. When inconsistency was present, one overview author (MB) acted as a third party, checking the reasons for the assessment and the original trials and discussing the assessments with another overview author (CF). For example, review authors judged one study as being at uncertain risk of bias for all categories, as they only had access to a short conference publication and were not able to contact the authors, while in another review, review authors had access to an unpublished copy of the study; thus we used the risk of bias assessment of the review with access to the data. In one review, review authors rated three studies as being at high risk, and in another review, the authors rated the risk of bias as unknown for not mentioning either allocation or blinding; we considered the risk to be unknown. In another review, authors rated one trial from the 1990s as being at high risk of selective reporting because it did not have a protocol, but another review rated the risk as low because the study reported all the pre-specified outcomes; we considered it to be at low risk. Where possible, for pairwise comparisons, we used the Cochrane Review authors' GRADE assessments of relevant outcomes, as presented in the summary of findings tables of included CochraneReviews. Where GRADE summaries were not available for our outcomes, two overview authors (MBR and AL) independently assessed the quality using GRADEpro ( GRADEpro GDT 2015 ). The GRADE summary of findings in a Cochrane Review includes an overall judgement of the risks of bias in the specific trials contributing data to the pooled eect estimate for each outcome displayed in the table. In addition to the risk of bias, for each outcome the GRADE assessment takes into consideration the following domains: imprecision of eects (due to wide confidence intervals, sparse data or both); unexplained inconsistency between trials (as measured by the I 2 statistic value/heterogeneity); indirectness (dierences in the population, intervention, comparison or outcome of trials); and evidence of publication bias, where the meta-analysis includes suicient trials. Pooled evidence for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with serious problems in any of these domains is downgraded one level. If problems are very serious, we may downgrade evidence by two levels. The Guideline Development Tool assesses these downgrading decisions and assigns the pooled estimate for each outcome a rating of either high, moderate, low or very low certainty (GRADE handbook ; GRADEpro GDT 2015 ; Guyatt 2008 ). There are standard definitions to aid the interpretation of GRADE ratings, as follows. High: further research should not alter our confidence in evidence rated as high certainty. Moderate: future research will likely impact our confidence in moderate certainty evidence and could change the estimates. Low or very low: there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the eect estimates considered to be of low or very low certainty, and further research will impact our confidence in these eect estimates and change the estimates ( Guyatt 2008 ; Guyatt 2011a ). We intended to exclude evidence of low or very low certainty, as the GRADE rating of evidence is an important finding of the overview. Unfortunately, as most trials were at high risk of performance bias, most of the evidence was low certainty, so we included it. A GRADE assessment may be further translated into a summary statement that incorporates the clinical importance of the eect, for clarity, using the following guide. We have interpreted the evidence following the 'GRADE guidelines 26: Informative statements to communicate the findings of systematic reviews of interventions' by Santesso 2020 . For outcomes subject to NMA, we present a summary of findings table, adapted from Yepes-Nunez 2019 . For NMA, one summary of findings table is produced for each outcome and contains eect estimates, credible intervals or confidence intervals, certainty of evidence (for each included intervention compared to one comparator) and a ranking. The NMA summary of findings table from Yepes-Nunez 2019 reports the number of trials and patients providing direct evidence between the intervention and the common comparator and uses credible intervals. We adapted the table, including the number of trials and participants providing direct evidence for each intervention, and we reported confidence intervals. The certainty of the evidence for each intervention takes into account both the certainty of the evidence provided by direct and indirect comparisons, inconsistency or incoherence (consistency Interventions for heavy menstrual bleeding; overview of Cochrane reviews and network meta-analysis (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.8Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews between direct and indirect evidence), and imprecision (of the network estimate). To rate the certainty of evidence of the NMA and interpret it, we considered the direct, indirect and network estimate for each comparison and outcome ( Brignardello-Petersen2017 ; Brignardello-Petersen 2019 ; Puhan 2014 ). The rating of the direct estimate considered the risk of bias, inconsistency-heterogeneity, indirectness and publication bias of the direct evidence. If the direct evidence was of high certainty and direct evidence contributed as much as the indirect, we intended to rate the network estimate directly (no comparison was rated of high certainty evidence). If it was moderate, low or very low certainty, we rated the indirect estimate. We rated the indirect evidence considering the most dominant first-order loop (if available, and if more than one was available we intended to choose the one with a larger number of participants and trials), looking at its direct estimates. Indirect evidence was rated lower than the direct evidence providing evidence on the loop. A loop is a section of the network diagram, with three or more interventions interconnected with direct evidence, and each direct source of evidence can be complemented by an indirect source of evidence for the same comparison. The certainty was considered to be the same as whichever piece of direct evidence on the loop had the lowest certainty. The indirect evidence was also assessed for transitivity. The transitivity assumption requires that the distribution of eect modifiers be similar for all sources of direct evidence ( Salanti 2014 ); this was evaluated conceptually. Finally, we rated the network estimate, choosing the estimate that contributed the most to the comparison (either directly or indirectly, or the highest if both contributed similarly and there was no incoherence) and examined for incoherence (inconsistency test) and imprecision (intervals and direction of eect). We did not interpret the findings from the NMA as proposed by Brignardello-Petersen 2020 , as we did not have a threshold of clinical significance for the outcomes. Data synthesis Types of outcomes We included Cochrane Reviews that reported one or both of the primary outcomes: menstrual blood loss reduction or treatment satisfaction. We included clinically important secondary outcome measures, such as quality of life, side eects and requirement of further treatment. We planned to impute data where missing for primary outcomes and conduct a sensitivity analysis, testing such results with and without the imputed data. Data synthesis and presentation We organised the review evidence for each subgroup (first and second-line treatments). NMA is a method that allows synthesis of information from a network of trials assessing the same question, but comparing dierent interventions. It allows inferences on interventions that have not been compared directly in any studies and can increase the precision for comparisons with limited data ( Caldwell 2014 ; Salanti 2014 ). NMA enables comparisons using direct and indirect evidence simultaneously and can rank all interventions coherently. Direct evidence is obtained from trials that directly compare two or more interventions, and indirect evidence is also combined whentwo interventions have been compared to a common comparator. With NMA it is possible to compare multiple interventions at the same time, even if some of them have not been compared to each other. However, the network needs to be connected. The interventions in each NMA are represented by a diagram, where nodes represent the interventions, and the size of the nodes is proportional to the number of participants randomised to that intervention. Nodes are connected by lines; the width of the lines is proportional to the number of trials available for that comparison. An NMA requires included studies to be suiciently similar so that the distribution of the eect modifiers is similar for all sources of direct evidence ( Higgins 2021 ; Salanti 2014 ). This is referred to as consistency (also coherence or transitivity) ( Dias 2019 ). We conducted network meta-analysis using the Stata 16 network package ( White 2015 ), as RevMan does not support NMA; the NMA model estimation was based on multivariable meta-analysis. We conducted the NMA using individual studies from the included reviews (checking and deleting duplicates), for the following outcomes. First-line treatments. Menstrual blood loss reduction: mean blood loss (combining mean blood loss at the end of treatment and change from baseline); mean blood loss at the end of treatment (sensitivity analysis); and perception of bleeding improvement. Satisfaction. Adverse events: side eects and serious adverse events. Second-line treatments. Menstrual blood loss reduction: PBAC reduction; proportion with blood loss of PBAC under 75 mL (normal menstrual blood loss) or acceptable improvement (participant perception). Satisfaction. Requirement of further surgery (endometrial ablation or hysterectomy) up to one year follow-up. Bleeding reduction, and in consequence the requirement of further surgery for treatment failure, are not related to the route of hysterectomy but rather the type of hysterectomy (total or supracervical/subtotal), so we combined all routes of hysterectomy for bleeding outcomes and requirement of further surgery due to treatment failure. We conducted a second subgroup analysis for endometrial resection and ablation procedures. We divided the EA subgroup by type of procedure into resectoscopic and non-resectoscopic ablation, and each group into dierent types using the most common ones, leaving the remaining as a group. REA was divided in TCRE with or without rollerball, and other REA. NREA was divided by procedure into microwave NREA, hydrothermal ablation Interventions for heavy menstrual bleeding; overview of Cochrane reviews and network meta-analysis (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews requirement of further surgery or HMB treatment: any (EA or hysterectomy) and requirement of further hysterectomy. We assumed a common estimate for the heterogeneity variance across the dierent comparisons. Fixed-eect and random-eects models were fitted where possible. Random-eects models were fitted only where there were three or more studies in at least one treatment comparison. We inspected the heterogeneity estimate, Tau, and where it was close to zero, we presented results for the fixed-eect model. Where Tau was moderate to large, we presented results for the random-eects model. We compared Tau to the size of the estimated relative eects and considered it in relation to the scale of the outcomes. Where Tau was consistently larger than the estimated relative treatment eects when considered on the same scale, we qualitatively described it as large, since this implies that the variability between relative treatment eects can be larger than the eects themselves. Where Tau was similar or smaller than the estimated relative eects, we qualitatively described it as moderate. For the selected model (fixed-eect or random-eects), we checked consistency for each network using the node-split model and inconsistency models ( Dias 2010 ; Dias 2018 ; Van Valkenhoef 2016 ; White 2015 ). If evidence of inconsistency in loops using the node-split model or overall inconsistency model was detected (P < 0.05), we attempted to explain it by checking the data and study inclusion for errors. Where we could not identify an explanation, we expressed caution in interpreting the results. When the inconsistency was extremely high, we did not perform NMA. We reported the network estimates for mean dierence (MD) or odds ratio (OR), with 95% confidence interval (CI), the certainty of evidence (moderate, low or very low), mean rank and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). SUCRA is a numeric representation of the overall ranking. It has a single number associated with each treatment, and the values range from 0% to 100%. The larger the SUCRA, the higher the chances a treatment is ranked highest among all the available treatments. On the contrary, the lower the SUCRA, the more likely the intervention is to be ranked near the bottom. We presented a cumulative SUCRA graph for each outcome, which indicates the cumulative probability of being the best treatment, the second-best, etc. until the worst treatment for the specific outcome. Interventions with high probabilities for low-ranking values are likely to be better than interventions starting at low probabilities for low ranks. The ranking goes from best to worst for all outcomes, meaning for positive or good outcomes such as bleeding reduction and satisfaction, a higher rank indicates a higher bleeding reduction or a bigger proportion satisfied with treatment. On the other hand, for negative or bad outcomes, such as adverse events, treatment failure or requirement of furthersurgery, a higher rank indicates a lower incidence of adverse events, treatment failure and requirement of further surgery. Where NMA was not conducted (network not connected or inappropriate to pool), we presented the results from pairwise comparisons. For pairwise comparisons we used risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and MDs for continuous outcomes, with their respective 95% CIs. We used the individual studies used in the reviews. We checked for any duplication, and if more than two studies compared the same treatments, we calculated a random-eects summary in a pairwise meta-analysis. We used RevMan for pairwise meta-analyses and Stata for NMA (Review Manager 2020 ; White 2015 ). Subgroup analysis We conducted a subgroup analysis based on whether the participants were surgical candidates or not. We considered that 'the desire (or intention) of future pregnancy' , 'women or 'medical treatment failure' as inclusion or exclusion criteria to determine if the participants were surgical candidates. According to that judgement, we performed the NMA for first- or second-line treatment. The progestogen-releasing intrauterine system (LNG- IUS) was part of both groups. A second subgroup analysis was conducted comparing the dierent endometrial ablation and resection techniques by type of procedure. Methodology note Methodologies for both overviews and NMAs have been developed since the publication of the protocol in 2018. It may be appropriate for the update to consider evolving the overview to a review of interventions, which would facilitate the process, by allowing a single search with all the NMA details, instead of updating each review. R E S U L T S Description of included reviews In July 2021 we identified 20 Cochrane Reviews on heavy menstrual bleeding. We included nine reviews in this overview: Beaumont 2007 ; Bofill Rodriguez 2019a ; Bofill Rodriguez 2019b ; Bofill Rodriguez ; Bofill Rodriguez 2021 ; Bryant-Smith 2018 ; Lethaby 2019 and Marjoribanks 2016 . The last search was performed a:\u00b5\"ter January 2016 in all but Beaumont 2007 , a review of danazol that has been stable since 2007. See Figure 1 for details of the selection process.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Table 3 presents details of included review characteristics (review title and author, when it was updated, number of studies and participants, type of interventions, inclusion and exclusion criteria and outcomes). The nine reviews included a total of 138 studies. We identified 26 studies that were part of two reviews and 4 studies that were part of three. A:\u00b5\"ter removing the duplicate data, we were le:\u00b5\"t with a final total of 104 unique studies with 11,881 participants. Nineteen studies with 1931 participants did not contribute data for the following reasons. Three because one of the treatment arms was not randomised (it was chosen from several options either by the doctor or the women) ( (N) Cooper 1997 ; (N) Gupta 2013 ; (N) Kupperman 2004 ). One because the comparison was the same type of intervention (dierent dosages of danazol) ( (N) Chimbira 1980 ). Eight because the data reported did not allow comparisons included in this overview ( (N) Andersch 1988 ; (N) Hall 1987 ; (N) Khajehei 2013 ; (N) Lamb 1987 ; (N) Najam 2010 ; (N) Onoglu 2007 ; (N) Reid 2005 ; (N) Shravage 2011 ). One compared TCRE to rollerball ( (N) Boujida 2002 ). Three because the second intervention was not specified in the included interventions of this overview ( (N) Fathima 2012 ; (N) Goshtasebi 2015 ; (N) Thabet 2010 ); therefore they do not contribute with indirect evidence. Three because the participants had other characteristics; in one, all women had a valve replacement and were receiving anticoagulants ( (N) Kilic 2009 ); in another two, there were dierent causes of HMB ( (N) Cameron 1987 ; (N) Makarainen 1986 ).

(Continued) Our search for trials assessing the use of progestin-only contraceptives for HMB did not identify any available or ongoing clinical trials. We excluded 11 HMB reviews. Ten had ineligible participants: in seven reviews women had HMB due to fibroids ( Gupta 2014 ; Liu 2013 ; Murji 2017 ; Ping Liu 2013 ; Sangkomkamhang 2013 ; Song 2013 ; Tristan 2012 ), one related to anovulation ( Hickey 2012 ), one to bleeding disorders ( Ray 2016 ), and one to intrauterine devices ( Grimes 2006 ). The last excluded review had an ineligible intervention - the use of preoperative endometrial thinning agents for women with HMB undergoing surgery ( Tan 2013 ). Methodological quality of included reviews We used the AMSTAR 2 tool to rate the quality of the included reviews ( Shea 2017 ). See Table 4 for details. A summary of the assessment is as follows. 1. All reviews included the components of participant, intervention, comparison and outcomes (PICO) in the research question and inclusion criteria. 2. All but Beaumont 2007 contained an explicit statement that the review methods were established prior to the conduct of the review, and the report justified if there was any significant deviations from the protocol. 3. All reviews included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The authors based their methods on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ). 4. In all but Beaumont 2007 , authors reported using a comprehensive literature search strategy and included authors with subject-specific expertise. 5. Review authors reported performing study selection in duplicate in all reviews except Beaumont 2007 . 6. Authors of all of the reviews reported performing data extraction in duplicate. 7. Authors of all of the reviews provided a list of excluded studies and justified the exclusions. 8. Authors of all of the reviews described the included studies in adequate detail. 9. Authors of all of the reviews used a satisfactory technique for assessing the risk of bias in individual studies that were included in the reviews. In Beaumont 2007 only allocation concealment was assessed, according to the Cochrane Handbook at that time. 10.Authors of all of the reviews reported on the sources of funding for the studies included in the reviews.11.All of the reviews intended to perform a meta-analysis if suitable data were available. The review authors used appropriate statistical methods and based their methods on the Cochrane Handbook . 12.All but two of the reviews performed sensitivity analysis (Beaumont 2007 ; Bofill Rodriguez 2019b ). 13.All but Beaumont 2007 described methods to take the risk of bias into account when interpreting and discussing the results of the review. 14.Authors of all of the reviews provided a satisfactory explanation for, and discussion of, any heterogeneity observed in the results of the review. 15.All the reviews except Beaumont 2007 intended to investigate publication bias using methods described in the Cochrane Handbook . 16.Authors of all of the reviews reported any potential sources of conflict of interest. We consider points 1 to 10 of the AMSTAR 2 to be the most important ones for this specific overview. By performing an NMA, we used data from individual trials and did not base the conclusions on the review's analysis. The risk of bias of studies providing data for the overview is summarised in Figure 2 . Eect of interventions First-line treatments There were placebo, non-steroidal drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics long-cycle oral progestogens, (LNG- IUS), danazol and ethamsylate. Primary outcomes 1. Menstrual blood loss reduction Mean blood loss (combined) Twenty-six studies reported mean blood loss (either mean blood loss at the end of treatment or mean change from baseline), comparing all 10 treatments including placebo. See Table 5 for the summary of findings for this outcome.

The best treatment for bleeding reduction was LNG-IUS (SUCRA 80%, mean rank 2.4, MD 105.71 mL/cycle, 95% CI 167.06 to 17.81; very low certainty evidence). Third, (SUCRA mean 3.7, MD 80.32 mL/cycle, 32.98; moderate certainty MD 81.53 mL/cycle, 95% CI 153.82 to 0.05; low certainty evidence).

Ethamsylate and placebo were the worst treatments (SUCRA 10%, mean rank 8.9, MD 10.20 mL/cycle, 95% CI 73.73 to 94.12; very low certainty evidence, for ethamsylate; placebo (SUCRA 10%, mean rank 8.9 reference comparator). Figure 6 summarises the risk of bias of individual trials contributing data to the NMA. Ninety-five per cent to 100% of the trials were either at low or unknown risk of selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment) and other bias (such as baseline characteristics). Half were at high risk of performance and detection bias (blinding), probably because blinding is diicult due to dierent routes and timing of administration (COC is usually one pill daily, antifibrinolytics is only during the days of bleeding, the intrauterine system is inserted only once, the vaginal ring lasts for three weeks, etc.); The outcome is likely to be influenced by the lack of blinding. Forty per cent were at high risk of attrition (incomplete outcome data), and 20% were at high risk of reporting bias (selective reporting).

The best HMB treatment in terms of perception of improvement was LNG-IUS (SUCRA 80%, mean rank 2.6, OR 20.73, 95% CI 1.60 to 267.83; very low certainty evidence). Second, danazol () (SUCRA 70%, mean rank 3.6, OR 20.73, 95% CI 1.60 to 267.84; very low certainty evidence).

Over 90% were at either low or unknown risk of selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment) and other bias (such as baseline characteristics). Over 70% were at high risk of performance and detection bias (blinding), so the outcome is likely to be influenced by the lack of blinding.

Satisfaction Three studies with six treatments reported satisfaction, although only two studies with four interventions (antifibrinolytics, COC, luteal progestogens and LNG-IUS) were in a connected network. See Table 8 for the summary of findings table for this outcome.The analysis was done on the connected subnetwork; see Figure 15 . As there is only a single study per comparison, we used a fixed-eect model.

All were at low or unknown risk of selection and reporting bias. Half were at high risk of attrition and other bias. All were at high risk of performance and detection bias, as blinding is very unlikely among these interventions, and knowing the intervention is likely to interfere with the satisfaction. Figure 18.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.32Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Secondary outcomes 1. Quality of life Data extracted were not suitable to combine in an NMA because they were reported as mean dierences (with an SD) measured on dierent scales, and this was not enough to calculate an SMD. It was therefore inappropriate to pool results. Using standardised means, there was extremely high inconsistency in the NMA. We present the results from pairwise comparisons. See Table 9 for the summary of findings table for this outcome. Antifibrinolytics versus long-cycle progestogen Bryant-Smith 2018 reported there may be little to no dierence in quality of life, measured with the SF-36 general health domain, when comparing antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid) with progestogen Antifibrinolytics versus short-cycle progestogen Bryant-Smith 2018 reported that the evidence is uncertain regarding any dierences in quality of life, measured by the proportion of women reporting an improvement, when comparing antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid) with low intrauterine-device (LNG-IUS) versus combined oral contraceptives (COC) Bofill Rodriguez 2020 reported there may be little to no dierence in quality of life, measured by the proportion of women reportinggood or excellent quality of life, when comparing LNG-IUS to combined oral contraceptives (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.00; I 2 = 0; 2 RCTs, 170 women; low certainty evidence). 2. Adverse events Adverse events for first-line treatments were reported mainly as individual side eects, and trials reported a wide variety, such as acne; anaemia; anxiety; arthralgia; back, changes; and weight gain and loss. The abundance of adverse eects makes it impossible to combine due to the risk of double counting. Two trials comparing COC to placebo reported over 15 specific adverse events ( (D) Fraser 2011 ; (D) Jensen 2011 ); although there was clear evidence of a dierence favouring placebo for any adverse event, the only specific adverse events with clear evidence of dierence was breast pain and metrorrhagia. Fourteen studies reported 'any events' LNG-IUS and danazol. See Table 10 for the summary of findings table for this outcome. The network was connected; Figure 19 presents the NMA diagram for any adverse event.

Please refer to the last paragraph of the medical interventions in Description of the interventions . The best HMB treatment in terms of adverse events was placebo (SUCRA 90%, mean rank 1.9, reference comparator). Second, antifibrinolytics (SUCRA 80%, mean rank 2.7, OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.63; low certainty evidence). Third, NSAIDs (SUCRA 70%, mean rank 2.8, OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.24 to 5.48; low certainty evidence). Fourth, LNG-IUS (SUCRA 40%, mean rank 4.9, OR 2.10, 5.38; very low certainty evidence). COC (SUCRA 40% mean rank 5.2, OR 2.21, 95% very low certainty to 7.17; very low certainty evidence). Worst, danazol (SUCRA 0, mean rank 7.8, OR 7.58, 95% CI 2 to 28.75; very low certainty evidence). Figure 22 summarises the risk of bias of individual trials contributing data to the NMA. Ninety per cent of trials were at either low or unknown risk of selection bias, 100% were at low or unknown risk of allocation concealment. Over 50% were at high risk of performance and detection bias due to lack of blinding, and over 80% were at low or unknown risk of selective reporting and other bias.

Risk of bias of studies included on the network for any adverse event for first-line treatments. Severe adverse events Severe adverse events were reported in only one trial comparing antifibrinolytics versus placebo ( Table 11 ). Bryant-Smith 2018 reported that there is probably little to no dierence in the presence of serious adverse events (thrombosis) in women receiving antifibrinolytics versus placebo (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.00 to 2.46, 2 RCTs, 468 women; moderate certainty evidence). 3. Requirement of additional medical treatment The intrauterine device system review reported on the outcome of requirement of additional medical treatment in combination with treatment failure ( Bofill Rodriguez 2020 ). Four studies reported failure related to a PBAC cuto. Two studies, comparing COC and LNG-IUS, defined treatment failure as requirement of further treatment. See Table 12 for the summary of findings table for this outcome. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine-device (LNG-IUS) versus combined oral contraceptives (COC) Bofill Rodriguez 2020 reported that evidence suggests that women using LNG-IUS are less likely to require further treatment due totreatment failure than women using COC (results from pairwise meta-analysis: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.79; I 2 = 0%; 2 RCTs, 208 women; low certainty evidence). Second-line treatments Primary outcomes 1. Menstrual blood loss reduction For this outcome, we grouped all hysterectomy routes into a single intervention (hysterectomy). Bleeding improvement Eleven studies reported the proportion of women with bleeding improvement (PBAC under 75 points or acceptable bleeding improvement) at one year follow-up, comparing four interventions: LNG-IUS, REA, NREA and hysterectomy.

The surface under the curve is a cumulative ranking line (SUCRA); the larger the SUCRA the higher its rank among all available treatments. The best treatment in terms of satisfaction was minimally invasive hysterectomy (SUCRA 100%, mean rank 1.3, OR 7.96, 95% CI 3.33 to 19.03; low certainty evidence). Second, open hysterectomy (SUCRA 90%, mean rank 1.8, OR 5.13, 95% CI 1.32 to 19.92; very low certainty evidence).

Risk of bias of studies included on the network for satisfaction for second-line treatments. Secondary outcomes 1. Quality of life There was substantial disagreement between the direct and indirect evidence comparing NREA to minimally invasive hysterectomy ( (D) Sesti 2011 ). This caused substantial inconsistency in the network (node-split model P < 0.001 and inconsistency model P < 0.001). In addition, inspection of the study estimates showed that the two studies comparing NREA and LNG-IUS provide substantially dierent estimates of this relative treatment eect ( (D) Talis 2006 ; (D) Tam 2006 ). We therefore decided not to formally combine these results in an NMA and do not present results. Instead, we present the results from pairwise comparisons. Seven trials reported quality of life up to two years using the SF-36 and one, the Menorrhagia Multiatribute Scale (MMAS). The MMAS was reported dichotomously as the proportion with MMAS = 1, which is the best possible result. See Table 17 for the summary of findings for this outcome. Data showed that there may be little to no dierence on the following comparisons using the SF-36. EA (unspecified) versus hysterectomy (unspecified route): MD 1.90 points, 95% CI 8.67 to 4.87; 1 study, 204 women; low certainty evidence). NREA versus LNG-IUS: MD 2.9 points, 95% CI 3.10 to 9.02; I 2 =81%; 2 studies, 98 women; low certainty evidence). The comparison reported evidence of dierence using the SF-36. Evidence favours minimally invasive hysterectomy compared NREA (MD 10.90 points, 95% CI 15.81 to 5.99; 1 study, 68 women; low certainty evidence). The comparisons reported dierence using the MMAS.Women having minimally invasive hysterectomy are probably more likely to have a better quality of life measured with MMAS compared to the NREA (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.95; 1 study, 616 participants; moderate certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the following comparisons. REA versus minimally invasive hysterectomy (MD 9.90 points, 95% CI 19.89 to 0.09; 1 study, 67 women; very low certainty evidence). REA versus open hysterectomy (MD 5.30 points, 95% CI 11.90 to 1.30; 1 study, 155 women; very low certainty evidence). Minimally invasive hysterectomy versus LNG-IUS (MD 1.50 points, 95% CI 4.28 to 1.28; 1 study, 72 women; very low certainty evidence) LNG-IUS versus hysterectomy (unspecified, or at surgeon's discretion) (MD 2.20 points, 95% CI 2.93 to 7.33; 1 study, 221 women; very low certainty evidence). 2. Adverse events Trials mostly reported individual adverse events, and we were unable to group them due to the risk of double counting. Twelve studies comparing six treatments (LNG-IUS, REA, NREA, minimally invasive adverse event' . The severity of the outcome varied among studies, which reported infection, bladder injury, haematoma, uterine perforation, blood transfusion, pelvic pain, vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, breast tenderness, headache, acne, mood changes, genital ulceration, decreased libido, hair loss, acne, anxiety-depression, hypertension and leg pain.

All trials were at either low or unknown risk of selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment), attrition, reporting and other bias, but they were all at high risk of performance and detection bias (blinding), as blinding is feasible only between dierent endometrial ablation and resection procedures, less likely with LNG-IUS compared to EAs procedures, and impossible with hysterectomies. The outcome is likely to be influenced by the lack of blinding.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews We used the random-eects model, as a Tau value of 0.88 suggests moderate/large heterogeneity in the log-odds ratio scale, and there was evidence of inconsistency using the node-split model for comparisons (microwave NREA versus bipolar NREA and bipolar NREA versus balloon NREA).

D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results This overview iincluded nine Cochrane Reviews (covering 104 studies) of interventions to treat heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in women of reproductive age. Eighty-five of these studies (9950 participants) provided direct evidence for the overview network meta-analysis (NMA). The overview shows that first-line treatments for HMB vary widely in eicacy, safety and satisfaction, while the dierences are less pronounced for second-line treatments. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for specific interventions as being from moderate to very low, with most being low to very low certainty. First-line treatments For women with HMB, evidence suggests LNG-IUS is the best intervention to reduce menstrual blood loss. Antifibrinolytics are probably second-best. Evidence suggests that long-cycle progestogens reduce menstrual blood loss, and NSAIDs slightly reduce HMB; we are uncertain of the true eect of the remaining interventions, such as combined oral contraceptives (COC), combined vaginal ring (CVR), cyclical luteal progestogens and ethamsylate, as the evidence was very low certainty; see Table 5 . The sensitivity analysis for mean blood loss (without combining data, see Table 6 ), the perception of bleeding improvement ( Table 7), and satisfaction ( Table 8 ) provided very low certainty evidence; thus, we are uncertain of the true eect of the interventions for these outcomes. The evidence suggests that there is little to no dierence in quality of life improvement when comparing tranexamic acid versus long-cycle progestogens, or comparing LNG-IUS versus COC. We are uncertain of the true eect on quality of life when comparing antifibrinolytics versus short-cycle progestogens (very low certainty evidence; Table 9 ). The evidence suggests that the use of antifibrinolytics, NSAIDs, LNG-IUS or placebo results in little to no dierence on the rate of any adverse events, and also that COC increases the rate of any side eect. We are uncertain of the true eect of theremaining interventions (CVR, luteal and long-cycle progestogens and ethamsylate), as the evidence is very low certainty ( Table 10 ). There may be little to no dierence in serious adverse events between antifibrinolytics and placebo ( Table 11 ). The evidence suggests that women using an LNG-IUS are less likely to require further treatment for HMB compared to women receiving COC ( Table 12 ). Second-line treatments Evidence suggests that hysterectomy of any type is the best intervention to reduce menstrual blood loss (with and without imputed data). NREA probably reduces menstrual blood loss and is the second best (with and without imputed data). Evidence suggests that REA reduces menstrual blood loss without imputed data, but we are uncertain of the true eect with imputed data (very low certainty evidence; Table 13Table 14 ). Evidence on amenorrhoea was of very low certainty, mainly because of very serious risk of bias of the direct evidence and serious or very serious imprecision; thus, we are uncertain of the true eect of the interventions on this outcome ( Table 15 ). Evidence suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy (laparoscopic or vaginal) results in a large increase in the proportion of women satisfied with treatment, and NREA results in an increase in the proportion of women satisfied with treatment. We are uncertain of the true eect of the remaining interventions (very low certainty evidence; Table 16 ). Women with minimally invasive hysterectomy probably have a better quality of life at up to two years follow-up compared to women receiving NREA. There may be little to no dierence in the general health for the following pairwise comparisons: unspecified endometrial ablation (EA) versus surgeon's discretion), and NREA versus LNG-IUS. The evidence is very uncertain about the eect on quality of life of the following comparisons: REA versus minimally invasive hysterectomy or open hysterectomy, and LNG-IUS versus minimally invasive hysterectomy or open hysterectomy (very low certainty evidence; Table 17 ).

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.81Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Evidence on any adverse event was very low certainty, so we are uncertain of the true eect of the interventions on this outcome. This uncertainty may be related to the wide variety of adverse events being reported ( Table 18 ). Hysterectomy (all routes) and NREA probably reduce the rate of the requirement of further surgery for HMB. We are uncertain of the true eect of REA and unspecified EA (very low certainty evidence; Table 19). EA subgroup analysis For women with HMB treated with EA, evidence suggests that microwave NREA is the best option for reducing menstrual blood loss, and bipolar NREA is probably the best option for achieving amenorrhoea. We are uncertain of the true eect of the remaining interventions on these outcomes, as the evidence was very low certainty ( Table 20 ; Table 21 ). For the outcome of satisfaction, evidence suggests bipolar NREA has the best satisfaction rate; other REA, microwave NREA, balloon NREA, and other NREA may not be dierent compared to TCRE/ rollerball, and we are uncertain of the true eect of hydrothermal NREA, as the evidence was very low certainty ( Table 22 ). For the adverse event of perforation, bipolar NREA probably shows little to no dierence in the perforation rate compared to TCRE/ rollerball. Evidence suggests that REA and balloon NREA are little to no dierent than TCRE/rollerball in the perforation rate. We are uncertain of the true eect of hydrothermal ablation NREA and microwave NREA (very low certainty evidence; Table 23 ). Evidence suggests bipolar NREA lowers the rate of requirement of further surgery for HMB. Balloon NREA probably lowers the rate of requirement of further surgery. Evidence suggests that other REA, microwave NREA and hydrothermal NREA produce little to no dierence in the rate of requirement of further surgery compared to TCRE. We are uncertain of the true eect of other REA ( Table 24 ). Evidence suggests little to no dierence in the requirement of further hysterectomy for treating HMB between bipolar NREA, other REA, balloon NREA and TCRE/rollerball; and probably little to no dierence between microwave NREA and TCRE/rollerball. We are uncertain of the true eect of hydrothermal NREA (very low certainty evidence; Table 25 ). Overall completeness and applicability of evidence We updated all the reviews whose last search was over 18 months old when we started the overview. We summarised all the data available in the Cochrane Reviews, extracting data by studies. We consider it to be complete, although we acknowledge that our searches may have missed relevant studies, and the evidence had limitations. This overview provides three sets of network meta-analyses reporting on the relative eectiveness of first and second-line HMB treatments, plus a subgroup analysis by type of endometrial ablation technique, in a coherent and methodologically robust way across clinical outcomes, combining direct and indirect evidence to increase the statistical power and confidence in the results. Most of the trials included in the reviews reported the bleeding outcome, but they did so in a wide variety of ways, limiting our ability to combine them. The network meta-analysis results were mostlyconsistent, and where there was significant inconsistency, this was likely to be due to unstable estimates from single studies. We excluded trials where participants' baseline characteristics did not match with the overview, that is, studies that included women with HMB due to an intrauterine device, ovulation disorders, or in treatment with anticoagulant drugs. All trials were carried out in clinical settings. Most trials compared first-line treatments to placebo, enabling us to set placebo as the reference treatment in the networks. Trials did not compare second-line treatments to placebo or no treatment. We decided to use LNG-IUS as the reference treatment for second- line treatments and TCRE/rollerball as the reference treatment for the subgroup analysis of endometrial ablation techniques. Unfortunately, we were unable to draw conclusions regarding quality of life, as network meta-analysis was not possible. Another limitation was that we did not have enough studies to use a funnel plot to explore the possibility of small-study eects (a tendency for estimates of the intervention eect to be more beneficial in smaller studies). We consider the information provided by this overview to be valuable for women with HMB, healthcare providers, and policymakers. Methodologies for both overviews and NMAs have been developed since the publication of the protocol in 2018. It may be appropriate for the update to consider evolving the overview to a review of interventions, which would facilitate the process by allowing a single search with all the NMA details, instead of updating each review. Quality of the evidence We recognise that there is no single established approach for assessing the certainty of the eect estimates generated by the network meta-analysis. We applied the GRADE Working Group method for appraising quality of network evidence. Overall, the evidence presented was low, and our confidence in the eect estimates ranged from very low to low. In general, due to the lack of blinding in most of the trials, and some indirectness arising from small studies, most of the comparisons started at moderate certainty. Either because of wide intervals or inconsistency on the network, or both, we then downgraded them to low or very low certainty. Potential biases in the overview process Two overview authors (AL and CF) were involved in one study contributing data to the overview ( (D) Talis 2006 ). They did not participate in data extraction or quality assessment for their study. Several authors have been involved on the reviews providing data for the overview, but they did not participate in the assessment of the quality of the reviews. One review contributing studies to the overview was declared stable in 2007, when the only risk of bias assessed was allocation concealment. The earliest trial included was from 1970, and since then the standard of care and even the HMB diagnosis has changed.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.82Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews In the first-line treatments network, the LNG-IUS appears to be the best for the outcome of bleeding reduction compared to the remaining interventions. This finding is consistent with the evidence summary reported by NICE 2018b which describes the LNG-IUS as eective or more eective than other treatments for HMB in terms of improving health-related quality of life, treatment satisfaction, discontinuation rates and blood loss. In addition, it is widely used in clinical practice and routinely available within primary care, and it should be the first option for treating HMB in women with no identified pathology. NICE 2018b did not report on adverse events, but instead on discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events, with NSAIDs and tranexamic acid ranking first (1 to 3) and second (1 to 5), and COC ranking 7 (6 to 7, in a ranking from 1 to 7); danazol was not included in the study. This dierence maybe due to the first-line treatments network of this overview using any adverse event as an outcome, which may not reflect the presence of serious adverse events. With respect to second-line treatments for blood loss, NICE 2018b agreed that for women who do not wish to have pharmacological treatment and who do not want to conserve their fertility, surgical options could be considered as a first-line treatment option, which is similar to the second-line treatment results reporting hysterectomy as the best treatment for menstrual blood reduction and avoiding further surgery. The NICE report used a dierent division of the endometrial ablation procedures, which made it diicult to compare. In terms of blood loss, they reported that NREA was more eective and had higher satisfaction than REA techniques. The second-line treatment network of this overview reported hysterectomy and NREA as being the two best options for menstrual blood reduction, yielding higher rates of satisfaction and avoiding future surgery for HMB. Daniels 2012 published a network meta-analysis of EA techniques, including bipolar NREA, NREA, laser NREA, cryoablation NREA and REA. The authors assessed bleeding reduction and satisfaction, reporting that bipolar and microwave ablation devices are more eective than thermal balloon and free fluid ablation for treating HMB with NREA devices, which is consistent with the numerical finding of the subgroup analysis for endometrial ablation techniques. A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice This overview provides up-to-date evidence on HMB treatments. HMB is a condition that aects a significant proportion of women of reproductive age. There is moderate to very low certainty evidence that treatments for HMB are eective and improve satisfaction. It is important to highlight that the best treatment may not be the same for all women. Clinicians should assess the patient characteristics before applying the result of this NMA, starting with the first-line treatments network, and then, in case of treatment failure or in women who have completed their families, moving to the second- line treatments network.In women who are not candidates for surgery, LNG-IUS is the most eective first-line treatment to reduce menstrual blood loss. LNG- IUS is probably little to no dierent than placebo in the rate of adverse events, and the requirement for further treatment may be less likely than in women receiving COC. Antifibrinolytics are probably better than placebo at reducing blood loss, with little to no dierence in the rate of adverse events. Long-cycle progestogens may be better than placebo at reducing blood loss. Unfortunately, we are unable to draw conclusions about perceived improvement and satisfaction due to very low certainty evidence. In women who are candidates for surgery, hysterectomy is the most eective second-line treatment for reducing menstrual blood loss and avoiding further surgery for HMB. Minimally invasive hysterectomy may be better than the LNG-IUS for achieving satisfaction. REA and NREA may be better than LNG-IUS at reducing blood loss. NREA may have higher satisfaction rates than LNG-IUS and may have lower rates of further surgery for HMB. Unfortunately, we were unable to pool the wide variety of adverse events reported, and most were specific to one technique. For endometrial ablation or resection, the certainty of the evidence for bleeding outcomes was mostly very low. Evidence suggests microwave NREA is better than TCRE for reducing blood loss, but it may not be very dierent in the satisfaction rate or the rate of further surgery. Evidence suggests that other REA produces a higher amenorrhoea rate than TCRE/rollerball, with little to no dierence in the rate of satisfaction, perforation rate and requirement for further surgery than TCRE, with or without rollerball. Evidence suggests that bipolar NREA is better than TCRE/rollerball at achieving satisfaction, with little to no dierence in perforation rate and a lower requirement of further surgery. Evidence suggests that balloon NREA produces little to no dierence in the satisfaction and perforation rate compared to TCRE/rollerball. Balloon NREA probably has a lower requirement of further surgery than TCRE/ rollerball. Evidence suggests that other NREA produces similar satisfaction and perforation rates compared to TCRE, with or without rollerball. Other factors such as the ability to use local (as opposed to general anaesthesia), surgical time, and other adverse events (not considered in this network meta-analysis) may influence the decision by clinician and woman regarding their choice of endometrial ablation options for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. Implications for research LNG-IUS is the most eective first-line treatment to reduce menstrual blood loss in women requiring contraception, but there is no clear ranking for the remaining options. There is an overlap between contraception and heavy menstrual bleeding treatment, as hormonal contraceptives reduce menstrual blood loss, and in some cases cause amenorrhoea; progestin-only contraceptives (pill, injections and implants) have been used o- label as HMB treatment. Future research should assess the eicacy and safety of progestogen-only contraceptives and compare dierent preparations of combined hormonal contraceptives for HMB treatment. Quality of life should be the primary outcome for future research, as the current HMB definition is based on quality of life. We had diiculties trying to combine data from dierent studies, as quality of life was reported in a wide range of ways.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.83Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews highlights the importance of developing a core outcome set for heavy menstrual bleeding trials that would facilitate more eective analysis, avoid (or restrict) the use of imputed data, and reduce data waste. The COMET initiative (Core Outcome Measures in Eectiveness Trial) has an ongoing project, 'Defining core outcomes for clinical trials of heavy menstrual bleeding. A Core Outcome sets for Gynaecological conditions (COGS) project' that aims to develop a core outcome set covering all the aspects of heavy menstrual bleeding ( COMET 2018 ). A core outcomes set should also improve the ability to combine quality of life data. There should be specified safety outcomes, encouraging reporting of any adverse event, as it makes it simpler to compare, avoids the risk of double counting and allows fair comparisons. Comparing adverse events between interventions if they are specific to the intervention (as perforation for endometrialablation and wound infection for hysterectomy) could lead to false conclusions. Future research should assess interventions that have been used o-label to treat HMB, such as progestin-only contraceptives, and focus on quality of life improvement.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews H I S T O R Y Protocol first published: Issue 11, 2018 C O N T R I B U T I O N S O F A U T H O R S All the authors contributed either to the study design or the original protocol. Two overview authors searched for reviews (JB and MBR), extracted data from the studies on the review (MBR and VJ) and analysed the data (SD and MBR). Three overview authors performed the AMSTAR (two per review, to ensure review's authors were not involved on the quality assessment of their own reviews) (SL, MW, MBR). MBR wrote all the versions of the overview and the graphs. All review authors critically reviewed the manuscript and approved the final version. D E C L A R A T I O N S O F I N T E R E S T Magdalena Bofill Rodriguez, Julie Brown, Michelle Wise, Cindy Farquhar, Vanessa Jordan and Anne Lethaby have been involved as authors or co-authors of Cochrane Reviews that may be included in this overview of reviews. Magdalena Bofill, Michelle Wise and Vanessa Jordan became involved updating the already selected reviews. Julie Brown has been employed as a medical writer; we are satisfied that her employer had no financial interest in any intervention of interest to this overview. Sofia Dias, Sarah Lensen and Jack Wilkinson have no conflict of interest. Cindy Farquhar, Vanessa Jordan and Anne Lethaby are editors of Cochrane Gynecology and Fertility. They took no part in the editorial process.

In the overview we intended to perform network meta-analysis for all three secondary outcomes to add completeness. We planned to present subgroup analyses for medical and surgical interventions. As the LNG-IUS was compared to medical and surgical interventions, using dierent participant characteristics, we decided to subgroup into first- and second-line treatments according to those characteristics. We added a provision to impute data where missing for primary outcomes and conduct a sensitivity analysis with and without the imputed data. In the protocol we stated we were going to conduct Bayesian network meta-analysis, but we used Stata, as recommended by one of the statistician authors (SD), because a more user-friendly so:\u00b5\"tware programme became available between publishing the protocol and performing the overview. We changed the original title of the overview to highlight the network meta-analysis, adding 'Overview of Cochrane Reviews and network meta-analysis' .
