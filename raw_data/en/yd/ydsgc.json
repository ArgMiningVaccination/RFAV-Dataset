The main Vision and Mission of the Institute is Health, Harmony and Happiness for all through Yoga. Presently, the institute has taken up the task of reviving its bi-annual :ournal Yoga Vijnana the Science and Art of Yoga. This peer-reviewed journal focusses to be a platform for preserving and disseminating the ancient knowledge system of Yoga which is both an art and a science as is becoming more and more evident, due to various scientific experiments being conducted all over the world. This :ournal proposes to showcase to the world the strong theoretical foundations of Yoga in being an astute path to achieve self-realization, as well as being a comprehensive application-oriented knowledge system that ensures physical and mental wellness. The word Yoga in Sanskrit refers to union, i.e. union of tman (Self, i.e. the person) with Brahman. Mention of Yoga occurs in the Upaniads, Puras, Bhagavad Gt and several other ancient sources. Yoga Stra defines the term Yoga as the process of making the mind tranquil and stationary, and also goes on to explain the real purpose of Yoga as reaching Brahman (Supreme Truth), i.e. attainment of moka. Yoga is an ancient Indian science and art catering to the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of an individual and by consequence, society at large. Reports suggest that there are more than 00 million Yoga practitioners in the world, which is a testimony to its popularity. Yoga has become extremely popular across the world not only due to the teachings and efforts of several personalities across the ages but also due to the fact that several studies have been conducted to justify the benefits of Yoga. Based on the benefits it offers, it is treated as an alternative therapy in modern times. The current :ournal Yoga Vijnana - proposes to highlight all of the above issues in a versatile manner and has articles by several versatile traditional Yoga experts and scientists. The first article titled ' F O U N DATIO N S, C O N C E PTS AN D PR AC TIC E S O F YO G A F O R H E AL TH AN D W E L L -BE IN G ' by D r. Ishw ar V . B asavaraddi explains the foundational concepts of Yoga as a comprehensive system for wellness. The second article Practice of Eaattvhsa in he Yogasras Anasis Base on seec classical com m entaries\" by D r. M .

Alvar clearly delineates how the Ashtanga Yoga is mentioned in the Yoga Upanishads along with authentic references. The fourth article SvhnaSavanam a 2h cenur Sansri or on Yoga by D r. K . S. K annan is a well-written review of a versatile treatise authored in the last century in Sanskrit.Editorial x iiThe fih article Yoga in he Puras by V inay Iyer gives a comprehensive account of the Yoga system in the Puranas. The sixth article titled A Critica Revie of Insrumenation on Nai by D r. T V Ananthapadmanab ha shows how the process of Naadi-Vijnana mentioned in the Yoga Shastra can be scientifically validated. The seventh article Prahra A Neuroscientic Perspective of Yoga Shasra by M ohan R aghavan & M . K . R aghavendra, is also another article that analyses the scientific background of a very unique practise associated with the spiritual aspect of Yoga Shastra. The eighth and final article AH AAR A VIG N AN A and YO G A by D r. V . P rak ash, though relatively short in size, clearly summarizes the close relationship between food science and the practise of Y oga. The :ournal is well guided by an Advisory Board and Editorial Board having many stalwart scholars and scientists who have great regard and passion for the subject and are sincerely contributing for the cause of making this :ournal a publication of a very high order. I, therefore, profusely thank all the members of the Advisory Board and Editorial Board for their guidance.

INTRODUCTION Yoga is essentially a spiritual discipline based on an extremely subtle science, which focuses on bringing harmony between mind and body thought and action restraint and fulfilment man and nature a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is an art and science of healthy living. The word ' Yoga' is derived from the Sanskrit root Yuj, meaning to join or to yoke or to unite. 1 As per Yogic scriptures the practice of Yoga leads to the union of individual consciousness with that of the Universal Consciousness, indicating a perfect harmony between the mind and body, Man Nature. According to modern scientists, everything in the universe is just a manifestation of the same quantum firmament. One who experiences this oneness of existence is said to be in yoga, and is termed as a yog, having attained to a state of freedom referred to as mukti, nirva or moka. Thus the aim of Yoga is Self-realization, to overcome all kinds of sufferings leading to the state of liberation (Moka) or freedom (<aivalya). >iving with freedom in all walks of life, health and harmony shall be the main objectives of Yoga practice. Yoga also refers to an inner science comprising of a variety of methods through which human beings can realise this union and achieve mastery over their destiny. Yoga has proven itself in catering to both material and spiritual upliment of humanity. Basic humane values are the very identity of Yoga Sdhan. 2. BRIEF HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF YOGA The science of Yoga has its origin thousands of years ago, long before the first religion or belief systems were born. The seers and sages carried this powerful Yogic science to different parts of the world including Asia, the Middle East, northern Africa and South America. Interestingly, modern scholars have noted and marvelled at the close parallels found between ancient cultures across the globe. However, it was in India that the Yogic system found its fullest expression. ABSTRACT Yoga is the spiritual discipline based on an extremely subtle science, focussing on harmony between mind and body.

Basavaraddi: Foundations, Concepts and Practices of Yoga for Health and Well-Being 2 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020Yoga is widely considered as an immortal cultural outcome of the Indus Sarasva Valley Civilisation - dating back to 00 BC. A number of seals and fossil remains of Indus Sarasva Valley Civilisation with Yogic motifs and figures performing Yoga sdhan suggest the presence of Yoga in ancient India. The seals and idols of mother Goddess are suggestive of Tantra Yoga. The presence of Yoga is also available in folk traditions, Vedic and Upaniadic heritage, Buddhist and :ain traditions, Daranas, epics such as Mahbhrata (including the Bhagavad-gt, which is a section within it) and Rmyaa, theistic traditions of _aivas, Vaiavas and the Tantric traditions. Though Yoga was being practiced in the pre-Vedic period, the great sage Mahari Patajali systematised and codified the then existing Yogic practices, its meaning and its related knowledge through Patajalis Yoga Stras. Aer Mahari Patajali, many sages, scholars and Yoga masters contributed greatly towards the preservation and development of the field through well-documented practices and literature. Yoga has spread all over the world through the teachings of eminent Yoga masters from ancient times to the present date. Today, everybody has conviction in Yoga practices, with regard to prevention management of diseases, and promotion of health. Millions of people across the globe have benefited from the practice of Yoga and the practice of Yoga is blossoming and growing more vibrant with each passing day. 2.1 Salient Features of Y oga: . Yoga is Essentially Spiritual . It is a Darana (Philosophy). It is a Science . It is an Art of Healthy >iving. It brings Harmony 6. Yogic practices are Mind-centric 3. THE FUNDAMENTALS OF YOGA Yoga works on the level of ones body, mind, emotion, intelligence and energy. This has given rise to following broad classifications of Yoga: :nna Yoga, where we utilise the intelligence (Buddhi) Bhakti Yoga, where we utilise the emotions (Bhva) <arma Yoga, where we utilise the body (_arra) Dhyna Yoga, where we utilise the mind (Manas) and <riy Yoga, where we utilise the energy (Pra). Each system of Yoga that we practice falls within the gamut of one or more of these categories.Every individual is a unique combination of these five factors. Only a guru (teacher) can prescribe the appropriate combination of these five fundamental paths, as would be necessary for each seeker. All ancient texts and commentaries on Yoga have stressed that it is essential to work under the direction of a guru. 2 4. TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS / KINDS OF YOGA The different philosophies, traditions, lineages and guru-iya parampars of Yoga led to the emergence of different traditional schools. These include :nna Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, <arma Yoga, Ptajala Yoga, Dhyna Yoga, <ualin Yoga, Haha Yoga, Mantra Yoga, >aya Yoga, Rja Yoga, :aina Yoga, Bauddha Yoga, etc. Each school has its own approach and practices that lead to the ultimate aim and objectives of Yoga. 5. YOGIC PRACTICES FOR HEAL TH AND WELL/hyphen.capBEING The as are restraints and N iyam as are observances. 3 These are considered to be pre-requisites for further Yoga practice. 4 sanas, which are capable of bringing about stability and comfort to the body and mind, 5 kuryttadsana sthairyam, 6 involve, adopting various psycho-physical body patterns and giving oneself an ability to maintain a body position (a stable awareness of ones own structural existence) for a considerable length of time. Pryma consists of developing awareness of ones breathing followed by wilful regulation of respiration as the functional or vital basis of ones existence. It helps in developing awareness of ones mind and helps to establish control over the mind. In the initial stages, this is done by developing awareness of the flow of inhalation and exhalation (vsa and pravsa) through nostrils, mouth and other body openings, its internal and external pathways and destinations. >ater, this phenomenon is modified, through regulated, controlled and monitored inhalation (vsa) leading to the awareness of the body space geng filled (praka), the space(s) remaining in a filled state (kumbhaka), and it geng emptied (rechaka) during regulated, controlled and monitored exhalation (pravsa). 8Dr. Ishwar V. Basavaraddi: Foundations, Concepts and Practices of Yoga for Health and Well-Being 3 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020Banhas an Murs are practices associated with Prnyma. They are viewed as the higher Yogic practices that mainly adopt certain physical gestures along with control over respiration. This further facilitates control over mind and paves the way for a higher Yogic attainment. Prahra indicates dissociation of ones consciousness (withdrawal) from the sense organs which connect with the external objects. 9 Dhrana concenration indicates broad based field of attention (inside the body and mind) which is usually understood as concentration. 0 Dhna (meditation) is contemplation (focussed attention inside the body and mind) 1 1 and Samhi (integration). 1 2 aarmas are detoxification procedures that are clinical in nature and help to remove the toxins accumulated in the body. Yuhra (right food) advocates appropriate food and food habits for healthy living. 1 3 A few dietary guidelines can ensure that the body and mind are flexible and well-prepared for practice. A vegetarian diet is usually recommended, and for a person over 0 years, two meals a day should suce, except in cases of illness or very high physical activity or labour. However practice of Dhyna (Meditation) helping in self-realisation leading to transcendence is considered as the essence of Yoga Sdhan. However, a judicious combination of practice of sana, Pryma and Dhyna daily, keeps an individual healthy and disease-free. The knowledge aspect of Yoga Sdhan is being extensively researched today, an advantage to Yoga practitioners. Psychological, anatomical, physiological, bio-chemical and philosophical phenomena underlying Yoga Sdhan are comparatively better understood today. This is a matter of satisfaction for the entire humanity. So also, elaborate and effective means of its transmission, such as internet across the globe, is a great stride towards the propagation of Yogic knowledge. Teaching methodology in Yoga has also ingrained the methodological rigours of modern education into it. There is also a growth of teaching schools of Yoga across the globe. An earnest scientific and philosophical-literary research has also arisen globally and is yet another encouraging sign of continuing evolution of Yoga. Principles of Y oga Therapy and Methods: Y oga Therapy It is important to adopt a holistic lifestyle and follow a healthy regimen to live a healthy and peaceful life. The modern world is facing a pandemic of lifestyle disorders that require changes to be made consciously by the individuals themselves. Yoga places great importance on a proper and healthy lifestyle whose main components are: 1. Yoga emphasises need for a healthy, nour- ishing diet that has an adequate intake of fresh water along with a well-balanced intake of fresh food, green salads, sprouts, unrefined cereals and fresh fruits. It is important to be aware of the need for a Sattvic diet, prepared and served with love and affection. 2 . s Proper recreational activities to relax body and mind are essential for good health. This includes proper relaxation, maintaining quietude in the realms of action, speech and thoughts, and group activities wherein one loses the sense of individuality. <arma Yoga is an excellent method for losing the sense of individuality and gaining a sense of universality. 3 . Yoga stresses the importance of healthy activities such as exercise and recommends sana, Pryma and <riys on a regular basis. Cardio-respiratory health is one of the main by-products of such healthy activities. 4 . s Right thoughts and right atude towards life is vital for wellbeing. A balanced state of mind is obtained by following moral restraints and ethical observances (Yama Niyama). As Mahatma Gandhi said, there is enough in this world for everyones need but not enough for any one persons greed. The Y oga therapy is based on the following doc-trines and concepts:- Doctrine of Chitta-vttinirodha, <riyyoga and Aga as in Pataali's zoga Stras. Doctrine of Pacakoa (five sheathsbodies) as found in Upaniads. Doctrine of various kinds of _uddhi found in Pataali zoga Stra and Hahayoga. Doctrine of opening blocked channels of vyus and pra (nuddhi), opening of lotuses and cakras, pryma , mudrs as found in Hahayoga and <ualin zoga. torking with the mind on Stra, Mantra zoga and Hahayoga.Dr. Ishwar V.

Practices to purify the body: The aim of Hahayoga is to create a balance among activities and processes of body, mind and energy. This balance helps in the awakening of the central force, suumn n which is responsible for the evolution of human consciousness. Purification of the cakras and ns is the first step the assumption is that complete removal of impurities from whole body purifies the ns through six different ways which facilitates the flow of pra. These are purificatory processes usually classified into six divisions and therefore they are oen called akriys or akarma. These are: 1 4 1. activating and revitalising the organs . Toning up the functions of the organs. Desensitisation . Development of deep internal awareness Principles of Y oga in the Management of Kleas & Vr. ttis: Yoga is a path towards realisation of true nature of the Self and practitioners of Yoga in search of this spiritual goal have evolved this art and science from time immemorial. Yoga is a true nature of the Self. This is a continuous experiential path which transcends various states of consciousness to ultimately merge with the reality or the infinite pure consciousness featured by <aivalyam or eternal freedom. This state of <aivalyam can be attained only through chittav-nirodha i.e. the cessation of all the mental processes. Patajali advocates development of correct psychological atudes such as Maitr (friendliness towards those who are at peace with themselves), <aru (compassion for the suffering), Mudita (cheerfulness towards the virtuous) and Upekaa (indifference and avoidance of the evil) as first step 1 5 and then suggests the practice of Abhysa- Vairagya, 1 6 agayoga and kriyyoga 1 8 to achieve the state of Chittavnirodha. Abhysa is regular punctual practice with patience and perseverance and Vairgya connotes a virtual freedom from attachment and indulgence to all worldly things and all pleasure of life. The practice of Abhysa and Vairgya leads to viveka khyti (discriminating wisdom). <riy yoga has and purifying the senses (tapas), () self-study in the context of teachings (svdhyya), and () devotion and leng go into the creative source from which we emerged (vara praidhna). The practice of both Abhysa-vairgya and kriy yoga reduces the gross and subtle thought patterns (vs and kleas) such as thoughts information perceived through the interaction with sense organs, this reduces the kleas into an attenuated state, where the impulsiveness of the kleas are reduced, Patajali advocates the practice of graded course of meditation aga Yoga such as Yama, Niyama, sana, Pryma, Pratyhara, Dhra and Dhyna of Samdhi which burn the attenuated kleas with the light of praj (super sensuous knowledge) defined as tambhar tatra praj 1 9, which reveals the true nature of purua and its distinctness from buddhi known as viveka-khyti. Principles of Y oga therapy in the Management of Pa\u00f1cakoa:The application of Yoga as a therapy can be correlated with the Upaniadic model of the Paca <oa (the five aspects of our existence) 0 and hence various Yogic practices may be used as therapeutic interventions at different levels in this respect. At the Annamaa Koa (anatomical level of existence) Yogic Skma Vyyma (simple movements for all body parts), Mudrs (gestures for energy generation and conservation), <riys (structured movements), sanas (steady and comfortable postures) along with the dietary modifications are useful . At the Pramaa Koa (physiological level of existence) atkarma (six cleansing processes), various Prymas, development of breath awareness and working on breath-movement coordination with emphasis on balancing Pric energy is to be done . Work on re-energising and integrating the energies of the Paca Pra and Upa-Pra Vyus needs to be done at this level . At the Manomaa Koa (psychological level of existence) there are numerous practices such as Traka (concentrated gaze), Dhra (concentration), Dhyna (meditation), :apa and :apa-Ajapa practices that are useful . Various aspects of concentration such as the Cakra-dhraa and other Yoga Di techniques are also available in Yoga . A n Dr. Ishwar V. Basavaraddi: Foundations, Concepts and Practices of Yoga for Health and Well-Being 5 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020awareness of all aspects of the Antakaraa needs to be developed at this level . When trying to deal with the Vinamaa Koa (intellectual level of existence), Svdhyya (self-analysis), Satsaga (lectures and spiritually uplifting exchange) along with the wonderful :na Yoga and Rja Yoga relaxation and concentration practices of Yoga are useful . To understand and work with the nanamaa Koa (our universal level of existence), it is important to lose sense of the limited individuality . >earning to implement principles of <arma Yoga (Yoga as skilled action performed without expectation) and following the principle of action in relaxation helps us to achieve a sense of joy in all activities . A realisation that we live in a blissful universe and that all life is joy is to be brought about in this intervention through use of Bhakti Yoga, <arma Yoga and other aspects like Bhajana, Yogic counselling and Satsaga . Practice of :na Yoga The present age of science has made man a rational being. Intellectual sharpness is imminent. Analysis forms the tool. :na Yoga helps to discriminate between real and unreal nature, because avidy (wrong knowledge) is the root cause to perceive the worldly phenomena as real but in reality it is not. The path of philosophy (:na Yoga) is apt for the keen intellectuals and is centred on the analysis of reality and happiness, the vital contribution of Upaniads. Also many other fundamental questions regarding the mind, the outside and inside world are taken up. Basic questions are raised even involving the intellect itself to reach the very basis of intellect. Practice of Karma Yoga This path of working in relaxation, involves doing action with an atude of detachment to fruits of action. This makes man release himself from the strong attachments thereby brings in him a steadiness of mind, which verily is Yoga Samatva yoga ucyate. Instruments of action and understanding (<armendriyas and :nendriyas) get cleansed. 2 1 Practice of Bhati Yoga The control of emotions is the key in the path of worship that involves pure love to the divine and is characterised by total surrender. In the age of globalisation, man is tossed up and down due to emotional onslaughts. The path of Bhakti is a boon to gain control over emotional instabilities by properly harnessing the energy involved in it. Yoga is basically a preventive life-science and hence Yogic counselling is a vital component of Yoga Ciis when dealing with all lifestyle disorders. The counselling process is not a one off matter but is a continuous process that starts from the very first visit and continues with every session at different levels. Helping the patients understand their condition, finding the root cause of the problem and creating a healthy opportunity for them to change themselves, is the Dharma of the therapist. Dharma is defined as: doing the right thing for the right person at the right place and at the right time in the right manner. It may take many months before we start to witness benefits of these Yogic lifestyle changes and Yoga Cikits practices. Mechanism of action of Y oga: The following are just a few of the mechanisms through which Yoga works as an integrated mind-body medicine: . Cleanses the accumulated toxins through various uddhi kriy s and generates a sense of relaxed light- ness through skma vyyma (simple movements for all body parts). Free flow in all bodily passages prevents the many infections that may occur when pathogens stagnate therein. . Adoption of a Yogic lifestyle with proper nourish- ing diet, creates positive antioxidant enhancement thus neutralising free radicals while enabling a reju-venated storehouse of nutrients packed with life energy to work on anabolic, reparative and healing processes. . Steadies the entire body through different physical postures held in a steady and comfortable manner without strain. Physical balance and a sense of ease with oneself enhance mental emotional balance and enable all physiological processes to occur in a healthy manner. . Improves control over autonomic respiratory mech- anisms though breathing patterns that generate energy and enhance emotional stability. The mind and emotions are related to our breathing pattern and rate and hence the slowing down of the breathing process influences autonomic functioning, metabolic processes as well as emotional responses. . Integrates body movements with the breath creates psychosomatic harmony. In Yoga the physical body is related to annamaya koa (our anatomical existence) and the mind to manomaya koa (our psychological existence). As the pramaya koa (our physiological existence sustained by the energy of the breath) lies in between them, the breath is the key to psychoso-matic harmony.Dr. Ishwar V. Basavaraddi: Foundations, Concepts and Practices of Yoga for Health and Well-Being 6 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 20206. Focuses the mind positively on activities being done, enhances energy flow and results in healthy circula- tion to the different body parts and internal organs. Where the mind goes, there the pr a flows! . Creates a calm internal environment through contem- plative practices that in turn enable normalisation of homeostatic mechanisms. Yoga is all about balance or samatva at all levels of being. Mental balance pro-duces physical balance and vice versa too. . Relaxes the body-emotion-mind complex through physical and mental techniques that enhance our pain threshold and coping ability in responding to external and internal stressors. This enhances the quality of life as seen in so many terminal cases where other therapies are not able to offer any solace. . Enhances self-confidence and internal healing capac- ities by the cultivation of right atudes towards life and moral-ethical living through yama-niyama and various Yogic psychological principles. Faith, self-con-fidence and inner strength are most essential for healing, repair, rejuvenation and re-invigoration. 0. Yoga works towards restoration of normalcy in all systems of the human body with special emphasis on the psycho-neuro-immuno-endocrine axis. In addition to its preventive and restorative capabili-ties, Yoga also aims at promoting positive health that will help us to tide over health challenges that occur during our lifetime. This concept of positive health is one of Yogas unique contributions to modern health care as Yoga has both a preventive as well as pro-moter role in the health care of our masses. It is also inexpensive and can be used in tandem with other systems of medicine in an integrated manner to ben-efit patients. Yoga as a herap Ciis is being practiced now as an alternative health care practice in many parts of the world. The number of Yoga practitioners continues to rise tremendously. Of the many benefits ascribed to Yoga practice, blood pressure control is among the most studied. There are several reviews regarding the potential benefits of Yoga for reducing blood pressure and other cardiovascular disease risk factors but the degree to which yoga therapy may decrease blood pressure and its potential modifying effects remain unclear. Yoga therapy is also seen to improve indices of risk in adults with type- diabetes, including glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, anthropometric characteristics and blood pressure. It also leads to a reduction in oxidant damage improve coagulation profiles and pulmonary function, and decreases sympathetic activation in adults with diabetes and related chronic disorders. Yoga may also be useful in reducing medication requirements in patients with diabetes and could help prevent and manage cardiovascular complications in this population. Many research papers have been published in indexed peer-reviewed journals to prove the ecacy of Yoga therapy in the management of many muscular-skeletal disorders and lifestyle-related diseases Concusion Thus, Yoga is the most perfect health and wellness module as it is comprehensive and holistic in its nature. Yogic principles of wellness help to strengthen and develop positive health enabling us to withstand stress better. This Yogic health insurance is achieved by normalising the perception of stress, optimising the reaction to it and by releasing the pent-up stress effectively through the practice of various Yogic practices.

INTRODUCTION The Yogastras mention about a practice of eka-tattva-abhysa which is advocated to overcome antarya-s (obstacles in the path of yoga) which are also known as Vikepa-s (distractions). The practice of eka-tattva- abhysa needs to be understood so as to overcome the antaryas. Unless one overcomes antaryas, progress in the path of yoga will be dicult. 2. COMPOUND WORD The word ekatattvbhysa is a compound word made up of three words eka, tattva and abhysa. Translated literally it would mean one-objectprinciple-practice. (the practice of (focusing on) one object.). 3. VIEWS OF THE TRADITIONAL COMMENTATORS Commentaries and sub-commentaries are written to explain and elaborate upon the ideas presented in the Stras. On most occasions they provide clarity and some times they provide multiple interpretations and at times mutually conflicting ideas. In such situations the discerning reader has to then reflect and draw conclusions which would assist practice. In this present topic of discussion too, one encounters various views presented as interpretations. From the point of view of the practitioner they need to be studied and reflected upon. This write-up endeavors to examine a few commentaries and sub-commentaries on eka-tattva-abhysa with an objective to just indicate the various ways in which this concept is discussed in the commentarial literature. This is not an exhaustive analysis based on all available commentaries. a) Vysa4 in his commentary simply states that one has to train the mind to hold on to one tava (obectprinciple) in order to overcome Vikepa- s5.

Jayaraman: The practice of Eka-tattvbhysa in the Yogastras - Analysis based on select classical commentaries 8 9 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020Vysa does not further elaborate this point. Rather, he focuses on refuting the view of Bauddhas that minds are many6. b) In the view of Vcaspati Mira7 eka-tava men- tioned here is vara8. Hence, according to his view one has to contemplate upon vara. ka-tava, according to Vcaspati Mira, has to be vara because it is the topic that has been dealt in pre-ceding stras and that it is proper to be referred in the sutra on eka-tattva-abhysa (which follows them). This indicates that eka-tavabhyasa is same as that of vara-praidhna in Vcaspati Mira-s view. c) Bhoja in his commentary (Bhoa- v) states 9 that eka-tava can be taken to mean some principleobject of ones own liking (abhimata-dh yana) that assists focusing the mind. d) But according to Vijnabhiku eka-tattva may be any object which is gross etc 1 0. He categorically states that eka-tattva cannot be vara1 1. Hence, eka-tat - tva-abhy sa cannot be vara-praidhna. Further vara-praidhna has been dealt in detail in the pre - vious Stras. And so, he opines that it would not be proper to state that which has already been stated. e) Sadiva Brahmendra1 2 toes the line of Vcaspati Mira. He states that eka-tattva is vara. And abhysa is the effort to enable the flow of the mental activity with that eka-tattva within the scope of mind. In the words that lead to this Stra (on ekat-tattva), Sadiva states it has been already stated that antarya-s are to be overcome by vara-praidhna (Yogastra .). And this Stra on eka-tattva-abhysa is merely a reminder. 1 4 f) Hariharnanda ara ya1 5 says that previously vara-praidhna has been stated. In the initial stages of vara- praidhna, one may start hav- ing multiple notions about vara. >ike - vara is free from klea-s (miseries and their causes), he is omniscient, he is omnipotent etc. The mind will not be one-pointed then. So by practicing eka-tat-tvbhyasa (single notion) initially on vara might help. He further adds that the one thought about vara can be aham-bh va(Iness in vara). One has to meditate I am also lik e vara. 1 6 4. ANALYSIS OF THE VIEWS The comments of the six traditional commentators above can be classified into three groups. Three opinions emerge out of the six commentators. . Eka-tattva is vara. And has to be practiced with single notion of vara so that mind is freed from vikepa-s. (Hariharnanda araya). . Eka-tattva-abhysa is focusing the mind on any (one) principleobject by which the mind can over- come vikepa-s. (Vysa, Vijnabhiku and Bhoja) Now a question arises as to which of the above three views is more probable. Let us examine one by one. 4.1 First view: It has been stated previously that vara-praidhna in the form of repetition of praava and contemplation upon its meaning helps to overcome vikepa-s.1 7 Again it is stated that eka-tattva-abhysa will help overcome vikepa-s. Then a question arises as to which one of the two - vara-praidhna or eka- tattva-abhysa, is to be practiced for overcoming If to Vcaspati Mira and Sadiva Brahmendra, eka-tattva-abhysa and vara-praidhna are one and the same then the problem of which of the two should be practiced stands convincingly answered. But then a question will arise Why is there a repetition of ideas Why is the same practice termed as vara- praidhna and eka-tattva-abhysya This is a Stra text which is of the nature of conveying ideas in a crisp manner. So, it would not be proper to state that ideas are repeated. To this we find an answer in Vcaspati Miras work. He states 1 8 that this is a section which concludes ideas about (abhysa and vairgya) on vara-praidhna. Hence from his words it could be understood that rather than taking it as a repetition of ideas, this sutra on eka-tattva-abhysa is to be taken to sum up the section on vara-praidhna. Dr. M. Jayaraman: The practice of Eka-tattvbhysa in the Yogastras - Analysis based on select classical commentaries 1 0 1 1 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 20204.2 Second view: The second view by Hariharnanda is an attempt to find a golden mean. He tries to overcome the possibility of repetition of ideas by presenting eka-tattva-abhaysa as something different from vara-praidhna. (as a practice prior to proper vara-praidhna) But he tries to keep it related to vara-praidhna by suggesting vara as the object of meditation in eka-tattva-abhaysa. 4.3 Third view: Of the three who hold this view Vysa is non-specific about the object of meditation or the eka-tattva. His emphasis is on making the mind one pointed and overcoming vikepa-s. Since his emphasis is on the end and not the means, It can be assumed that he is not to particular that only vara should be the object of eka-tattva-abhysa. Bhoja also explains that one can chose any object of that one prefers for focusing the mind(which can be termed as eka-tattva-abhysa ). (But it would be interesting to see how the idea of repetition of ideas is avoided when the same idea of choosing an object of ones liking is stated later in the yogastra-s (.) This idea is not further elaborated here for fear of losing focus on the present topic under discussion) It should be noted that Vijnabhiku is vocal in rejecting vara as the object of meditation in eka-tattva-abhysa. Because he says it would amount to repetition of ideas of vara-praidhna. He further states that eka-tattva-abhysa is a general term which means practice of focusing the mind in a single principleobject. Until and unless there is a compelling situation there is no need to interpret the meaning of a general term to denote a specific object. (The present context does not have any compelling necessity so as to restrict the meaning of the general term tattva (principleobject) to mean vara). 1 9 Further he makes certain points clear while discussing the yogastra .. 2 0 The result of vara-praidhna is realization of the consciousness within. The absence of antaraya-s which is also said to be achieved by vara-praidhna should be taken as mere anuvda (explanatory repetition). Anuvda is mere statement of fact to add to clarity. In his view, absence of antarya-s is achieved by the practice of eka-tattva-abhysa where any object can be taken up to counter the vikepa-s. When this is achieved, the practice of vara-praidhna can be taken up which would lead to the realization of consciousness within. In that state quite naturally there would be absence antaraya-s. 5. CONCLUSION Hermeneutically, the first view seems plausible. But keeping in view the need of the practitioner it lacks practical guidance. An objection raised by vijnabhiku also needs to be stated in this context. If P atajali intended to state vara-praidhna in the Stra on eka-tattva-abhysa then he could well have said it as varbhysa to avoid ambiguity. 2 1 Why should he coin another word and use it in the same meaning This question remains unanswered if one takes recourse to the first view. Further, the mechanism of how the practice of vara-praidhna can remove antarya-s is not evident from this interpretation. The second sounds hermeneutically and practically possible. Even there a doubt persists. When one looks at the nature of vikepa-s and their off-shoots it can be understood that they are at multiple levels. Some of them are based on the body and prna-s, some of them are based on the senses and some others arise from the mind. 2 2 Hence fixing up vara (though with single notion) as the object of meditation to counter these challenges which may arise might be dicult for a practitioner who is at initial stages of his practice (as stated by Hariharnanda himself). vara is a subtle concept and needs a trained intellect to grasp his nature. It is evident from the stra-s that explain the concept of vara. Even for an advanced practitioner it would be quite a challenge to have a subtle support (vara) to overcome distractions of varying proportions. 2 4 Thus from the above discussion it can be concluded that the third view which allows the freedom to fix-up any object of focus according to ones level of comfort seems to be the probable meaning intended by patajali by the term eka-tattva-abhysa. Even the third view needs further reflection. Rather than randomly fixing up any object for eka-tattva- abhysa, if the object of focus during eka-tattva-abhysa is determined by the practitioner going by the nature Dr. M.

When once these anatrya-s are overcome gradually by eka-tattva-abhysa, higher practices like vara-praidhna which directly lead to the accomplishment of samdhi becomes practicable by an initiate (practitioner) in the path of yoga.

INTRODUCTION T here are many people, b oth in India and ab road, to w hom the term Y oga conj ures up images of Asanas or physical postures demanding effort, great flexibility and determination. Asanas are just one part of the System of Yoga called the Ashtaanga Yoga. Our aim in this article is to briefly describe the Ashtaanga Yoga and to distinguish it from other types of Yoga. At the outset, it must be made clear that wherever the term Yoga is used in this article, it refers only to the Yoga as ad- vocated by the Yoga Upanishads, which are about twenty in number. The Yoga of the Yoga Upa- nishads is fundamentally different from many other types of Yoga such as Hatha Yoga, Raj Yoga, Gnyaana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, <riya Yoga, etc., though there may be some common elements. T he Y oga advocated b y the Y oga U panishads is called the A shtaanga Y oga, which means Yoga of Eight >imbs or Components. It is a graded course in increasing order of di- culty and complexity. Each limb prepares the adept specifically for the next one. If one limb of the Ashtaanga Yoga were to be attempted without mastering the previous one, it w ould lead to a dangerous failure. In real life, a student who has secured poor marks or failed in the rd Standard and yet b een promoted, may do w ell in the 4 th standard. But that would be impossible in Yoga. The Eight >imbs of Ashtaanga Yoga are as follow s: - 1. Yama . N iyamaABSTRACT Asanas are just one part of the System of Yoga called the Ashtaanga Yoga. Yoga as ad- vocated by the Yoga Upanishads, which are about twenty in number. The Yoga of the Yoga Upa- nishads is fundamentally dierent from many other types of Yoga such as Hatha Yoga, Raj Yoga, Gnyaana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Kriya Yoga, etc., though there may be some common elements. If one limb of the Ashtaanga Yoga were to be attempted without mastering the previous one, it would lead to a dangerous failure. Yamas & Niyamas are designed to make the Body and the Mind, strong, pure and /f_it for further Yoga. Asanaas constitute the third limb of Yoga. Pranayama, Prathyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi yoga of the yoga upanishads 1 4 1 5 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020. A sana . amas & N iyamas are designed to mak e the Body and the Mind, strong, pure and fit for further Yoga. M ore importantly, they b ring the M ind and the Body under the full control of the :iva or the Sentient Principle in embodiment. The term yamah in San- skrit connotes a sense of restraint, control or self control. T he T rishik hi Braahamanopani- panishad [ M antra, 3 2 ( ii) - 3 3 ] and the D arshanopanishad [ 1 - 6] b oth tell us that there are ten k inds of Y amas, namely, ahimsa dayaa aarj- vam mitaahaaraha or temperance in food; and shaucam or cleanliness. Students can follow variations in other Texts with added benefit. However, the adept would do well to consult his or her Guru. The term Niyama in Sanskrit also denote the sense of restraint taming subduing a restriction or limitation. T he T rishik hi Brahmanopanishad [ M antra, 3 3 ] says that tapah or penance; santo- sha or contentment, astikaya or belief in the existence of God and the other Worlds daanaam or charity: araadhanamhare or the adoration of Sri Hari vedaantashravanam or the study of the Vedanta hniha or modesty mati or knowledge and discrimination japa or prayers and lastly vratam or austerities are the ten Niyamas. The Varaahopanishad - p. concurs with the Trishikhi Braahmanopanishad except that it uses the phrase Ishvara Poojanam in place of Aaraadhanam Hare to denote the adoration and worship of God. In effect, like Yamas, Niyamas are also restraints, rules and restrictions. If so what is the difference between Y amas and N iyamas? Y amas are things forb idden for the aspiring Yogi. They are negative in the sense of avoidance. Niyamas are things the Yogi is exhorted to do. They are positive and pro-active action oriented. Thus Yamas are restrictions or restraints and Niyamas are observances positively enjoined. To- gether, they form a code of conduct that transforms the M ind and the Body mak ing the adept fit for further Yoga. Niyama is the second of the eight >imbs of Yoga. Sri <rishna says Gita 0: 8 q\u00d5q y [50] A man with evenness of mind discards here and now good and evil. Therefore endeavour for Yoga. Yoga is skill in action. 0 Asanaas Asanaas constitute the third limb of Yoga. The term aasanam in Sanskrit has a num- ber of meanings such as sing down a seat a particular posture or mode of sing stop- ping, camping abiding, dwelling. The term Yogaasanam in Sanskrit means a posture suitable for profound meditation. Yogaasnam is important per-se in that it purifies the mind and body of the Yogi making it strong, healthy and focused for the rigorous stag- es of Yoga to follow. Another role that aasanams play, which is certainly as important, if not more, is that many of the Asanams act as the indispensible foundation for per- forming other limb s of Y oga such as Praanaayaama, Pratyaahaara, Dhaaranaa, Dhyaa- na and Samaadhi. For instance, the rishik hi Braahmanopanishad [ M antra 9 2 -9 4 ] says; \u00d0a 5 [ 9 2 ] y y [93] \u00b3a 8 \u00b1s P [ 9 4 ] zogi assuming the posture at first, keeping his body erect, (his Mind) alert, with his eyes fied on the tip of the nose, (one row of) teeth not touching the (other row of) teeth, the tongue fied on to the palate, his Mind at ease, showing no distemper, with his head slightly inclined, with his hands bound in the (characteristic) zoga-posture (of Cin-Mudra), (the zogi) should practice Pranayamaa according to the prescribed rules. piration (of foul air from the body), then Inspiration (of pure air), then purifying the air (with the <umbhaka), similarly Colonel Ramesh Shama Alvar (Retd): The Ashtaanga yoga of the yoga upanishads 1 4 1 5 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020epiration (once again completely) the ehaustion of air by (repeating) the (above) four (processes), is said to be Pranaayaamaa. [ 9 2 - 9 4 ] T he Y ogak undally U panishad [ 1 / 3 2 - 3 4 ] says a man of clear intellect having as- sumed the Padmaasana posture; k eeping his neck and b elly in line; controlling the mouth firmly should expel the vital air through the nose such that vital air moves from the throat and occupies the cranium with a distinct sound. The Dyaanabinduupanishad 0 says that Y ogi is deemed the lib erated one w ithout doub t, who, aer assuming the Padmaasana, fills the vital air in the passages of the Naadis and retains it by <umbhaka. T he Y ogi having as- sumed the Baddha- Padmaasana, and saluting his Guru and Shiva, should practice Praanaay- aama with his eyes fixed on the tip of the nose says the Yoga Cuudaamany Upanishad 06. There are many examples in the Yoga Upanishads recommending the use of specific Asanaas or Postures while practicing aspects of other Limb s of A shtaanga Y oga such as Pratyaahaara, Dhaarana, Dhyaana and Samaadhi. What is the aim of Asanas Briefly put, it is to purify and strengthen the mind and the body in order to make the Yogi fit to pursue the next angaa or stage of Yoga and indeed all different angaa of Yoga successfully. Mastery of the Asanaas will enab le the Y ogi to conq uer the three w orlds according to the Darshanopanishad . It is impossible to answer the question as to which is the b est Y oga A sanaa b ecause each A sanaa is meant for specific goals and attainments. But one may ask as to w hat are the el- ements of the right posture? T he M andala Braahmana U panishad [ 1 / 5] says the right posture is one w herein one can transport his mind ( to the Supreme Atman) comfort- ably wherein one can abide for a long time (without discomfort). The Yoga Upanishads sometimes stress the importance of comfort and firmness of the posture before mention- ing the name of the Asanaa. The Shandilyopanishad says that, In whichever posture one can hold ones body comfortab ly, the man of feeb le strength should tak e recourse to it. 2. PRAANAAYAAMAA The Sanskrit term Praanaayaamaa is a composite of two words namely Praana and aayaama. Praana refers to the vital airs that course through the b ody, and ayaama denotes the sense of restraint or control or stopping. Praana is not just the breath which is the source of oxygen, which we inhale and exhale continuously to remain alive. It is b est describ ed as the vital force w hich regulates and maintains the body and the mind in running condition. T heT rishik hib raahmanopanishad [ M antra, 9 3 ( ii) - 9 4 ( i) ] , explains the term Praanaayaamaa as being that process which begins with exhalation of the vital air follow ed b y its inhalation. Thereaer the V ital A ir is held for the given duration to b e follow ed b y exhalation once again to facilitate the next cycle. T hese four processes tak en to- gether, w hich destroy all kleshanam or fears constitute Praanaayaamaa according to this Mantra. T rishik hib raahmanopanishad [ M antra, 53 ] reminds us that Praanaayaamaa must come only aer perfect control has b een gained over the M ind and the Body b y diligently ob serv- ing the Y amas, N iyamas, and A sanas and aer the Naadis have been purified. The adept must not lose sight of the fact that each A ngaa or Limb of Y oga is meant to prepare the adept for undertak ing the Angaa to follow in sequential order. That is part of the grand design of Yoga. It means that no Angaa or stage of Y oga can b e sk ipped or performed imperfectly w ithout adverse repercussions on the next stage, and indeed, on the whole of the discipline. T he D arshanopanishad [ 6/ 1 - 3 ] says that Praanaayaamaa is made up of three compo- nents namely, Recaka, Puuraka and <umbhaka, which are said to be of the triad of Varnas or letters that constitute the Pranava or AUM. Praanaayaamaa is made up of that Prana- va. The Darshanopanishad 6(ii), defines these three terms clearly and briefly. It says that Puuraka is the inhalation of the outside air and filling it up in the belly. <umb- haka is the retention of that inhaled air in the belly as though it were a filled-up pot. Re- caka is the expulsion of the air freely. According to the Yoga Upanishads, <umbhaka or retention of the vital air is really the essence of Praanaayaamaa for w ithout it, the process of inhalation and expiration would tantamount to normal or supernormal or ab normal b reathing b ut not Praanaayaamaa. The longer the <umbhaka one performs, the better it is. T he D hyaanab induupanishad [ 1 9 - 2 1 ] says that one should meditate upon the Lord in the form of the Omkaara stationed in the middle of the pericarp or the >otus of the Heart who resembles the steady flame of a lamp who is the size of a thumb and perfectly still. D raw ing in the air through the Idaa, one should meditate upon the Omkaara in the middle of the body surrounded by a lustrous halo. This Mantra emphasizes meditation on the Om- kaara during the <umbhaka phase.Colonel Ramesh yoga yoga upanishads 1 6 1 7 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 20203. PRATYAAHAARAA Pratyaahaaraa or Abstraction consists in the withdrawal of the Mind and the sense-organs from their respective objects. It comes aer Praanaayaamaa and before Dhyaana in the order of the Ashtaanga Yoga. The Amrta N aadopanishad [ 5] says that w hen one think s of the five senses such as sound and the like as horses of the chariot, and the fickle Mind as being the reins or bridle in the hands of the Atman, it is known as Pratyaahaaraa. The Mantra exhorts the :iva to take up the reins and to exercise its inherent authority over the Mind and the Senses in its capacity as the inner-controller of the body in which it finds itself in embodiment. The natural propensity of the Senses and the Mind is to collaborate w ith each other to provide the J iva w ith various sense experiences, which delays final liberation, if not making it impossible. Another age-old and apparently irresistible natural tendency of the sense organs is to gravi- tate tow ards sense- ob j ects that are w ithin their amb it and to pass on the sensory impressions acq uired b y them to the M ind for processing so that J ivaatman may cogniz e and experience the external Universe. Aer all, any Data without the sentient principle to make use of it is meaning- less. However, if the Mind has to be freed from its natural but incessant propensity of acquiring, interpreting and transming sensory data, it must be trained not to react to any external sensory impression in the first place. Slowly the Mind must be compelled to pay less and less attention to the stream of sensory data inputs from the outside. Next, the Mind must be trained to turn inwards abandoning the external world for the inner. Who will train the Mind to do all this Obviously, no entity other than the J ivaatman itself Pratyaahaara teaches the :ivaatman how to bring the Mind and the Senses under its control and to obey its wishes. Pratyaahaara teaches the Yogi not only how to take charge of the Mind and the Senses b ut also to compel them to move aw ay from all sense-objects. Pratyaahaara prepares the Yogi for the next stage of Yoga called Dhaaranaa. 4. DHAARANAA In the Y oga A ngaa called D haaranaa, w hich follow s Pratyaahaara, the J ivaatman tak es further control of the Citta and gives it a specific target to focus on. Since b oth Pratyaa- haara and D haaranaa involve the control and direction of the Citta or the Mind, one may like to know the difference between the two The T rishikhi Braahmanopanishad Man- tra, 0 (ii)- (i) says that when the :ivaatman cognizes that his Citta has turned fully in- wards, it constitutes the adoption of Pratyaahaara and w hen the J iva cogniz es itself as b e- ing one w ith the Paramaatman, it constitutes the adoption of Dhaaranaa. W hen the Citta is pointed tow ards the Paramaatman, it w ould b e the highest form of Dhaaranaa. 5. DHYAANA The Sanskrit term dhyaana denotes meditation, contemplation, attention, or reflection. In the sequence of Ashtaanga Yoga, Dhyaana comes aer Dhaaranaa and before the last Angaa of Samaadhi. Recall that b eginning w ith Pratyaahaaraa, the J ivaatman of the Saadhak or the aspirant, turns its attention to the most important b usiness of tak ing full control of the Mind. In Pratyaahaaraa, the Mind and the Sense Organs are withdrawn from the objects of the Senses. Their orientation is turned away from the external Universe to the internal. It is by no means easy to control the naturally wayward Mind and the Sense Organs long used to external sensory stimuli over repeated births. If the aspiring Y ogi does succeed in Pratyaahaaraa, no new sensory impressions or stimuli would thereaer b e received from the outer w orld and the M ind and the Sense Organs of the Yogi would have become fit to take up the next Yoga Angaa of Dhaaranaa. In the stage of D haaranaa, the J ivaatman of the Y ogi further tightens its hold over the Mind giving it specific targets to rivet its attention upon for increasing periods at a time. It is but a part of the rigorous training and disciplining of the most powerful entity of the human body, which ought to have been the :ivas willing slave b ut w hich has alw ays tended in the default programming mode to b e an unw illing servant, if not to dominate the :iva in the vast majority of the cases of em- bodiments. Despite, successful Pratyaahaaraa, distractions will continue to crop up, not from the outside world but from the inside, triggered b y residual impressions in the Mind. In Dhaaranaa, the Yogi attempts to reduce these distractions in strength and frequency in a progressive manner. The taming of the Mind is an ongoing process without any let or relaxation. If the Yogi eventu- ally succeeds in eliminating all distractions and is able to concentrate upon an ob j ect smoothly w ithout interruptions, he is ready for the next stage of Yoga which is Dhyaana. When Dhyaana is perfected, all objects except the one chosen for Dhyaana would be completely eliminated.Colonel Ramesh Shama Alvar (Retd): The Ashtaanga yoga of the yoga upanishads 1 6 1 7 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020T he T ej ob induupanishad \u00d4\u00ca \u00b4 [ 3 6] that the very act of contemplation that one is one with that Brahman, which rests on no support and which yields supreme bliss is famous by the name of Dhyaana. [ 3 6] /T_he T rishikhibraahmanopanishad [Mantra, 31(ii)] says, \"Re/f_lection in the Mind that 'I am of the form of Consciousness alone' is known as Dhyaana.\" /T_he Yogatattvopanishad [24(ii)-25] ' \u00e5 dhyaanambhrumadyameharim' which means that Dhyaana is the meditation of Sri Hari in the middle of the eyebrows. /T_he Mandala Braahmanopanishad [Braahmana, 1/1/5-10] de/f_ines Dhyaana as the contemplation upon the Supreme Consciousness abid- ing in all. In the act of Dhyaana, one's consciousness must /f_low continuously without a break towards the object of meditation chosen and there must be intense and one-pointed devotion for it to bear fruit. The Yoga Upanishads are theistic by nature. They advocate D hyaana upon D ivinity more than upon ab stract objects. They oen speak of Meditation upon a Deity of choice with various wonderful attributes and divine qualities. This is because devotion integrated with the object of meditation facilitates sustained concentration and unbroken application of the Mind to the object of Dhyaana. It also satisfies the spiritual needs of man for expressions of devotion and communion with Divinity. Dhyaana done without a break and complete devotion can become an independent means to Moksha. Sri <rishna says Gita 0 \u00ec a\u00ca \u00f8 0 When one has begun to find life's sole satisfaction in meditation on the Lord, the vision of Him through such meditation, speaking about Him, saluting Him, singing about Him and praising Him\u2014then the operation of the senses, intellect, mind and vital forces will get concentrated on Him. [30] 6. SAMAADHI Samaadhi is the final and most intense stage of concentration of the consciousness. It fol- lows Dhyaana or Meditation. The term Samadhi as used in Sanskrit >iterature has several dif- ferent connotations in English such as that of collecting or composing, profound meditation, intentness or concentration, the fixation thoughts, penance, perfect absorption of thought into the object of meditation, and perseverance to cite some. As far as Yoga is concerned, the English sense of perfect absorption of thought into the object of meditation is the closest ex- planation of the term Samaadhi. However, the depth, complexity, and ramifications of the term Samaadhi defy a simple or concise explanation in any language. We have to turn to the Yoga Upanishads for insights. The Mandala Braahmanopanishad 0 uses the Sanskrit phrase Dhyaana-Vismruti to define Samaadhi. This means that Samaadhi is that state wherein one has become oblivious of the very act of contemplation. Such a concept of Samaadhi is substanti- ated by the Amrta Naadopanishad 6 which says that, Aer having attained it (the Supreme Self or a Deity of Choice), w hen one look s upon oneself as b eing the same ( as that attained), such a state is known as Samaadhi. The Trishikhi Braahmanopanishad Mantra, 60(ii)- 6 says that when the thought be- comes firmly estab lished in the Y ogi that he or she has b ecome a part of that Supreme Brahman and verily that Brahman alone, it is known as the state of Samaadhi devoid of all functioning. The Brahman is then attained and the Yogi would not have to go back to worldly existence any more. The Darshanopanishad 0- says that Samaadhi is the advent of that state of con- sciousness in w hich the J ivaatman and the Paramaatman ( T he Brahman) are found to be merged. 7. CONCLUSION What is the grand Aim of Yoga I conclude this Article with my firm belief that the pur- pose of Yoga as stated in the Y oga U panishads themselves is not to develop yogic-siddhis (ex- traordinary or supernatural powers), but to seek Moksha and thence attain either the State of <aivalya or merger with the Brahman as may be desired b y the Y ogi w ho has reached the summit of the Yoga. Siddhis acquired in the course of the practice of yogic disciplines are to b e used only to facilitate further progress in the quest for emancipation and God. A ccording to the Yoga U panishads, they are not to b e disclosed or pub liciz ed for fame or misused in any form. T hese Upa- nishads seek to provide valuab le aspects of knowledge helpful to the seeker of the Brahman.

T he depth of the insights gained depends upon the efforts of the seeker himself, the Grace of the Brahman, and the help of the Guru.

Lastly, the final goal of Yoga is mysterious per se and cannot b e easily describ ed or imag- ined. In this spirit, we quote a shloka from the M ahaavaak ya U panishad es the im- mense diculty of comprehending the final goal of Yoga, if not its impossibility. It says ibid. 6-9]: \u00c1 \u00e5 \u00e5a\u00c8 \u00d0 \u00b3 then the himself in Meditation in the form of istence, Consciousness and Ananda or Bliss', that state known as the knowledge of the Truth intensely resplendent with the radiance of thousands of Suns rising up simultaneously is like the waveless deep (ocean), incapable of being absorbed on account of its very fullness. This is not Samadhi. Nor is this the successful accomplishment of zoga. Nor is this the final dissolution of the Mind. That is oneness with the Brahman. Author Biography in brief: Colonel (retd.)

INTRODUCTION Svdhna-Savanam ( S S ) is a 2 0th century S ansk rit w ork on Y oga authored b y Paita M(ydugolam V(enkappacharya) Raghavendracharya, and published (in <annada script) with an explanatory <annada translation by the author himself (in ). The work consists of verses divided over chapters called adhyya-s. The book opens with a claim by the author - that the work has absorbed into itself the essence of all the stra-s and that it bears the name Svdhna- Savanam (which literally means Autonomous Resuscitation) significantly and that being easy to implement, it is capable of conferring on any human being not only the worldly riches such as longevity and health in addition to na, bhakti and vairgya (knowledge, devotion and detachment - roughly), and finally, even mukti (beatitude). The author styles the work as peculiar- as not conforming to the pattern of standard works. The author elaborates on ideas such as the following. One needs to fix, first of all, wherefrom he came, whereto he would go, and where indeed he stands in the immediate present. The sense organs etc. are all directed towards a distinct superior goal. <arman and na are like two wings ABSTRACT Svdhna Sa\u00f1jvanam is a mid-20th century work on Yoga/Tantra designed for an inner spiritual growth. Consisting of a little less than 200 verses in chaste Sanskrit (inclusive, though, of a few corroborative verses culled from Upaniadic/allied literature) and a prefatory prose passage running to no more than half a dozen pages, the work sets forth a somewhat novel theory-cum-practice schema designed to help spiritual aspirants. The author Raghavendracharya, as well as the work have remained obscure as the work was printed only in Kannada script. The philosophy the work embodies was \"earned with inordinate eorts\" , asserts the author, vouchsa/f_ing at the same time that it has stood in good stead in his own personal life, and exuding con/f_idence too that it will help others in the attainment of a sound health such as conduces to the attainment of the supreme dharma. The author seems to have absorbed key precepts of the practice of Yoga, as also certain principal tenets of Dvaita and Advaita philosophies. He has carefully and skillfully steered clear of worthless controversies via choosing to dwell on little else than quintessential issues, as too, making an apt choice of words, and pressing into service a style easily reminiscent of a Madhva or a Vidyraya. Setting forth an \"eortless practice\" of a \"wordless mantra\" , he delineates the logical process involved in the natural coalescence of the ways of karman, bhakti, and j\u00f1na. Dependent upon no external appurtenances or observations of strict regulations that most rites insist upon, the method he posits is one /f_it alike for practice by all - immaterial of time and place, or age and gender. The paper studies this little-known work against some standard texts/approaches in Yoga and Tantra.Keywords: Svadhina Sanjivanam, YogaDr. K S Kannan: Svdhna-Sa\u00f1jvanam - a 20th century Sanskrit work on Yoga 2 0 2 1 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020of a bird. All actions to be surrendered to the >ord. Every action should have three goals directly indirectly: (a) atonement for our ppa (sins) (b) attainment of puya (merit) and (c) attainment of Truth. The ancient dictum amantram akara nsti, which occurs in this text also, indicates that things under our control are to be properly utilised as nothing can be a waste. We all have selves ( a) sthla-arra or the gross b ody that grow s w ith the food that we take, (and which is not the true self) (b) the skma-arra w hich grow s w ith our thoughts and ( c) the vtman whose food is the >ord: during meditation one ought to think of offering the >ord as food to this self and this is what is meant by bhakti(devotion). Of these while the sthla-arra or the gross b ody has birth as well as death, the last, the vtman, has neither the middling has no birth but has death. :vtman is of the nature of sat, cit, and nanda. As all can attain the Supreme, none none at all - should feel disheartened at any point of time. The method shown in this work is something that is done purely internally, whence the name. The medicine advocated here demands no monetary expenditure, and no dependence on another individual. The method taught in the work is not constrained by factors such as time, age, place, and gender. The method is unfailing, yet not dicult to implement. And the more it grows, the more powerful it becomes. One must contemplate upon the vital fact that there is a certain continuous flow of energy from the >ord, the ocean of all potentialities: this is in fact what is meant by dhyna . This work has chapters viz. . Sarva-strrtha-sagraha (a compendium of the contents of all the stra-s) . Sdhannuhna-tatphaldi-nirpaa (an exposi - tion of the spiritual practice and its benefits) . Ski-pra-rpa-pradhna-sdhana-nirpaa (an exposition of the primary means in the form of ski-pra or the Witness Consciousness) . :vtma-paramtma-tatsambandha-nirpaa ( an exposition of the relation between and paramtman) . Sdhanakrama-tatphaldi-nirpaa (an exposi - tion of the procedure that has been adopted) 6. pravyu-prabhva-nirpaa (an exposition of the power of the pra-vyu (vital breath)). . svdhna-savana-sevana-prakra-nirpaa ( an exposition of the way the medicine svdh- na-savana is to b e ingested) . kaivalyaphala-prdhnya-nirpaa (an exposi - tion of the importance of the fruit in the form of <aivalya (the Solitude Supreme)). Though this work teaches a mantra, the famous aapa- gyatr, it demands no specific, tough, discipline. The mantra can be pursued at all hours. The hexasyllabic mantra runs as: hasah so'ha svh, and need not be uttered through the mouth. Ha is uttered along with the inhalation and sa with the exhalation. While the aga-nysa and kara-nysa are required only during apa, the rest of the time only hasa needs to be dwelt upon in ones own mind, coupled with a reflection upon its meaning. As a consequence, ones entire lifetime becomes tapas. The mantra can also be thought of as the >ords upadea (tuition) to the va. The meaning of the mantra in that case would be as noted below. The >ord addresses the va thus: Oh :va, sa hasa ( that >ord Whose name is Hasa is done b y the parama-hasa -s, is) aha (Myself). Svh means Oh :va, offer your own self to Me, saying svh. As a reward, I bless you, says the >ord, and hence this upadea is of the form of abhaya- pradna or conferring freedom from fear. It is well known that tmrpaa (or offering of ones own self) is the most important one among the nine types of bhakti. The author adds a personal note that at the age of 6 he fell somewhat ill (adding that the astrologers had indicated that his life may be in danger around that time). But then, he resorted to such food as is suggested in the Bhagavad-gt, and was cured of the illness in a matter Dr. K S Kannan: Svdhna-Sa\u00f1jvanam - a 20th century Sanskrit work on Yoga 2 0 2 1 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020of days by pursuing this very medicine (viz. Svdhna- Savana ) and that he is now (in the year ) , and is in a sound physical and mental state - all on account of this very medicine. The author recommends this to all as an additional medicine in case they are already under some medication. The author also says that he has labelled his very house Savanlaya, and welcomes all to benefit by discussion with him, and he also insists that they come singly. The author claims in his Introduction, finally, that all the statements in the text are supported by the Vedas and the stra-s. Further there are, he says, a few elements that are not intrinsic to the stra-s, but they are all supported by his own personal experience. Coming to the actual text, the opening verses of Chapter 1 praise the >ord and the Goddess in the form of Consciousness. Verses , , and glorify Hanmat, Bhma and Madhva respectively. This is followed by philosophical tenets which may be stated thus. The >ord, the tman, is omnipresent, and is of the nature of pure knowledge and happiness, and all the va- s are his aa-s, portions. The >ord is the original (bimba) and the va-s are all His pratibimba-s, reflections. The va- s do his upsan variously, and He responds as per the Vedic dictum ta yath yathopsate tathaiva bhavati. Being the paramtman, the va- s are all similarly sac-cid-nanda in essence, and it is only on account of their association with Prakti that they have been vitiated. By the grace of the Guru they obtain their original form. Disbanding the first two bodies, they enter into the >ord in the third form - of the sat-cit-nanda. The >ord is the Ocean of satya, na, and day (Truth, <nowledge and Compassion), and has waves in the form of Bliss Eternal. C hapter 2 deals with the discipline and the benefits one reaps out of them. Three steps are to be taken. Firstly, one must nullify ones sins via the nitya-karman- s and the naimika karman-s (respectively the mandatory karman-s, and occasional ones as prescribed in the stra-s). Secondly, one must make gis over to the worthy and thereby earn merit. Thirdly one must resort to a guru and thereby learn the stra-s. While by means of the first, one can rid oneself of demerits, by means of the second and the third, he attains merit and knowledge while the first two conduce to the higher worlds or higher births, the last one leads to the attainment of the High Abode of the >ord. One must keep contemplating on three questions as to whence one came, where he is stationed and whereto, he is going and take guidance from three sources, viz. the guru, the stra and the anubhava the spiritual master, the scriptures and ones own experience. The more one withdraws from sasra, the more one gets closer to the >ord. The author makes a reference to the four types of moka viz. Slokya, Smpya, Srpya and Syujya but says that he does not insist on the truth of any of these singly and exclusively, the essential point being liberation from the fetters of sasra. Disputes, similarly, regarding the nature of the reality and otherwise of the world are also of no use, as one is aer all to transcend the world itself, ultimately. Similarly, there are various views regarding the nature of liberation and such views are natural for those at different stages of their evolution in life. All doubts get dispelled anyway, when one actually aains the goal no point would be served by dwelling on the numerous philosophical differences. C hapter 3 is on w hat is introduced as ski-pra . Though all schools of Vedanta accept viz. Pratyaka, Anumna and gama (perception, inference and scripture), there is a fourth one called Skin, the Witness the one different in nature from all the other prama-s. The Skin is called svarpendriya . This self divides himself eightfold viz. the seer, the seen, the act of seeing and the fruit of seeing, plus place and time, and the instrument and the experience. Dry logic, the author cautions, can sometimes detonate even deep experiences. Ones own self becomes ones guru and all other elements are merely contributory factors. tman, manas and the avykta ka are all perceived only by Ski- pra only. And therefore, none can absolutely deny the existence of this faculty. Further, it is this Skipraj that enlivens the other prama-s viz. Pratyaka and Anumna. The importance of this pra is to be realised by the factor that it is this that acts as a cint-mai , the Wish yielding Gem, or the kalpalat, the Wish- yielding Tree. It is he who realises this faculty of praj that becomes a pra, wise man. Pra is the b oat to cross the ocean of sasra. Pra itself becomes the sdhana at first, and then the sdhya, and finally, the very phala thus the means and the end and the very fruit. Dr. K S Kannan: Svdhna-Sa\u00f1jvanam - a 20th century Sanskrit work on Yoga 2 2 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020C hapter 4 speaks of the preciousness of human birth - as the culmination of evolution in about four stages - of grass and shrubs, of insects, of animals and birds, and finally of humans. Human birth opens up possibilities of enjoyment right up to ruling over a kingdom, and even attaining moka. It is only aer a lot of experimentation that one seeks, aer several births, the final and permanent liberation. There is none who may be damned as useless. Given this preciousness of the human birth, every human being must ascertain the truth of things with the three-pronged approach - of the stra-s, the words of the guru and, too, personal experience. The va has three forms the first one, consisting of the hands, feet etc. is the physical one the second, the mental, which lasts longer than the former lasting till the end of the cycle of births and deaths. But the one without beginning and ending is the cin-mtra (one of pure consciousness) one. One must ultimately be established in that one, abandoning the first two, and eschewing identification of ones self with them. The very notion of the va is erected on the foundations of the link with the two bodies, whereas the true self is pure, being of the nature of sat, cit and nanda. The Dhtupha notes the sense of the root v as va pra-dhrae, and thus it is on account of the association with manas and pra that the condition of va-ness is conjured up. The >ord, the Sustainer of the Universe, being of the nature of sat, cit and nanda, and being the very In-dweller, shines thereupon. C hapter 5 deals with va- s w ho are sa, such as >ord Brahm, and niraa, like ourselves. (It is significant that the author refers to the realms such as svarga as bhva prapaca Indra and other gods being the abhimnin - s of those realms). It is for the sake of the niraa-va - s that the five mah-bhta-s are created in two fashions ( a) as sthla and skma gross and subtle, and ( b ) as bhya and bhyantara external and internal. The sa-deva-s are present in the bodies gross as well as subtle, of the niraa-va -s, and impel us to act, and themselves function alongside with us. Sa divinities assume three types of forms the subtle, indwelling ones one within us, the bhva-arra in the bhva loka, and on occasion, even the skma ones. The >ord is always on the wait to confer fruits upon us as per our upsan-s, and for the sake of this divides the creation into three viz. the sdhana, the adhvan and the phala the endeavour, the way and the fruit viz. the human world, the proper knowledge of the stra-s and the >ord himself of the nature of bliss. A mere knowledge of even this much coupled with the absence of relish - of things else than the >ord - makes one :vanmukta right here, attaining liberation even while being alive in this world. Human birth is for the attainment of dharma, and it will be wasted if dharma is not accomplished. <nowing the tman via yoga is the supreme dharma - high above the half a dozen paths such as the performance of yaa-s, adhering to proper observances, practice of ahis, giving away gis, and even the pursuit of svdhyya (Vedic studies). The tman is the dearest to oneself, and is of the nature of na and nanda, knowledge and bliss. Going abegging elsewhere for what is already with ones own self - is no wisdom. Everything in the universe is to lead one to ones own self. Of the four pururtha -s, the valid goals of life, the last one alone is the eternal one, and the first three are non-eternal, and so constitute a means for the final one. The mind is the prime instrument to attain the self. The world is impermanent and sorrowful and it is the self, with its opposite qualities, that needs to be pursued. C hapter 6 deals with pra-vyu. Fish live in the ocean of waters, and we humans live in an ocean of air - with our inhalations and exhalations. Humans breathe ,600 times a day. The act of this breathing assumes the name of aapa gyatr or hasa- gyatr. It is this that we label, the author says, as svdhna-savana in this book. We do not perform this apa on the other hand, it is >ord Vyu who keeps doing this apa, and confers upon us the fruit of this apa. Mind flows constantly through either of the auspicious and inauspicious tracks, and one should engage it effortfully in the righteous track. It is vyu that sustains all, the Veda declares in the words namaste vyo, tvam eva pratyaka (Salutations to you You are verily Brahman incarnate). It is Vyu who confers nine benefits upon us - viz. long life and health, wealth, knowledge, devotion and detachment, merit and fame, and even kaivalya, Solitude Supreme. There is no effort involved in the pursuance of this apa, and no disturbance to any worldly activity. Considering breathing itself as the mantra, and viewing it as the upsan alone can suce. One has of course to get to know of things from the stra-s and from the guru.Dr. K S Kannan: Svdhna-Sa\u00f1jvanam - a 20th century Sanskrit work on Yoga 2 2 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020We have in our pair of nostrils two n-s functioning viz. I and Pigal, also called Candra-n and Srya-n they are designed by the >ord for a balance of the cold and the heat. The vyu called Prabhajana significantly absorbs during inhalations what is useful for the nourishment of all the three bodies, and even as it returns, discards along with exhalation, all the vicious elements. A pursuit of this mantra dispels our negativities and reinforces positivities. As a consequence, the presence of tman in our mind increases. Here lies the distinction of this mantra entitled svdhna-savana . As a lion or an elephant or a tiger comes under control gradually, so does vyu, yielding all its fruits once it is under control. The less the number of breathings per day, the longer our yus (life-span) would be. Wherever there is in the body any deficiency, this pra- vyu, there directed, rectifies the same. Whichever limb the mind hovers upon during meditation, this vyu puts it in order. The mucus and the hair filter the impurities of the air inhaled. Prnyma destroys all defects, and goes to nourish all the three bodies. The ease and autonomy make this the best and exclusive method, surpassing all other methods. It is for this reason that the viniyoga for even the 'yatr -mantra is pryma itself. To the aspirant who wends his way on this track, the path ahead reveals by itself. C hapter 7 deals with the technique. 'yatr -mantra is of two types :apa-'yatr and Aapa- 'yatr . This book deals with Aapa-gyatr only, as it has to serve all the former being reserved for the elect. Common though to all creatures, this Aapa-'yatr confers special benefit on humans. Thinking before acting, and changing ones desires - are acts possible for humans alone. Per ghaik, one breathes 60 times. There are crore mah-mantra-s conferring various fruits, but this mantra is the one that is easy, and bestows all of the pururtha -s. The actual, hexasyllabic mantra is . The kara-nysa and the dhyna for the mantra are next given. The period from the previous morning till todays morning is considered as one unit, and the period from this days morning till the next days morning is counted as the second. The apa is made of counts of , , or 6, or even more. C hapter 8 , the last chapter, deals with <aivalya. It is stated that there are types of va-s viz. mukti-yogya those fit for liberation, and tamo-yogya those deserving tamas or darkness, and nitya-sasrin -s the ones who are forever doomed to be in the cycles of births and deaths. The discipline detailed in this book will be limited to the mukti-yogya -s (who, for all practical purposes, are all of us). One must establish ones mind in the self, and think of nought else. The person who has taken his final birth is verily the one that would get interested in spiritual lore others get swayed elsewhere. This is set forth clearly in <ahopaniad where it is stated: Brahm created the sense organs opening outwards should one turn ones vision inwards, he would become capable of beholding the antar-tman. Some 6 verses here are selections from <ahopaniad. What needs to be realised ought to be realised in this very birth, right here. The Hasa- mantra purifies the dirt of the body, the sense organs, and the mind. One must contemplate on the fact that whatever is non-self is but instrumental in character to the nature of the self. The nature of the self as sat, cit and nanda is the very goal to be attained. For the noble who thinks on these lines, the nature of the self is cognizable directly and even the >ord Supreme appears as the Indweller. It is thus that one ends the never-ending peregrination, and attains Supreme bliss. The last chapter concludes stating that this book is as the butter obtained upon churning all the noble stra-s. Those who believe in the >ord should take this seriously up. The above provides a gist of the entire text Svdhna Savanam. A discussion of the tenets and their implications follows. 2. DISCUSSION >ike all texts in a field where there is a vast literature (here, the Yogic literature), SS has to present something new even while reiterating, even if succinctly, much that is of value in the earlier literature. In the case of a spiritual text in the Hindu context, there is also the b urden to show that w hat is said does not go counter to the stra-s. The pressure upon concise statements is more in a brief text where detailed explanations are not possible (granthasysya sagraha-rpatay vicre vailya nsti as the text says (p, Introduction). Yuite like many traditional texts, the work simply quotes many verses verbatim and shows adaptations of a few verses. Thus, over two dozen verses are cited, as noted earlier, from <ahopaniad in the last chapter (pp 6- . - .) Dr. K S Kannan: Svdhna-Sa\u00f1jvanam - a 20th century Sanskrit work on Yoga Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020The work betrays a very positive outlook on life - taking a cue from the verse that starts with the words 'amantram akara nsti'and asserts that there is none who may be declared or damned useless (ayogya puruo nsti). The text steers clear of all unnecessary controversies. Thus, it says there are kinds of liberation viz. slokya, smpya, srpya, and syuya - all characterised as sanctioned by stra-s. It dismisses much of worthless controversies - with a sensible statement that the state of moka b eing so distant, many questions assume no importance for us at this stage, and so we assert no particular stand (. asmka tatra ngraha) and on the other hand, what is agreed upon unanimously by all is, that we must indeed set ourselves free from the fetters of sasra. So also, with regard to the issue of the reality or unreality or the illusory nature of the world (.-): whatever may be the various views on the status of the world, all are at one ab out the sac-cid-nanda nature of the tman. Clarity of thinking is a hallmark of this work: thus, who am I, whence have I come here, where am I now, and where am I to go - these vital questions are the ones everyone has to put to himself constantly (.). The confidence the author shows in the book regarding the means and the end is also significant. He introduces the ideological framework with the assertive words asty tm (.) (note the verb occupying the primal position in the sentence), pointing towards the tman who is omnipresent, who is of the nature of truth, knowledge and happiness, and whose portions (aa) are the various va-s. It may be said that the entire thesis of the author is erected on a firm Vedic foundation - that the yus or lifespan of an individual is a function of his pra or life-breath. As Tairyopaniad says pro hi bhtnm yu . What is deduced as a corollary from this is, that in proportion to the reduction of the number of breaths, the lifespan of a person yvanta vsa-vyava nbhavanti klpteu tvad yur vivardhate! The essential contribution of the work may be said to be the underscoring of what is called aap. Of course, this concept figures in various yogic Upaniad-s such as Brahmavidyopaniad of that in the mantra hasas so'ha svh, so'ha is obtained by a reversal (in the Devangar script) of haso (the sandhied form of hasa). Glossing upon the ord hasa the - iti vkya vadet - iti dyotyate. The original itself notes that this aap is a k not b etw een pra and apna. (Brahmavidyopaniad ). Dhynabindpaniad 6 refers to the famous link b etw een the sound ' ha and the exhalation and the sound ' sa' and the inhalation and further that every being is constantly uttering this mantra : hakrea bahir sarvad That this mantra is uttered 600 times a day by an average human being is no new discovery of this work. It is again cited in all the Upaniad-s referred to above. The singular distinction of this little work on Yoga is that it does not prescribe any dicult sana-s or types of pryma. On the other hand, a careful observation of the breathing, and making use of the natural rhythm itself so as to work for us as the utterance of a mantra - is w hat is taught in this work. In other words, what is happening involuntarily is itself grasped and converted into a voluntary act conferring immense benefits upon us. Thus, the author says that actually speaking we are not doing any apa of the mantra on the other hand, >ord Vyu himself does the apa constantly, and himself confers the various benefits upon us, as a consequence of what we are ourselves reflecting upon. 6. na apmo vaya mantra bhagavn vyur phala dsyati nas svayam It may be recalled that the author belongs to the tradition of Madhvcrya, and what is said here, is already stated in the opening sandhi (chapter) of the work ) of :agannthadsa). This way, the work may be said to prescribe the most minimum regimen on the aspirant. This also marks high eciency in terms of input and output with its minimal input prescribed and maximum output promised. The only insistence is on a discreet alertness (.): Dr. K S Kannan: Svdhna-Sa\u00f1jvanam - a 20th century Sanskrit work on Yoga Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020sapta-koi-mah-mantr kli bhinna-phala- prad svdhno hasa-mantroya sukara sakala prada The author also points out how even animals are constantly doing this apa, but it is only with humans that it can be so highly beneficial and because of two reasons viz. that humans have the power to know and act, and can change the direction of their desires. (What is to be noted is that there are certain explanatory notes in <annada which are supplementary and complementary to the Sanskrit text). The universality of the mantra and the speciality with the human beings is thus expressed (.6) : primtra-samnopi narm eva kevalam viea-phaladas tem anusandhna-bhedata The author also shows that irrespective of ones status in society everyone is an adhikrin for this mantra: sarvdhikrikatvt (.). The work gives a special emphasis on the development of pra - a particular awareness and alertness. The essential idea of the fourth prama, viz. the skin, is shown to have a vital role. The skin is also designated as the svarpendriya. It is this factor that continues w ith the va even in the state of liberation. (.) ata is thus self-luminous. He also points out that true knowledge is attained by the pra of the disciple whereas the role of all teaching is only to support the same. He identifies the skin w ith svarpa-bht pra, or the awareness which is of the very essential nature (.0). The tman is the guru of the tman (tmano gurur tmaiva) what all else may provide is merely the pretext and the context for the same. In this context, he makes use of a famous verse which is quoted in the is also a famous verse occurring in the Mahbhrata. The ocean of sasra is crossed w ith pra as the boat. >ike the role of bhakti in Viidvaita, which assumes a double role as sdhya-bhakti and sdhana-bhakti, pra assumes a here a triple role here as sdhana, sdhya and phala. Another indication of the very logical nature of the text is its repeated insistence on the trio of evidences viz. the stra, the guru, and anubhava the scripture, the teacher and ones own experience. (.0) stra-mrgea guru-vkyena sarvad svnubhty ca Vedantic : atra pramm vednt guravo'nubhavas tath, famous in Advaitic tradition. The text makes use of several straic utterances absorbed as direct quotations incorporated into the text. E.g. verse 6.0 ubhubhbhy mrgbhy vahant bhva-vhin is easily reminiscent etc. Similarly, there are statements lied straight away from standard texts on Yoga and other texts and placed appropriately in this work in a very befing manner. References from zavalkya-smti , Hahayogapradpik, some of the Yoga Upaniad-s, the <ahopaniad and even some subhita- s are w orth mentioning. There are again statements which are adaptations of yogic texts. E.g. nivrayati cetarat The hierarchy of values is very clearly made out, based on a citation from zavalkya-smti at .0, where it is stated how, against over half a dozen of other choices, the one called tmadarana via yoga is the Supreme dharma. Cf. aya tu paramo dharmao yad yogentma- daranam (zavalkya-smti .). The author has absorbed ideas from Advaita and Dvaita traditions freely. For example, he makes use verbatim of the idea in Viveka-cmai as to w ho there can b e w ho would be so idiotic as not to be selfish (.). The idea of :agannthadsa, a Mdhva saint, in Hari kathmta-sra has already been cited. The idea that the commonality b etw een vtman and paramtman is b eing sat-cit- nanda, and also the idea of liberation being nothing more than being stationed in ones own true self are clearly set forth in .0 and .. Another important aspect where one can note the exudation of confidence of the author is in the idea, and the emphasis on the same, that the attainment of liberation is not to be le as a post-mortem affair, but is something to be attained right here, even while we are alive. Cf. atra brahma samanute (.), actually an prk arrasya visrasa, actually the Bhagavad-gt. Dr. K S Kannan: Svdhna-Sa\u00f1jvanam - a 20th century Sanskrit work on Yoga 2 6 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020The strong logical structure of the text is exemplified in instances such as .. The work also has certain good maxims which are easily appreciated e.g. no goal is reached without its proper means (.). What is also interesting is that this yogic work also calls itself a kvya. The diction of the work is commendable and delectable. There are easy and beautiful strokes of metaphor in . and ., and a natural simile occurs in 6.. There is also a nice play on words as in .0 tm prea ca (preha ca). The maturity of the Sanskrit style of the author shows itself all through. A reading of the text also gives the impression of the direct experience the author must have had in regard to what he has claimed. Incidentally, and finally, the text also brings out the beauty and greatness of the Sanskrit language itself. The central thesis of the work, viz. hasa mantra, involves five items. viz. (a) soham (b) haso'ham (c) sa aha( d) aha sa and (e) om The syllables ha and sa are, it may be noted here, are natural expressions of the sounds of exhalation and inhalation. Mantra-s are oen constituted of apparently meaningless sounds and syllables, but here is the Mantra Supreme (viz. so'ha ) w hich b rings out the identification between the seeker (aha me) and the sought ( sa He) - the (a) above. sa aha, item (c), which means He is me and aha sa ,item (d), I am He. And further, haso'ham is a sound that is heard in the process of the continuous and repeated utterance of so'ham. As Upaniadbrahmayogin points out, the va and the 5vara are both referred to as hasa - at the microscopic and macrocosmic levels respectively (see his commentary on Hasopaniad ). And finally, as many works on Yoga and Tantra clearly show, the removal of the consonantal portions of so'ha yields om (upon the operation of the prvarpa sandhi) (AUM), which constitutes the very essence of the Vedas, and which is asserted by Patajali in his zogastra as the very label Yogastra ). The Hasa-mantra expounded in the text is thus apparently very simple, yet very profound. The propriety and justification of the title Svdhna-Savanam of the text is amply borne out by the well depicted content of the work.

Some noteworthy ones include: Dev Bhgavata, _iva Pura, Viudharmottara Pura, etc. One of the themes that some of these puras touch upon is yoga. Yoga is one of the dominant philosophical systems that flourished in Ancient India, oen paired with another system known as Skhya. >ike other philosophical systems, the primary goal of yoga is moka (also called: mukti, nireyasa, nirva, etc.). In Indian philosophy, the cycle of birth and death (called sasra) is said to cause suffering. Moka is the release of a person from this cycle. The Vedas, especially the Upanishads, speak of a single Brahman which is formless and cannot be described but is the source of the universe. In this context moka is also understood in the philosophical systems as the merging of oneself into the Brahman or the realisation of Brahman. One of the hallmarks of yoga which distinguishes it from the other systems is the usage of an eight step method to achieve moka. 2. DE F IN ITIO N O F YO G A Yogastra, a major treatise on yoga, defines it as: That which removes unsteadiness in the mind is yoga (Yogastra .) Brahman is not describable, as it lacks attributes. Vedas hint about the nature of brahman. When the mind is tranquil with yoga practice, the mind is able to pick up these hints and realise the true nature of Brahman. The practice of yoga is equally conducive to worldly life since the steadiness of mind is indispensable in various circumstances. A person who practices yoga is called a yog. 3 . PH IL O SO PH Y O F YO G A Every system is dependent on certain theories which can explain the principles. The theoretical elements of yogic practices trace to the philosophies of Skhya and Yoga, which are briefly expounded in the puras. These have been explained below: It was mentioned earlier that the Vedas focus on a singular Brahman who is the source of the world. Brahman has no attributes, but is permanent and is in the form of light. 1 The singular Brahman splits into two: prakti and purua at the time of creation.2 The identifiable person, i.e. the soul, is termed as purua (other terms: tman, ja, ketraja, called: avyakta, pradhna, etc.) is the progenitor of the world. Prakti gave rise to mahat (intelligence). Mahat (also known as buddhi) gave rise to ahakra (ego). 4 Ahakra creates a sense of distinction in objects hence it is the foundation for creation. Here, ahakra gets tinted with three guas: sattva, rajas and tamas. 5 The nature of these guas is understood from the persons having excess of them: sattva is pure, free from defects, and binds a person to happiness and knowledge rajas is composed of passion, and arises from cravings and attachment and, tamas arises out of ignorance and causes delusion, laziness and sleep. 6 Ahakra is of three types by the influence of the three guas7 vaikrika, taijasa and tmasa respectively.8 creates manas (the mind),9 as well as the indriyas (sense organs).1 0 The taijasa form supports creation since it is the form of rajas that represents action. The tmasa form is the origin for the bhtas and tanmtras. 1 1 Indian knowledge systems in general are founded upon a system of five elements (bhtas) or the pacabhtas: pthiv (earth), jala (water), tejas (fire), vyu (wind) and ka (ether). Each of these pacabhta is associated with a sense organ (indriya) and sense object (the object perceived by these organs) in the manner stated: 1 2 The objects perceived from these sense organs are termed as tanmtra. These are the characteristic qualities of each of these elements however, one element is not devoid of the others qualities. The qualities of the elements are: Out of these, tmasa first creates abda (sound), which creates ka. 1 3 ka and abda created spara (touch), which created vyu.1 4 Vyu and spara created rpa (visual form), which created tejas.1 5 Tejas in conjunction with rpa creates rasa (taste), which creates jala.1 6 :ala and rasa together create gandha (smell) which creates bhmi, the final element in creation. 1 7 Brahman, as purua, split up into different creatures and entered the Sri Vinay Iyer: Yoga in the Purn .as 3 0 3 1 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020creation as the various creatures. In this way, the entire world was created. When the world is being destroyed during pralaya, the above objects join back Brahman in the reverse order. 1 8 Sound Touch Form T aste Smell E ther Air Fire Water E arth Each of the above objects is called a tattva. The sensory and motor organs1 9 put together are 0 in number. With the mind these make a set of indriyas. Adding five bhtas and five tanmtras makes it . Adding in prakti and purua brings the total upto . These are called the tattvas. 2 0 Yoga additionally accepts the existence of a separate vara (personal God), a special type of purua who is not affected by prakti, though they interact with each other. This is one of the main differences between Skhya and Yoga. 2 1 There are various modifications or different viewpoints in this scheme of such as the 6 dhtus of Agni Pura, 2 2 the scheme of packaraa in Agni Pura and Dev Bhgavata, and the 6 guas of the Brahma Pura. 2 3 Prakti acts as a medium for all the tattvas and binds them together. Purua is the only one among these which is alive while the others are lifeless. Purua commands the above structure and gives it life. However, just as the sun is not affected by its reflection in water, purua is above these, is without a change, motionless, and is not an agent for anything, is not tainted by the three guas. 2 4 Purua only develops wants.2 5 When a want arises, prakti moves according to this want. Purua remains bound to prakti and all the tattvas which act under its influence, experiencedeath and birth, by taking up a new body, in this sasra. 2 6 The outcomes of Good deeds is good while bad results in bad.2 7 Repeated actions develop habits which carry over to the next life as tendencies. 2 8 Experiences continue across lives. However, when purua realises that it is different from these objects, that they are not his, the concepts of I and mine disappear and wants cease. 2 9 Thus the cycle of birth and death (sasra) is cut with these correct thoughts, just as a tree is cut with an axe, and the past, present and future set of actions and their results are destroyed. 3 0 Purua gives up on these wants and becomes detached from prakti, attaining mukti.3 1 With knowledge of the final state and indifference towards the world outside, the yog reaches the Supreme State, which is union with Brahman. 3 2 When rajas and tamas are high in a person, they express themselves in the form of six emotional states, called the six enemies: 3 3 kma (desire), krodha (anger), lobha (greed), moha (confusion), mada (intoxication) and mtsarya (envy). 3 4 In these states, the intellect does not function since sattva in the mind (which represents clarity) is obscured by rajas and tamas. The person performs such actions that bind him further,3 5 pushing him deeper into the cycle of birth and death. But sattva, with the clarity it brings, guides a person towards moka.3 6 Since binding of purua to prakti is the cause of sasra, when purua exercises non-attachment, it is freed. Various paths (called yogas) towards moka incorporating this core idea have been prescribed: . :na: Devoting ones life to learning and understand- ing Brahman, oen aer renunciation of worldly affairs. 3 7 . Sannysa: >iving in complete renunciation and soli- tude.3 8 . <arma: Actions done without any expectation or desire or attachment to result.3 9E lem ent Sense organ Sense object Pthiv E arth Ghra Nose Gandha Smell :ala Water R asana Tongue R asa T aste Tejas Fire Cakus Eyes Rpa Visual form Vyu Air Tvak Skin Spara HearingSri Vinay Iyer: Yoga in the Purn .as 3 0 3 1 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020. Bhakti: Personal relation to Brahman (devotion). The formless Brahman is given a form using the concept of vara in yoga (as _iva, Viu, Durg, Gaapati, <a, etc.). The mind becomes fixated onto this form and merges into it the devotee attains moka. 4 0 . Dhyna: The practise of meditating on Brahman or on a deity with form.4 1 Each path is given prominence in different puras: for example, one of the central themes of the entire Bhgavata is bhakti, while Mrkaeya Pura delves deep into aspects of dhyna. As such, all these methods weave into one another, and a person might practice many together. 4 . TH E E IG H T STE PS At the heart of yoga is a set of eight steps. These A AN D N IYAM A Yamas and niyamas together constitute a code of conduct that the yog is expected to follow. Yamas are restrictions put in place to promote self-control. They are five for anothers possessions. 4 3 Niyamas are behaviours which one must engage in. They are also five in number: () fixing ones mind on 5vara (personal God). 4 4 The above list is found, with minor variation, in the <rma Pura,4 5 Garua Pura4 6 and Viu Pura.4 7 Some puras provide larger lists. In Dev Bhgavata, there are ten of each, 4 8 while the Bhgavata has of each.4 9 Others combine the list into a single code of conduct: Brahma Pura has a list of 6 practices.50 Bhgavata another list of restrictions.51 <rma Pura lists a vrata (vow) of practices.52 These need to be understood as being meant to facilitate those who use the methods are given prominence in that pura. Yogastra as well as <rma Pura and others, provide an overview of the subject and the basic framework of five yamas and five niyamas are sucient. Bhgavata, being focussed on bhakti, adds those practices that facilitate devotees, such as physical worship of Gods, etc. These practices must be constantly maintained. 6. SANA AND PROPER PRACTICE sana refers to the act of sing or to seating posture. 53 The exact definition of sana is provided in the Yogastra as: That posture which can be held for a long time without diculties is sana. (.6) Based on this, any posture that can be held for a long time and does not damage the body in any way, is acceptable. Books such as the Yoga Upaniads and books on Hahayoga delve deep into several types of sanas and their comparative merits and demerits. The puras usually restrict themselves to at the most five sanas. Some popular ones found in several puras include: padmsana, 54 bhadrsana55 and svastiksana.56 Other postures may also be selected provided the head, neck and body is straight. 57 The yog must look forward as though towards the tip of his nose and focus on the image mentioned in dhra. There are situations and places when a yog must not practice yoga. Individual puras provide lists of places where it would be safe to sit, such as avoiding places next to a fire or water or near anthills, or where it would not be conducive to yoga such as where studies are in progress or at junction of roads. 58 The place chosen by the yog must be clean, neither too low nor too high.59 As a general rule, any place that is quiet and free from interference of other people can be used for practice of yoga. Examples include: mountain tops, monasteries, at the foot of large trees. 60 Situations are stated in the Mrkaeya Pura. The yog must not practise yoga when he is weak, sick or disturbed, when the weather is not appropriate, if there is war or near areas which are unsafe (near leaf piles, dilapidated buildings, near snakes, etc.) or not conducive (at road junctions, cremation grounds, etc.). It would be best to surround oneself with people who support these activities than those who cause hindrance. 61 7. PRYMA In the system of yurveda, the cause of diseases in the body which are numerous are brought down to three Sri Vinay Iyer: Yoga in the Purn .as 3 2 3 3 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020doas that act as agents vyu, pitta and kapha. In a healthy person, they have roles in various parts of the body, 62 but they malfunction during a disease. The responsibilities of vyu are divided into five and are known by five names: pra, apna, vyna, udna and samna. Pra is the name given to the breath which circulates between the head and chest. 63 It is the primary agent which retains the life of a person.64 The yma (control) of pra is defined as pryma.65 Yogastra defines it: The practice of stopping the flow of inhalation or exhalation or both when in it seated in sana is termed pryma. (Yogastra .) Pryma can be classified under two types: sagarbha, when it is accompanied with japa or dhyna, and vigarbha, when it is not. 66 Chanting of the sound o (resembling the sound of bells) mentally is considered good. 67 A type of sagarbha pryma is used in the sandhy vandana ritual.68 The of pryma is split into three stages: praka, kumbhaka and recaka. Filling up the air into the body is known as praka (meaning filling). <eeping still with filled air is called kumbhaka (meaning pot since the body is like a filled pot). Throwing out of air is recaka (throwing out). 69 Pryma can be done at three different lengths: short (also called laghu, adhama, manda, etc.), medium (also called madhya, long (also called uttara, uttarya, reha, etc.) which lasts for , and 6 mtrs respectively. 70 Brahma Pura states that it should be performed for 0 or mtrs but it should not be performed for more than mtrs. 71 This apparently contradictory picture is resolved when it is known that there are a few different opinions regarding the length of mtr. In grammar, one mtr is the time required to pronounce one short vowel. 72 Indian astronomy uses this time period in calculations one gurvakara is made of two mtrs, meaning the length of a mtr is 00 milliseconds. 73 Yogacmayupaniad defines one mtr to be composed of one breath.74 This is also a unit in Indian astronomy by the name of pra and is equal to seconds.75 Mrkaeya Pura defines one mtr in the context of pryma as the time of the blinking of the eye,76 which is called nimea in Indian texts, and functions as a time unit. The length varies from author to author: Manusmti77 milliseconds), to name a few. The body is a chariot, the senses are its horses and the mind is the charioteer. Pryma is the whip used to control the horses. When the charioteer is controlled using knowledge and indifference, the practice of pryma slowly and gradually brings the horses which are the senses to a standstill. 81 When done properly, it results in good health, speed, enthusiasm, clarity in speech, bodily strength, proper skin condition, calmness and reduction of all issues. 82 Practice of yoga without giving attention to injunctions can result in issues including physical debility, disability, auditory, visual or speech impairment, mental unsoundness, etc. 83 When pryma is performed wrongly, it can result in diseases such as recurrent hiccups, breathing diculties, and other similar issues. 84 Pra is a type of vyu, and when it is not handled properly, it will not function well. Ears, 85 speech and sense organs in general86 are all reliant on vyu. They may cease to work. Other diseases such as kampa (tremor) can also arise. 87 To cure these issues, the yog must eat hot rice gruel mixed with ghee or oil.88 The yog is expected to protect his body in whatever way necessary, since the body is aer all the means to achieve dharma, artha, kma and moka. 89 8. PRATYHRA Aer taking an appropriate sana and performing pryma, the yog must bring into focus his wandering mind. 9 0 Both the senses and mind are brought under the control of the yog.9 1 This step is known as pratyhra. As defined in the Yogastra: When the mind interiorises and the sense follows suit, it is known as pratyhra. (.)Sri Vinay Iyer: Yoga in the Purn .as 3 2 3 3 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020Conquering the mind necessitates conquering rajas and tamas. However, one gua when in excess creates the other two.9 2 Hence, it is impossible to remove them completely. Nonetheless, tamas represents ignorance. The darkness which is tamas covers the clear nature of sattva. For this reason, sattva must keep rajas in check, while both of these must remove tamas as far as possible. A person who brings his indriyas under control will have to control these guas in the manner stated. 9. DHRA AND DHYNA Once the mind has been brought to a single place using pratyhra, it can be made to focus on something. Dhra refers to the fixing of the mind on an object. As stated in the Yogasutr: The fixture of the mind at a certain place is called dhra. (Yogasutr .) When the object on which dhra is done, is retained in the mind of the yog, through practice, whether he is moving or standing or doing some other voluntary act, then the dhra has been perfected 9 3 and that stage is known as dhyna. Yogasutr says: Constant flow of thoughts towards only that is dhyna. (Yogasutr .) The word dhyna refers to the act of thinking. The word dhra on the other hand refers to the act of fixing the object of interest in the mind. Brahma Pura states that pryma and the concentration of mind in pratyhra are also modes of dhyna.The only difference between dhra and dhyna lies in intensity6 in dhyna, the mind moves only towards the object of dhra. This puts dhyna squarely at the root of the practice of yoga. The suggestions made for dhra and dhyna below have been combined, and addressed as dhyna. Dhyna is oen translated as contemplation or meditation. A related idea is that of bhvan explored in the Viu Pura. This is of three types: the first one, brahma-bhvan, bringing the idea of Brahman the second, karma-bhvan, bringing the idea through action and the third, Ubhaya-bhvan, doing both together. Agni Pura lists four things that the yog must remember when performing dhyna which are called the dhynacatuaya (set of four in dhyna): 9 9 . Dhyt: the person performing dhyna . Dhyna: procedure for it and other things to keep in mind . Dhyeya: the object of dhyna . Dhynaprayojana: the purpose of dhyna being moka An ideal performer of dhyna has been ascribed the qualities: jna (knowledge), vairgya (indifference to worldly affairs), raddh (attention or faith), kam (patience), bhakti (devotion), and utsha (enthusiasm). 1 0 0 The object of dhyna varies from pura to pura, with each giving multiple options. Each choice brings a different result. If performed on worldly objects, the results are usually worldly, since dhyna on an object with guas cannot liberate one from them. On the other hand, if dhyna is performed on the formless Brahman or Gods with form without the mind becoming distracted, 1 0 1 it leads to moka.1 0 2 The various objects or techniques of dhyna can be classified into six categories: () worldly use of cakras, () the use of mudrs and (6) using images. 1. NIRGUA DHYNA Since Brahman lacks attributes, meditation on it for beginners is a very dicult task. Brahman is the only one which is permanent and whatever has come from it is destroyed over a course of time in short time or over the eons, including objects that are seen as well as the eyes themselves. Hence, Brahman cannot be seen directly. 1 0 3 It is only possible to realise Brahman when one is fully rid of ahakra, which acts as a barrier between the tman and Brahman, this is not practical for a beginner. 1 0 4 But those in an advanced stage can meditate upon the God of their choice being one and the same as Brahman. This God is formless. In the Dev Bhgavata, this is known as _akti. 1 0 5 In the Garua Pura, it is mentioned that meditation on a formless Viu is the same as Brahman Sri Vinay Iyer: Yoga in the Purn .as 3 4 3 5 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020and the upholder of the world and its creatures,1 0 6 as well as that of the Supreme Brahman that lacks form1 0 7 . Garua Pura a dhyna equating oneself with Brahman (aha brahmsmi).1 0 8 11. W O R L DL Y O BJ E C TS Dhyna on worldly objects can be practised as a subsidiary to the main dhyna or as the main dhyna. If the yog suffers from a disease, he must cure himself. In this situation, meditation on the cure of the problem is said to solve the problem.1 0 9 If the yog experiences diseases in any body part, he must think of that particular body part for the cure of the disease. 0, 1 1 1 For cure of certain mental aictions, 1 1 2 the person can meditate upon the elements that are all-pervading and present in his body. 1 1 3 A yog bothered by hunger, heat or physical attack, must meditate upon the Vru mantra, while imagining the God of his choice being covered in snow or cold water. It will bring him happiness and relief. 1 1 4 Dhyna can also be done on the mantra of Viu. The yog reminds himself of a white lotus which has the same colour as the full moon, and is located on his head. 1 1 5 Similar dhynas on the element ka, half moon, and other objects have also been described in the Agni Pura. 1 1 6 Dhyna can also be performed on different body parts, as suggested in the Dev Bhgavata,1 1 7 Brahma Pura1 1 8 and <rma Pura.1 1 9 Mrkaeya Pura1 2 0 lists a set of places from which the yog can drink air just as the thirsty drink water from pipes or straws, in order to overcome issues. 1 2 1 They are supposed to be done in order. All of these methods are said to lead to moka. In tabular form: Dev torso C hest C hest Neck Neck ThroatSo palate or UvulaMouth E ars Nose Nose Tip of nose Eyes Eyes Between eyebrowsEyebrows Top of head Head HeadMiddle of head Beyond the head Since dhyna on the formless Brahman is dicult, it is suggested to meditate on Brahman with form. 1 2 2 As per Viu Pura, this may be anything in the world (since they are perceivable forms of Viu) including Hirayagarbha, Vsudeva, Rudra, the sun, stars, planets, all the gods and their ancestors, humans, animals, mountains, oceans, rivers, trees, and all living and non-living things. 1 2 3 The entire world is pervaded by Viu hence it is possible to use any object for dhra.1 2 4 Viu exists the least in things without life, a bit more in stationary living things, progressively more in insects, birds, wild animals, domestic animals and humans, in that order. Aer humans, it increases in Ngas, Gandharvas, Yakas, Devas, _akra (Indra), Prajpati and complete in Viu. 1 2 5 :ust as fire fanned by the wind, burns away dry grass, in the same way, Viu sing in the heart of the yog consumes the sins of the yog and enables his mind to be fixated on the Supreme. This state of the mind is the perfect dhra. 1 2 6 The minds of all other people including devas, are altogether impure, since their actions arise out of their own desires. 1 2 7 Dhynas on worldly objects with a wish for worldly gain create the gains but mukti does not result. If done with a sense of non-attachment (towards family, possessions, ones own body, etc.), it leads to mukti. 1 2 8 According to Sri Vinay Iyer: Yoga in the Purn .as 3 4 3 5 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020Agni Pura, proper dhyna with focus on Hari, done for even half of a muhrta (i.e. minutes) can lead to higher levels than those attained by large sacrifices. 1 2 9 12. O M AN D M AN TR AS Various mantras are used in dhyna, just as in pryma. The yog must embed the mantras in his mind using japas and homas. :ust as a jar in a dark room is illuminated with a lamp, the jvtman surrounded by the darkness of my is illuminated with the mantra which is knowledge, and becomes visible to the Paramtman. Yoga is futile without mantra and vice versa. 1 3 0 The sound o is considered equivalent to 5vara and the best mantra.1 3 1 Simple dhyna and japa (chanting) of o is considered good for stabilising the mind. 1 3 2 Chanting may be done for mtrs in length.1 3 3 A person who meditates upon o attains mukti.1 3 4 The gyatri mantra can also be used. The use of other mantras can be found in texts. One of the mantras that are recommended in the Dev Bhgavata is ai chanted twice (the seed mantra of Dev). 1 3 5 The story of Satyavrata, an illiterate who became the best of poets using this, is also described. 1 3 6 13. CAKRAS AND KUALIN5 A system of dhyna that relies on kualin and cakras is described in the Dev Bhgavata. N are pathways in the body and number ,0,00,000, as per the Dev Bhgavata. Three are the most important, namely suumn, i and pigal. 1 3 7 These have the nature of fire, the moon and the sun, and located in the centre, to the le, and to the right of the spinal cord, respectively. 1 3 8 The innermost portions of suumn1 3 9 at its base (between the anus and genitals) have a specific region where a type of fire known as kualin resides. <ualin is associated with _akti or thought of as a serpent. 1 4 0 It is surrounded by an area termed as the mldhra. This area and ones like this are termed as a cakras and the spinal cord is dotted with these areas. Each cakra is pictured as a lotus with petals, with a colour and number of petals associated. The description and relevance of each cakra, along with these details has been presented as a table. All except bindusthna are called dhra cakras and rely on the muldhra. Using the praka pryma, the yog concentrates upon the mldhra and contracts and arouses the kualin, as he breathes in. <ualin moves upwards along the suumn piercing through each cakra, until it reaches the sahasrra. There, one must meditate upon the united _iva and _akti. The yogi then brings _akti back down to mldhra. When the yog practises this daily, he breaks free from the bonds of sasra and attains moka. 1 4 1 Cara Location C olourN o. of petalsDescription an reevance Mldhra Between anus and genitalsGolden 4 Base of all cakras.

MUDRS One effective method for dhra and dhyna that is explored in detail in Brahma Pura is the use of mudrs. Mudrs are various hand gestures which, in the context of yoga, are a kind of dhra. These are also meant to please Dev, 1 4 2 and used in worship of Dev.1 4 3 That which helps the tman, bound in the body, realise that it is not separate from the larger Brahman is mudr. 1 4 4 Therefore, these mudrs bring mukti. The practice of mudrs can also be found in Hahayoga, as part of the twelve steps of Hahayoga. 1 4 5 T here are ten The first mudr discussed is the mahmudr, also known as vhan, vypik or trikha. This mudr is performed by joining and holding both the little fingers upwards, holding the ring finger of the right hand on that of the le hand and hold them with the pointing fingers, joining the middle fingers and the thumbs pointing upwards and little fingers pointing downwards. 1 4 7 This mudr is praised across many books as one which frees a person from diseases.1 4 8 A version of this mudr uses the entire body.1 4 9 . In sakobhi mudr, the middle fingers of both hands are held in the centre. The pointing fingers are held like a stick (straight). The remaining fingers are held closely together. 1 50 . The third mudr is called vidrvi or drvi. The pointing (tarjani) and middle (madhyama) fingers of both hands must be pointed and the remaining fingers must be held closely together, just as in the sakobhi mudr. 1 51 . For the kari mudr, the middle fingers of both hands must be pointing outwards and the remaining fingers must be held holding closely together, so as to make a hook-like shape. 1 52 . For the vaakar, also called veakar, mudr, the fingers of both the hands must be closed together and interlocked. 6. Unmdin is gestured by joining and holding the thumb, the pointing finger, middle finger and the lit-tle fingers of both hands facing up and pointing the ring fingers together. The folded fingers will be in the shape of hook. 1 53 . The mahku mudr is achieved by joining and holding the thumbs, middle fingers and the little fin-gers of both hands facing up and bending the ring fingers and the pointing fingers in the shape of a hook. 1 54 . <hecar mudr is one of the major mudrs.1 55 It is praised as being the best among all mudrs1 56 and one that releases a person from both diseases and worldly bonds. 1 57 The yog must entwine his right hand over his le hand and holding these hands sky ward. Then he must perform the yonimudr (described below) while keeping the hands in that position. 1 58 In another version, the tongue is moved in a peculiar way inside the head.1 59 . For bjamudr, the fingers must be bent in the shape of a half moon. The fingertips of both hands must touch each other so that the shape looks like a circle. The bjamudr brings its user various siddhis as well as moka. 1 60 0. For yonimudr (pratham), the middle fingers must be bent and placed over the pointing fingers. The ring fingers are placed in the middle with the right one placed over the le. They must also be with the pointing fingers. The little fingers are placed above all the others pointing slightly downwards. The thumb is placed over all other fingers. 1 61 Agni Pura gives a different set of mudrs used for general yoga as well as worship of Varha, incarnation of Viu. A total of mudrs are used. Three of these are sdhraa which bring the yog closer to the object of dhyna: ajali (namaskra posture), vandan (on the heart) and a third one where the le hand is folded as a fist and the thumbs are upwards and interlocked. The remaining are asdhraa, and performed in order and accompanied with bjas (syllables with significance in tantra). The hands are interlocked and each finger is separated until only the thumbs remain interlocked. The ninth one involves raising the hand to the face, bending the le hand and then opening it. 1 62 15 . IM AG E R Y The puras are replete with legends and stories of various Gods. All of them can be in fact used for dhyna. Sri Vinay Iyer: Yoga in the Purn .as 3 6 3 7 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020However, certain images are specifically mentioned for this purpose. One image that is common across many puras with some variation is that of a white lotus with eight petals. This is described first. There are four puras that describe the dhyna on the lotus in detail. These are the <rma Pura, Agni Pura, Bhgavata Pura and Garua Pura. The have been designated in the following manner: <rma (), 1 63 <rma (),1 64 Agni (),1 65 Agni (),1 66 Agni (),1 67 Bhgavata,1 68 Garua () and Garua ().1 69 Each aspect of the eight-petalled lotus is representative. Oen the lotus was drooping until the yog meditates on it it then blooms and opens. A comparative table presents the different representations of the lotus seen across puras. The centre of the lotus is depicted to contain various things. This has been given as a list under the table. In the table, a represents agula, an Indian unit of length, aaivarya is a set of eight siddhis attained at samdhi (see section on siddhis below). Blank entries denote unsaid aspects. The descriptions of objects in the centre are given below: . <rma (): On the centre, there is a golden koa (vessel) that is composed of all powers and which is considered as divine and permanent. The sound o is another name for it. It is not discernible and cov-ered by a net of rays of light. The yog must meditate on the faultless parajyoti (Brahman) as being pres-ent there. One places ones own tman (self) into this light considering the two to be the same. . <rma (): At the centre of the lotus, he must think of purua, in the form of a fire. Brahman is located in the middle of this in the form of ka and light, and is understood using the sound o. It is the highest tattva, singular, permanent and bestows wellbeing. . Agni (): Prakti must be thought of to be the centre of a lotus. Three circles which represent tamas, rajas and sattva in that order are drawn around it in the colour of black, red and white respectively. On top of the centre, is Viu himself representing the tman. The entire image is very clean. Optionally, the Viu can be pictured inside a net of light. 1 70 . Agni (): Above circles of tamas, rajas and sattva is a clean and steady lamp flame, one thumb width in height. It is in a spherical shape similar to the kadamba flower (N eolamarck ia cadamb a ) or like a star. This flame represents the sound o which in turn represents vara. . Agni () and Bhgavata: The lotus is located at the heart. In the middle of the lotus, there are three cir-cles one over the other in order: the sun, the moon and fire. Viu is situated at the middle of the circle of fire. 6. Garua (): Prakti must be thought of to be at the centre of the lotus. Three circles which repre-sent tamas, rajas and sattva in that order are drawn around it in the colour of black, red and white respectively. On top of the centre, is Viu himself representing the tman. Apart from the lotus, the yog may meditate upon the form of a God of his choice. Viu is described in the Agni Pura, Bhgavata, Viu Pura and Garua Pura. describe _iva but mentions a dhyna done on the form of _iva.

Male Gods are usually directly equated with purua or Brahman. However, female Gods who are always taken together as a single Dev may be equated with Brahman or with prakti. The connection of prakti with Dev is stated in the Dev Bhgavata. 1 7 The forms are given in a table: Meditation on part of the form is also described in these books. In case of Dev, the devotee might meditate on different parts of the form of Dev such as hands, feet, etc. He conquers each of these places in the process and the heart of the yog is purified. He then fixes the purified heart on the complete form of Dev, elaborated above. This is called avayava yoga. 1 72 In the Bhgavata, Pura Description Forms of Viu Agni Pura He has four arms carrying the akha (conch, Pcajanya), cakra (discus, Sudarana), Gad (mace) and a lotus. 1 0 He can be imagined to be white or golden in colour. He has the rvatsa mark on his chest. He wears a yellow cloth, golden necklaces, the kaustubha jewel, the vanamla (divine garland), shining earrings in the shape of a crocodile (makara), and a crown full of jewels. 1 1 Instead of four arms, Viu can also be pictured with eight arms. He would then additionally carry his bow (rga), a rosary (akavalaya), a noose (pa), and a hook (akua). 1 2 Viu may also be pictured without any ornaments. 1 3 Bhgavata Viu is calm, tranquil and beautiful. He has four long well-formed arms. He has a beautiful neck. He has shining and clean cheeks, with a beautiful smile. His ears are proportional with crocodile- shaped earrings on each ear. His eyes radiate peace and joy. He wears a gold-coloured cloth and he looks dark like the rain-cloud. He has a mark of rvatsa on his chest where _r resides. His four hands hold the conch (ankha), the discus (cakra), the mace (gad) and a lotus. He wears a shining crown, wristlets, girdle and armlets. He wears a garland known as vanaml and a gem known as kaustubha. He has anklets on his feet. His form is beautiful and bewitching in every way. 1 4 Garua PuraTwo types of dhyna forms are stated. () The Vivarpa form once the yog understands this form, he is liberated. 1 5 (as stated in the Puruaskta, Bhagavadgt, etc.) () Viu standing on a lotus (this need not have eight petals). This can be combined with chanting of o. 1 6 Viu PuraTwo types of dhyna are mentioned Vivarpa and the form of Viu. () The form of Vivarpa - 1 7 a yog who meditates upon this form is freed from sin and becomes purified. 1 8 () The form of Viu it is said that only a mind fit to grasp and retain this idea will be able to retain and meditate upon it. 1 9 The yog must contemplate on Viu, who has a pleasing and attractive expression. His eyes are like the petals of the lotus. He has smooth cheeks, and a broad and shining forehead. His ears are equal in size and decorated with shining adornments. His neck is smeared. He has a broad chest with the Srivatsa mark. His belly has graceful folds, with a deep navel. He can be thought of as having eight or four long arms. He has firm and well-formed thighs and legs, with beautiful feet and toes. He wears a yellow robe, a crown (kira), a garland (hra), and lustrous armlets and bracelets on his arms with other ornaments. He has in his hands the bow (rga), the conch (akha), the mace (gad), the sword (khaga), the discus (cakra), and the rosary (akavalaya). He shows his hands in the varada and abhaya mudrs 2 0 Forms of _iva commencing dhyna, the yog makes all his tattvas pure using the praava (the sound o.) 2 1 He must then meditate on _iva being present in ka. _iva is the root cause of the whole world and is all-pervading. 2 2 He firmly establishes his mind in _iva, who is the tman and Brahman. He submerges his body into this ocean of knowledge. 2 3 He may optionally apply some bhasma (ashes) prepared from the agnihotra sacrifice, which represent _iva. He puts these ashes over his body while chanting the mantra that begins agni He meditates upon the _iva who is present within himself. 2 4Sri Vinay Iyer: Yoga in the Purn .as 3 8 3 9 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020the yog first fixes his mind on the entire form of Viu. He then must focus on any one limb or part, ideally Vius smiling face. When the mind is fixed there, there is no need to think of the rest of the form. This dhyna leads to mukti. 1 73 The transition from sagua to nirgua is stated in the Viu Pura, with reference to the form of Viu. First the yog can meditate upon the above form, then that of a calm Viu with only the rosary in his hands. When this form is well entrenched, 1 74 the yog meditates upon the form of Viu without any ornaments.1 75 In the last step, Viu is meditated upon as a single whole. 1 76 15 . PR O G R E SS The indication that a person has successfully reached the higher stages of dhyna is when only similar thoughts to the one of interest arise in the mind of the yog and other thoughts do not arise. 1 77 On a physical level, as per Mrkaeya Pura: () reduced movement, () and () soness in speech. 1 78 A person is considered siddha (perfect in yoga) when: () people view the yog with affection, () people praise him in his absence and () creatures are not afraid of him. 1 79 A person has reached the highest level of yoga when he is not affected by extreme cold or heat and he does not fear anyone else. 1 80 A quantitative approach to progress is provided in several puras in the following manner: prymas make one dhra. dhras make one dhyna and dhynas make one samdhi. 81 A parallel system in Mrkaeya Pura is: prymas make a dhra. Two dhras make one yoga. 1 82 A common issue is that of exhaustion (mental and physical). For this, Agni Pura states that a person can intersperse dhyna with japa or simply think of Viu. Viu will quickly be pleased with one who is engaged in japa, dhyna and other activities. 1 83 It is important to keep in mind that when the yog reveals the actions that he performs to others, it causes surprise in people and pride in him. This causes his knowledge to disappear. He should thus keep his actions secret. 1 84 16 . SIDDH IS AN D U PASAR G AS Siddhis are superhuman capacities obtained over the course of yoga. Upasargas are the term used to denote disturbances in the path of yoga. Siddhis are a subset of upasargas, since siddhis cause temptation in the mind of the yog and he is bound again in worldly activities. Upasargas are dealt with in various books. On the whole, there are two kinds of siddhis, those that pertain to the world and those that arise from Brahman. 1 85 The latter are eight in number. The former is described first:Forms of Dev Dev BhgavataIn Dev Bhgavata, the form suggested is that of Dev. She is peaceful and easily worshipped. She is an ocean of mercy and fulfils all the desires of her devotees the mere utterance of her name is sucient. 2 5 The singular prakti is viewed in five forms: Durg, >akm, Sarasva, Svitr and Rdh. 2 6 Durg (referred to as my) destroys all the pains and sorrows and gives devotees happiness and liberation. 2 7 >akm is the presiding deity of wealth and prosperity and resides in all grains, vegetables and plant life. Her nature is that of pure sattva. She is peaceful and all auspicious. The beauty, glory, fame, prowess and wealth seen in people mark her presence. 2 8 Sarasva is the presiding deity of knowledge, speech, intelligence and learning. She removes all doubts and diculties in the minds of devotees and facilitates the understanding of books, helps every being earn livelihood. She is peaceful and holds the v and books in her hands. She has pure sattva and is modest. Her colour is white. 2 9 Svitr is the origin of the Vedas, Vedgas, the sandhyvandana ritual, the tantras, being well-versed in all of them herself. She is tapas (penance) and japa. She is so pure that even the rthas (places of pilgrimage) want her touch for purification. Her colour is white. She has pure sattva and she is in the nature of paramnanda and the bestower of moka. 3 0 Rdh is the presiding deity of the five vyus, consort to _r <a. She is Brahman herself. She transcends the three guas and is formless. She is the soul of all and devoid of ahakra. 3 1 These are the five Prakti Devs. There are more forms that arise from them such as Gag, who destroys all ppa (sins), 3 2 or Tulas, by whose grace austerities are performed. 3 3 Sri Vinay Iyer: Yoga in the Purn .as 4 0 4 1 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020Upasargas in the Brahma Pura are Adbuta superhuman faculties for smell, taste, sight, hearing and touch (such as ability to hear minute sounds from great distances, etc.), () _toa ability to bear heat and cold, (6) Mrutkti taking up any form of choice just like the wind, () Pratibh superhuman creativity and () Status of superhuman beings, i.e. attaining the position of Nagas, Pits, Devas such as Candra (the Moon), etc. 1 86 The Agni Pura provides another viewpoint to siddhis: The yog is able to see or hear things not otherwise perceivable. Devas pray to him and give him various divine objects of enjoyment. <ings give him land and the wealthy give him money. He understands the meaning of the Vedas and all other stras. All kinds of divine medicines and rasyanas 1 87 come within his reach. He acquires mastery over all arts.1 88 In the Bhgavata, siddhis are eighteen in number. Out of these, eight arise from Brahman and the remaining ten arise from the three guas. 1 89 The siddhis from guas are: () Anrmimattva freedom from hunger and () Draravaadarana seeing and hearing from afar, () Manojava travelling as fast as one wishes, () <marpa assuming any form one wishes, () Parakyapraveana entering anothers body, (6) Svacchandamtyu dying only at () Devasahakrnudarana seeing the sports of devas, () Yathsakalpasasiddhi one desires, () jpratihatgati unobstructed movement, (0) Triklajatva knowledge of past, present and future. 1 9 0 Dhra done on selected objects is capable of producing the above siddhis or those that arise from Brahman as well as lesser siddhis. 1 9 1 In the Mrkaeya Pura, upasargas occur in two levels. In the first level, the yog might wish for worldly objects, rites with future benefit or position of devas.1 9 2 The yog must restrain himself from these thoughts and always bring his mind back towards Brahman.1 9 3 Once these are conquered, these, five more upasargas arise out of sattva, rajas and tamas:1 9 4 . Prtibha: Appearance of knowledge of Vedas, litera- ture, arts and every other subject1 9 5 . _rvaa: Understanding of all words and their mean- ings, as well as hearing of noises from thousands of yojanas away 1 9 6 . Daiva: Ability to see in all eight directions (the cardi- nal and ordinal directions) like devas1 9 7. Bhrama: The mind of the yog no longer stays in a sin- gle place and roams about. The yog loses basic sense of living and etiquette. 1 9 8 . varta: When the mind of the person is agitated because knowledge like a whirlpool engulfs the mind 1 9 9 These upasargas destroy the yoga practice of the yog and he is born again and again as a deva.2 0 0 Hence, it is imperative that the yog cover himself with a mental white blanket and focus himself on the supreme Brahman.2 0 1 The final siddhis that indicate perfect dhyna are called aaivarya eight-fold wealth as they are eight in number. These arise from Brahman. A person who has these can get whatever he wishes.2 0 2 These are:2 0 3 . Aim: than the >aghim: Becoming respected and worship-worthy to Prpti: Ability to get anything . Prkmya: Become all-pervading6. 5itva: others . <mvasyitva: Stationing oneself wherever one wishes A person with any of these siddhis is tempted to engage once again in the world. He becomes bound to the world made of guas and forgets his original goal. Thus all progress made in yoga is lost. Therefore, if a person is serious about moka, it is imperative to give up on siddhis and retain the dhyna he started with in order to get moka. 2 0 5 17. SAMDHI A yog who has advanced to a higher state of dhyna, attains the last state, which is samdhi. The definition in Yogastra: Dhyna on an object where the objects form is no longer discernible, as though it no longer has a form, is samdhi. (Yogasutr .) During the later stages of dhyna, the yog is expected to progress from a dhyna on something that has form to a formless dhyna. When this transition is complete, the yog is said to have attained samdhi. Only the Sri Vinay Iyer: Yoga in the Purn .as 4 0 4 1 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020tman appears to the yog and the mind is completely stationary,2 0 5 like a lamp in a windless room.2 0 6 These thoughts are echoed in the Bhagavadgt (6.): The mind of a yog who is absorbed in the Brahman stays still just as a lamp in a windless place does not flicker. That is the example stated. Mrkaeya Pura provides four indications which show that the yog has attained samdhi. These are: 2 0 7 . Dhvasti: Removal of mind from the results of good or bad actions2 0 8 . Prpti: Removal of greed for objects in this world and the next, as well as the desires that create confusion2 0 9 . Savit: The knowledge of the past and future is alike (and irrelevant) to the yog and he also con- siders the effects of the sun, moon, planets and stars to be alike.2 1 0 . Prasda: State where the mind, five vyus, the senses and the elements are all in a state of calm-ness 2 1 1 The yog can neither hear, nor smell, nor see. He does not recognise touch. He does not wish to do anything nor does he wish for anything. He appears to not recognise anything like a block of wood. 2 1 2 When his mind is completely stationary, the knowledge required to liberate him comes to him, and he is liberated. 2 1 3 18 . C O N C L U SIO N From the above discussions, it can be seen that the puras provide a more-or-less complete viewpoint of the different aspects of yoga. The philosophical aspects of yoga are generally drawn from the philosophy of Skhya, which is also the philosophical basis for Yoga. Dev Bhgavata and Agni Pura, have significant elements of Vednta. Each pura, with certain exceptions, provides at least basic definitions for each of the eight steps of yoga. Yama and niyama are the steps which might be found to be omitted. Different approaches to these are observed in the puras. The puras also specify what places are conducive to the practice of yoga. None of the puras explore sanas in much detail. In general, at the most three sanas are found, usually padmsana, svastiksana and bhadrsana. The picture of pryma is uniform across puras. Since puras tend to have a specific deity of focus, dhra and dhyna tend to vary. All of them acknowledge the nirgua Brahman. The dhyna of a lotus with eight petals is common among puras that focus on Viu. The idea of cakras and kualin is mainly found in the Dev Bhgavata. The use of mudrs is only found in Brahma Pura and Agni Pura. The method of Brahma Pura is found across several texts on yoga. This is not the case with the method of Agni Pura. Out of all the steps, the focus of Brahma Pura is clearly on mudrs. Image of each deity is taken up in the puras that prioritise those deities. The form of Viu is described in detail across books. In the mahpuras, _iva is not described in comparable detail. Dev is not described physically however, the roles of different aspects of Dev have been clearly stated in the Dev Bhgavata. Bhgavata Pura focusses on dhyna. The description of progress and upasargas is most clear in the Mrkaeya Pura, where indications for progress and the kinds of upasargas are stated in detail. Bhgavata also provides a clear classification in terms of upasargas. The description of samdhi is common in all puras. Each fleshes out the same description with a variety of lively examples, so as to convey the point. From this, it can be seen that puras, when taken together, provide a complete viewpoint of the subject of yoga.

INTRODUCTION The ancient Indian civilization has made singular contributions in the areas of Astronomy, Phonetics, Grammar, Mathematics, Medicine (Ayurveda), Yoga etc. Nadi, in the context of Ayurveda, refers to certain characteristic movement felt over the radial artery near the wrist, in a manner very similar to feeling the wrist pulse. Three specific sites on the radial artery are chosen for feeling the nadi. The three sites are referred to as Vata, Pitta and <apha or Sleshma sites. Index, middle and ring fingers are placed over the Vata, Pitta and <apha sites, respectively. Nadi vijnana, though considered as a branch of Ayurveda, plays a significant role also in Yoga. Nadi vijnana refers to the art of feeling the nadi and interpreting the associated attributes in terms of physical, mental and spiritual (adhi-bhautika, adhi-daivika and adhyatmika) planes of life. A well trained physician can make an accurate diagnosis based on nadi parik sha (examination) alone without even inquiring a patient about the symptoms. In recent times, nadi vijnana has attracted a wide attention. There are many classical and contemporary books as well as review articles with an emphasis on medical diagnosis. Only a few select references are mentioned here (>ad, , >ad, 006, Mahesh et al 00 Dattatraya et al, 0 <umar et al, 0a). References to the original classical works and other secondary sources on nadi can be obtained from these select references. The scope of nadi vijnana extends beyond medical diagnosis Sriranga Mahaguru, and . According to Sriranga Mahaguru, every input, such as food or sensory, to a human system, produces distinct changes in the attributes ABSTRACT Nadi is the subjectively felt movement experienced by the /f_ingertips or /f_ingerpads of the three /f_ingers, index, middle and ring, placed at three speci/f_ic sites near the wrist curled over the radial artery. The perceived movements are characterised by certain attributes of which 'gati' happens to be the most important attribute. Nadi vijnana is the art of feeling nadi and interpreting its attributes in terms of physical, mental and spiritual aspects of life. Attempts have been made to develop electronic instruments to capture attributes of nadi, principally, the nadi gati. The motivation is to replace the subjectivity associated with the feeling of nadi and its interpretation. A brief review of the instruments is presented. It is argued that the instruments, as of date, merely record the wrist pulse (allopathic pulse) at three sites and that these instruments don't capture the nadi gati or associated attributes in the traditional sense. The author's conjecture is that some of the attributes may arise due to an interaction between certain characteristic subtle vibrations inherently present in the /f_ingerpads and the cyclic pulsatile blood /f_low through the radial artery. If such a conjecture is true, any attempt to capture nadi gati by replacing /f_ingertip or /f_ingerpad by pulse diagnosisDr T V Ananthapadmanabha: A Critical Review of Instrumentation for Recording Nadi 4 9 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020of nadi. This forms the basis for the subject matter of dravya-guna, the basis of Ayurvedic pharmacology. There is an intimate relationship between Ayurveda and Yoga as exemplified in a prayer offering salutations to Patanjali Maharshi wherein he is described as a proponent of Yoga, Ayurveda and Sanskrit Grammar. The term Ayu: in Ayurveda signifies prana, a central concept in yoga. The term nadi in the context of Yoga refers to a nervous path along which prana is flowing through at any given moment (<hedikar and Mukund, 06). According to Sriranga Mahaguru, knowledge of nadi vijnana has been used in the evolution of yoga practices (asanas, pranayamaa, meditation etc) as well as in the shaping of various traditional customs and rituals of the ancient India (sanatana Bharatiya dharma) Chamu, , Chamu is an element of subjectivity involved in the feeling of nadi and in the interpretation of nadi gati. In order to develop an expertise in this area, a keen tactile skill and long duration practice are required. Trained experts as per tradition are rare to be found. There exists different schools of practice. It is a time consuming process to transfer the subjective traditional knowledge from one generation to the next via personal interaction. In this context, the need for objective instrumentation is well recognized. Inspired by tradition, pulse signal is recorded, at three sites as recognized by tradition, using sensors and associated instrumentation. Automatic classification algorithms are applied on the features extracted from recorded pulse signals for a differential diagnosis. Some parameters extracted from the recorded signal are assumed to represent the traditional attributes of nadi. An attempt is made in this paper to critically review the available instrumentation for recording nadi from the authors perspective. The paper begins with a very short introduction to the subjective approach being practiced for feeling nadi. Such a background is essential to evaluate the performance of instruments developed for recording nadi. Some available instruments are reviewed. According to the author, a rigorous scientific validation of the instruments vis-a-vis traditional knowledge seems to be lacking. There is no clear answer to a question such as under a given experimental situation, do these instruments detect changes that are well correlated to the changes predicted by traditional experts The author concludes that the present day instruments merely record the conventional wrist pulse at one or more sites and that the recorded signals dont capture the attributes of nadi as per tradition. An instrument to record nadi gati in the traditional sense is yet to emerge. 2. ABOUT NADI 2.1 The Origin of Wrist Pulse Human heart pumps blood, in bursts, cyclically throughout the body. Oxygenated (pure) blood is pumped into aorta by the contraction of le ventricle of the heart. The aorta expands (dilates, increases in diameter) to accommodate the extra blood. The diameter at the entrance of aorta returns to its normal value aer le ventricle completes its function of pumping of blood. This cyclic expansion and contraction at the entrance of aorta propagates along the arterial wall as a pressure wave (>evick, , p.0 Milner, 0, Ch. 6). A consequence of this is the repetitive pulse felt on the radial artery near the wrist. This wrist pulse is felt by placing one or more fingers superficially curled over the radial artery just below the wrist. The velocity of propagation of the arterial pulse is in the range of 00 to 000 cmsec. Blood itself moves away from the heart along the arteries at a much lower velocity of about 0 cmsec. 2.2 Pulse and Nadi: Commonalities and Dierences In the contemporary literature, nadi and pulse are used almost interchangeably and nadi pariksha is oen translated as pulse diagnosis. We emphasize that the perceived subjective feeling associated with nadi gati and pulse are entirely different. We prefer not to translate nadi as pulse since it would be like translating a proper name. By feeling wrist pulse, an Allopathic medical practitioner infers the number of heart beats per minute and the strength of the pulse (strong or feeble). On the other hand, the subjective feeling associated with nadi is described by attributes that are very distinct from those associated with a pulse. Of the various attributes, gati is the most important attribute that is related to the apparent movement felt under the fingerpad. The relative dominance at the three sites with respect to gati is referred to by the term, dosha. Thus, the terms Vata dosha, Pitta dosha and <apha dosha are used in practice. Other attributes >ad 006 are vega (rate or speed), tala (rhythm), bala (force), akruti (tensionvolume), tapamana (heat) and kathinya (stiffness) etc. Most persons are familiar on how to feel the wrist pulse as in modern Allopathic system. Nadi is felt in a very similar manner. Though, both pulse and nadi gati Dr T V Ananthapadmanabha: A Critical Review of Instrumentation for Recording Nadi 4 9 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020are felt by the fingers placed over radial artery, yet the two subjective experiences are distinctly different. How come that one and the same underlying phenomenon gives rise to two different perceptual experiences in the tactile mode The differences arising in the two subjective experiences of pulse and nadi can be appreciated by an analogy to the concept of figure and ground in visual perception. Readers may be familiar with a visual experience where one and the same image appears as either two faces in profile or as a vase in the middle. If readers are not familiar with such an image, they can find such images on the web (See Rubin Vase. in Wikipedia). Such a shi in the visual experience occurs because of a shi in figure and ground. In this context, a familiar experience with respect to the relative movement may be recalled. All movements are relative. If A moves with respect to B, we can say that B is moving relative to A. When a person seated in a stationary train at a railway station looks through the window at an adjacent moving train, that person feels as though the train in which heshe is seated itself is moving whereas if the person looks through the opposite window towards the railway station, the person feels no movement. Such a difference in experience can be attributed to a shi of ground or the reference. 2.2.1 Fingertip or Fingerpad to feel Nadi? In the context of feeling nadi, in the literature, both the terms fingertip and fingerpad have been used. Fingertip refers to the semi-circular fleshy part just below the tip of the nail. Fingerpad is the inner fleshy part covering the topmost (distal) phalynx or phalange. Fingertip is used in the simultaneous approach and fingerpad is used in the sequential approach of feeling nadi (See Sec. II. D. below).. It has been reported that there is a sophisticated somato-sensory system (Ch., Purves et al, 00) underneath the fingerpad. Experimentally it has been shown that the cutaneous mechanoreceptors in the fingerpad can capture information accurately about the shape of contact object, contact force and the rate of change of shape (Srinivasan and >aMotte, Goodwin et al, ). Such neuro-sensory systems may be playing a big role in the tactile perception of nadi gati. 2.2.2 Feeling the Distinction Between Pulse and Nadi: F eeling the pulse: Although feeling of a wrist pulse is a very common experience, we elaborate it as a preliminary to appreciate the feeling of nadi. Place the fingerpad of index finger over the Vata-site That is, what you consider to be the best guess of Vata-site (See Sec. II. C below). Ensure that other fingers are not making contact with the radial artery. >et the radial artery be considered as the ground (background or stationary). Imagine the fingerpad as the figure. That is, mainly focus on the pressure exerted by the pulse on the fingerpad. A repetitive pulse (conventional allopathic wrist pulse) is felt. On closer introspection, it may be noted that a small lateral movement is felt due to the impact (or force) exerted by the pulse on the finger. There are three sub-intervals within each cycle with respect to the perceived movement: a pause (no movement), abrupt beginning of a movement, abrupt ending of a movement. Three main factors may be associated with respect to the experienced movement: (a) the beginning (denote as B) and the ending (denote as E) spatial locations. The spatial locations may be remembered relative to the mid-point of the fingertip. (b) the direction of movement from B to E and (c) the speed of movement from B to E. There are a few additional factors: The beginning and ending of the pulse may be felt as abrupt or gradual The force of the impact is yet another factor. In the case of a wrist pulse (with radial artery as ground or stationary), locations B and E as well as the speed of movement are perceived to be the same from cycle-to-cycle. Since the locations B and E remain the same from cycle to cycle, the direction of movement experienced also remains the same from cycle to cycle. Usually, this direction of movement is lateral, sideways, i.e., perpendicular to the axis of radial artery. F eeling the N adi: In order to feel the nadi at Vata- site, let the fingerpad of index finger remain at the same site as used above for feeling the wrist pulse. This is a case of sequential approach (See Sec. II. D. below.) In order to feel the nadi, consider the fingerpad as the ground or stationary. That is, pay less attention to the fingerpad of index finger. Treat radial artery as the figure or the moving part. Mainly focus on the relative apparent movement of the radial artery within and around the fingerpad (i.e., experience the movement of pulse in the radial artery). With this shi in focus, identify the beginning and ending locations. The beginning location (B) of apparent movement for successive cycles seems to shi spatially within the fingerpad of index finger. Similarly, the ending location of apparent movement for successive cycles seems to shi Dr T V Ananthapadmanabha: A Critical Review of Instrumentation for Recording Nadi 0 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020spatially within the fingerpad. This is unlike the feeling of pulse described above where the beginning and ending locations remain the same for successive cycles. Since the finger placement has not been changed, the change in experience has arisen only due to a shi in the focus (attention) and the selection of ground or reference. Such an experiment may be repeated with the middle finger placed over the Pitta site and ring finger placed over the sleshma or <apha site. Distinction in the nadi movement at the three sites may be noted. 2.3 The Three Sites: Vata, Pitta and Kapha or Sleshma Nadi is felt over the radial artery at three specific sites called Vata, Pitta and <apha or Sleshma. Anatomically, it may be noted that the radial artery stretches in the forearm from elbow to wrist Grays Anatomy. The radial artery usually lies about mid-way along the lateral outer-half (thumb side) of the forearm (right-half of right forearm and le-half of le forearm). However, the actual course of radial artery in the forearm may differ from one individual to another. By searching for the location where the pulse is felt maximally, the course of radial artery and the location of the three sites may be found. Three fingers, index, middle and ring are used to feel the nadi at the three sites. The order of placement of these three fingers is such that the examiners thumb is towards the thumb of the Subject (or ones own thumb in case of self-examination). Fingers are curled over the radial artery. Vata site is about one finger width below the root of the wrist on the radial artery (radial tubercle). The fingerpad of index finger is used to feel Vata gati. Pitta site is slightly below the lower edge of the index finger. Middle finger is used to feel the Pitta gati. <apha or Sleshma site is slightly below the lower edge of the middle finger. Ring finger is used to feel the <apha or Sleshma gati. Finer adjustments in the placement of fingers are made such that strong cyclic pulses are felt at each site. Chinese and Tibetan system also follow a similar approach of feeling nadi at three sites, which are referred to as Cun, Guan and Chi. The author leaves it to the historians to decide on the precedence of the origin of these different systems. 2.4 Simultaneous and Sequential Approaches for Feeling Nadi Because of the subjective nature in feeling nadi and its interpretation, training is invariably through a personal interaction with a teacher. There are different schools of practice. Despite diverse types of practice, there are some common grounds such as the choice of index, middle and ring fingers, correct order for the placement of these fingers, choice of right hand (or le hand) for a male (or female) Subject the choice of three sites on the radial artery, the list of attributes associated with nadi etc. There are two broad approaches >ad, 006 for feeling nadi. In the sim ultaneous approach all three fingers (index, middle and ring) make contact with the radial artery. The tightness of the contact varies depending on the so called >evel as described below. Here, fingertips play a major role. This is recommended to ascertain subtle qualities of Vata, Pitta and <apha doshas. In the seuentia approach , only one finger is used at a time and the finger makes a gentle contact with the radial artery. Here, fingerpad plays a major role. The sequential approach is said to be useful for ascertaining gross qualities of the doshas. In traditional literature nadi gati is compared to the movement of animals like that of snake, leech, frog, swan etc. To feel such characteristic movements or complex patterns of nadi gati only one finger at a time has to be used. The details of only the simultaneous approach are presented below. Details of sim ultaneous approach : The authors training is based on sequential approach. Yet, the author attempts to give a description of simultaneous approach >ad 006 as understood by him and this is subject to correction. In the simultaneous approach of monitoring the gati, the point of im pact of pulse (or the throb) felt on the fingertip is noted. If the point of impact of the pulse occurs near the bottom edge of a fingertip of any one of the three fingers, it is referred to as <apha Spike, denoted by <. As an example, for a given cycle, if the impact is felt near the bottom edge of the index finger placed over the Vata site, it is still considered as a <apha Spike. If the point of impact is near the mid-line of a fingertip it is referred to as Pitta Spike denoted by P. If the point of impact is near the upper edge of a fingertip it is referred to as Vata Spike, denoted by V. Sometimes, the point of contact may be felt in- between the bottom edge and the mid-line (or the upper edge and the mid-line) giving rise to an ambiguity. That is, whether the contact is to be considered as a Pitta Spike or <apha Spike (or Vata Spike). In such cases of ambiguity, the quality of contact is to be considered. A pointed strong contact corresponds to Pitta Spike, Feeble rapidly changing wavy contact (higher spatial frequency Dr T V Ananthapadmanabha: A Critical Review of Instrumentation for Recording Nadi 0 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020or shorter wavelength) corresponds to Vata Spike. Deep, slowly changing wavy contact (lower spatial frequency or longer wavelength) corresponds to <apha Strike. Yuantication of he oshas : The following procedure is followed to determine the relative proportion of doshas. >et us say that nadi is felt for one minute. The number of times Vata Spike occurs is counted. Similarly, the number of times Pitta and <apha Spikes occur are counted. It may be dicult to keep track of the count of the heart rate as well as all the three types of spikes within the same one minute interval. Hence, heart rate, Vata, Pitta and <apha Spikes may be counted during consecutive one minute or 0 second intervals.. To simplify the above task, todays technology of audio recording can be used. For each cycle, the sound V or P or < may be recorded. This could be done for about one minute. >ater the audio recording may be played and the number of spikes of each category as well as the heart rate may be deduced. If the heart rate is rapid, then only one Spike may be monitored at a time. T he reative dominance of doshas is quantified by assigning numbers to , where represents decreased or depleted dosha and represents excess dosha, represents balanced dosha and represents an intermediate quantity of dosha, i.e., in-between decreased and balanced doshas. Experts can estimate up to a fraction of one-half. >et the heart rate be per minute. If the number of V, P and < Spikes are each ( of ), then all three doshas are balanced or equal in proportion. Such a balanced proportion is represented by VP<. As another example, if the number of V, P and < Spikes, respectively, are (far less than of ), (closer to of ) and (much greater than of ), then the dosha is denoted as VP<. This Pitta dosha and excess <apha dosha. A count in the range of to for a heart rate of may be represented by . >esser the number of Spikes, greater the depletion or decrease in the corresponding dosha. In the above explanation, we have assumed heart rate to be . Appropriate changes in the counts have to be made for a different heart rate. It is the proportion of Spikes relative to the heart rate that is to be noted. Concep of Leve: In the simultaneous approach, there is yet another concept called >evel >ad 006 related to the tightness with which the fingers make a contact with the radial artery. Before counting the Spikes, all three fingers are firmly pressed as if to stop the blood flow through the radial artery (as in the case of measuring the systolic blood pressure). Then, the pressure is released just enough to feel the throbs or the pulses. This is referred to as the deepest level or the seventh level (>evel-). If the pressure on the radial artery is released so that the fingers make a so or gentle contact then it is referred to as superficial level or >evel-. For the >evels between and , the applied pressure has to be in-between those of >evel- and >evel-. Of course, deciding on the pressure to be applied for intermediate levels is highly subjective. According the author, an objective way of controlling the >evel would be to use a mercurial sphygmomanometer and set the pressure just below the systolic pressure for >evel- and just above the diastolic pressure for >evel- and proportionately in-between these two pressures for other >evels. >evel- is used to measure the intrinsic prakruti (the congenital prakruti) of the doshas and >evel- is used to measure the vikruti (or the current) status of doshas. 3. A BRIEF CRITICAL REVIEW OF INSTRUMENTATION TO RECORD NADI 3.1 Commercial Products of Indian Origin There have been many attempts to develop instrumentation to record nadi using various types of sensors. Pressure (piezo and condenser microphone), photoelectric (optical) or displacement (strain gauge) and velocity (ultra-sound) based sensors have been used. In a single channel recorder, the sensor is placed at one site at a time (Vata or Pitta or Sleshma). A three channel instrument can record pulse at all the three sites simultaneously. Nadi Tarangini, an early attempt made at IIT, Delhi has undergone various revisions. A description of nadi tarangini has been published (:oshi et al, 00) where it is mentioned that a strain gauge sensor has been used. The latest model is a three channel commercially available device (Nadi Tarangini, 0). Nadiswara is yet another commercially available single channel product (Nadiswara, 0). The technical details of these commercially available devices are not available in the open literature. Outwardly, the sensor used in these two commercial instruments resembles PulsePen of DiaTecne Company (a part of Arterial Tonometer). Nadi yantra (Abhinav et. al., 00) is a -channel mechanical setup that avoids manually holding the sensors at the chosen sites thereby providing hands-free recording to ensure stability, repeatability and long-term acquisition facility. Dr T V Ananthapadmanabha: A Critical Review of Instrumentation for Recording Nadi Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020Based on some features or parameters extracted from the recorded pulse signal for known cases of ailment, a knowledge database has also been built for a differential diagnosis in some of these instruments. Further, some of the measured parameters are assigned the names corresponding to some of the attributes of nadi. Commens on he aove insrumens The term nadi has been used in the naming of these commercial products and traditional names associated with the attributes of nadi have been assigned to the measured clinical parameters. A full scientific justification involves a rigorous comparison of the subjective assessment of these attributes of nadi made by traditional experts with the estimates provided by instrumentation for the same Subjects during the same session. The recorded signal (or the raw data) must be made available for researchers in order to independently evaluate these instruments and for the sake of transparency. Such a rigorous scientific evaluation seems necessary. Secondly, the procedure used for recording based on the above instruments differs from that of the traditional approach. As per the simultaneous approach (>ad, 006), as already described, all three fingers are initially pressed firmly on the radial artery as if to stop the blood flow through the radial artery. Then the applied force is released to feel the nadi, the degree of release depending on the >evel. Immediately aer the release of applied pressure, the Spikes are counted. In the instrument based approach, this concept of >evel seems to be missing. Facility to trigger the recording at the time of release is also lacking. A traditional expert compares the present doshas (vikruti) with the intrinsic prakruti of the Subject to arrive at a diagnosis. In the instrument based approach, only the vikruti seems to be measured. Thirdly, as described earlier, the pulse is assigned to Vata or Pitta or <apha Spike depending on whether the point of contact is at the upper edge or mid-line or the lower edge of each of the fingertips. This would require totally nine sensors in the instrumentation, three for each fingertip. Sometimes, the V or P or < Spike is decided based on the quality of contact rather than the location of contact, which is purely subjective and dicult to be implemented in an instrument. Finally, a traditional expert carefully chooses the optimum location of the three sites to feel the nadi based on the individual anatomical differences. However, in some of these instruments, the relative spacing of the sensors is fixed. 3.2 An Example of a Siddha-based System Mahesh et al, 00 describe a three sensor system supposedly meant for Siddha based medical diagnosis. In this setup, a peizeo-electric polymer has been used as a sensor. C om m ents: The setup has been used to determine the intrinsic prakruti of a group of subjects. The intrinsic prakruti so determined by the instrument has not been validated against a judgement made by traditional experts. The system makes use of only the amplitude of the recorded pulse andor the heart rate, both of which are merely the attributes of the modern day allopathic wrist pulse. Thus, the traditional attributes of nadi have not been used in this study. 3.3 Instrumentation inspired by Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese system of medicine (TCM) uses a diagnostics method very similar to that of the traditional Indian system. A recently published book (\u007fhang, 0) covers previous works on the recording of pulse followed by signal processing techniques, feature extraction and classification. A recent paper (Wang et al, 06) may be considered as representative of the latest in instrumentation. This paper presents a very sophisticated design. Here, an array of photoelectric sensors is initially used to identify the optimal sites for each Subject. Pressure sensors are then positioned and firmly held at these optimal sites by mechanical means without manual involvement. Three channel signals are recorded simultaneously using the pressure sensors. The paper concludes that pulse signal recorded at the traditionally identified sites shows consistent wave shape whereas the pulse signal recorded at other sites shows a wide variability from cycle-to-cycle. C om m ent These works dont claim to replicate the traditional Chinese knowledge. Only the choice of sites is inspired by tradition. The recorded signals are considered to be bio-medical signals. They explore the utility of recorded pulse signals at the three sites. Further, instead of an experts interpretation, automatic classification algorithms have been applied on the features extracted from the recorded pulse signal. For example to classify a group of subjects (closed-set) into diabetic or non-diabetic (Wang et al 0) etc. Dr T V Ananthapadmanabha: A Critical Review of Instrumentation for Recording Nadi Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 20203.4 Anatomical and Blood-/f_low Dierences at the Three Sites Measurements on the velocity of blood flow over the radial artery at three sites near the wrist has been carried out in order to gain a deeper understanding (<im et al, 0). Some minor differences in the mean velocity of blood flow profile at the three sites have been reported. Also, it is reported that a hard bone is seen just under Guan (Pitta) site. C om m ent: It is not clear if these noted differences in blood velocity profiles are adequate enough to explain the observed systematic differences at the three sites as noted by traditional experts. 3.5 Equivalence of Nadi Attributes and Modern Medical Terms The motivation with this approach is to find a correspondences between the modern Allopathic clinical parameters and the attributes of nadi so that the attributes of nadi may be measured using the available instruments meant for measuring the Allopathic clinical parameters. Although the approach of finding equivalences between the attributes of nadi and modern clinical parameters is worth pursuing, rigorous controlled experiments have to be planned to calibrate and validate such equivalence involving traditional experts 3.5.1 Bio-electrical Modelling of Nadi Gati Dattatreya et al, 0 propose a model to explain the origin of variability in nadi gati. In this context they cite previous works on the relation between nadi and certain biological processes at the cellular level. They suggest measurement of three bio-electrical properties as an alternative to subjective feeling of nadi gati at the three sites. C om m ent: Such an equivalence has to be validated by an inter-disciplinary approach. 3.5.2 Arterial Stiness and 'Kathinya' <umar et al, 0b considers one of the attributes of nadi called kathinya to be the equivalent of arterial stiffness. In their reported pilot study, two parameters, viz., stiffness index and reflection index are computed using signals recorded by Nadi Tanrangini and these indices are shown to differ at the three sites. The noted differences in the measured parameter at three sites is used as a justification of the approach. C om m ents: Out of a large number of recordings made using Nadi Tarangini only a small subset of the recordings (with clearly identifiable systolic and diastolic peaks) is found to be usable. This usable small subset has been chosen manually. It is not clear if the chosen recordings correspond to that of the same Subject. The measured parameter, claimed to represent the attribute kathinya, is not compared against an independent measurement of arterial stiffness using modern day instruments. In other words, calibration is missing. It is said that tradition mentions differences in kathinya at the three sites. The study also reports differences in the measured stiffness index and reflection index at three sites. Perhaps, the modern clinical parameter arterial stiffness may be applicable to the entire arterial tree and may not differ from one location to another along an artery. One could inquire if kathinya can indeed be considered as equivalent of arterial stiffness. 4. CONCLUSION We have argued that pulse and nadi gati are distinctly different experiences and that we prefer not to translate the term nadi as pulse. We have presented in some detail the so called simultaneous approach to feel nadi gati. Contemporary effort to build instruments for recording nadi gati has been reviewed critically. An inter-disciplinary approach is required for validation of instrumentation. When an experimental object is held in the palm, certain characteristic changes occur in the nadi gati compared to the nadi gati for an empty palm condition See page. , Sriranga Mahaguru, . For example, the experimental object could be a piece of gold. Any suitable experimental object may be used. This experimental situation is not related to medical diagnosis and hence may be performed on any number of normal healthy Subjects. Pulse signals may be recorded with an empty palm and with an experimental object in the palm. These recorded signals may be analyzed to find out if there are correlates that change in a manner predicted by an expert feeling the nadi. The author has developed a two channel pulse recording system using electret condenser microphone as a sensor that is mounted on a stand whose position can be adjusted for each individual. Recorded signals with this setup for twelve Subjects didnt show any significant change for two different experimental objects compared with an empty palm condition. It is argued that the present day instruments record only the arterial pulse, which may still be useful for a differential diagnosis, the recorded signal being considered as yet another bio-medical signal. However, Dr T V Ananthapadmanabha: A Critical Review of Instrumentation for Recording Nadi Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020it is premature to describe recorded pulse signal as nadi or to assign traditional names of the attributes to the measured parameters without a rigorous validation. According to the authors conjecture, some aspects of nadi gati may be arising due to an interaction of subtle vibrations inherently present in the fingerpad and the cyclic pulsatile blood flow through the radial artery. This conjecture is yet to be tested. If this were to be so, any attempt to record nadi by replacing a live fingerpad with an inanimate sensor would be self-defeating. Several intriguing questions arise concerning nadi gati. Why, as per tradition, nadi is felt at three locations instead of a single location as in wrist pulse What factors (anatomical, physiological and neuro-physiological) cause significant and noticeable differences in the nadi gati at such three closely spaced sites (within a few cm) How come the attributes of nadi carry useful information helpful for a medical diagnosis How come an object held in the palm produces systematic and consistent changes in nadi gati, that too almost immediately In other words, what is the rationale behind the origin of nadi At this point of time, the origin of nadi gati is a deep mystery that is yet to be unravelled. Wealth of information carried by nadi gati is yet to be fully explored. Traditional knowledge has to be collected, preserved and expressed using contemporary technical terms by an inter-disciplinary team. Instruments to record nadi gati, as distinct from pulse, are yet to be developed, calibrated and validated. Dubbing nadi gati as imaginary is an un-warranted criticism. Such a scepticism closes the doors on a great gi bestowed by Nature to monitor ones physical and mental health as well as ones spiritual status. 5.

IN TR O DU C TIO N Aga zoga or the eight limb ed path of zoga is w ell k now n as a comprehensive system of achieving the highest state, variously called as Samdhi , Unman or Sahavasth1. It is a process of disciplining and conditioning the mental faculties gradually, and turning them inw ards. zama and Niyama prescrib e a set of practices for restraining and calming the faculties. sana prescrib es a variety of dynamic postures. Pryma talk s of the control and restraint of b reath w hile Pratyhra is associated w ith turning the senses inw ards. T he senses that are turned inwards are trained to focus their attention on an object. This is termed as Dhra. In Dhyna , the focus on the chosen object becomes intense and all- encompassing, eventually leads to Nirvikalpa Samdhi where the difference between the meditator, object of meditation and the act of meditation is no more cogniz ab le. In the eight- fold path, the last three steps - Dhra, Dhyna and Samdhi are considered the core of the eight- fold path and technically k now n as Sayama . The first five steps are preparatory in nature and gradually turn the mind inwards. Pratyhra as the fih step thus constitutes the critical phase transition where outward predisposition of the cia (mental faculties) transforms into an inward and focused cia. H ence the name Pratyhra, meaning leading ( haraa) inwards or against its natural flow (prati). In this w ork , w e proceed to collate the b road set of principles underlying Pratyhra from the primary sources or stras and in particular, the Ptaala zoga elucidate some well-known neurophysiological principles related to sensory- motor processing that are of relevance to the subject matter. Using this dual understanding, we will next proceed to draw some parallels between the two perspectives namely that of zoga and neurophysiology. We will conclude by proposing a hypothesis for the neuroscientific basis of Pratyhra. ABSTRACT Ashtanga yoga or the eight limbed path of yoga to achieve the highest Samadhi state. Yama and Niyama can restrain and calm the faculties by a set of practices. Asana prescribes a set of dynamic postures. Pranyama is the control and restraint of breath. Prathyahara turns the senses inwards. The senses turned inwards are trained to focus attention on an object, it is known as Dharana. Dhyana is the focus on the chosen object and leads to Samadhi. Dharana, Dhyana and Smadhi are the core of eight fold path and known as samyama.Keywords: Ashtanga Yoga, PrathyaharaMohan Raghavan & M K Raghavendra: Pratyhra - A Neuroscienti/f_ic perspective of Yoga Shastra 56 57 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 20201.1 PRATYHRA IN STRAS 1.1.1 PRATYHRA IN YOGA STRA AND ITS ROLE IN AGA YOGAPratyhra is the process b y w hich the senses are restrained by preventing their contact with their usual sense objects 4. T his is similar to the restraint of the mind or cia, w here it is made to follow or concentrate on its own true natural disposition5. This exercise of Pratyhra results in the highest form of restraint of the senses6. T his restraint w here senses or other mental faculty are inhibited from their normal mode of operation, is a recurrent pattern in the philosophy of zoga. zoga itself is defined as restraint of normally encountered mental activities or states or cia vris 7, such as cognition (factual or false), memory, imagination or sleep. T he first steps to achieve restraint of the mental faculties are zama 9 and Niyama1 0 w hich prescrib e certain restraints on lifestyles choices, values and morals such as non- violence, truthfulness and the lik e. sana and Pryma involve the restraint of the musculosk eletal system and breath respectively. The restraint in sana is of the form of maintaining one of the prescrib ed postures that is b oth dynamically stab le and is comfortab le . T he dynamic eq uilib rium of the sana is further emphasiz ed b y the fact that the sana siddhi involves cessation of a conscious effort to maintain the posture . It is in this b ack drop that restraint of the senses - Pratyhra is undertak en. T his restraint is of the form of denial of the usual object of the senses, i.e., shung the eyes out from vision, ears from hearing and so on. T hese 5 steps starting from zama and culminating in Pratyhra lead the subject into the internal practice of zoga or Sayama - w here the mind focuses steadfastly internally on its chosen object or point in the body . When this focus transforms into an unchanging, unbroken flow of thought where the object of meditation holds centre stage, it is dhyna 1 4. The culmination of this process is the state where the object of dhyna , engulfs and tak es full possession of the mind. T his state is thought to b e brought on, as if in a burst of inspiration. 2. PRATYHRA IN THE YOGA UPANIATS T he zoga Upaniats describe many different methods and their variants for the practice of Pratyhra. T w o b road classes of methods are describ ed in the Darana Upaniat1 6. The first relates to the holding of breath andor (de)focusing attention on different parts of the b ody. T he second is related to the philosophy of Vedanta, which requires the mind to be drawn away and focused directly on the atman w hich dw ells w ithin. T he former is a graded, methodical process of w ithdraw al of senses, while the latter is more a drastic and complete w ithdraw al. While these are largely two broad classes of methods, it must b e recogniz ed that these are ak in to tw o ends of a spectrum, w ith a variety of methods that fall in one of the tw o classes or in b etw een them. Another scheme of classification with five different classes is describ ed in the _ilya Upaniat 1 7. It is said that Pratyhra may be practiced in one of many ways, namely, . By withdrawing the senses forcibly from their sense objects. . By practiced disinterest in the sense objects such as sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches and the happiness derived therefrom. . Identifying all the sense objects with the atman itself0: The Amtanda Up. gives another variant of this method w herein it prescrib es considering the sense objects as the rays of the atman, as having an organic connection with the atman . Yogachudamani Up. takes it a step further and describes the process of Pratyhra as similar to that w herein, at sunset, the sun draw s b ack it rays w ithin itself . The Tejobindu Up. further says that identifying this connection of the sense objects with the atman gives a pleasurable feel-ing. An alternate reading of this text may be taken to mean that the joy derived from a pleasurable sense object must be thought of as having an organic connection with the real nature of atman - b liss. . By giving up the fruits of the daily activities or even those actions done for satiation of particu-lar desires Pratyhra may b e performed.

Somewhat counter-intuitively it is also said to be achieved by filling in the air within the body from Mohan Raghavan & M K Raghavendra: Pratyhra - A Neuroscienti/f_ic perspective of Yoga Shastra Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020toe to head. Elaborate and frequent mention is made of holding- dhra, or transferring0, the pra b etw een marma sthnas or vital points in the b ody. <urik Up. mentions that not just the pra, b ut the triad of di, mana and pra are to b e focused on one of the marma sthnas, and then w ithdraw n as the focus moves to another marma sthna. 2.1 PRATYHRA AND MARMA STHNAS IN THE BO DY T his method is describ ed in detail in several upaniats lik e <urik Up., Darana , eighteen marma sthnas3 3 in b oth3 4 ascending and descending orders, i.e from head to toe3 5 or toe to head6, . The list of the marma sthnas as given in _ilya Up. is as follows3 8 Big toe of the feet . Feet . Ankles . Shanks 4 . K 6. 7. G enitals. Navel . Heart 0. Throat . Cavity of . Palate . Nostrils . Eyes . Mid-brow 6. Forehead . Crest of the head In addition, joints such as the shoulder, hip, elbows are also considered as marma sthnas 3 9. The different parts of the body from toe to head are connected to the concept of five elements pthiv, ap, agni(tejas), anila(vyu), ka. From the sole up to the knees are associated with Earth (pthiv) knee onwards, until the anus with water (ap) thereon till the heart with fire(agni tejas) thereon to the middle of the brows with air (anila vyu) thereon till the crown with ether (ka) 0. The association of these body regions with the five elements, their maala and bjkara are mentioned as well. The association of these five elements with the first five chakras mldhra, svdhihna, maipra, anhata and viuddhi are well known. Oen Pratyhra and dhra are treated as tw o facets of the same process. In Pratyhra Pra, di and mana are exercised well, sometimes holding, sometimes moving from one marma sthna to another. In dhra, this process is taken to the next level by w ithdraw ing fully and severing the marma sthnas one b y one - the ank les, shank s, k nees, thighs, anus and genitals and entering the suumn n . 3. SENSORY-MOTOR NEUROSCIENCE 3 .1 Spinal and C ranial nerv es The cerebral cortex receives sensory information and controls the motor organs through a system of spinal and cranial nerves. The cortex is connected to the rest of the b ody through the thalamus, b rainstem and the spinal cord. Olfactory information by virtue of its location on the ventral surface of the b rain, connects directly. Cranial nerves connect the sense organs i.e., eyes, ears, organs of taste and touch ( from the middle and anterior parts of the face to the brain). It also conducts control information for movement of the eyes, facial muscles and jaws. Spinal nerves bring information about the sense of touch from the posterior portion of the head and whole b ody. S pinal nerves also carry motor signals to control body movement by activating the muscles. Movement is effected by motor nerves that cause muscles to contract. The contracting muscles move the skeletal bones around the joints and effect movement. Sensory information from the body is of several kinds: information about touch - pressure, pain and temperature from the surface of the skin. Another important source of sensory information is the proprioceptive information from muscle spindles and G olgi tendon organs. T hese signals encode information about the state of the muscle stretch. Thus, the composite of these proprioceptive information from all the muscles of the body provide information about the position of the various limbs of the body (Purves, Fitzpatrick and Hall, 00). 4. THALAMUS The thalamus acts as the front oce of the cerebral cortex. Its position as the front oce naturally endows Mohan Raghavan & M K Raghavendra: Pratyhra - A Neuroscienti/f_ic perspective of Yoga Shastra Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020it w ith a direct, large- scale access to almost all parts of the cortex. These connections are reciprocal in nature. As the front oce, almost all sensory information either from the spinal or the cranial nerves are relayed to the b rain through the thalamus. T hus, the thalamus plays an important role as the gatekeeper of sensory information. T he fact that the thalamus is w ell connected to all parts of the cortex is also useful in another manner. It is an effective way for different parts of the cortex to communicate with each other and exchange notes. The part of thalamus that acts as the front oce, relaying sensory information is different from the part of the thalamus that acts as the internal relay centre and helps communicate quickly between different brain regions. These two regions are respectively termed as first order and higher order areas of the thalamus . 5. SPINAL CORD AND BRAINSTEM The spinal cord and brainstem manage the coordination of the b ody and act as intermediary b etw een the b ody and the brain. Spinal cord is a hierarchical system with a rhythm generator at the top level. The next level contains the modular circuits required to coordinate antagonistic components: extensors and flexors, le and right sides of limbs and so on. Finally, at the bottom level are the motor neurons that cause the muscles to move, the afferent proprioceptive sensors from the muscles that indicate the state of the muscles, and interneurons in b etw een. T here are also the somatosensory inputs b ringing in information of touch-pressure, pain and temperature. The descending connections from the brainstem and cortex largely turn on or off the various modules, or pace the central patterns generators . or at times the motor neurons directly. In turn, the sensory information is sent upw ards to the b rainstem, cereb ellum and the first order thalamic nuclei. The brainstem contains other rhythm generators, most notab ly the one req uired for respiration. 5.1 UNDERSTANDING THE BRAIN AT DIFFERENT SCALES The basic functional unit of organization in the nervous system is the cell also called a neuron. Neurons receive information from multiple other neurons through dendrites and send outputs to other neurons through long processes called axons. Small regions of the brain can b e thought of as a dense netw ork of interconnected neurons that communicate w ith other netw ork s of neurons. The neurons are electrically active cells and communicate b y means of ions. O ne can measure and understand brain activity by directly measuring electrical activity of neurons. Since it is impossible to measure each and every neuron, in order to understand activity in an area of the brain, electrical fields resulting from the lumped neural activity of large populations of neurons are measured. Thus, the ongoing activity must b e understood b oth at the micro scale ( electrical activity of neurons) and at the macro scale (activity in large populations of neurons, e.g. EEG) and at scales in between these two extremes. 6. NEUROSCIENCE OF PRATYHRA AND YOGA 6.1 Citta vttis from a perspective of neuroscience. Cia vs activities or modes of working of the brain are cognition (factual and false), memory, imagination, or sleep. We know that during cognition, sensory information flows into the brain from sense organs to the cerebral cortex via the spinal or cranial nerves and then through the relays in the first order thalamic nuclei. This sensory information is integrated and interpreted by the associational cortices and other areas to understand, cognize and respond to it. The mode of cognition may also be broadly interpreted as interaction with the external world, to include sensory-motor interaction. The memories of these interactions are stored in areas such as hippocampus, amygdala and cortical areas. While hippocampus is largely associated with formation of explicit memories, implicit memories are represented in various diffuse areas. Recalling and recovering information from them, constitutes memory6(. Sleep involves a shutdown of large cortical areas by means of synchronized oscillatory activity. This is achieved by the higher order nuclei of the thalamus together w ith the cortex by creating thalamocortical oscillations. Since it may sound counterintuitive, a few words may be in order on why oscillations represent a silencing of the brain. Neurons in brain when alive are inherently noisy. Thus, to keep them silent requires firing of inhibitory neurons. Since different parts of the brain are highly connected, if activity was uncoordinated, then neurons silent period would get disrupted by incoming activity from some other neurons. Thus, some populations of neurons engaged in certain oscillatory synchronies enab le idling of regions of the b rain, w hich can b e measured w ith an EEG system(Buzsaki, 006). Mohan Raghavan & M K Raghavendra: Pratyhra - A Neuroscienti/f_ic perspective of Yoga Shastra 60 6 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 20206.2 CITTA VTTI NIRODHA IN THE LANGUAGE OF NEUROSCIENCE Nirodha is an important techniq ue in zoga. It is defined as the restraint of all vs. O n one end of the spectrum of vs are cognition and memory involving an active cortex, processing inputs from the senses and controlling motor output or playing b ack old inputs from memory. T he other end of the spectrum is sleep which involves a drastic and global shutdown of brain activity where even an awareness is lost. Hence, cia v nirodha requires all these normal modes of cortical operation to be abolished. Neither sensory inputs nor their replay from memory, nor a glob al shutdow n. T hus, it must b e a state w here sensory inputs are b lock ed b ut without the global shutdown of cortex, leaving intact a sense of aw areness. Experiments have shown that when subjects are ask ed to shut their eyes it results in a high amplitude oscillation termed alpha activity in the occipital area. O pening of eyes, movement of eyes, or even visual imagery abolishes this activity. However, the subject is awake and aware. It may specifically be noted that this state is incompatible with vikalpa - imagination. Similar oscillations (Rolandic mu rhythms) are found when recording ab ove the sensory- motor area in the ab sence of musculoskeletal activity or movement. It requires that the limbs be immobile, but is not sensitive to sensory inputs from other modes such as visual inputs. S imilar rhythms have also b een recorded over the temporal area which is responsible for processing auditory stimuli. Absence of auditory stimuli gives rise to the tau rhythms when recording over the temporal lobe. Since these rhythms - occipital alpha, Rolandic mu and temporal tau occur in ab sence of sensory inputs and are ab olished b y respective sensory stimuli, these rhythms are referred to as default state oscillations or idle oscillations. It is interesting to note that this name is quite literally the name for Samdhi in the zoga S hastra - the saha 4 4. The mechanism of these oscillations is thought to be due to pacemaker like activity or due to a network phenomenon involving the thalamus and cortex. Oscillation as a natural mode of activity is seen in microscopic scales as well. Experiments on dissociated neuronal cultures0 and immature cortex in-vivo have show n that the cultures spontaneously form recurrent networks that show synchronized bursting followed by long periods of sparse activity. The mechanisms of formation of synchronized oscillations in spontaneously formed clusters have been well studied. These spontaneous oscillations are terminated by random external stimulations, which act like sensory inputs0. Thus, oscillations as the fundamental activity (some of them functioning to induce idling of certain areas of the brain), may be observed across microscopic and macroscopic scales in the nervous system. While we explore these rhythms from a context of resting, physiologically idling of certain parts of the brain also serves to increase the salience of inputs coming from other parts. 6.3 ROLE OF PRATYHRA IN SAMDHI While it does look like alpha oscillations are commonly observed during yoga practice or during relaxed non-sensory processing states, it is pertinent to ask whether the alpha activities observed due to lack of sensory inputs completely characteriz es Samdhi culmination of zoga? O r is there more to it? It may b e recollected that in Samdhi, there is complete internal immersion and sensory stimuli do not have any effect. For instance, a shining of light on the closed eyes or a cold stimulus on the skin is likely to leave its mark on brain activity if the subject has only shut his eyes and is relaxing with no mental activity. However, in experiments on experienced practitioners of zoga, it has b een reported that these stimuli do not alter the ongoing idling rhythms 4 5. T his implies that in Samdhi , the default idling oscillatory dynamics are not altered by an external stimulus, w hich is normally not the case. In order for this to b e functionally plausible, it is further required that in case of external stimuli, either the sensory stimuli do not reach the thalamus cortex, or if they do, they are ineffective in altering the idling rhythms. We may presume that the steps leading to the stage of Samdhi must have placed the practitioner in such a state. Pratyhra being defined as the step that constitutes the phase transition where senses are cut off, or turned inwards, may be expected to play an important part in this process. 6.4 A PROPOSED NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS FOR PRATYHRA The starting point of our proposed neurophysiological b asis of Pratyhra is the hypothesis ( henceforth called Hypothesis P) that the steps preceding Samdhi , placed the subject in a state where a. sensory inputs to first order thalamic nuclei are suppressed and Mohan Raghavan & M K Raghavendra: Pratyhra - A Neuroscienti/f_ic perspective of Yoga Shastra 60 6 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020b. ensure that any subsequent external stimuli do not reach the first order thalamic nuclei, or at least are not strong enough to disrupt the ongoing rhythms. We may also note here that the philosophy of zoga proposes a gradual progression upw ards along the spinal cord (more specifically the suumn) and the culmination of this journey at the crown is Samdhi . Thus, it is pertinent to suppose that the spinal cord and its activity must have a role to play in achieving the conditions described in hypothesis P. 6.5 DEFAULT RHYTHMS FOR THE SPINAL CORD? In order to understand w hat role it may play, w e may start with a question as follows: Does the spinal cord too have a natural state or rhythm similar to the cereb ral cortex. The answer to this question it turns out is, yes. These rhythms are called fictive motor patterns- and are found in spinal cord laboratory preparations in the ab sence of sensory inputs. T he spinal cord circuits that generate these rhythms are called central pattern generators and are largely responsible for generating movement driving signals. These patterns are of different kinds and correspond to the different modes of locomotion such as walking, trong, galloping. Some of these involve alternating of the le and right limbs while others involve synchronous activity (<iehn, 06). It is interesting to note that the mechanisms that generate these rhythms are very similar to the ones generating oscillations in the cerebral cortex as well, thus making it plausible that the notion of default state oscillation is a generic concept applicable in the cerebral cortex as well as in the spinal cord. 6.6 FACTORS MODULATING SPINAL CORD ACTIVITY T hree factors are k now n to modulate the rhythms of the spinal cord. - Descending connections from the brainstem and cortex. - S ensory inputs- touch, thermal and pain signals from the skin, proprioceptive from the muscles - H ormones secreted b y the neurosecretory organs Based on the discussion above we may now postulate that if the spinal cord circuits themselves w ere placed under a persistent oscillatory state this might suppress the sensory stimulation of the thalamic first order nuclei, or even prob ab ly give an oscillatory rhythmic input to them which could accelerate and exaggerate the rhythms corresponding to the state of cia v nirodha . T he oscillatory state of the spinal cord may itself render it incapable of processing any external stimulus and thus act as a shield, leaving the thalamocortical rhythms unaffected. Seng up the idling rhythm in the spinal cord may be achieved by using one of the three modulating factors mentioned above. 6 .7 A BASIS FOR DIVERSITY IN PRATYHRA METHODS We may recollect that there were largely two broad classes of methods applied for Pratyhra. Firstly, the methods where the subject assumes a state of mind or a mental atude such as active disinterest, or disowning (treating the sense organs as non-self), or coopting ( sense organs as b eing under the control of or part of the self). These may be called as the Vedantic approach to Pratyhra 4 6. We hypothesize that these correspond to the modulation of spinal cord through descending control from cortical centres, largely top down methods. S econd class of methods are b ased on the classical Aga zoga 4 7. Here the practices include sana w herein a comfortab le posture in dynamic eq uilib rium is assumed and maintained. Dynamic equilibrium implies that there is an active muscle force, but the limb posture is such that the forces exerted by the limbs counteract each other. This dynamic equilibrium results in a flow of patterned stimuli into the spinal cord which contributes to moving the spinal cord to its default rhythm. S imilarly, during the phase of pryma, b reathing req uires rhythmic activation of the motor neuron array and results in rhythmic afferent inflow into the spinal cord. It is worthwhile noting that breathing patterns also have neuromodulatory effects. Thus, sana and pryma contribute to seng up the default rhythm in the spinal cord through patterned afferent inflow. During Pratyhra, the triad of di- mana- pra implies a focusing of attention on a marma sthna and then gradually w ithdraw ing it. It may b e noted that most of the marma sthnas are major muscles or joints of the body. Thus, focused attention on a marma sthna is likely accentuate the patterned afferent into the spinal cord from the relevant part and w ithdraw ing the attention may release the accentuation. Performing Pratyhra seq uence from head- or toe-to- head in the manner prescrib ed is lik ely to result in a wave of input activation to the spinal cord travelling end Mohan Raghavan & M K Raghavendra: Pratyhra - A Neuroscienti/f_ic perspective of Yoga Shastra 6 6 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020to end. T his may b e ascertained from dermatomes and myotomes by computing the sequence of spinal cord levels corresponding to the marma sthnas . It may now also be noted that the seng up of these patterned input stimuli may have another important function. It may provide a persistent strong sensory stimulus that can drown out an external stimulus. For instance, the rigidity of muscles achieved may drow n out the effect of a touch, thus acting as an additional fence around the cortical rhythms. While it is proposed that the vednta and agayoga b ased approaches to samdhi largely utilize respectively the top-down and bottom-up modulation of spinal cord respectively, it is most likely that these are not mutually exclusive. Aspirants pursuing vednta based contemplation are also likely to adopt a suitab le sana . S imilarly, agayoga prescribes adopting several mental atudes as aids. Further, descending drives to spinal cord and proprioceptive input patterns are likely to interact w ith each other. S imilarly release of neuromodulatory substances acting as inputs to the pattern generators may be utilized by either of the methods outlined above. The hypotheses proposed here are verifiable to various extents by experimentation. However, modeling may help support or w eak en these hypotheses and develop further intuition. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this work we have surveyed the practice of pratyhra in zoga sutras and upaniats in the context of achieving the yogic state of samdhi . We also review ed the neuroscience literature related to the various cia vs and their nirodha . O n the b asis of this interdisciplinary study, w e have proposed a hypothetical mechanistic basis for pratyhra grounded in modern neuroscientific literature. We have also described why there is a ground for diversity in methods for achieving Pratyhra. We hope that this w ork can serve as an impetus to the experimental and computational exploration of these hypotheses and advance the interdisciplinary area at the intersection of Yoga and neuroscience. 7.

An individual is a unique personification of the microbiome especially in the abdominal region. One must cultivate a large plethora of these beneficial gut microflora and its large species of microorganisms for good health. This is achievedby consuming a variety of foods per day. These foods get converted into good bioactive molecules for better health and sustainable wellness not only for the microbiota but also for the body. In the current scenario of obesity, diabetes, heart diseases, and non- communicable diseases that are rapidly emerging as the major causes of death in most of the obesity centric economies, if one does not give importance to the gut microflora, it has large repercussions on the overall health of the individual and the society. Despite modern scientific advancement, this subject is least understood . But we know the cause and effects as to what to eat and how it will help the body to be healthy. There should be a sustained consumption as well as a clean, hygienic, and safe food that is desirable beyond nutrition and beyond proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. This is perhaps what we call as Sampoorna Ahaara. If one looks at Aahaara what one sees is the abundance of literature which is so voluminous, in Science , the tradition, variety and combination of the same and to comprehend all of it is not possible to even summarise within this article. These days people talk about GYM! This according to me is not Gymnastics! G stands for Gut, Y stands for Yoga and M stands for Meditation perhaps. So there is the importance of Gut and YOGA and Meditation all working hand in hand for a holistic approach. People may perform and cultivate these in many different ways, but the fundamental aspect is Food and Exercise for the body and mind is the most important point one, that one has to remember. Through the approach of deconstructing molecular gastronomy and nurturing our genes by well- documented plant-based foods, one can transform and transcend to a delayed onset of certain diseases thus improving the Quality of Life. The implementation of Food and exercise perhaps through YOGA and evidenced-based traditional foods and understanding them on the platform of physiology appears to be lacking in our system. This is where the right intake ABSTRACT Ayurveda emphasizes on nutritious and balanced food. Gut micro/f_lora is of utmost importance in the current scenario of obesity centric economy. GYM (Gut Yoga Meditation) is essential for a holistic approach. Health, food and exercise sharing an appropriate balance and slight imbalance in any of them can lead to a diseaseDr. V Prakash: AHAARA VIGNANA and YOGA 66 67 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020 Yoga Vijnana - The Science and Art of Yoga, Vol 1, Issue 1, April - Sept, 2020of the combination of Food is very important for a Yoga Practioner. Scientific Institutions must focus on these aspects and work towards creating evidence for the cause and effect of each food we eat,digest, complete absorption and the benefit one receives with or without exercise. This data is very vital to Modern tools. Evidence- based science on the well-known holistic approach of the Integrated Indian Medicinal System followed much earlier in India and practices spanning and documented are well over 6000 years! We need to use it to our advantage, it is very similar to Yoga, which is India Centric, Food, especially Traditional and Ethnic food practices and wisdom are equally important and India can be a hub and spoke model with YOGA and FOOD at its center of Cultural diversity. It has and can attract the whole world for a healthy lifestyle approach especially in the current pandemic where Immunity plays a major role. Very similar to Yoga which needs to be learnt from a proper Guru with the correct postures and breathing systems in place, so also a Yogi needs to comply with many qualities and some characteristics of food. One has to keep in mind Food has to be: Swaccha( clean), Shamshuddha( garnished), Supachya (easy to digest), Swarasya (interesting), Sukaramika (in the right sequence), Swasthya(Healthy), and may other attributes can be added but ultimately has to be Sampoorna( Complete and Wholesome). Thus the relationship between health, food, and exercise is that of a balancing act and a slight imbalance in it can tilt the balance towards a disease which is avoidable if one practices the right YOGA, eats good food with some of the above characteristics mentioned and maintiansgood mental health as per their practice, a good Healthy life will continue to be blessed to all.
