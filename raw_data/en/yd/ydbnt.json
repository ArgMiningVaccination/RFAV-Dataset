Welcome to the 4FTC's Workshop on Competition and Consumer Protection 5Issues in the Pet Medications Industry. My name is 6Stephanie Wilkinson and I am an attorney advisor in the 7FTC's Office of Policy Planning. Before we get started, 8I need to go over some administrative details. 9 First, please turn off or place in the silent 10mode any cell phones, Blackberries or other electronic 11devices. 12 Second, if you leave the building for any reason 13during the day, you will have to go back through 14security. So, please bear that in mind and plan ahead 15so that we can stay on schedule. 16 Third, please try to avoid having conversations 17in the hallway directly outside the auditorium while 18panels are in session. The background noise from the 19hallway carries over into this room and sometimes 20disrupts the discussions that we're having. Also, the 21microphones that we have set up are very sensitive. So, 22some of the conversations that happen in the hallway may 23be picked up by the court reporters or by the live 24webcast. So, fair warning on that. 25 Fourth, the restrooms are located out in the4 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551lobby, behind the elevator banks. There are signs to 2indicate where they are, but if you go out to the 3security guard's desk, the restrooms are to your left. 4 Fifth, in the unlikely event that an emergency 5occurs and the building alarms go off, please proceed 6calmly to the main exit in the lobby, and assemble 7across the street on the sidewalk in front of the steps 8of Georgetown Law School. Hopefully it won't be raining 9too hard should that happen. At that point the security 10guards will let us know when it's safe to return to the 11building. 12 Lastly, I would like to remind all presenters 13and panelists to speak directly into the microphone so 14that everyone can clearly hear your remarks. If anyone 15has any questions throughout the day, please feel free 16to ask the people wearing the FTC staff badges or the 17people at the registration desk and we will be glad to 18help you. 19 We will be conducting moderated panel 20discussions today. If members of the audience would 21like to submit questions to the panelists, you will need 22to obtain a question card. These are located on the 23table in the hallway and you can pick one up during the 24breaks. 25 FTC staff will be live tweeting today's5 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- is @FTC. You may tweet our Twitter handle @FTC with 3the hashtag #FTCpets. You may also submit questions and 4comments via the FTC's Facebook page at 5www.Facebook.com/FederalTradeCommission. 6 To open today's workshop, I would like to 7introduce FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz. During his tenure 8at the FTC, Chairman Leibowitz has demonstrated 9leadership in examining complex competition and consumer 10protection issues in health care markets. Consistent 11with this interest, Chairman Leibowitz suggested that 12the Office of Policy Planning conduct research into the 13pet medications industry. He has been very supportive 14of our efforts to organize this workshop, and remains 15committed to protecting the American consumer, including 16their beloved pets. 17 Chairman Leibowitz? 18 CHAIRMAN LEIBOWITZ: Wow, I just want to say how 19appreciative we are that so many of you got here, 20despite the inclement weather and difficult traffic 21patterns this morning. So, thank you. 22 Welcome, everybody, to the FTC's Workshop on 23Competition and Consumer Protection Issues in the Market 24for Pet Medications. I have personally been looking 25forward to this workshop, because like the majority of6 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551Americans, I own a pet. He is a shelter dog named Tank 2and he is truly a member of my family, of our family. 3 When Tank was a puppy, I once brought him here 4to work with me at the Commission and I thought it was a 5lot of fun. Now, Tank did, too, and he certainly 6enjoyed himself barking and running around my office and 7the adjacent corridors. Later, I learned that there was 8a deposition taking place just down the hall, and 9apparently the lawyers thought Tank's barking was 10annoying. Now, it seems to me that a puppy barking 11would be preferable to the barking of the objections of 12the lawyers at a deposition, but -- 13 All right, I'm sorry, I know it's early in the 14morning, but that was a joke, you're going to have to 15laugh. Since then, by the way, I have pretty much left 16Tank at home. I wanted to bring him with me today, but 17instead I brought a picture of him to show you, and here 18he is. Is that cute or what? And you can see in the 19photo, he's in front of the flag, because he holds a 20position of some importance in the dog world. Anyway, 21there he is. 22 Once in a while, we have a consent decree here 23at the FTC regarding animal medications, for example, 24in Pfizer's acquisition of Wyeth in 2009. But on most 25days, it seems that pets and the FTC just don't mix.7 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551Today, however, they do, of course, because we're going 2to talk about competition and consumer protection issues 3relating to the distribution of pet medicines, and pet 4medications. 5 Judging by the variety of pet products that are 6now available in any number of retail outlets, pets are 7very important to American consumers. For example, 8during a recent visit to a local Costco store, we were 9able to purchase this box of Frontline Plus for a very 10competitive price. How many of you know about Frontline 11Plus? Of course, because you have dogs and hopefully 12the Frontline Plus has taken care of the flea, flea egg 13larvae, tick or chewing lice. What is chewing lice? 14How many of you know what chewing lice is? Because I 15don't know that and I don't want to know it. 16 There's a huge convenience, of course, of being 17able to buy a product like this in the same cost-cutting 18retail outlet where so many Americans shop. 19 Among the questions we're going to ask today, 20are whether consumers benefit from being able to 21purchase pet medications at retail outlets. In 22particular, I think the Commission is interested in 23knowing whether competition from retail outlets results 24in lower prices for pet medications, as it does for so 25many other products that we buy. Unlike human medicine,8 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551which is supported by both public and private insurance, 2and reimbursement, pet medicines are largely paid for by 3consumers out of their own pocket. So, today, we hope 4to examine some of the options that are available to 5consumers to help them manage the cost of pet care and 6discuss some proposals that have been made to give 7consumers more choices when buying pet medications. 8 Here's what we know: And I learned this, 9actually, as we were preparing for this workshop. 10Sixty-two percent of U.S. households own a pet, and our 11national pet population includes more than 78 million 12dogs and more than 86 million cats, and sometimes they, 13of course, even live in the same house. American 14consumers spend more than $50 billion a year on their 15pets, including nearly $7 billion a year for 16over-the-counter and prescription pet medications. 17 And here's something else we know: More and 18more, consumers are able to purchase pet medications 19from sources other than their veterinarians. Some pet 20medications are available over-the-counter without a 21prescription, and even for prescription medications, 22consumers may be able to obtain a written prescription 23from their vet that they can use to buy pet medicines in 24an online or brick-and-mortar retail pharmacy. But that 25information isn't always volunteered, by the way.9 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 Still, an increasing array of options for 2consumers to purchase their pet medications has begun to 3lead, we believe, to lower prices and increase consumer 4choice, certainly in a few pet medicines. While this 5market may be becoming more competitive, it clearly has 6a way to go. We have heard that many pet medicine 7manufacturers choose to distribute their products only 8through veterinarians, so retailers can't purchase these 9products directly from the manufacturer. As a result, 10some retailers use secondary distributors. 11 Take, for example, our box of Frontline. Now, 12this was purchased, as I said, at a local Costco store. 13And we don't exactly know how Costco or other retailers 14acquire Frontline because we do know that the 15manufacturer publicly denies selling the product 16directly to non-veterinarians. We also know that this 17Frontline was priced about 20 percent or more below the 18prices of some local veterinarians. 19 Now, this may be so, for example, this 20three-month supply at Costco costs about $37.99. And the 21veterinary prices ranged, it was a small sample of five 22veterinarians, one veterinarian priced it at or below 23the Costco price, four priced it above, one priced it 20 24percent above. So, the prices ranged up to $48.50 for I 25think that's for a three-month supply. At Costco,10 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551again, $37.99 for a three-month supply. 2 So, again, this may be competition, or this 3mystery of gray market distribution may be leading to 4increased prices for consumers. I think it's a pure 5distribution system and we just want to learn more about 6it. 7 We have also heard that complex, cumbersome, and 8sometimes antiquated state and federal laws may be 9restricting competition in the pet medicine market. In 10fact, a major national retailer has told me that it 11wants to enter this market, and it would, but for the 12crazy-quilt patchwork with state licensing and 13regulatory requirements. Although many or even all of 14these regulations may have once had sensible health and 15safety justifications, some now may no longer be in the 16best interest of Americans and our pets. 17 Today, our panelists, and it is a terrific, 18terrific group of panelists, who include veterinarians, 19animal drug manufacturers, distributors, 20brick-and-mortar and online retail pharmacies, pharmacists, 21animal welfare advocates, academics, economists and 22lawyers, of course this is Washington, so we will have 23lawyers, will explore the costs and benefits of 24consumers getting a written prescription from their 25veterinarian that they can fill wherever they choose,11 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551say at a grocery store pharmacy or an online veterinary 2pharmacy. We will also explore whether the consumers 3are able to verify that the products they buy at those 4retail outlets are the same medicines that they could 5buy from their veterinarian and whether there are any 6safety risks with purchasing these products from retail 7outlets. 8 We will also hear about restrictions on the 9distribution of some pet medications by manufacturers or 10by states, and how these business practices may limit 11their availability. And by having this dialogue, we 12hope to educate consumers, and we hope to educate 13ourselves about changes occurring in the marketplace, 14ones that may create new opportunities for consumers to 15obtain high quality, low-cost medical treatment for 16their pets. 17 So, let me thank our panelists for coming to 18Washington to share their experiences with us. I know 19some of you have come great distances, and let me also 20thank hundreds of industry participants and consumers 21who have submitted comments in advance to our workshop, 22that was really terrific. 23 For our audience here at the conference center 24and for those watching on our webcast, we hope you sit, 25stay, I'm not going to go too far into that, I am not going12 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551to say don't bark at each other, but don't roll over 2either. I'm just going to say we hope you sit, stay, 3and enjoy the discussion. 4 We thank you all for coming here, we really do 5appreciate it. I am going to turn it over. Stephanie, 6are you coming up? Great, I'll give this to you. 7 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you, Chairman Leibowitz. 8 Many people have asked us why is the FTC 9interested in the pet medications industry, and why are 10we conducting this workshop? We have learned over the 11past many months that the market for pet medications is 12in flux. Industry stakeholders have noted that consumer 13demand for pet medications has grown dramatically over 14the past decade. Manufacturers have introduced many new 15products to the market. 16 During this time period, new distribution models 17have also emerged for pet medications, including online 18retail pharmacies, such as 1-800-PetMeds and Drs. Foster& 19Smith, as well as brick-and-mortar retail pharmacies, 20such as Target, Walgreens and several large grocery 21store chains. Generic products have also been 22introduced into the pet medications industry, although 23perhaps not to the same extent as what we've seen with 24human medications. 25 We are interested in exploring the competitive13 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551impact that these changes have had on the market for pet 2medications, and what this means for consumers. To help 3us better understand these issues, we are pleased to 4bring together a broad spectrum of industry experts to 5serve as presenters and panelists for our workshop who 6will offer diverse and important perspectives. 7 We will begin this morning with two introductory 8presentations that should help set the stage for our 9panel discussions. During these presentations, we will 10learn about the veterinary profession, including the 11importance of the relationship that veterinarians have 12with pet owners and their pets, particularly within the 13context of diagnosing the condition of pets, prescribing 14medications and providing follow-up care. We will also 15learn about the various options that consumers have for 16purchasing pet medications, and about how the various 17distribution models for pet medications work. 18 During our first panel, we hope to explore two 19categories of distribution practices that appear to be 20used in the pet medications industry, the first being 21exclusive distribution by manufacturers through the 22veterinary channel, and the second being exclusive 23dealing arrangements between manufacturers and 24distributors. Ultimately, we are interested in 25understanding how both of these distribution practices14 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551affect the choices that consumers have when purchasing 2pet medications, including the scope of products offered 3to consumers, where consumers are able to purchase 4products, and the prices that consumers have to pay. In 5addition, we are interested in understanding 6whether there are product safety and dispensing safety 7issues that consumers should be aware of when making 8decisions about where to purchase pet medications. 9 After lunch, there will be a second panel 10discussion regarding the ability of consumers to obtain 11written, portable prescriptions from their 12veterinarians. When a pet dog or cat needs medication 13that requires a prescription, the pet owner often buys 14that medicine from the veterinarian at the time of the 15exam. But consumers also purchase a substantial amount 16of pet medications from retail pharmacies, particularly 17long-term maintenance drugs such as heartworm 18preventatives and diabetes medications. In order to make 19these purchases, consumers must be able to obtain a written, 20portable prescription from their veterinarian. Some states 21require veterinarians to provide portable prescriptions, 22while other states leave this to the veterinarian's 23discretion. 24 Anecdotally, we have heard that many 25veterinarians give clients prescriptions upon request,15 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551but we've also heard that some veterinarians refuse to 2provide prescriptions to clients even where state law 3requires that they do so. There is a bill pending in 4Congress, H.R. 1406, that is called the Fairness to Pet 5Owners Act which would require veterinarians in all 6states to give a written prescription, regardless of 7whether they request it. We are hoping to discuss the 8pros and cons of this legislative proposal during this 9second panel. 10 We have also heard that there may be safety 11issues with pharmacists that are untrained in veterinary 12pharmacology dispensing pet medications, such that 13veterinarians may be concerned about giving clients 14portable prescriptions if they believe there is a risk 15that retail pharmacies do not dispense the medications 16in a safe and appropriate manner. We are interested in 17better understanding all of these issues today. 18 Finally, there will be a third panel discussion 19about whether we can learn any lessons from the contact 20lens industry about the effects of restricted 21distribution practices and prescription portability on 22consumer markets. We intend to examine the similarities 23and differences between the contact lens and pet 24medications industries, and the degree to which the 25evolution of the contact lens industry provides a16 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551reliable basis for predicting the potential consumer 2cost savings and non-price benefits that might result 3from eliminating vertical restrictions for the 4distribution of pet medications and empowering pet 5owners with prescription portability. 6 We are examining the vertical restraints on 7distribution and prescription portability issues that 8once characterized the contact lens industry. In 2003, 9Congress passed legislation to give consumers a federal 10right to written prescriptions for their contact lenses. 11Furthermore, vertical restraints on the distribution of 12contact lenses were eliminated during this time period 13through litigation efforts by several states attorneys 14general. As a result of these changes in the market, 15consumers today have many more choices for buying 16contact lenses. Some have suggested that requiring 17prescription portability and addressing restricted 18distribution practices for pet medications would 19potentially have similar benefits in terms of more 20consumer choices and more price competition. 21 To conclude, I would like to thank everyone for 22attending today's workshop, including those who are 23viewing the live webcast. In particular, I would also 24like to thank our distinguished presenters and panelists 25for their participation, as they have spent a17 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551significant amount of time preparing for today's 2workshop. 3 We also appreciate all of the public comments 4that we have received so far, and to ensure that 5everyone has an opportunity to submit comments, we have 6extended the comment period to November 1st. We 7strongly encourage everyone to submit written statements 8if they have not already done so. 9 Now, I would like to introduce Dr. Douglas 10Aspros, who will be making the first presentation of the 11day. Dr. Aspros is the president of the American 12Veterinary Medical Association, and a companion animal 13practitioner. 14 Dr. Aspros? 15 (Applause.) 16 DR. ASPROS: If I had realized I could have brought 17pictures of my animals, I would have done that, but they 18didn't tell me that was an option. 19 I am Dr. Doug Aspros, I am the president of the 20American Veterinary Medical Association, and a companion 21and exotic animal practitioner in Westchester County, 22New York, part of the New York City metro area. 23 AVMA has been asked to set the stage for this 24discussion today at the workshop to present the 25ecosystem in which companion animals and their owners18 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551find medical services, including the dispensing of 2animal drugs. As you shall see, this is a wide, divergent 3and fragmented system, on all sides, including the client, 4the patient and the providers. 5 A little bit about AVMA. AVMA has a little over 682,000 members, which comprises about 83 percent of all 7the veterinarians in the United States. About 61 8percent of them practice on companion animals, that 9means that at least part of their practice is on 10companion animals. If you look at this pie chart, some of 11the companion animal practitioners are in what we call mixed 12practice, meaning that there are some livestock patients 13that are being cared for in the practice, as well as 14companion animals. Remember, these are self-reported 15numbers. The figures may not quite add up, nearly 25 16percent of our members don't list a species affiliation, 17either because they don't practice clinical medicine, or 18because they don't like to fill out surveys. 19 About two-thirds of households in the U.S. owned 20one or more pets in 2011. Of those pet-only households, 21almost two-thirds own more than one pet. All of these 22data come from the AVMA's U.S. Pet and Demographic 23Survey Book from 2012. It is the largest scale survey 24of U.S. households conducted every five years and 25there's some data I'll present a little later on that19 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551comes from the same studies. 2 These patients, these veterinarians, practice in 3approximately 25,000 different practices. We said 4earlier, there are about 50,000, roughly, small 5animal -- I'm going to switch back and forth between 6companion and small animal. Companion animals are for 7our purposes dogs, cats, birds, reptiles, ferrets, 8rabbits and rodents, but inside of AVMA, when we talk 9about companion animals, horses that don't work, 10pleasure horses, are considered companion animals, but 11for the purpose of today, I don't think we're talking 12about horses in any way. 13 These 50,000 veterinarians provide services in 1425,000 or more practices, meaning that the average size 15practice has one veterinarian, since there are multiple 16practices with multiple veterinarians. These practices 17are quite diverse. They're diverse in the size of the 18practice, the number of veterinarians and staff. In 19the species that are catered to, we talked about how wide 20the companion animal practice could be, but there are 21practices that only do cats, there are practices that do 22just cats and dogs, there are practices that do only birds 23and exotic species. 24 These practices are in rural, suburban and urban 25settings, all of which provide different resources and20 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551opportunities both for the practice and their clientele. 2Mobile clinics to multi-practice sites. So, 3veterinarians can be one person in a car or a truck, 4they can be large, large, large practices. Primary care 5to specialty care. Veterinarians, by and large, in 6companion animal practice provide general care, meaning 7that veterinarians do everything from taking care of 8happy and well puppies and kittens to major surgeries 9and, of course, at the end, perhaps to euthanasia. 10 Specialty care these days is on the rise. There 11are more and more specialty practices where 12veterinarians do just what they do, just ophthalmology, 13just surgery, and not provide general care. And, of 14course, routine care and emergency care. One of my 15practices does just after-hours, weekend and emergency 16care, no primary care at all. And then finally, private 17to corporate to not-for-profit to university practices. 18 So, these are the kinds of animals we're talking 19about, dogs and cats and birds, ferrets, rabbits, 20rodents and reptiles. The total veterinary visits, and 21these are every five years, again this is from the AVMA's 22U.S. Pet Demographic Surveys. The number of veterinary 23visits for dogs has been going up as dog ownership has as 24well. The number of cat visits, particularly over the 25past ten years, has not only peaked, but has been on the21 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551way down, and there are a lot of reasons for that, some 2of which we don't understand. The total visits for 3birds has been on the decline, and bird ownership, 4actually, has been on the decline. This slide shows the 5mean veterinary visits per year. The average dog visits 6the veterinarian about one and a half times a year. The 7average cat doesn't get to the veterinarian every year. 8Birds get there when they actually have problems. And 9specialty, meaning all of the other kinds of exotic 10animals, even less than that, even fewer times than that. 11 So, we're talking about veterinarians and drugs. 12So, what do veterinarians know, how do veterinarians get 13educated to do the services, provide the services that 14we do? Veterinary education programs are accredited by 15the AVMA's Council on Education, which is a member of 16the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, under 17the authority of the USDE. Most or all college curricula 18include one or more veterinary pharmacology courses. 19 While pharmacy is not mentioned by name in the 20standards for accreditation, the basic and applied 21principles of pharmacology are covered throughout the 22four years of the curriculum, in both pre-clinical and, 23of course, in the clinical years of programs. Students 24receive a firm foundation in biology, biochemistry, 25pharmacology, medicine and therapeutics in a wide range22 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551of species. At the end, in the licensing test, the North 2American Veterinary Licensing Exam covers material on 3therapeutics in dogs, cats, pigs, horses, cows, birds 4and exotic pet species. 5 Veterinarians operate in all jurisdictions under 6what's called the VCPR, the Veterinarian-Client-Patient- 7Relationship. The VCPR is a recognized obligation both 8in the AVMA's Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics 9and in state and federal law. The VCPR requires 10sufficient knowledge of the patient and when we're 11talking about companion animals, in almost all cases, 12examination; the veterinarian advising the client; 13diagnosing and prescribing; advice; the veterinarian's 15obligation to keep written records, and to provide 16information and options for emergency care and 17follow-up. 18 To put this in context, in routine veterinary 19practice, about 17 percent of revenues -- now we're 20talking revenues, not bottom line -- in companion animal 21exclusive practices are Rx drugs, and another five 22percent are non-Rx drugs and pet products. And this 23varies to some extent by species. If you look at dogs, 24it's not that drugs have been over the past 25 years 25actually a decreasing source of practice revenues, as 23 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551physical exams, vaccines and laboratory tests and other 2diagnostics have become a more important part of 3veterinary practice. For cats, the same thing holds 4true. Cats have been vaccinated less often, if you 5look at the numbers over the past ten years. And so 6more of what veterinarians do are physical examinations 7and all of the services there attendant to diagnosing. 8And for birds, most of what we do is examinations, and 9when we look at grooming there, it's mostly nail 10trimming. 11 How do veterinarians get drugs? Well, they get 12them two ways: They either get them directly from the 13manufacturer or through a distributor. The 14manufacturers may have several distributors that they 15work with, but we'll go through that later. I think that 16a number of other presenters will talk about how that 17works. 18 Regulation and oversight of the veterinary 19practitioners, and Adrian Hochstadt will be talking 20further about this, but just to set the stage for it, 21licensure requirements for veterinary practices are set 22by the states. State licensing boards have the 23authority to suspend or revoke a veterinarian's license 24for unprofessional conduct or other infractions. The 25state veterinary medical boards, of course, enforce the24 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551state practice acts, examine prospective licensees, set 2the requirements, define unprofessional conduct, 3investigate breaches and, of course, discipline 4violators. 5 If consumers have complaints, if clients have 6complaints, they have many avenues to have their 7complaints heard. They can take complaints of 8negligence or other unprofessional conduct to a wide 9variety of places, including the state licensing board, 10state veterinary medical associations, the state AGs, 11departments of consumer affairs, and even to local or 12state courts. 13 Veterinarians have, in all states, as part of 14veterinary practice, the authority to dispense drugs and 15pharmaceuticals for their patients. And, of course, 16veterinary prescribing and dispensing are also covered 17under regulations from FDA and DEA. 18 Finally, veterinary clinics are just one of many 19channels for pharmaceuticals sold in the U.S. to 20companion animals and their owners. Please keep in mind 21as we go through this day that veterinarians primarily 22dispense drugs and pharmaceuticals to ensure the health 23and welfare of their animal patients. We would be wise 24to remember this dictum as we go through the rest of 25today's presentations.25 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 Thank you. 2 (Applause.) 3 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you, Dr. Aspros. 4 Our next presentation will be given by Dr. Paul 5Pion, president and co-founder of the Veterinary 6Information Network. 7 Dr. Pion? 8 DR. PION: Good morning. 9 So, I have been asked to give an overview of how 10medications get to consumers, and a look at how the market 11has evolved. So, the first question I asked was, why me? 12Probably the least likely person in this room to be 13giving this presentation. I'm guessing nobody else 14wanted to give it. 15 I've never worked in either drug manufacturing 16or distribution, and I'm actually a former academic and 17researcher, and currently the co-founder and president 18of Veterinary Information Network, which is a purely 19subscription-based information service. You can think 20of a mixture between Google and Facebook for 21veterinarians. And we actually accept no advertising 22and no sponsorship, purely supported by the membership 23fees of our colleagues. 24 My background really is and my passions are in 25medicine and information, the generation, quality and26 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551delivery of that information. 2 So, VIN, as part of our services we offer our own 3news service, the VIN News Service, and we did some 4articles. The Chairman, who I thank for giving my talk 5before I gave it, alluded to the fact that there is 6diversion of drugs from the prescribed and official 7supply chains, and our news service did some 8investigative reporting into that gray market diversion, 9and I think that Stephanie and Elizabeth read those 10articles and contacted us and that's how we got here. 11 So, my disclosures for conflict of interest, I'm 12certainly pro-veterinary, pro-pet owner, pro-patient, 13pro-fairness and pro-informed choice. Most of the 14lecturing I do is on information, and I look at 15information as its own economy. It's got manufacturers, 16distributors and consumers on the wholesale and retail 17level, and to convert that to a slide for this talk, we 18just had to look at pet medications certainly have the 19same players and channels. These are the players that 20I consider play a part in the information economy of 21veterinary medicine, and if we look at pet medications, 22then we would add the drug retailers, both online and 23big box type. 24 When we're looking at any economy, we should be 25looking at in our situation the goals, what's the27 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551currency we use, what are the ethics and what's at 2stake? And for information, I'm very much interested in 3what's the quantity of that information, what's causing 4us to generate more or less, and what's the quality of 5that information? And when we're talking about pet 6medications, I hope we also very much consider the 7safety issues. In any economy, it's simple -- we all 8learn it's simple supply and demand. And for pet 9medications, certainly we're here to talk about how 10that affects pricing. 11 I had to do some Googling to figure out the size 12of this market, and if I just look at individual, I've 13heard between $6 and $10 billion as an estimate of the 14market. I've heard the human market is up to about $250 15billion. So, and if you look at this, looking at a 16couple of companies, and there's people in the room who 17can tell us these numbers certainly more accurately than 18I can. Just looking at Pfizer Animal Health, we're 19talking a couple of percent. This animal health part 20also includes livestock and all the other animals that 21don't include what we're talking about. So, I think 22we're down in the one to two percent of what the human 23market would be. 24 What products are we talking about? Well, for 25the most part, everybody here is interested about what28 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551we would consider mega products. So, these are the flea 2and tick preventions, this is the heartworm preventions, 3and then there's everything else. And the mega products 4tend to be continual use. So, like any consumer product, 5people like to get into things that people are going to 6buy over and over again, whether they are sick or not, and 7if they're sick on an ongoing basis. They're dealing with 8things that are over-the-counter. The flea and tick 9prevention tend to be you don't need a prescription, and 10the heartworm preventions you do need a prescription 11and those are FDA-approved. 12 The \"everything else\" category includes both 13categories. They could be short-term things like 14antibiotics to treat an infection, or they could be 15chronic use such as pain relief, et cetera, and those 16tend to be more attractive and profitable for the 17manufacturers. 18 One big question in pet drugs is, is it worth 19seeking registration approval for a specific veterinary 20product? So, what else do we need to know to answer 21that question? A large percentage of the medications 22prescribed by veterinarians are not labeled for the 23patient species they're targeted for. They're the same 24medications and formulations that you and your 25grandmother are taking. There are several differences:29 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551the indications, the safety, the dosing, the drug 2interactions, many of them differ from grandma and between 3species. You know? A dog is not a little person, and a 4cat is not a little dog. The physiology and the 5pharmacology are very different, and that's what a lot 6of the veterinary education is focused upon. 7 As we've seen, it's a much smaller market, and 8the research possibilities and NIH funding for 9veterinary research are much less than in human 10medicine. So, the information sources -- a lot of these 11things are figured out by colleagues in academia, in 12practice, and shared through literature, conferences and 13other media that are generally not explored by typical 14medical education or a pharmacy education. 15 I mean, I am by training a veterinary 16cardiologist and I can't tell you how many times I run 17into colleagues, physicians in all trades of life who 18look at me and go, snakes have hearts? So, I think it's 19a whole different world for them. Some of my best 20patients were snakes. 21 So, one of the questions that Stephanie and 22Elizabeth put to me to think about was the growth trends 23and future projections. I've got no idea. So, an 24honest answer. 25 So, like any supply chain, we'll start looking30 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551at the supply chain and how I think we've gotten to the 2current situation. We've got manufacturers. The 3manufacturers sell to the veterinarian, as Doug talked 4about, either through distributors or directly, through 5distributor reps or manufacturer reps. And classically, 6as I said before, most consumers and their pets got 7their medications from the veterinarian. 8 One thing to really make clear is that the local 9pharmacist has always been a big part of this chain. 10It's not new for veterinarians to be writing 11prescriptions. And when I was in practice full-time, 12the relationship with a local pharmacist was a big, 13important thing because a lot of the formulations we 14use are different, and the pills and the solutions need 15to be cut up and diluted down into concentrations and 16sizes that a cat and dog or a bird or a snake can take. 17These are not easily available unless you're producing 18them yourself within your practice, or dealing with a 19good compounding pharmacy or a local pharmacist that 20you have a good relationship with. 21 In the '90s, with the advent of the Internet, we 22started to see the appearance of the online pharmacies. 23And the question that arose was, how were they getting 24products? Because the manufacturers and the distributors 25had -- for reasons we'll get into -- stated that these31 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551products, many of them would only be sold into the 2veterinary channel, because they believed -- and there's 3many reasons we'll talk about -- that the veterinarian was 4the most educated to be able to decide when they should 5be used and which should be used, and to detect 6problems. And so, they wanted their products to get a 7good reputation and be used properly. 8 So, there appears the gray market. And the 9question arises, how did those middlemen within the gray 10market, who are aggregating product, get the product? 11And that's the investigative reporting that the 12VIN News Service did, and it turns out, from everywhere. 13I'm embarrassed to say that there were veterinarians who 14buy product beyond their personal needs, aggregate it 15and sell it to these middlemen for not much profit we 16found out. We did that by creating our own diverter of 17only over-the-counter products, so to keep it legal. 18 Manufacturer and distributor reps, it turns out, 19are a big part of this. How high it goes up that 20they're encouraged to do this, to make their numbers, 21and to increase their income, we don't know. But we know 22that they're a big part of this. And there's a lot of 23indications that manufacturers, despite saying that they 24don't want to sell into these channels, and 25distributors, are doing so directly as well.32 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 The latest players would be the big box stores, 2such as the Walmarts and Targets, and the big chain 3pharmacies, like CVS and Walgreens, who have 4recognized that there is a good market in these 5products, although we recognize very tiny. So why would 6they be interested in this? And as you'll see, they're 7probably getting the product by the same mechanisms, and 8the reason that they're interested is because I think 9for them, it's the latest milk in the back of the 10supermarket. It's the way to get more consumers in the 11store rather than a true interest in pursuing pet 12health. 13 So, there's another part of this chain. 14Recently, in the last decade, manufacturers, 15distributors and other providers have come in to provide 16technologies to veterinary practice to give them their 17own online pharmacy presence, and be able to compete 18with some of the other markets. There is kind of a 19second gray zone that came in, it's not really a gray 20market. And this involves, it started with a company 21called VetCentric, who is now owned by Vets First 22Choice, and they had to change their model, because what 23they were doing was they would make an online store for 24the veterinarian, and the veterinarian's client would 25purchase from there, and then VetCentric could pay them a33 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551commission. And several pharmacy boards saw this as a 2kickback, so they had to change that model. There's another 3group today, VetSource, who is doing something similar. 4But both of these involve kind of phantom inventories and 5virtual transactions to make it the veterinarian's product 6actually, so it looks like on paper actually they're paying 7for the product and getting their mark-up above it. So, 8this is just another market out there. 9 So, a big question is, what has this change and 10this gray market and being able to get product through 11other outlets done to consumer purchasing patterns? 12Well, obviously, if most of it was going through 13veterinary practices before, and then these markets are 14emerging, things have moved in the direction towards the 15right, and the market has moved over. How much, I don't 16have an idea for, maybe somebody else on the panels will 17give us an idea of where they think that split is today. 18 I can give you a better idea of sort of the 19veterinary thoughts and reactions to this evolution. 20Manufacturers now come in two flavors. So, Bayer, a 21couple of years ago, decided to come out of the closet 22and openly sell to the other chains, and admit that 23they were selling to the big box stores and the online 24pharmacies directly. The remainder of the manufacturers 25have remained in the closet and still claim to be34 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551selling only through veterinary channels. 2 So, manufacturers are a big, important part of 3this market. We need them to be developing new 4products. We need them to be our partners, and to work 5with veterinarians. But I think due to distrust that has 6grown over the years and disbelief in the honesty of 7their statements, there is a strained relationship 8between the veterinary profession and the manufacturers. 9 Distributors, for the most part, I think have 10remained in the good stead of the veterinary profession 11and trusted. The distributor reps, although I think 12many are trying to squeeze them out of the market, they 13still are seen by the veterinarian as their friend and a 14big source of drug and new product information. And I 15think that the realization that they're involved in the 16diversion of product has given them a little bit of a 17black eye in the profession. 18 The local pharmacist is still a very important 19part of the veterinary practice and relationship 20locally. Obviously the gray market diverters are not 21viewed as very ethical, or the veterinarian's friend. 22 The online pharmacies, I would believe, and I 23think most veterinarians believe that the convenience of 24purchasing product in the Costcos and Walmarts will diminish 25their market, and they will not go into oblivion, but35 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551probably are the ones greatly threatened by the big box 2stores and the big pharmacy chains becoming interested. 3And although I think that there's a mixed relationship 4with the pharmacist within those chains, I think there 5is a great fear that they're coming to this market 6purely for financial reasons, without true concern for 7the health of pets and properly educating consumers. 8 There's lots of issues, I'm sure we'll get into 9today, as far as being able to advise. We all go to the 10pharmacy, and what do we fear? Getting called into the 11counseling booth, and being told how to swallow that 12pill. But for a pet, that's a very big issue. There's 13no sense in giving a pet -- especially a cat, for 14example -- a medication if the pet owner can't get the 15medication in. That's classically been a lot of why a 16veterinary practice has been the best place for 17administration, at least getting the first dosing, 18because the pet owner needs a lot of help. And then 19afterwards they're calling and they can't get it in 20and the medication is no good if it doesn't get to the 21patient. 22 The other thing that is a concern is that 23pharmacists are not traditionally trained in veterinary 24pharmacology, and all the nuances that I referred to 25before. And in the panel we can talk to many examples36 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551where this becomes a very important issue. So, there 2is a danger to the pet health if the person dispensing 3can't recognize problems, can't inform about interactions, 4and even doesn't understand the proper dosing and is 5trying to make a dog a little person, or if there are no 6dogs, a cat a little dog. 7 So, how did we get here? Well, I think there's 8a very logical reason as to how we got here. We said 9it's a much smaller market, and so we have a 10manufacturer who has high costs in getting a product to 11market. So, how can they effectively market it? Well, 12you turn to the veterinarian and you make him feel like 13a hero. And I have been to many releases of new products 14at big conferences that go exactly this way in that we 15believe the manufacturer saying that the only way that 16this medication can be used properly is being sold 17through veterinary clinic, with your expertise. And, of 18course, there's the carrot for the veterinarian of 19feeling important, and having a new product to truly 20treat. Some of these were wonderful new advents. If 21anybody has been hurt by the new flea medications, it's 22the fleas of the world. They're just, they're under 23attack. The veterinarians were not immune from seeing 24that this was extra revenue coming into their practice. 25 The manufacturers also had control over the37 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551distributors in which they would look at the major 2distributors and say, if you handle our mega product, 3you can't handle our competitor's mega product, and I 4think this did a lot to artificially inhibit 5competition. 6 The other players, just as happens in our free 7market society, is if there's money to be made, others 8are going to try to get into the market. So, I think it 9really was kind of a predictable reaction down the chain 10that all these things would happen. How much the 11manufacturers planned this and how much it happened as 12unintended consequences, I don't know. But to look at 13kind of the chain of events, the manufacturers would 14look at it as advertising new products and 15pharmaceuticals for pets as too expensive to do direct 16to consumers. And I think if we don't keep that in mind 17and that cost gets added to the manufacturer's costs, we 18may actually see the opposite effect of what we're 19intending here in that we will see prices go up from the 20manufacturer, who is truly the one who sets the bottom 21line on pricing. They set the floor. 22 They promise veterinarians exclusivity because 23they were the only ones who were qualified for these 24products to be sold through. They would demand 25distributor exclusivity, and that would also keep the38 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551price up. And they made happy, feeling-like-hero 2veterinarians, but they also made dependent 3veterinarians, because we saw how much of their gross 4revenues have come to be seen as drawing on these 5products. To be honest, I think veterinarians should 6focus a lot more on service, because product is not what 7we were trained to sell. And it made happy clients. 8 But once the brand was established, the gray 9market starts to appear, and what this did was expand 10the market. It reached consumers who didn't go to 11veterinary clinics. It didn't really lower prices much, 12because it was still all mostly coming through 13veterinary chains, and so there wasn't much of a margin, 14because veterinarians weren't marking them up as much 15as people believe, in general. The big box entry, I don't 16know if manufacturers predicted this. So was this an 17end game for them, they were waiting for it, or is this a 18note on their case? 19 For the veterinary profession, I see it as a big 20detriment, overall, this evolution, because I think it's 21damaged the public's trust in the veterinary profession. 22The veterinary profession has a need to supplement the 23inability to charge adequately for services. It costs 24veterinarians equivalent to what it costs a human 25hospital to maintain that hospital, in many cases, and39 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551to provide those services across. And yes, they have 2sustained the ability to charge affordable pricing for 3services by supplementing with product fees. But I think 4when you have a situation where you're advertising to the 5public that veterinarians are overcharging you for these 6products, the public is going to start to ask what else 7are they overcharging me for. 8 I think also, veterinarians are in trouble now. 9That's a part of the story that hasn't been told. 10There's an article that just came out in the New York 11Times on lawyers, and the oversupply and the 12educational debt. And the article ended being about 13lawyers, but it started out saying, don't feel so bad if 14you're a lawyer, because veterinarians have it much 15worse. Right now, a veterinarian's educational debt is 16like 2.3 times their starting salary, and most people 17will tell you, you don't want to go beyond one time your 18starting salary. So, if you think lawyers have 19problems, veterinarians have it worse. 20 I think that there's a danger here if you stress 21the veterinary profession too much further here that 22with the increased competition you'll damage quality of 23service available to the public. As Doug pointed out, in 24the end, we're talking about trade, but we can't forget 25that really the most important players here are the pet 40 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551owner and the pet. We really need to look at what we're 2going to do here and the intended and unintended 3consequences and what impact it will have upon them. 4 Thank you. 5 (Applause.) 6 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you, Dr. Pion. 7 We will now take about a ten-minute break, and 8we will meet back here at 10:00 for the first panel. 9 (Whereupon, there was a recess in the 10proceedings.) 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 For The Record, Inc.

He is 10the vice president and general counsel for Novartis 11Animal Health. 12 MR. VRANIAN: Good morning. First I would like 13to thank the FTC and Chairman Leibowitz for including 14Novartis Animal Health in this workshop. We are very 15pleased to be able to participate and to provide 16information about our business and some perspective as 17it relates to the issues that we're discussing today. 18 I'm Clint Vranian, general counsel for Novartis 19Animal Health US, Inc. We are a division of Novartis AG, 20the pharmaceutical firm. As you already may be aware, 21Novartis is a world leader in the research and 22development of products focused on the health and 23well-being of patients. Across our organization, our 24driving force is leveraging innovation to meet unmet 25medical needs. At Novartis Animal Health, we extend this43 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551innovation to provide solutions which extend and enhance 2the quality of life of our patients, our veterinary 3patients, our companion animals, pets and their pet 4owners. 5 Today's workshop centers on, as you heard, the 6companion animal or the small animal side of the 7veterinary market, those that we use on our pets. Novartis' 8companion animal portfolio -- and Dr. Pion talked a little 9bit about this -- like many manufacturers, consists of two 10categories: parasiticides and therapeutics. Parasiticides, 11which represent the bulk of the market today, are those 12medications or solutions that affect internal and external 13parasites on our pets, things like fleas, ticks, heartworms, 14chewing lice, as we heard earlier. These can take a variety 15of forms. Some of them are FDA-regulated, some of them are 16EPA-regulated. They can be systemic, developed specifically 17for companion animals or reformulated pesticides from the 18agricultural field. 19 Therapeutic medications are products that 20address medical conditions, they're much more akin to 21human medications. They will address the medical 22condition of the pet, such as arthritis, allergic 23dermatitis, Addison's Disease and other conditions that 24can challenge the pet's quality of life. These are 25largely FDA products and they represent treatments that44 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551pets did not enjoy just a decade ago. Although these 2medications are essential, they represent a minority of 3the market for animal health products. Animal health 4therapeutic products, as I've said, are largely FDA- 5regulated prescription medications. 6 At Novartis Animal Health, our entire portfolio -- 7parasiticides and therapeutics -- falls towards the FDA 8side of the spectrum. As a division of a globally 9respected health care company, we're a company with a 10strong FDA prescription pedigree. Consistent with this 11pedigree, our product portfolio which places the health and 12well-being of our pets at the center of our mission that 13is also FDA regulated. While today some of our products, 14a small subset are indeed non-prescription, we've founded 15our business on prescription medicine and today our 16portfolio followed suit. This underscores our primary 17objective, which is a commitment to and history of 18delivering innovative medicines through the veterinary 19channel. We introduced the first commercially successful 20prescription flea medication in the 1990s. Since then our 21focus on FDA prescription medicine has not changed. 22 Now, prescription medications by definition must 23be administered in the context of their efficacy and 24their safety. It is essential to ensure that these 25products are prescribed by trained professionals that45 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551are educated on the risks and benefits of these 2innovative technologies. 3 The unique circumstances of a pet, of an 4individual pet, setting aside its species or breed or 5things endemic to the specific pet can impact the 6administration, efficacy and safety of these products. 7This is why the Veterinarian-Client-Patient-Relationship 8plays a critical role for an FDA-focused company like 9ours. Appropriate therapies require familiarity with 10pharmacology, adequate education and a thorough 11understanding of the unique circumstances of an 12individual patient. 13 The Veterinarian-Client-Patient-Relationship is 14essential to ensure the optimal application of these 15innovations that can help prolong and save pets' lives. 16Accordingly, we bring our products to consumers and 17their pets exclusively through practicing veterinarians. 18We consider these highly skilled professionals to be our 19partners in addressing unmet medical needs. We have 20found no better way to ensure that innovative science is 21best leveraged to the benefit of our companion animals. 22 We understand that the issues presented today 23during this workshop will go right to the pocketbooks of 24consumers and that our concerns are to better understand 25distribution practices and analyze how these may affect46 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551consumer choice and price competition. Questions will be 2posed here that ask essentially whether all pet 3medications should be required to be made available to 4consumers in different ways than they are today. Novartis 5Animal Health does not have an answer to this question for 6all companies. Nor can we take a position that would speak 7for all products and all product portfolios. But as a 8company with an FDA pedigree and founded on delivering 9innovation to unmet medical needs for the sole purpose of 10preserving and enhancing the quality of life for our 11patients, we believe that doing so through the Veterinarian- 12Client-Patient-Relationship creates efficiencies that 13serve this objective. 14 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you, Mr. Vranian. 15 Our next panelist is Michael Hinckle. He is a 16partner with K&L Gates law firm. 17 MR. HINCKLE: Thank you. 18 Good morning. I would like to thank the FTC for 19the opportunity to come and present on behalf of my generic 20drug clients. I am primarily an FDA regulatory 21attorney. I serve as outside counsel for a number of 22pharmaceutical companies. A number of those are generic 23drug companies, and some of those are in the generic 24animal drug space. I know now you're thinking, \"I didn't 25even know there was a generic animal drug space.\" But47 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551there is, and I think that one thing that we would like 2to present today is a question and then maybe 3think about what those answers would be. 4 The question, I think, on a lot of people's 5minds, certainly my clients' minds is: Why are consumers 6of animal drugs, particularly FDA-regulated companion 7animal drugs, not seeing the same degree of savings 8through the generic drug process that they see, say, on 9the human drug side? I'm sure there are a number of 10reasons. I suspect one of those is not that pet owners 11are just not price sensitive and don't care how much 12their drugs cost. I think they probably do. I think 13certainly in this economy, almost everyone cares. I 14also think that when you look at our experience 15with the human drug side, where there has been 16tremendous pressure to try to contain costs, one of the 17areas that has certainly been a successful area in that 18cost-containing effort has been the generic drug 19industry. 20 So, why is it that we don't have generic animal 21drugs in the same way? Well, is it because the FDA 22doesn't have a way to approve them? Well, that's really 23not the case. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act 24does set forth a pathway for approving generic animal 25drugs. In fact, it uses the same bioequivalence48 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551criteria that's used for human drugs, they use the same 2statistical criteria, the same confidence intervals and 3the same type of bioequivalent studies. So, certainly 4the opportunity is there. There are some other reasons 5why, and I hear these from my clients and see them, as 6to why they're not entering the market and why you don't 7see the same cost savings. I congratulate the FTC on 8addressing these issues quite well with these panels. 9 With this panel in particular being the 10distribution panel, there's a couple of things that I 11would like to comment on. One is that as a generic 12competitor thinking about entering the market -- the fact 13that has been mentioned several times -- the veterinary 14distribution channel, the channel to get right into the 15veterinary clinics, is often times foreclosed by way of 16exclusive arrangements that don't allow a generic 17competitor to easily enter that market. 18 The second one, and maybe not so obvious, is 19that you would think, as a generic company, well, if I 20can't get into the veterinary channels, can't I use sort 21of the standard prescription drug wholesaler channels 22that are used on the human side that primarily serve the 23retail pharmacies and online pharmacies, and mail order 24pharmacies. The problem there, again, is an access 25problem, and a bit of a demand problem. In order to, as49 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551a generic company, if I want to try to get my product 2into a major wholesaler, say a Cardinal or Amerisource 3Bergen, that services the retail market, I've got to be 4able to convince them that there's actually a market at 5the retail market. 6 One thing that I would say that probably will 7surprise you as someone representing the generic side is 8one of the real problems is a lack of brand products at 9the retail pharmacy level. This may also surprise you, 10the fact is the generic industry -- and a robust generic 11industry -- relies on a robust innovator industry. There 12has to be an innovator product in order for there 13to be a generic product. A real substitutable generic 14relies on the brand product being prescribed, and then 15substituting the generic. Without the brands in the 16pharmacies, there's no demand. There's no reason for a 17mainline standard wholesaler to carry the product. 18 So, I hope what I'll bring a little bit to this 19discussion is that if we're going to provide real 20competition and lower prices, like we've seen on the 21human side, with generic animal drugs, there needs to be 22a little bit of a leveling of the playing field so that 23these generic companies can have access, both to 24veterinary clinics, through the veterinary channels, and 25also through the retail pharmacies and mail order50 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551pharmacies, through these standard wholesale 2distribution channels. 3 So, once again, thank you for your time. 4 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you, Mr. Hinckle. 5 Our next panelist is John Powers. He is the 6executive vice president of Drs. Foster & Smith. 7 MR. POWERS: Good morning. I would like to 8thank Stephanie and Elizabeth for moderating this panel 9this morning, and for inviting us here today. 10 I have had the good fortune of working in the 11pet supplies and pet pharmacy industry for over 35 12years. My experience includes being vice president of 13marketing and merchandising, as well as the vice 14president of operations both in the direct marketing 15brick-and-mortar business and the Internet business, 16all on a national scale. I have also taught marketing 17for several years at the university level. As Stephanie 18mentioned, I've been now 20 years as vice president of 19Drs. Foster & Smith. 20 There are three main points I would like to make 21here this morning. One, because of our background 22history, we are uniquely positioned to fill pet 23prescriptions. Two, there's a real dichotomy between pet 24prescription portability and restricted distribution. 25And thirdly, the restricted distribution is both51 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551illogical and untenable. 2 Drs. Foster & Smith is now in its thirtieth year 3of providing quality pet products to pet owners. The 4company was founded by two veterinarians, Dr. Race 5Foster and Dr. Marty Smith, who continue today to own 6and operate our business. Our pet pharmacy is an 7integral part of our operation. The Drs. Foster & 8Smith pet pharmacy is both Vet-VIPPS and PCAB certified. 9In addition to Dr. Foster and Dr. Smith, we have staff 10veterinarians as part of our company. We also have a 11trained staff of fully licensed, full-time pharmacists, 12certified pharmacy techs, and veterinary techs. In 29 13years, our company has been dispensing over-the-counter 14and prescription medications, therefore filling thousands 15of prescriptions. We have never had a single state or 16federal dispensing violation in our history, and we're 17proud of that record. 18 Drs. Foster & Smith, therefore, has all the 19necessary pharmacy certifications and accreditations, and 20educated licensed staff of both veterinarians and 21pharmacists working together, and a stellar record. The 22question that I would like to ask is, then, what is the 23justification for restricting pet prescription products 24from us? 25 Second, prescription portability is one of the52 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551main subjects of these workshops. Later this afternoon, 2an entire panel is devoted to that subject. I would 3like to emphasize the point that true prescription 4portability cannot exist within the context of 5restricted distribution. Writing a prescription for a 6particular drug and having that manufacturer of the drug 7severely limit where the drug can be sold, to only a 8veterinarian's office, has the real effect of denying 9true portability. The result is that consumers have far 10fewer choices of where to fill that prescription, and the 11ultimate result is higher prices. The AVMA guidelines 12state, a veterinarian should honor a client's request for 13a prescription in lieu of dispensing. The AVMA also 14talks about using Vet-VIPPS as a way of ensuring a 15pharmacy's credentials. I would like to remind everyone 16here this morning that Drs. Foster & Smith is a 17Vet-VIPPS certified pharmacy. 18 Third, it is clear that the current method of 19restricted distribution isn't working for anyone. Not 20the manufacturers, who spend an inordinate amount of 21time attempting to police the system and struggle with 22chain of custody. Not the veterinarians, who deal with 23conflict among colleagues and act as pharmacists as 24opposed to practitioners. And not the consumers, who 25pay higher prices and the result is often poorer pet53 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551health. 2 There's a tangential issue that should be of 3concern to all of us, that is the real possibility of 4product recalls. In the last several years, some of the 5best known consumer companies in the United States have 6faced product recalls. Baby toys, medical devices, 7automotives. In fact, in the third quarter of 2011, 8there were 35 million units of pharmaceuticals recalled 9in this country. The only real way of controlling chain 10of custody is for manufacturers to deal directly with 11companies like ours. Selling directly to a pharmacy 12retailer like Foster & Smith rather than being an 13impediment to safety actually enhances consumer safety 14when it comes to drug recalls. 15 The current system of restricted distribution is 16also illogical. Why should the distribution of pet 17pharmaceuticals differ from the human model? Our 18pharmacy has purchased and filled prescriptions from 19companies like Pfizer for human heart medications like 20Lipitor. Yet the same manufacturer denies us the ability 21to purchase drugs like arthritic medication for dogs. 22Does it make any sense that my pharmacy can dispense 23heart medication for you, but not arthritis medication 24for your pet? 25 Let me relate a personal story. My young54 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551daughter was diagnosed with human growth deficiency. 2The endocrinologist put her on a growth hormone 3treatment. That is an injectable prescription drug 4that is directly shipped to our home. When we need a 5prescription refilled, that is sent again to our home. 6We can inject this into my daughter, but I can't buy a 7refill for pet medication anywhere but a vet's office or 8through a veterinarian. 9 To recap, let me make just three quick points: 10Drs. Foster & Smith is uniquely qualified to fill 11prescriptions; portability without product availability 12is a sham; and restricted distribution just doesn't make 13sense. 14 Thank you. 15 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you, Mr. Powers. 16 Our next panelist is Andrew Bane. He is the 17chief operations officer for VetSource. 18 MR. BANE: Thank you, Stephanie, and good 19morning everyone. Again, my name is Andrew Bane and I 20am chief operating officer for VetSource. We appreciate 21the opportunity to participate in this panel today and 22offer our input and experience as the FTC considers 23these important issues. 24 For those of you who do not know, VetSource 25offers outsourced pharmacy services, as well as55 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551wholesale distribution services, for our contracted 2veterinary hospital customers. We hold pharmacy 3licenses in all 50 states, as well as wholesale 4distribution licenses in all required states. We are 5Vet-VIPPS accredited, and our outsource pharmacy services 6enable veterinarians to offer the convenience of home 7delivery directly to their clients. In essence, we 8operate a specialized central fill-like pharmacy that 9gives veterinarians an Internet presence. 10 We designed our business model similar to other 11business models that exist in the marketplace to operate 12as an extension of the veterinarian's pharmacy and to 13fit within the context of the current veterinary 14pharmaceutical network. This means that we do not 15acquire any of our products via the gray market. 16 Regarding the distribution of pet medications, 17we believe that veterinary medicine represents a special 18niche within the practice of pharmacy. As has been 19stated by other panelists, the medications, their unique 20dosing, side effect profiles and uses for the veterinary 21industry are very different from those in human use. 22 For these reasons, we believe it's a better 23standard of care, pet health care, to utilize health 24care professionals that have specific training in this 25area of medicine. Of course this includes56 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinarians, but it also includes specialists, for 2example, members of the Society of Veterinary Hospital 3Pharmacists, as well as other pharmacists who specialize 4in veterinary medicine and work closely with the 5prescribing veterinarians. 6 It's true from a regulatory perspective a 7pharmacy is a pharmacy. In other words, a pharmacy 8specializing in veterinary medications is required to 9operate under the same regulatory statutes as a pharmacy 10dispensing human medications. However, we know the 11practice of pharmacy is very broad. For example, human 12hospital pharmacy is recognized as different than 13retail. Specialty pharmacy and compounding pharmacy are 14also recognized specialties within the practice of 15pharmacy. Specific training is required to properly 16evaluate, dispense, educate and counsel pet owners on 17the proper use and administration of medications to 18different species of pets. 19 Because not all pharmacists receive this 20training in the course of their education, we believe 21veterinary pharmacy is also a specialty within the 22practice of pharmacy. Just as a DVM degree is not 23interchangeable with an MD degree, we feel that 24pharmacists trained only in human medicine is not 25interchangeable with a pharmacist specializing in57 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinary medicine. 2 Until this training gap is closed and the 3pharmacist-DVM relationship more closely models the 4pharmacist-MD relationship, we believe that some 5level of selective distribution by manufacturers or 6additional regulatory standards is warranted to ensure 7pet safety. I also think it's important to point out 8that restricted distribution is not unprecedented in 9human pharmacy. Some human medications requiring 10specialized knowledge for dispensing, counseling and 11management are only sold to specialty pharmacies that 12have demonstrated competency in supporting the proper 13use of those medications. 14 On the matter of gray market distribution of 15veterinary prescription products, we feel that this 16unregulated product trafficking has the potential to 17endanger pet health. The lack of regulatory oversight 18means that the appropriate mechanisms are not in place 19to ensure that prescription products are stored and 20shipped under their required conditions. This also means 21that there's a lack of transparency in the chain of 22custody of the products for the dispensing pharmacists 23as well as for the pet owner. Furthermore, this gray market 24distribution channel creates substantial risk of adulterated 25or counterfeit compounds being introduced 58 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551into the supply chain. 2 Generally, veterinarians are authorized to 3dispense prescription products via the respective 4veterinary practice acts of the states within which they 5practice. These acts require that the prescription 6dispensing by the veterinarian is to occur within the 7context of the valid Veterinarian-Client-Patient- 8Relationship. This requirement is violated when 9veterinarians wholesale products outside of the 10context of this relationship to other businesses. 11 Additionally, anyone reselling prescription 12products needs to be properly licensed according to the 13state boards of pharmacy, just as is required of 14legitimate wholesale veterinary distributors. We feel 15that gray market sales are occurring in violation of one 16or more statutes in nearly every state. Although the 17state boards are consumed with many pressing issues in 18their mission to protect the public health, we encourage 19them to revisit this issue in veterinary medicine and 20remind veterinarians that this practice is not approved 21or sanctioned. 22 Once again, we appreciate the FTC's invitation 23to participate in this workshop and we look forward to 24the ensuing discussion. 25 Thank you.59 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you, Mr. Bane. Our next 2panelist is Brad Dayton. He is the senior director of 3pharmacy for Ahold USA. 4 MR. DAYTON: Good morning. Thank you, Chairman 5Leibowitz and Stephanie for the opportunity to speak 6this morning. 7 I am a retail pharmacist, I have been in the 8retail pharmacy industry for 24 years. I started my 9career at a local chain that existed in the Washington, 10D.C. area, Peoples Drug. I worked for CVS Pharmacy and 11worked for Giant Pharmacy in this area. I am currently 12the senior director of pharmacy for Ahold USA. Most 13importantly for this conversation today, I am a pet 14owner, and I'm glad to learn this morning that I know 15what percentage I fall into. I am not part of the 47 16percent that one of our candidates mentioned, I am not 17part of the one percent, but I'm part of the seven 18percent, I have four pets. So, and all my pets are 19shelter pets, also, and I would love to have brought my 20animals today. 21 Ahold USA is a retail grocery-pharmacy 22combination. We operate stores up and down the east 23coast and the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions. We 24operate our stores under the banners of Stop & Shop, 25Martin's, and in this local market, Giant. Ahold is a60 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551$25 billion company. We're the fifth largest grocer in 2the United States. We operate 784 grocery stores and 565 3pharmacies. Our pharmacies are in 11 states and the 4District of Columbia, and in 2012, we'll fill 5approximately 27 million prescriptions. 6 So, the question is, why is a retail pharmacist 7interested in pet medications? A couple of points were 8brought up in presentations this morning, 63 percent of 9all Americans own pets. Very strange that between 60 10and 65 percent of our customers who shop our grocery 11store also shop our pet aisle. So, it is a natural 12offering that we can offer our customers more services 13such as being able to fill their pet medications. 14 We also -- as Dr. Pion pointed out -- fill many 15prescriptions today from the human supply chain for pet 16medications. However, we have limited ability to do 17that. We have basically three ways to fill 18prescriptions today for pets. One is from the human 19supply chain. Secondly, are the products that we do have 20available to us that are pet medications only. And 21third, we've had to partner with a mail order type 22pharmacy, PetCareRx, which is also a Vet-VIPPS certified 23mail order pharmacy; and our customers are able to drop 24their prescription off at our store or use our website 25to order their prescription, and then we deliver that61 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551prescription through the mail to them at home. 2Obviously, being a brick-and-mortar retail establishment, 3that is not our preferred method, but it at least allows 4us to play in the arena. 5 There have been questions raised this morning as 6if we are actually qualified to dispense pet medications 7as retail pharmacists. I would like to thank Dr. Pion 8for using the picture of the retail pharmacist. That was 9an Ahold pharmacist. So I was very happy when he said 10the part about the trusted partner, but then we ended up 11on the bad side of the equation where there were just 12dollar signs and the word \"danger.\" 13 Pharmacists are not 100 percent trained in vet 14medications. I agree with that completely. However, a 15pharmacist's experience, knowledge and education -- 16pharmacists go to school for six years, sometimes take 17up to two years of post-doctorate work -- you can use your 18education to develop and work with veterinarians on a 19regular basis. I've had many opportunities as a 20pharmacist myself, when I was presented with a 21prescription for an animal that, I'll be honest, was not 22quite sure of what that dose was. 23 A specific example with a horse -- a dose that 24would have killed a human being -- that I needed to go 25speak with the vet who wrote the prescription. So, the62 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551relationship does exist, and retail pharmacy wants to 2play in this space, not only to increase sales -- because 3let's face it, we are a business -- but we do care 4for our patients and animals are our patients, also. 5 What I think the future should look like? I 6think pet owners should have the right to choose where 7they get their prescriptions filled, whether it be a 8retail establishment, a mail order pharmacy or their 9local vet. I believe that competition will only help 10prices for pet owners. And I also learned this morning 11that the average dog only makes it to the vet 1.6 times 12a year. I need to talk to my wife, because it seems like 13we go many more times than that. 14 So, in conclusion, I would like to thank the FTC 15again for the opportunity to speak here, and just to 16reiterate, pharmacists are qualified and we would like 17to play in this space. 18 Thank you. 19 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you, Mr. Dayton. 20 Our next panelist is Gregg Jones. He is the 21compliance manager for the National Association of 22Boards of Pharmacy. 23 MR. JONES: Good morning. Thank you for the 24opportunity to be here to speak with you about some of 25the observations that the NABP, National Association of63 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551Boards of Pharmacy, has made. I, too, am a pet owner. I 2consider myself having five children -- three daughters 3and a German Shepherd and a Spaniel. I love those dogs 4more as I get older. They stay home with me and watch 5ball games and seem to love it, and they don't ask for 6money or anything. 7 NABP primarily assists its members, boards of 8pharmacy, in protecting public health. That's our 9primary mission. We issue the Vet-VIPPS accreditation 10to online pharmacies that dispense prescription drugs 11for companion animals. What we do is offer an assurance 12to the consumer that they are buying their medications 13from a licensed pharmacy and a pharmacy that complies 14with state and federal laws. Our pharmacies that are 15accredited undergo an extensive application process, 16and once they're accredited, they undergo an annual 17compliance review and every three years are re-surveyed 18to ensure their compliance with the standards. 19 I would like to touch on a few of the 20observations that we have made regarding the acquisition 21of drugs that are, as we've heard, exclusively 22distributed to veterinarians and how we have seen these 23entering into pharmacies. Overwhelmingly, the majority 24of the pharmacies that we see obtain their drugs from 25wholesale distributors. Included in that process are64 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551wholesale distributors and pharmacies that solicit 2veterinarians to purchase medications. We see 3veterinarians who serve as consultants to pharmacies or 4wholesalers and the drugs are purchased in the name of 5the veterinarian and then transferred to the wholesaler. 6 There are situations where veterinarians 7actually own pharmacies and buy the drugs in the 8veterinarian's name and then transfer them over to the 9pharmacy. There are some situations where we have seen 10veterinary wholesalers that are purchasing directly 11from manufacturers and we're not sure exactly how they 12have obtained those relationships, but they are buying 13directly from the manufacturer certain types of 14medications that appear to be restricted. We think 15some of these involve situations where the wholesale 16distributor license was obtained under the name of 17possibly a veterinary hospital and then the veterinary 18hospital went out of business and the wholesaler 19continued. 20 We have heard -- I think it was mentioned earlier 21by one of the veterinarians -- about the relationships that 22exist between veterinarians and some of the online 23pharmacies, and the financial arrangements that are made 24between them. We have confirmed that there are 25pharmacies that are removing secondary bar coding that65 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551has been placed on certain types of medication to 2identify the veterinarian that purchased that product. 3Shortly after we learned of that, the pharmacies moved 4to removing those medications and placing them into 5vials and dispensing much like a human drug would be 6dispensed. 7 I would like to touch on some of the differences 8in the human drug distribution supply chain and 9veterinary drug supply chain. Under the Food, Drug and 10Cosmetic Act, human drug distributors must be licensed 11by their resident state in accordance with rules 12established by the FDA. Those requirements do not exist 13for veterinary distributors. Under the federal act, 14human drug sales must be tracked back to a manufacturer 15or authorized distributor in accordance with FDA rules. 16And again, this does not apply to veterinary 17distributors. The licensing of wholesale distributors 18for veterinary drugs varies widely by the states. Some 19states do not license veterinary wholesale distributors 20of drugs and some states do not require veterinarians to 21have a wholesale license to sell to a pharmacy. 22 In the human prescription supply chain, we 23strive for and have the highest confidence in a closed 24distribution system where drugs move from the 25manufacturer to the wholesale distributor to the66 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551pharmacy or practitioner, through what is referenced in 2the wholesale distribution for human drugs as the \"normal 3distribution chain.\" This type of system is not 4developed for animal drug distribution. 5 NABP's accreditation of online pharmacy ensures 6that they are operating in accordance with the laws and 7rules of their state and federal requirements, and 8ultimately ensures that the medication that we give our 9pets is safe. 10 Thank you very much. 11 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you, Mr. Jones. 12 Our next panelist is David Miller. He is the 13chief executive officer of the International Academy of 14Compounding Pharmacists. 15 MR. MILLER: Thank you, Stephanie. 16 Good morning, everyone. I am going to cover a 17few quick points, but before we get into that, pretty 18much everyone up here has some sort of relationship with 19the veterinary industry. Some of us are clinicians, 20some of us are pharmacists, some of us are involved in 21manufacturing and distributing, but I would say most of 22us in this room, when we were listening to Dr. Pion's 23presentation, was thinking about the fur balls that we 24have at home. How many of you own dogs? Yes. How many 25of you held out your cell phone to show the person next67 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551to you a picture of your dog? How many of you are owned 2by cats? Notice how I have phrased that, because up 3until recently, I had five small ones that ran my life. 4I'm now down to one, fortunately. 5 The reason why I tell you this, and I ask this, 6because we all do share something in common, and that is 7as pet owners. Sometimes we need medicines for our 8animals, for our family members, if you will. 9Compounding pharmacists play a rather unique role in the 10treatment distribution system. If you think about dogs, 11we have small Teacup Poodles and then we have Great 12Danes. And it doesn't require clinical training to 13understand that the dose of medicine you need for that 14small Teacup Poodle is probably going to be a little bit 15less than what you need for the Great Dane. 16 In the case of a cat -- for those of you who have 17ever tried to get a pill into a cat -- after you have 18managed to put the tourniquet on your bleeding arm and 19come back from the emergency room, you know that there 20are preferred ways to get things into a cat. And that's 21usually with a gel that you can apply to their ear or a 22tuna flavored solution that you can attempt to squirt 23into their mouth at some point. 24 What compounding pharmacists do in collaboration 25with veterinarians is create formulations, modified68 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551doses, and solutions for obtaining and creating 2drugs that aren't available commercially. Things that 3aren't in the manufacturer-wholesaler distribution chain. 4 I know much of our focus this morning is on the 5mega products. But I want to make sure that you 6understand how the marketplace and its current economic 7incentives has created some rather difficult catch-22s 8for compounding pharmacists and for veterinarians who 9are trying to treat a wide range of species and a wide 10range of sizes and types of animals within a given 11species. 12 What do compounders do? We create medicines on 13prescriptions in collaboration with prescribers, both on 14the human side and the veterinarian side. In the case 15of veterinary compounding, things are a little bit 16different. The Food and Drug Administration has something 17termed a compliance policy guideline that requires that 18the compounding of medications for veterinary use must, 19must, be done with commercially-available finished drug 20products. 21 Now, when a pharmacist compounds something, we 22really have two choices. We start with the raw 23ingredient, the drug that we buy from the same FDA 24suppliers that many manufacturers do, and that's the 25same thing for both the human side and the veterinarian69 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551side. We also can use the old-fashioned method of take 2the tablets off the shelf, grind them up and turn them 3into something else. Those are the finished drug 4products that I can buy from a wholesaler, or I can buy 5directly from a manufacturer. The FDA requires in 6veterinary compounding that both pharmacists and 7 veterinarians must use the finished drug product. 8 Now, here's the problem. I receive a 9prescription from a veterinarian. I have to prepare that 10and compound it. The only way that I can legally do so 11is if I use a finished drug product, a commercially- 12available manufactured product I buy from the 13manufacturer or the drug supply company. Unfortunately, 14because of unilateral decisions by manufacturers who have 15restricted their sales to only veterinarians or veterinary 16supply houses, a pharmacy cannot buy that finished drug 17product. So, how do I get it? Well, I have to turn to 18and eventually begin to develop an unfortunate disruption 19in our supply chain that challenges the integrity. I 20have to get that medication not from the manufacturer, not 21from a veterinary supply house, I have to get it from a 22veterinarian. And that starts opening up a whole series of 23potential disruptions in the supply chain. As the 24pharmacists on this panel and in the room will tell you, 25the first and foremost thing that we are concerned about70 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551is knowing that when we pull something off of a shelf, 2preparatory to dispensing to a patient, animal or human, 3we want to make sure it is what it is. 4 So, I think we need to address how the 5manufacturing-wholesaler side of the veterinary business 6is set up in a manner that restricts pharmacists from being 7able to obtain medications that they are legally required 8to have in order to care for patients. 9 Thank you. 10 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you, Mr. Miller. 11 Our next panelist is Nate Smith. He is the vice 12president of business development at NuSkin Enterprises 13and a former retail strategist for Walmart. 14 MR. SMITH: Thank you for having me. I 15appreciate being on the panel. 16 I hope today to be able to share comments that I 17believe reflect the interest of consumers. Because of 18the distribution practices in this industry, consumers 19pay more. They are limited as to where they can buy pet 20medications, and they are, in many cases, denied the 21chance to buy less expensive alternatives. This is an 22important issue in this economy, as all Americans are 23looking to save money, and they're demanding good 24service and they also want convenience in the way that 25they buy these drugs.71 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 When it comes to purchasing medication for their 2pets, consumers are at a severe disadvantage. They 3can't buy pet medications without a prescription. The 4prescriber, in this case the veterinarian, chooses the 5medication, and is free to choose a medication 6distributed only through veterinarians. But this 7system, with its inherent conflicts of interest, also 8puts the veterinarian in a tough spot. It's unfair to 9both, and the government should step in to assure 10consumers are treated fairly, their ability to choose 11is protected, and competition is allowed to flourish. 12 Allow me to summarize my remarks in five points. 13First, the distribution practices for pet medications 14cost consumers money. These practices inflate prices 15for pet medications and limit competition. They 16discourage the prescribing of generics, which would save 17consumers money, in and of itself, and put a downward 18pressure on prices for the name-brand drugs. And it would 19serve as a strong incentive for pharmaceutical 20manufacturers to develop new drugs. 21 Number two, veterinarians choose the medication 22and the brand. This makes the marketplace much 23different than for consumer products. It's fine to 24limit the channel distribution if you're a manufacturer 25of a premium brand that you want to associate with a72 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551Nordstrom's and not a Walmart or a Costco. But it's not 2okay when legally-established prescribing powers are 3combined with exclusive distribution. 4 Number three, pharmaceutical manufacturers can 5engage in practices with pet medications that they could 6never do with human medications. There are examples of 7manufacturers providing sales incentives to 8veterinarians, protecting them from price competition, 9and rewarding them with extra product that can be 10resold. In 2011, Elanco sent a letter to veterinarians 11highlighting and then condemning the decision by a 12competing pharmaceutical company to sell its products 13outside the veterinarian channel. I ask that a copy of 14this letter be made a part of the record, and I will 15provide that to you, Stephanie. 16 Number four, veterinarians can engage in 17practices which human physicians do not or cannot. 18Under the American Medical Association Code of Ethics, 19where there is a potential of conflict of interest 20between the physician's financial interest and that of 21the patient, the physician is required to so advise 22patients and to resolve the conflict to the patient's 23benefit. The AVMA code recognizes that a patient whose 24interest is in receiving quality health care is placed 25in a difficult, if not impossible position when the73 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551health care provider sells products or additional 2services to that patient. Pet owners are the same. 3If they ask for a copy of the prescription, it puts them 4in an uncomfortable position of having to ask their 5health care provider for permission to purchase 6elsewhere. This is an unreasonable burden which is why 7we don't have to ask for our prescriptions from human 8physicians, or from an eye doctor, for that matter. 9 Five, finally, consumers have a right to know 10they are grossly underrepresented in this marketplace 11and they are the ones with the most at stake. Consumers 12are unaware of the hostile market power. Pet owners 13rightfully love their vets for the care they give; 14however, veterinarians have an identity crisis on the 15horizon. The system keeps prices high, discourages the 16use of generics and more affordable or efficient 17alternative solutions, and blocks more convenient access. 18 So, I commend the FTC for holding these 19workshops, and I hope that this becomes the beginning of 20creating solutions and a means to an end that will help 21the consumer. When and where that occurs, I believe 22that everyone will win. I believe that manufacturers, 23veterinarians and consumers will all enjoy improved 24economics and benefit from a change in the way we manage 25and regulate this industry.74 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you, Mr. Smith. 2 Our next panelist is Mark Cushing. He is a 3partner with Tonkon Torp law firm and he is here today 4representing the American Veterinary Distributors 5Association. 6 MR. CUSHING: Good morning. It's a privilege to 7represent the AVDA. Let me start with some broad 8observations, and then I'll tell you a bit more about 9AVDA and our role in the pet medication chain. 10 I look around the room and I see a number of 11colleagues that, like myself, have been involved for the 12past two years in efforts to defeat the retail support 13for H.R. 1406 in Congress, which after two years is not 14proceeding. I share that because what became clear on 15Capitol Hill, fortunately for those of us who opposed 16the bill, is that this is a classic solution in search 17of a problem. 18 I will tell you that the discussion today and 19the focus of this workshop is much the same. It is a 20solution in search of a problem. It's fair in our 21system to go to Congress, to go to an agency and raise 22issues, that's great. We're here to have a good 23discussion, but the very fact that you have the 24conversation does not mean that you, in fact, do have a 25problem that requires federal intervention.75 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 Let me expand. For example, every state 2extensively regulates the veterinarian-client 3relationship. It is not the subject of a one-paragraph 4statute buried in state statute books. It is a 5comprehensive, multi-paged, detailed, administratively 6enforced scheme to regulate the veterinarian-client 7relationship. The intent of 1406 was to nationalize 8that, and for the first time to have the Federal 9Government, and specifically the FTC, regulate the 10veterinarian-client relationship. Many of us felt, and 11I believe the majority of Congress felt, that at this 12time in our nation's history, that's not necessary and 13not a good idea. 14 Second point. We have a vigorous, highly 15competitive pet medication marketplace. I respect my 16colleague, whom I have just met to my right, but I 17couldn't disagree more with his conclusions. The notion 18that consumers are trapped, that they're prisoners in 19this simple veterinary-driven pet medication marketplace 20is just not true. It is a highly competitive 21marketplace. 22 My client, AVDA, shared in its comments -- and I 23encourage you to take a look at this -- a study commissioned 24by Axiom, an animal health consulting firm, to just get 25a feel for broadly how competitive is the pet medication76 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551marketplace. Take a look at that. One can only 2conclude, as consumers understand, you can get pet 3medications, both prescription and otherwise, OTC, from 4a host of sources all over this country, online, retail, 5veterinary and otherwise. It's simply not correct to 6say that that marketplace is constricted and somehow 7works against the consumer. Again, it's a solution in 8search of a problem. 9 So, to my main point. At the heart of the 10system, when you strip it down to its essentials, we're 11talking about the health of a pet and the safety of a 12pet, period. It is a rational decision. You can debate 13it, but it is a rational decision for a manufacturer to 14determine that it wants medical products that depend 15upon an understanding of the physiology and the 16pharmacology of a host of species to be placed in the 17hands of licensed medical professionals who were trained 18to do that. 19 Therefore, it's a rational decision for 20distributors to honor those contracts and provide those 21medications to veterinarians. And we can spend all day 22talking about that, and I'm not qualified as a lawyer, 23doctor of juris prudence, but certainly not a DVM, I am 24not qualified to enhance the discussion there. 25 So, do go to the record and read hundreds of77 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551submissions, mainly by veterinarians and many by state 2veterinary medical associations, an excellent submission 3by the AVMA, that make that point. It's not a 4condescending point. It's not a point that in any way 5attempts to demean pharmacists, of course not. Human 6pharmacists have impossible jobs. In the current 7environment, thousands of chemical factors that they 8have to understand for the human species, and they have 9to do it right every time. 10 My point is, don't assume it's a simple thing. 11I know pharmacists don't assume it's a simple thing 12after their human pharmacy training to turn around and 13say, let me see, with a 10-hour course here, a little bit 14of extra work there, I can figure out how dogs work, how 15large dogs, small dogs, old dogs, young dogs, cats, go 16down the line. It's very complicated. 17 It makes sense that medications are placed in 18the hands of professionals trained, and frankly, 75 19percent of a veterinarian's training in their four years 20of vet school, in some meaningful way, involves or 21considers knowledge related to how medications and 22pharmacology operates in a given species. 23 I just suggest to all, including, of course, the 24FTC, take that expertise seriously. Take seriously the 25concerns that you need to bear in mind as you make a78 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551decision about an individual pet. 2 I'll say to that end, I'm disappointed that we 3don't have on any of the three panels today a 4representative from state veterinary medical 5associations, many of whom submitted comments, most 6importantly from Oregon, my home state, documenting a 7whole series of examples of adverse consequences for 8pets when there was a decision made by a pharmacist, 9online or retail, to change dosage, or to swap out the 10particular prescription for a different drug reflecting 11a lack of concern or understanding about how the 12medication would work with a pet when a simple phone 13call might have made the difference. 14 Of course, veterinarians, every day, I'm sure by 15the time, 11:00 on the east coast, there have been a 16thousand prescriptions written and probably handed to 17clients that go to human pharmacies. Veterinarians 18understand that. And what they hope is that a 19pharmacist who has any questions, or more importantly, 20gets some independent idea about what to do with that 21prescription, would get on the phone and call the 22veterinarian and ask for guidance. Unless that 23pharmacist was trained to deal with animal-related 24issues. That's fine, but we're not talking about that 25in this context. So, I would just urge you to keep that79 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551consideration in mind. 2 Very briefly, AVDA has 74 members. It is a 3combination of both distributors and associate members 4who are manufacturers. It has both generic and pioneer 5manufacturers in its membership. It services 6approximately 55,000 veterinarians and 25,000 practices, 7as well as 10,000 other retail and over-the-counter 8outlets. It should be obvious just from those figures 9why distributors exist, from the manufacturer's 10perspective, right? If you're trying to service that 11broad of a market, you need the assistance, and 12distributors provide that, and I think they do a good 13job. They comply with a whole host of Federal agencies, 14DEA, FDA, USDA, of course, EPA on the pesticides or 15insecticides, as well as state boards of pharmacy and so 16forth. It's a complicated business, and they take it 17seriously, and I'm happy to answer questions as the day 18goes on. Thanks. 19 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you, Mr. Cushing. 20 Once again, we have Dr. Paul Pion. He is the 21president and co-founder of the Veterinary Information 22Network and we wanted to give him an opportunity to 23provide any additional comments to his presentation 24earlier. 25 DR. PION: Thank you.80 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 So, when I gave my presentation, despite the one 2slide that I tried to show what veterinarians were 3thinking, I tried to keep it as objective as possible 4and just tell a story. Last night, when it kind of 5dawned on me that I had to say more than that, I started 6to jot down some thoughts to speak more as a 7veterinarian. 8 One of the points I realized that I had left out 9of my presentation was the issue of compounding, so 10thanks for covering that. The only thing I would add 11there is one of the patterns we've seen is there's a 12great partnership between veterinarians and compounders, 13but sometimes it's gone too far and not been regulated 14and it's kind of merged into manufacturing when products 15weren't yet available. So, just one other thing to 16throw in the mix. 17 I would agree with the Distributors Association 18that the market is right now very competitive. I mean, 19just the fact that the Chairman of the Federal Trade 20Commission could walk into Costco and buy Frontline and 21give a product ad in front of this forum was 22documentation that anybody can buy any product, 23and if the chains were not open, these big retailers 24would not be currently providing them if they didn't 25think they had a sustainable supply chain. So, despite 81 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551the fact that what's written down and what's said 2publicly by manufacturers and distributors, the chain is 3quite open. 4 One of the things that really dawned on me is 5that the focus has been on veterinarians in H.R. 1406, 6and that kind of says it backwards, since the control 7here has always been and is in the hands of the 8manufacturer and distributor and their relationships 9that are largely dictated by manufacturers. 10 Veterinarians want to do what is best for their 11patients and clients. This is not to deny that losing 12medication income has and will hurt veterinarians, but I 13think they've already lost much of that. But I do 14believe there's a real chance that as it increases, 15there could be an increase, and we're already seeing an 16increase in service fees that will result. In the end, 17pet owners will end up paying more for their pet care, 18or fewer pets will be seen, which will deteriorate the 19health care of our pets and our population. 20 One of the things I don't want to see come out 21of this is animosity between veterinarians and 22pharmacists, in that there has always been a great 23relationship between them. They're two very noble 24professions, and I really see that trying to force it by 25law will start to create that animosity.82 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 So, yeah, I agree, and I think most colleagues 2agree that pet owners should be informed, they have the 3right to a prescription to purchase their medications 4elsewhere. I think in that regard, all veterinarians 5are asking is a level playing field, that they be able 6to not have their clients purchase in other retailers 7for less than the veterinarian can purchase for 8themselves, which is often the case. They want to know 9that the products that their clients purchase have a 10known pedigree, and they've been handled properly. 11That's one issue that hasn't come up, I think in all the 12jiggling that goes on in the supply chain, who knows how 13long those products sat out on the tarmac in Phoenix at 14110 degrees. 15 We have to remember that dogs are not little 16people, and that cats are not little dogs. Dispensing 17for pets is like dispensing for an infant. The client, 18like a parent, needs the person providing the medication 19to be able to advise them and caution them about drug 20interactions and possible side effects, how to 21administer it safely and effectively and even to spot 22inappropriate doses due to math or transcription errors. 23 These can all be overcome by education. I have 24no doubt that pharmacists can learn this, but is it 25realistic to believe that the big box stores and83 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551pharmacies who largely see selling pet medications as a 2way to increase traffic are going to pay adequate 3attention to these issues? 4 I've said, most veterinarians agree that pet 5owners should be informed and have a choice, but it 6shouldn't be at the expense of ensuring that the 7medications are dispensed appropriately with appropriate 8ability to counsel. 9 So, I agree maybe veterinarians should do more 10to inform pet owners they can get prescriptions 11elsewhere, and maybe a sign in a lobby would be enough. 12Most veterinarians, it just doesn't come up in the 13conversation. I don't think it's an outright attempt to 14restrict it. And if pharmacists don't get the proper 15education and don't respect veterinary prescription 16directions, meaning consult the prescribing veterinarian 17before they consider substituting what they consider an 18equivalent drug, or preparation, or questioning a dose 19without first consulting the prescribing colleague, then 20I think we're going to see lots of problems within the 21market. 22 I've got hundreds of examples where this has 23been an issue, just recently about a Dachshund in 24California who was given 61 units of insulin when it 25should have been six units, that ended up in the84 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551euthanasia of the animal because of the cost it would 2have taken to take care of that. 3 And on a less severe degree, just last night a 4colleague was telling me about a cat who had a 5ringworm infection, a simple problem, and they 6prescribed a systemic medication, Metronidazole, the 7pharmacist looked at it and said, I would never do that 8for a person, don't do that. And that delayed the 9treatment for a couple of months before the person 10almost gave up and euthanized the cat until they gave it 11the medication for a few weeks and it was resolved. 12 Thank you. 13 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you, Dr. Pion. 14 So, we've heard in the presentations and in some 15of the panelist statements what some of the business 16rationales are for manufacturers to exclusively 17distribute pet medications through the veterinary 18channel, and not through the retail channel. It seems 19namely that veterinarians are the ones who are trained 20in veterinary pharmacology and that they are in the best 21position to be able to properly oversee pet medications 22and the way that they are used for safety reasons. 23 My question is, although the veterinarian is the 24one with the VCPR, and is in the best position to 25properly prescribe pet medications, why is it that the85 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinarian is in the best position to also dispense 2the medications? In other words, as long as retail 3pharmacists dispense prescriptions exactly as written by 4the veterinarian, why should there be concerns about 5safety if a retail pharmacist dispenses the medications? 6And I would open this up to the panel. 7 Okay, Mr. Vranian? 8 MR. CUSHING: This is Mark Cushing, I'm sorry, 9did somebody else go first? 10 MS. WILKINSON: That's okay. 11 MS. JEX: From now on, if you could put your 12name card up on end and we'll call folks in order. 13 MR. CUSHING: It's always the lawyer that 14misbehaves. 15 MR. VRANIAN: You've cited to the VCPR and the 16importance of preserving that, and again I think it 17comes to the portfolio of the manufacturer. If you have 18non-prescription products or ones that have higher 19safety and efficacy balancing acts to maintain, it's 20important that the vet maintains these contact points -- 21and points include treatment, prescription, dispensing, 22and follow-up. And dispensing is one of these contact 23points that allows trained professionals to get some 24feedback from somebody who doesn't speak any human 25language. They are trained to acquire that feedback.86 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 From a manufacturer's perspective as well, here 2we are today and there's billions of dollars of market 3share that people want to get a piece of. That's one of 4the questions here today. Many of the most effective 5life-saving products, take our Clomicalm product, 6considered medically necessary by the FDA. In other 7words, we are required to make it available. 8 The market this year for Clomicalm is about $2 9million. We are not getting requests from big box 10stores for Clomicalm. They don't want a piece of that 11action. But by this model where we educate the vets and 12they have ownership in the dispensing and prescription 13and treatment and follow-up, and they know in their 14community across 25,000 veterinary clinics who needs 15this drug, a model where we can efficiently provide that 16on a one or two-box basis across the country I think 17increases access to medicine. 18 You also factor that into innovation. We come 19out with products for diseases that weren't available 20just a few years ago: Addison's Disease 21ectopic dermatitis for cats and dogs, life-threatening 22and devastating diseases. The vet clinic is a good way 23to generate awareness and demand for that. All we know, 24we have a dog that's itching or that seems unhappy, we 25take our dog or our cat to the vet. That is the point87 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551where these innovations can be made available to the pet 2owner. By focusing on that channel and training them 3and giving them those additional contact points where we 4can keep sacred that Veterinarian-Client-Patient- 5Relationship just ultimately enhances the quality of pet 6health. 7 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 8 Mr. Bane? 9 MR. BANE: From our perspective, again, the 10veterinarians are the ones who receive the formal 11training, so it makes sense, as Clinton just mentioned, 12that distributing those products to the professionals 13that they know had experience in monitoring the side 14effects and being able to get ahold of that group of 15professionals to be able to train them appropriately, 16monitor side effects, administer doses, et cetera, makes 17some sense. 18 From our perspective, one of our closest allies 19as a pharmacist -- and having to expend significant time 20overcoming this training gap and the availability of 21information for pharmacists -- one of our closest allies 22is the veterinarian. So, in the case of dispensing, 23often times our veterinarians, before they send us a 24prescription they would like us to fulfill and send to 25their client, they'll administer that first dose in the88 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551hospital, where that one-on-one interaction with that 2pet owner and that pet allows them to understand 3how it's dosed and what signs to watch out for is very 4important. 5 In fact, I think in some of these other 6establishments, we can't see the patient, so that's an 7important thing for us to maintain that very close 8relationship with the veterinarian in that context where 9they can explain those things to the client in a way 10that's much more difficult in other ways. 11 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 12 Mr. Powers? 13 MR. POWERS: Thank you. I would like to make a 14few points. First of all, with all due respect to Dr. Pion, 15I think there's some clouding of the issue when Chairman 16Leibowitz showed that product up there, Frontline, that 17is an OTC product. So I think we have to be careful when 18we talk about restricted distribution, we separate those 19products which are OTC products that were registered by 20the manufacturer to be sold over-the-counter as opposed 21to prescription drugs. 22 Secondly, there was a point made about there's 23plenty of distribution out there because of big box 24retailers getting some product. That's true, but that's 25usually as other people have pointed out, often times89 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551through the gray market or through the nefarious ways of 2getting the product. My question, again, is I've heard 3the comments of the veterinarian-pharmacist 4relationship, we're a company who has both veterinarians 5working in concert with pharmacists, we're still told we 6can't get the drugs, they're restricted from us. 7 The third point that I wanted to make was 8listening to the VCPR relationship, my vet is great, I 9love my personal vet, but where does that relationship 10begin and how does it progress? Pfizer in their 11statement to the board here said that there were six 12million prescriptions filled outside the veterinary 13channel for pets. We've heard it again and again that 14other people fill many of these, the pharmacists fill 15many of these. Does that mean that each time each of 16those six million times that somehow the 17veterinarian-client relationship was diminished? 18 In my own case, I have a Groenendael that was 19abandoned that I took in that recently had eye problems. 20My veterinarian, Allison French, a wonderful woman, decided 21the dog was coming down with glaucoma. She prescribed a 22drug, pilocarpine, to reduce the pressure in that dog's eye, 23but she said, \"John, I don't carry it, here's the 24prescription, you should take it to Walgreens or some 25place to have it filled.\" Does that mean that once she90 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551gave me that prescription for my dog that it diminished 2the Veterinarian-Client-Patient-Relationship between 3Allison and I? I don't think so. 4 MS. WILKINSON: Okay, thank you. 5 Mr. Miller? 6 MR. MILLER: Thank you, Stephanie. 7 I know we're the distribution panel, and it's 8always a struggle sometimes for the clinicians in the 9room. I think there's a lot of discussion today about 10stuff. Stuff -- the things that we can buy, sell, what's 11in the marketplace, what's in the chain. But to the 12clinicians in the room, the veterinarians and the 13pharmacists, this is not stuff. This is now we treat 14and cure disease. Whether it's for an animal or for a 15human. 16 Stephanie, your question was should we, 17considering the VCPR, ensure that veterinarians still 18have the ability to obtain and dispense medications, 19even in an environment or a marketplace that's changing 20and expanding so that other types of distribution 21points, retail pharmacies, online pharmacies, whatever 22it might be, evolve. The answer to that is so simple, 23I guess, from a pharmacist's perspective, and I would 24think from a vet's as well. Absolutely. Because we 25know as clinicians that there are instances when a patient91 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551presents, when a client presents, that they're going to 2need that medication to be available immediately, and 3that's going to be from the veterinarian. There are 4specialty medications, as we've heard, that are only 5appropriate for dispensing by veterinarians. And that 6needs to remain with them. 7 At the same time, we also have to recognize that 8just as in the human side of the world, that there are 9instances where the medication isn't available and 10approved by the FDA CVM, that it is a human version, and 11that probably the retail pharmacy, be it a Walgreens 12or Dave's Independent Drugstore, is the place to go get 13that. 14 We need to ensure for consumers that they have 15as many options to get the medications and therapies 16they need, but we also have to balance that with the 17very simple fact that this is not the marketplace of 18widgets. This is the marketplace of patient care that 19just happens to have a product associated with it. 20 We cannot let that be forgotten in this 21discussion. 22 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 23 Mr. Cushing? 24 MR. CUSHING: Thanks. Two points that haven't 25been made. The question, again, is the role of the92 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinarian in the actual dispensing, not just in the 2writing of a prescription. There's a simple practical 3value. Many pet owners in the real world, at the end of 4a workday, stop by their veterinarian, their pet may 5have been examined during the day or treated, and they 6pick up their pet to take them home, and it's extremely 7convenient and it's very consumer friendly for the 8veterinarian to play that role, just as a practical 9matter. 10 More complex, and I would encourage you all if 11you haven't read it to see the submission by the Animal 12Health Institute, which had an excellent description 13from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that just summarized 14six or seven of the services, if you will, that 15pharmacists typically provide to their customers, and 16we've all experienced that in the human context. 17 If you go down that list, we don't just go to a 18pharmacist and get something back. There's a 19conversation, there's advice given, there's questions 20asked. It's expected. It's part of the pharmacist view 21of their own profession. That's appropriate. 22 The veterinarian, uniquely, that is unique 23meaning there may be a veterinary-trained pharmacist in 24a pharmacy, but for the most part, the veterinarian is in 25that position to have that conversation with the client93 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551as to how this works, what to do, what problems to 2expect, what frustration you're going to meet in about 335 minutes when you get home and try to administer it, 4how to respond to that and so forth. 5 That's much more than a pure prescription 6writing service and I think it's appropriate. 7 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 8 Dr. Pion? 9 DR. PION: Well, you may be surprised that I'll 10probably be the least likely to try to defend keeping 11the status quo. I think most colleagues have accepted 12that product medication sales has to become less a part 13of their practice. I don't think we're here trying to 14stop that. 15 I think that we are here to try to see it 16done rationally. I think there are issues that relate 17to convenience. I mean, we all go to the physician now, 18and what happens? You might get a physical exam, you 19get sent here for blood work, you get sent there for a 20radiograph, you're sent there to pick up medication, and 21that's not been classically what people are going to put 22effort into for their pet's care, and I don't think 23that's what the public wants to see. 24 So, physicians handle that. Manufacturers 25handle, since physicians can't dispense, they handle94 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551directing what physicians are likely to dispense by 2providing them with samples. So, they tend to prescribe 3what they can give you: here, here's a few doses and you 4can go fill it in a couple of days when it's convenient. 5So, the same still does go on in the human market. 6 I think veterinarians are all in favor of choice 7and helping their clients, because veterinarians are 8faced every day with the choice as opposed to humans, 9where insurance covers costs. We're not able to 10apply our healing arts because it's limited by money. I 11think most of us would be happy if the medications were 12available elsewhere, free, cheap, but in the end, the 13client is going to look at the cost of that health care, 14as what they spent at the veterinarian, and what they 15paid for the medication. 16 If we take out efficiencies of the system, and I 17talked about how, and I think Novartis and a few others 18have addressed how it's just not efficient for them to 19try to introduce these products and will it reduce the 20incentive for innovation and introduction of great 21products into pet health care if the unintended 22consequences of the outcome here is that it actually 23ultimately increases pet health care cost. 24 So, I think there's lots of conflicting issues 25here, but I don't think you're going to find95 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinarians wanting to say I think that this should be 2restricted in that way. I think most veterinarians, 3they're good, honest, open people, and they would just 4like the shenanigans to stop. And if these things are 5going to be sold in the open chain, then that should be 6fine and the public should have a choice and maintain 7their relationship with their veterinarian. 8 MS. WILKINSON: Okay, thank you. 9 And finally, Mr. Hinckle? 10 MR. HINCKLE: Thanks. Stephanie, to get kind of 11back to your question of why do we believe that a 12pharmacist can't consistently follow directions on a 13prescription and dispense the drug, I think the obvious 14answer to that is that they can, and the reason why I 15say it's obvious is because they do in a large number of 16cases already. 17 As I think has already been mentioned, 18pharmacists already dispense a lot of drugs for animal 19patients. Many times it's off-label human drugs that 20are being dispensed for the animal use. And bear in 21mind in that case, the pharmacist doesn't even have an 22FDA-approved package insert that discusses animal uses. 23We're talking here about higher priced animal-only 24prescription drugs where there is an FDA package insert 25that a pharmacist can at least refer, aside from the96 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551obvious question that they can call the veterinarian 2with any questions as well. 3 The idea that a pharmacist really can't dispense 4these, surely there are some exceptions, as there are in 5the human context, where you have some drugs that are 6under restricted distribution, restrictive or risk 7evaluation mitigation strategy, or REMs they're called 8on the human side, that says you can only dispense this 9drug after a physician has gone through a certain amount 10of training or they've had certain lab tests for that 11particular patient, for safety reasons. 12 Are there examples like that on the animal side? 13Yeah, I expect there probably are, and I think most of 14the veterinarians here would probably know that there 15are some, but I think the concern here, and as far as 16this workshop goes is, are we going to let those 17exceptions drive the rule? Are we going to open the 18market up to allow generic competitors in the retail 19space, and then carve out the exceptions where necessary 20to ensure animal safety? 21 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 22 I would like to move on and talk about the fact 23that we've heard today that as a result of exclusive 24distribution practices, that many retailers currently 25obtain at least some portion of their product supply97 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551through the secondary distribution system. What I'm 2interested in understanding is whether there are any 3inefficiencies associated with this secondary 4distribution system for both prescription and 5over-the-counter pet medications and how do these 6inefficiencies impact consumers? 7 Mr. Hinckle? 8 MR. HINCKLE: Okay, I'll just pick back up 9again. Again, speaking from somebody who represents 10generic drug companies, one of the things that I've 11heard that's a problem for getting generic companies' 12products into, in this case a chain retail drugstore, 13was the chain said, look, we can't really carry your 14generic if we can't also carry the brand. 15 From a corporate perspective they said, look, 16we're not comfortable buying product outside of what in 17the human side is considered the normal distribution 18chain. We don't want to get it outside. They deal in a 19PDMA world, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, where 20everything is very controlled on the human side. I 21think Gregg talked about that from that perspective. 22 So, they are very uncomfortable getting out of 23that chain, and so the impact is that the generic 24products can't get into the retail market either because 25the brand products aren't there. That clearly has an98 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551impact on consumers. 2 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 3 Mr. Dayton? 4 MR. DAYTON: You asked a question on 5inefficiency, I think the largest inefficiency is time. 6For products we cannot obtain, we go to a 7secondary supplier, which takes longer to get the 8medication to our patients. So, I think time is the 9biggest inefficiency. 10 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 11 Mr. Smith? 12 MR. SMITH: I think just in classic supply chain 13consideration, you're always going to look at how many 14players are there in a supply chain, how many times is a 15product received, touched, reaped, distributed, shipped 16somewhere else. And so when you think about the chart 17Dr. Pion put up with all the arrows, and all the 18additional touches that are occurring all across the 19supply chain, it inevitably has to cost more money when 20you have more people making a profit along the chain, 21more people touching it, more freight miles, it can't be 22cheaper. 23 The other thing that I would add is, at some 24level, when you think through that chart, and then you 25think about the average end prices that are being99 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551offered to consumers, it also makes no sense that the 2product that gets tortured along the longest supply 3chain with the most touches is generally showing up to 4the market right now with the lowest price. It makes no 5sense. 6 I think it demonstrates where margins must be 7taken by certain players and the rate at which they're 8taking those margins. It's not an efficient market. I 9think the notion of convenience needs to be treated 10carefully, because convenience at a cost is a certain 11question. If I don't want to drive somewhere, because I 12just want to have it prescribed and I want to take it, 13fine. I think it's very well documented that prices are 14much lower and if price becomes an important issue to 15the consumer, then you can't claim that convenience at a 16prescribe-and-fill location is better than how often do 17they go to a supermarket or a place where a pharmacy is, 18that's also convenient. We don't shop in a meat shop, a 19bakery, and a sporting goods store. In our world today, 20consumers need access and convenience to product, and 21the obvious preference is they like to be able to buy 22more than one thing in one place. 23 So, there's obviously inefficiencies for the 24consumer as well. I don't think it's more convenient 25to have to go to the vet every time I want my Heartgard100 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551refilled. 2 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 3 Mr. Powers, did you have a comment you would 4like to make? 5 MR. POWERS: I was going to echo his comments. 6Any product, whether it's hardware or housewares, where 7you include another step in the distribution channel, is 8going to raise prices for the consumer ultimately. Most 9companies have a minimum mark-up they can work on and 10still be profitable. Cost enters into that equation. 11So, every incremental cost you add, from the time the 12product is manufactured until it gets to the ultimate 13retailer, will definitely affect the price of that 14product to the consumer. 15 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 16 Dr. Pion? 17 DR. PION: I think it's important to remember 18there's many different sides to the answer. So, from a 19cost basis, to me, the one who has the most to lose by 20opening the supply chain is the manufacturer. The 21Walmarts, et cetera of the world push back on them and buy 22on consignment, as they do with all others, and it will 23bring lesser prices. There's other dangers in that 24even if they're over-the-counter products, it doesn't 25mean 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 The EPA has been looking into the registration 2of many of the spot-on products and if they're actually 3causing problems. There are questions about lack of 4efficacy, because of inappropriate use and overuse and 5the species of insects or parasites that they're aimed 6against becoming resistant to them. These are all 7questions that are coming up. 8 So, again, I'll reiterate, I don't think it's 9the veterinarians who are arguing strongly about this. 10All the veterinarians really want is a level playing 11field. I don't think they would mind at all if their 12clients could purchase this for their patients for less 13money, they just want to have an equal footing in there 14and to give the consumer an option. 15 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 16 Finally, Mr. Vranian? 17 MR. VRANIAN: I think that certainly I defer to 18many of the points that were made, but we have to 19realize that this market is very dynamic and it's 20evolving and these inefficiencies are resolving 21themselves. Manufacturers that were cited in an earlier 22presentation have embraced the non-veterinary channel, 23voluntarily. We have seen innovations such as home 24delivery services that embrace the Veterinarian-Client- 25Patient-Relationship that leverage both of those.102 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551You've got mobile clinics. 2 So, to the extent there are inefficiencies in 3the market, I would just put out there that the market 4appears to be addressing them as well. 5 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 6 MR. POWERS: Excuse me, I would disagree with 7that. 8 MS. WILKINSON: Okay. 9 MR. POWERS: Let me tell you why I disagree with 10that. Some of the same manufacturers who are 11restricting distribution to us today up until a year and 12a half ago were encouraging us to carry their 13prescription products and soliciting us to do more 14business with those prescription drugs. 15 An arbitrary decision made by a manufacturer to 16no longer sell to us without even informing us, left us with 17a case of we have lots of prescriptions on file with 18customers needing refills and the drugs aren't available 19to us. 20 So, I would disagree that it's an open channel, 21and I would disagree that it's an arbitrary 22relationship. It's an arbitrary decision on many 23manufacturers' parts to turn off and turn on the spigot 24of their prescription drugs. 25 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you.103 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 How do manufacturers typically respond when 2veterinarians resell products to retail pharmacies or to 3secondary distributors? 4 Mr. Vranian? 5 MR. VRANIAN: As the manufacturer on the panel, 6I can only speak from experience at Novartis Animal 7Health and only conjecture about what others might do. 8There appears to be a range across the industry. Some 9might leverage the secondary market to obtain sales they 10might not have obtained through the veterinary channel. 11We've seen, over the past two decades, companies claim 12to try and be able to control that, claim to be able to 13police it and implement measures that they say can stop 14it, but even those products tend to wind up in the 15veterinary market. 16 I think in both cases, it can be a distraction 17for both the manufacturer and the veterinarian when our 18primary purpose is ensuring the safe, quality health 19care of our pets. So, we've been in this industry for 20two decades. We started before the Internet, it was 21before my time, but my sense is that this really started 22happening with the advent of online retailing. We had a 23history of trying to stop it. It was impossible. It's 24clear that this is an economic force and where there's 25sufficient demand for a product, the consumer or the104 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551market is going to find a way. 2 It's not our place, and there are many 3illegitimate secondary markets, but a secondary supply 4can be done legally and it's not our place to prevent a 5legal business from operating in any way. 6 So, we refocus on controlling what we can 7control and that's focusing on the health and well-being 8of our patients. To the extent that we see a 9counterfeit or unapproved product, that is aggressively 10pursued and reported. Let me put that out there. We 11ask our contractual customers to guarantee what they are 12going to do in the context of the Veterinarian-Client- 13Patient-Relationship. We don't incentivize our sales force 14to somehow look for opportunities to create a secondary 15market. They are not incentivized if those things are 16found. And if we learn of somebody that has represented 17to us that they're going to sell in the context of the 18Veterinarian-Client-Patient-Relationship and breaches 19that representation, we have terminated supply 20relationships with those clients. 21 We don't publish this to other customers, we 22don't use it as a marketing tactic at all. I think 23that's part of the distraction we're talking about. 24Instead, we consider it our job to focus on what we can 25control. Does that mean that some of our product leaks105 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551through to the market? We know it does. Our best 2estimate is between two and five percent maybe on an 3annual basis winds up in the secondary market. The cost 4of trying to stop that, setting aside competitive 5issues, is just cost prohibitive. 6 We focus on bringing clients back to the 7veterinarian and controlling what we can control. In 8the end, our objective through these measures is to 9protect the quality and health and life of animals. It's 10not to protect the channel, control distribution, limit 11competition or support inefficient businesses. Rather, 12our driving goal is to meet our medical needs through 13the innovation and ensure the health and quality and 14life of our companion animals. 15 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 16 I don't know if anybody would have a response to 17this, but how do veterinarians view the practice of 18their colleagues reselling products to retail pharmacies 19or to secondary distributors? 20 Dr. Pion? 21 DR. PION: They certainly are not looked upon 22kindly, but also, I think it makes us sad that 23colleagues can't support themselves by providing services 24and need to look for other ways. I talk to veterinarians 25every day now who are going bankrupt, and that makes me106 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551worry about the future of our profession and the ability to 2provide the services and the relationship that everybody 3here seems to value so highly. 4 So, in some ways, I can understand the 5desperation of some, and I don't understand those who 6purely get into it when they don't need that. I'm not 7justifying it in any way. I see it outside the way 8things are supposed to be, but I see that a lot in the 9world. 10 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 11 MS. JEX: I want to thank everyone for 12submitting so many questions, I'm having a little 13trouble figuring out how to ask them all. So, bear with 14me. 15 There are several questions from the audience 16that relate directly or indirectly to the issue of the 17term \"diversion\" or \"gray market.\" Many people are 18familiar with the term \"diversion\" as used in the human 19pharmaceutical market, which typically involves 20counterfeit, adulterated or the illegal trade in 21narcotics. In our workshop, we've been using the term 22\"secondary distribution,\" but the terms \"diversion\" and 23\"gray market\" have also come up in the context of our 24workshop today. 25 Could any panelist address the issue of how is107 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551diversion different in the animal pet medicines market 2as opposed to the human pharmaceuticals market, and with 3regard to the issue of secondary distribution, what is 4the legality, the status of the legality of, for 5example, a veterinarian who has a valid wholesaler 6distributor's license, reselling prescription products 7into the secondary distribution channel? 8 I apologize for the complexity of the question. 9 MS. WILKINSON: Yes, Mr. Jones? 10 MR. JONES: As you mentioned, the term 11\"diversion\" in the human side of prescription drug 12distribution generally always implies something illegal 13occurring such as the diversion of controlled 14substances, the diversion of complex special priced 15medications within that system. 16 As far as the diversion of the veterinary 17prescription drugs, as we've touched on here on the 18panel, there are some very widely varying regulations 19that deal with veterinary drug distribution, and some 20states actually allow veterinarians to have a wholesale 21license, and it's not illegal for the veterinarian to 22wholesale their products. Some are allowed to actually 23obtain a veterinary wholesale distribution license and 24there are no specific audit trail requirements in 25whether they buy under their veterinary license and sell108 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551under their wholesale license. 2 So, these terms \"diversion\" may not be as negative 3in the veterinary industry related to the legality of them 4as they are on the human side. 5 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 6 Mr. Smith? 7 MR. SMITH: So, just maybe a quick point of 8clarification. First, I used to work for Walmart two 9years ago, I no longer do. So, at some point I'm 10reflecting back on some of the things that we were 11working on and considering then. 12 As it relates to the way Walmart, and I presume 13other retailers, work, when a product comes into 14Walmart, vendors are required to indemnify the retailer 15as to the integrity of the product, to the efficacy, the 16safety of the product, that the product is what it 17claims to be, and that's the requirement of the vendor 18who delivers the product into Walmart. 19 The challenge a retailer has with diversion from 20a legal perspective is that our preference is not to 21divert product, because the chain of custody becomes 22really problematic. We would prefer sourcing the 23product from the manufacturer to know that that supply 24chain has had all the integrity, all the controls. So, 25diversion is something that creates this legal gray area109 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551as well, and it's not good for anybody when that legal 2uncertainty exists. 3 I know Walmart, for one, would prefer to do 4business with all these great manufacturers who provide 5products to their human pharmacy. That's safer for 6everyone involved, if that were the case. 7 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 8 I would like to move on now and discuss the 9exclusive dealing arrangements that may exist between 10some manufacturers and distributors. In particular, I'm 11interested in understanding what are the business 12rationales for these types of exclusive dealing 13arrangements? 14 Mr. Vranian? 15 MR. VRANIAN: We don't have them. Novartis, on 16behalf of Novartis, we don't use them, but we know they 17exist out there. I would be interested in the 18distribution perspective on this, but some context as to 19the role of distribution within animal health is helpful 20and we received some good context in the opening 21comments. But it's absolutely essential in the 22veterinary medication industry, if you have 25,000 23customers out there -- so distributors have a sales force 24that has a huge share of voice with these customers -- 25they're one-stop shopping for the veterinarian.110 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551Everything from Novartis products to syringes to latex 2gloves, they can rely on their distributor for. 3 We have one of the most highly qualified or 4highly respected sales forces in the industry, about 300 5folks out in the field. But for every one visit that one 6of our guys or one of our sales representatives has in 7the field, they get five to seven from a distributor 8rep. There's just a share of voice out there. 9 Most distributors deal with all manufacturers. 10I think they pride themselves on the ability to carry 11everything, to be one-stop shopping for everybody. 12 It's particularly relevant today, and that's 13because distributors can be very effective when you're 14launching a product, with that voice. What I 15referenced earlier, the ability to launch the new 16information, the science to a veterinarian, having that 17presence within the clinic is very valuable. As our 18industry shifts into more generics and we're seeing a 19rise in generics, each generic in and of itself is a 20launch, so to speak. So, the ability to leverage 21distribution to that is a useful thing. 22 We've seen both sides of it. We've had 23competing molecules to ours that have gone off patent 24launch and become part of differentiated generics and 25they've, through savvy use of distribution and certainly111 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551merits of the product, achieved extraordinary 2penetration within a year. It's been good. 3 We've also been on the other end of it. We 4recently launched a generic version of a blockbuster 5product, and a differentiated generic, the one that had 6the off-patent molecule with a compound that provided 7superior efficacy. This product was well adopted by the 8vets that adopted it, but we were unable to access 9distributors. We presume that was due to an exclusive 10dealing arrangement. Obviously we don't know the 11details of it, but we achieved one, two percent penetration 12on that product in a launch. You had a superior, 13lower-priced product that was just not getting that 14share of voice out there. 15 So, to the extent exclusive arrangements can be 16done in a pro-competitive manner that may facilitate 17lower prices or access to medicines, but to the extent 18that they're done to protect from market forces, I think 19that they're anti-competitive. 20 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 21 Mr. Cushing? 22 MR. CUSHING: Thank you. I appreciate the 23explanation from Novartis. 24 First of all, it's much less common than you 25might think, and the line between generics and pioneer112 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551of course changes. Bayer just announced it acquired Teva 2on the animal side. So, our members of the AVDA 3typically have between 20 and 50 generic products in 4their portfolio. As counsel for Novartis said, it's a 5very competitive business, multiple distributors carry 6multiple manufacturers' products and that happens all 7the time out there in the marketplace. Some 8distributors are regional, a handful are national, and 9the instances are very few. You can count on one hand, 10I believe, you don't need all five digits to count to my 11understanding the cases where there would be an 12exclusivity only as to a specific generic tied to a 13specific pioneer product. And there's a couple of those 14instances, but this is not a typical practice and certainly 15not one on a scale that would, I think, concern the FTC. 16It's also not unlawful, to state that up front, but it's 17just not a common practice. So, I think it's much less of 18a concern. 19 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 20 Mr. Bane? 21 MR. BANE: It's become less of a concern, it's 22actually changed over the last handful of years or so, 23and there are fewer of these instances. I think it's 24becoming less and less of a problem. In addition, 25because of some of the newer business approaches, not113 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551everybody is under those same restrictions. In fact, 2we've never signed an exclusivity contract with anyone. 3We feel as though from a pharmacist's perspective, we 4need to be able to provide those medications that we're 5being requested to fulfill, so I have never signed an 6exclusive arrangement with any manufacturer. 7 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 8 Mr. Smith? 9 MR. SMITH: I'm kind of confused by that because 10I don't understand how access is being made available to 11all pharmacists, it's just not true. A pharmacist can, 12like a Walmart pharmacy, for instance, can secure the 13drug if we're willing to work with a diverter, but there 14is an exclusive distribution reality in terms of who the 15product is going to and it's to certain distributors who 16then in turn will not deliver it to Walmart. 17 I think it's important here to kind of talk 18about exclusive distribution and what I think it 19effectively does. From the manufacturer's perspective, 20they're very happy to have brands that are effectively 21supported by that recommendation of the veterinarian. 22And as long as they can preserve a place where theirs is 23the exclusive product that's being recommended, that's a 24tremendous place to be when every consumer is interested 25in following the advice and the counsel of their trusted114 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinarian. The brand value associated with that vet 2recommendation is I can charge higher prices, I can have 3higher margins, because it's what the veterinarian has 4established from a brand perspective as the most 5efficacious, the most optimal medical treatment. 6 From the veterinarian's side, if they can avoid 7a brand or a competing product, they have a challenge as 8well, because they have a conflict of interest, because 9their recommendation creates a lot of sway with the 10consumer. 11 To the comment earlier -- \"this is a solution 12looking for a problem\" -- I think there's a real problem 13that needs a solution. And I think when you look at the 14American Medical Association, and this is a quote from 15the American Medical Association, I think I referenced 16it, \"Under no circumstances may physicians place their 17own financial interest above the welfare of their 18patients. If a conflict develops between the 19physician's financial interest and the physician's 20responsibility to the patient, the conflict must be 21resolved to the patient's benefit.\" So, to me, the 22problem here is when an exclusive distribution is 23connected to the legal right to also prescribe, and it's 24in a limited number of places where that product can be 25dispensed, you have a problem with a conflict of interest. 115 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551We don't dislike our human physicians, but we expect our 2human physicians to be completely objective and independent 3in the things that they prescribe to us, the medical 4direction they give us. And as long as there's a personal 5interest in there, that can be really challenged. I think 6that's the problem that needs the solution. 7 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 8 Dr. Pion? 9 DR. PION: So, a couple of points. One, I think 10when you look at 1406 and you look at the prior comment, 11I don't think the focus really needs to be on the 12veterinarian. I think if you look historically -- and your 13question was more about manufacturer-distributor 14relationships than it was to pharmacists, but of course 15they're down the chain -- it is true that it's less of 16an issue today. But I don't think that was as much a 17voluntary choice as just the reality that as is happening 18in many industries, very much in the veterinary industry, 19consolidation is taking place. The number of 20distributors who came together and were bought up and 21gobbled up, it just created confusion. Because now you 22had to actually -- when the consolidation began, 23actually that discussion happened, okay? You sell this 24manufacturer and this manufacturer. When you 25consolidate, you're going to have to choose. I think 116 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551eventually it got down to so few that that conversation 2didn't make sense anymore. 3 I don't think it's in anybody's best interest, 4other than the manufacturers, to have those type of 5exclusive relationships; not to the consumer, not to the 6veterinarian, both for price, convenience and other 7reasons. I think that it did lead to some predatory 8practices. I mean, I think the place it still occurs in 9our industry is in the veterinary lab sector and 10especially in-house. I know that the FTC is 11investigating that as well within our industry. 12 That involves distributor relationships as well, 13where there are some of the larger lab providers are 14playing unfairly and making it impossible for others to 15compete. 16 So, I think the answer to your basic question is 17that the restricted practices are in nobody's best 18interest, other than the manufacturers. 19 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 20 Mr. Hinckle? 21 MR. HINCKLE: I'm not able to really comment on 22the pervasiveness of these types of agreements, and it may 23be that they're rare, I don't know. But what I can say 24from my personal knowledge, what I've heard from 25my clients, I've had at least one client tell me that117 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551they were considering launching what I would consider 2more of a branded generic, much like Novartis was 3talking about. So, these are generics in the sense that 4they're approved through a pathway that relies somewhat 5on a prior product, but the fact is they are sold as a 6branded product through the veterinary channels directly 7to vets. They opted to discontinue their R&D program, 8because they felt like because of the exclusive 9arrangements that were there, they were not going to be 10able to get market penetration. That's one anecdotal 11thing from my experience. 12 I would also say that there's a difference when 13we're talking about generic products because those 14branded generics that compete with the brands as a brand 15product with a sales force through the veterinary 16channels versus what one would consider on the human 17side a more typical straight generic that's sold maybe 18even without a brand name in a retail pharmacy and 19relies on pharmacy substitution or drug selection 20depending on the state laws where the pharmacist 21actually makes the switch in the pharmacy. 22 That's what I've pointed out before is really 23missing in the animal drug market now. 24 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 25 Finally, Mr. Cushing?118 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 MR. CUSHING: Yes, just two points to respond to 2my colleague. First, we were talking, there's two types 3of exclusivity, and I think you may have been thinking 4this statement was made that there's not a number of 5exclusive relationships vis-a-vis veterinarians. Yes, 6there are exclusive vet channels. We were discussing, I 7thought, the issue of exclusivity in terms of very 8limited practices where a manufacturer would say to a 9distributor, if you carry X, you can't carry Y, that was 10the comment made there, and that was quite limited. 11 However, having the microphone, I do want to 12comment that I think, and I'll just be blunt, I think 13it's superficially appealing, but I think it's unfair to 14veterinarians to create this drama around a so-called 15conflict of interest that they have and that they're 16somehow placing pricing burdens on their clients. 17 Number one, I just don't think that factually 18describes what happens. And secondly, veterinarians, all 19day long, utilize a whole host of medications, many of 20which are human, many of which are prescribed through 21pharmacies, to address their clients' pets' needs, and I 22don't think there's this calculation going on that somehow 23they're attempting to maximize their revenue via 24some preferred branded product. I think that theory sounds 25attractive and would get people excited. I hate to119 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551disappoint folks, I don't think that's the reality of 2the U.S. veterinary practice. I think if it was, you 3would have seen consumers storming Congress when there were 4efforts made by parties supporting 1406, there was a 5broad social media effort to get consumers to go to 6Congress and show your concern about this practice. 7Hence my solution in search of a problem, because guess 8what, the phones didn't ring, the emails didn't fly. 9You didn't see pet owners perceiving that they were in 10the sort of vise that's been described, and I just don't 11think that's the factual case and for that reason 12Congress hasn't taken any interest after two years. 13 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 14 Mr. Hinckle, would you like to briefly respond? 15 MR. HINCKLE: No, I'm sorry. 16 MS. WILKINSON: I saw your placard up. So, we 17are technically -- 18 MR. POWERS: I have a response. 19 MS. WILKINSON: Brief response, Mr. Powers? 20 MR. POWERS: I disagree once again with 21Mr. Cushing down there. I do believe there's a problem. 22I believe that 1406 may or may not be a bad bill, we can 23discuss that this afternoon, but I don't think as many 24consumers, pet consumers knew about that or were able to 25be as reactive to that as Mr. Cushing stated. I do120 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551think there is a distribution problem. Again, Dr. Pion 2said that veterinarians shouldn't care whether the 3channels of distribution are open or not, and he laid 4the blame at the feet of the manufacturers. I agree 5with him. And for the life of me, with all due respect 6to Mr. Vranian, I don't understand why companies like 7his or Pfizer restrict distribution to a company like 8ours who has both veterinarians and pharmacists on 9staff. Thank you. 10 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 11 We are technically at the stopping point for 12this panel, but I think it would be important to try to 13go into some of the safety issues that we were planning 14to get to. If people on the panel are willing to spend 15another maybe five to ten minutes discussing, I think it 16might be worthwhile to extend our time a bit. Is that 17all right with everyone? Okay. We'll try to move 18through this very quickly. 19 What product safety issues exist with respect to 20the secondary distribution system that people feel 21haven't already been addressed? 22 MR. BANE: I'm not sure that they haven't 23already been addressed. As Gregg said, from the NABP, 24the regulations vary from state to state. I'm no JD, but 25have read more than I care to remember about the121 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551distribution requirements from state to state, and there 2are concerns that when we have what's called a normal 3distribution supply chain on the human side that's 4regulated by pedigree, that was put in place for a 5reason. There were tremendous abuses going on. If 6anybody wants a good read, Dangerous Doses is a 7fantastic historical account of exactly why those rules 8were put in place. 9 I think that some of the practices today create 10these loopholes whereby it's just a matter of time 11before there's some adulterated or counterfeit product 12that's going to be placed in the marketplace. Arguments 13are that maybe these compounds aren't that important and 14the criminals will focus their efforts elsewhere. But 15certain shortages in the marketplace and existing demand 16by consumers I think will ultimately lead to some places 17whereby these products can enter through a non-regulated 18mechanism into the channel and there's potential dangers 19there. 20 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 21 Mr. Miller? 22 MR. MILLER: A very interesting question given 23some recent discussions on the FDA side, specifically as 24they pertain to human drug shortage issues. And what has 25cropped up in response to that with gray market, where122 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551pharmacies purchase then sell back to other wholesalers, 2who sell to other tertiary wholesalers, who sell to other 3pharmacies. And what you see is this massive churn in 4the system. And where the safety issues start to come in, 5as those of us, the pharmacists on the panel, my 6preference is to always purchase either directly from 7the manufacturer, or through a wholesaler who has a 8direct relationship that is licensed and regulated. 9 The minute we start, as I mentioned before in my 10own presentation, when I have to obtain a product from a 11veterinarian because I can't buy it through my regular 12channel, two types of safety start to play a 13part of it. Number one is, how is that medication 14handled? Was it stored appropriately? Did it go 15through the appropriate environmental handling methods 16that we expect? 17 The second is, is it what it is? Because the 18minute that you start introducing an additional player -- 19a veterinarian who sells to a pharmacy, a pharmacy that 20sells to a secondary supplier, a veterinarian that sells 21to a wholesaler -- you give the opportunity, as you were 22just saying, to have diversion in the truest sense, 23which is the introduction of false or counterfeit 24medications into the system. The minute I don't know 25where this came from, as a pharmacist, as a123 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551practitioner, as a veterinarian, then there is a safety 2issue. 3 The unfortunate thing -- and we see this on the 4human side, it's even worse on the veterinarian side -- is 5if we have treatment failure because of a medication, 6we don't know because of the current marketplace whether 7that medication didn't work or it's not what it says it 8was. Because I don't have that assurance of the supply 9chain integrity that I should have, but has unfortunately 10been manipulated by relationships between manufacturers 11and the terms that they place on the wholesale distribution 12system or veterinarians themselves. 13 We need to open the marketplace up so that 14legitimate, licensed pharmacies can purchase the same 15way that a veterinarian can purchase from either 16directly a manufacturer or wholesaler. Then there will 17be no need for a secondary market. 18 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 19 Finally, Dr. Pion? 20 DR. PION: I think just for completeness, since 21I think we've covered most of the issues, there's one 22indicator that I think the market has gotten much more 23open but a source of question of how deep the diversion 24definition went in this market is in years past there 25was a significant amount of the online pharmacies, et124 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551cetera, that would deliver products that were registered 2for outside this country coming in, Australian products 3and other countries. And I think it speaks to how open 4the market currently is that I really don't hear that 5from colleagues that clients aren't coming in with those 6products anymore. So, it seems like there is adequate 7openness to the chain at this moment. 8 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 9 Moving quickly through this, there have been a 10number of concerns raised today about pharmacists who 11may be untrained in veterinary pharmacology dispensing 12pet medications. I have a few questions about that. 13One is could manufacturers of pet medications provide 14product training to retail pharmacists similar to the 15types of training they provide to veterinarians? If 16anybody would like to respond to that. 17 Mr. Vranian, you're the manufacturer on the 18panel, so you might be the obvious place to start. 19 MR. VRANIAN: To the extent that doing so would 20enhance the quality of pet care, absolutely. But as I 21mentioned earlier, we have a $2 million market product 22and -- I don't know how many -- 60,000 pharmacists around 23the country. It may wind up increasing the price of 24certain products. But our primary goal is the quality of 25life for the animal.125 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 2 Mr. Dayton? 3 MR. DAYTON: As I said in my presentation, a 4pharmacist might not always know the answer to every 5question. But it was mentioned earlier that if you have 6a package insert that is the way a pharmacist, when they 7do not know information, gathers information and uses it. 8So, if we have the package insert coming from a 9manufacturer, we have a better chance to answer 10questions and dispense medication properly. So, I think 11that it addresses the safety. Dr. Pion in his presentation 12addressed that pharmacists are already a trusted partner 13in the medications that we do dispense. If the market 14is opened up, we have access to that information. I feel 15that pharmacists can continue to be that trusted partner. 16 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 17 Mr. Miller? 18 MR. MILLER: The question was whether the 19manufacturing industry has a responsibility to educate 20the pharmacy profession. I would say absolutely not. 21That is ultimately our responsibility. It needs to fall 22within our curriculum, it needs to fall within the 23continuing professional education, our board 24certification processes, the specialty that pharmacy 25has, just as any other health care profession does.126 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 Having come from the pharmaceutical industry and 2having worked in education, the objective of a 3manufacturer is not to teach how to, but rather to teach 4about the product that they are bringing to market, the 5particular therapeutic class, where it fits, new diagnosis, 6new trends. 7 So, I think we have an obligation as pharmacists 8to train ourselves. We need to do that collaboratively 9through our professional organizations, with AVMA, but 10most especially, and I want to re-emphasize this, 11because it's been mentioned a few times and I find it 12personally very disturbing as a practitioner. You know 13what, if a pharmacist is making an error or making a 14judgment call that is inappropriate, there is a way to 15handle that. And that is actually through our boards of 16pharmacy. If a pharmacist changed a human prescription, 17without calling the doctor, that's illegal. It's like 18pharmacy 101. It's illegal. We're not allowed to do 19that. And you guys will come and get me. 20 It should never happen in the veterinary 21industry either. I will tell you right now, AVMA, if 22you know of instances, you need to get that in front of 23our boards of pharmacy because that is not the way 24practice is done. This is collaboration. Ultimately, 25pharmacists, vets, need to train each other on how best127 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551to work together, not the manufacturers. 2 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 3 I'm going to give Mr. Cushing and Dr. Pion a 4chance to respond, but just in follow-up to what 5Mr. Miller just raised, should retail pharmacies or 6pharmacy schools be offering veterinary pharmacology 7training to pharmacists? 8 Mr. Miller? 9 MR. MILLER: Yeah, that's a no-brainer, sorry, 10Stephanie. Yeah, of course, we should. 11 MS. WILKINSON: I wondered if anybody else 12wanted to respond to that. 13 Okay, Mr. Cushing? 14 MR. CUSHING: Thank you. I think, first of all, 15the key is for pharmacists, which most do, to understand 16that if they are inclined to change and not deliver the 17product that was prescribed by the veterinarian, pick up 18the phone and call. I mean, that's the most basic idea 19here. I will say, had we had state VMA officials 20participate, you would have heard it is not an easy 21thing. And there have been many efforts in many states 22to work with state boards of pharmacy. And as you may 23expect, some are easier to work with than others. Some 24are more successful than others. It's to get the pet 25owner, the veterinarian may hear about it much later to128 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551get in and make sure you've got all the evidence to go 2to a state board of pharmacy and begin a proceeding. 3It's complicated. People can decide it may or may not be 4worth their effort to do. There's a lot of ongoing 5discussion. I know in the case of Oregon, the Oregon 6VMA and the State Board of Pharmacy talk all the time. And 7unfortunately, it's not as simple -- and I'm sure you 8don't think that -- but it's not as simple as it may sound 9and there's a lot of ongoing effort to try to do that. 10 You're right, that's what should ultimately 11happen, because the state board of pharmacy should say, 12don't do that, and stop that practice. 13 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 14 Dr. Pion? 15 DR. PION: So, I think in theory it sounds easy, 16and that label is clear and confusing. But the reality 17is, in our profession, off-label usage, whether a 18veterinary product or non-veterinary product, is the 19majority of usage. And much of that information is 20generated after the product's released. It costs the 21manufacturer a huge amount to go back for another 22indication, another label. They don't want to change 23that label. If the product is out there, and the 24profession is learning how to use it and evolving and 25finding other uses, that's what they want. It's not129 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551even just off-label at indication, it's moving it into 2other species. Most of the time a product gets into 3another market just for one species or two species and 4then they're looking to refine where we can use it in 5other species. There's many indications where the label 6dose is wrong, and it doesn't go back and get changed. 7But it's through collegial communication that it gets 8communicated that this is a better dose, and you can 9follow that in many ways. 10 Just to address the simplicity of reporting 11things to the boards, I know in our work, we have called 12many veterinary boards, many pharmacy boards, on 13pharmacy issues, and often there's confusion in the 14states about who's responsible. We call the pharmacy 15board, they say, why are you calling us, call the 16veterinary board. We call the veterinary board, they 17say, why are you calling us, call the pharmacy board. 18And they don't even know if diversion, as we've defined 19it here, is legal or illegal. They don't know if in 20their states veterinarians can resell prescription drugs. 21So, I think there's many levels here that contribute to 22the situation where we're at. 23 MS. WILKINSON: Thank you. 24 One final question that I will probably pose to 25Mr. Vranian, what position do manufacturers take on130 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551whether to guarantee products that are distributed 2through the secondary distribution system, and do 3manufacturers have concerns about product liability 4issues in the event that consumers purchase either 5expired or adulterated products from retailers? 6 MR. VRANIAN: We certainly have those issues 7with adulterated products, which underscores some of 8our distribution practices that we've discussed earlier. 9On the product support, I think you need to 10differentiate between technical medical support and 11perhaps commercial premiums or premium support, for lack 12of a better term. 13 We provide technical support irrespective of 14origin. Everything, no matter where somebody bought a 15product, is reported to the FDA as an adverse event and 16that adverse event is logged and becomes part of the 17technical support record. 18 Where a veterinarian is involved, one of our 19voluntary policies is to provide reimbursed diagnostic 20costs where our product may have failed or where 21efficacy could be an issue or have caused an adverse 22event. Necessarily a veterinarian needs to be involved 23in that equation. There's patient records, there's a 24history of that patient. So where that's initiated by 25the veterinarian, which is who we usually get the call131 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551from, the origin of the call does not make the 2determination. 3 Now, if somebody calls us from the street and 4they've purchased it from the secondary market and 5demands free product, that will probably be the end of 6the discussion right there and that's just not something 7we do. Each of these is honestly looked at on a 8case-by-case basis, but that diagnostic reimbursement 9guarantee is what I would call our premium level 10support, and honestly, where a veterinarian is involved, 11where they initiate, it is not determined by product 12origin. 13 MS. WILKINSON: Mr. Powers, if you would like to 14briefly respond? 15 MR. POWERS: The second part of that you asked, 16Stephanie, what about expired product, et cetera. I 17think as David Miller suggested, the easiest way to 18solve the distribution channel issue in secondary 19distribution in gray markets is for the manufacturer to 20have direct relationships through themselves or through 21authorized distributors with companies like ours. When 22you talk about old or outdated product, ironically -- 23and I don't mean to cast any aspersions on the veterinary 24profession, some of my best friends are veterinarians -- 25an article this summer in DVM Magazine reported when in132 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551Massachusetts they inspected veterinary clinics, 20 percent 2of those clinics had misused, expired or poorly handled 3products. In some cases it was the second or third 4offense of those clinics. 5 So, the issue of product viability, efficacy, 6and whether outdated or not, extends throughout the 7channel, and I think it needs to be policed at every 8level. One of the things that companies like ours and 9other people here who are Vet-VIPPS certified do is they 10have a prescribed policy for handling product and how 11the product is stored and they have to follow it or they 12lose certification. 13 MS. WILKINSON: We have definitely gone way over 14our time and I think in order for people to have enough 15time to eat lunch before our afternoon sessions we do 16probably need to end the discussion. 17 I would like to thank all of our panelists for 18their participation. I think this has been a really 19interesting and informative discussion. If everyone 20would please join me in a round of applause for our 21panelists. 22 (Applause.) 23 MS. WILKINSON: So, we'll now take a short 24lunch break and meet back here at 1:00 for our 25afternoon panels. There are hand-outs out in the133 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551hallway about lunch venues that are nearby and many of them 2move very quickly. Thank you. 3 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., a lunch recess was 4taken.) 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25134 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 AFTERNOON SESSION 2 (1:02 p.m.) 3 PANEL TWO 4 PORTABILITY OF PRESCRIPTION PET MEDICATIONS 5 MS. KOSLOV: I think we will go ahead and get 6started with our afternoon session, if everyone could 7please take their seats. 8 Good afternoon, everyone, thanks for coming back 9from lunch. My name is Tara Koslov. I am the deputy 10director of the FTC's Office of Policy Planning, and on 11behalf of all of us, I would like to thank you again for 12coming to our workshop. I would especially like to 13thank this morning's panelists and presenters for their 14excellent presentations and discussion. 15 In our first panel this afternoon, which focuses 16on prescription portability, we hope to really 17build on some of the topics we heard about this morning 18and see where we can go from there. 19 One thing that's become clear from what we've 20heard so far is that any discussion of what's best for 21consumers and their pets has to start by recognizing the 22importance of the Veterinarian-Client-Patient-Relationship. 23Of course, pets should be properly examined and diagnosed 24by a veterinarian so that the vet can determine the 25appropriate course of treatment and that might include 135 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551the prescription of medication. 2 So, with that context and framing in mind, what 3we hope to focus on in the next session today is what's 4the best way to handle the dispensing of pet 5medications, assuming that there is a prescription for 6medication. 7 Historically, vets have done most of the 8dispensing and selling of pet medications, not just the 9providing of the medication, but also providing 10important information and counseling to ensure proper 11administration of drugs. But as we heard this morning, 12there are other alternatives that have become more 13prevalent in the pet meds marketplace, in particular 14over the last ten years, as we've heard, there has been 15a larger presence not only by brick-and-mortar, but also 16online retail pharmacies. And it seems that more consumers 17are, indeed, asking their vets for portable 18prescriptions so that they can shop around among 19alternative sources. 20 The issue of prescription portability clearly 21implicates a very complex network of state-by-state laws 22and regulations. So, to start our afternoon's 23discussion, in order to provide us with a foundation for 24the subsequent panel discussion, we are going to begin 25with an overview presentation by Adrian Hochstadt. He136 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551is the director of the AVMA's State Legislative and 2Regulatory Affairs Division. He is going to explain some 3of the basic issues and applicable state and federal 4policies on prescribing and dispensing pet medications. 5He will also provide us with a brief summary of H.R. 61406, the legislation that we heard a little bit about 7this morning which would mandate, among other things, 8that vets provide written prescriptions. 9 After Mr. Hochstadt's presentation, we will ask 10our panelists to quickly yet gracefully get themselves 11to the table, and we will explore a variety of factual 12and policy questions relating to the provision of 13prescriptions to pet owners following a similar format 14to this morning. 15 So, Mr. Hochstadt, you are welcome to come up. 16Thanks. 17 MR. HOCHSTADT: Thank you, Ms. Koslov. It's a 18pleasure to be here. So, I'm going to introduce the 19second panel. We'll try to keep the flow going after 20lunch. Hopefully everybody is back. 21 I'm going to cover quickly some of the basic 22tenets of prescription writing and dispensing. 23I want to touch on the AVMA Principles of Veterinary 24Medical Ethics, talk a little bit about state regulation 25in this area, and also go over the basic elements of H.R.137 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 555511406. 2 So, let's get right to it. The basic tenets of 3prescription writing. Pet medications are either 4dispensed by a veterinarian as medically indicated, or the 5veterinarian provides a written prescription to a client 6who may then have the prescription dispensed at the 7pharmacy of his or her choice, either retail or online. 8 Prescriptions sometimes are provided by fax or 9telephone, although that's subject to state rules, and 10also DEA rules on controlled substances. 11 Traditionally, we've heard that veterinarians 12stock and dispense pet medications due to his or her 13specialized knowledge and training, and the fact that 14pharmacies didn't stock many animal drugs years and 15years ago. It was seen, and I think it still is, as one 16product of a larger service provided by that 17veterinarian. 18 In the last 30 years or so, we have seen more 19pharmacies, especially online, selling pet medications 20and prescriptions are being written. What caught my 21attention is a study referenced in the AVDA comments 22submitted to the FTC. During a 12-month period, in 232010-2011, more than 45,000 veterinarians provided more 24than four million prescriptions to be filled through a 25retail pharmacy location. So, these prescriptions are138 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551being written. Under state laws and FDA rules, however, a 2pharmacy may only dispense a pet drug, pet medication to 3the client with a prescription from a veterinarian. 4 You heard a little bit about the Veterinarian- 5Client-Patient-Relationship, the VCPR. This is a 6critical piece at arriving at a decision that a 7prescription drug is needed. It's based on the 8lifestyle of the client, the needs of the animal, and 9the specific needs based on the situation. 10 A veterinarian may fulfill pharmacy-initiated 11requests, but only if medically appropriate, and in most 12states, within a VCPR that I mentioned. 13 Let me touch on the AVMA Principles of 14Veterinary Medical Ethics. Something was brought up 15during the first panel a little bit. This is a code of 16ethics. Like all the other code of ethics, they're 17basically the defining rules of what's right and what's 18wrong within a given profession. They were developed in 19the 19th Century in the learned professions, law and 20medicine primarily, and the essence of veterinary 21medical ethics was captured by one of the founders of 22veterinary medicine in the U.S., Alexandre Liautard, not 23for ourselves alone, or non nobis solum . And this is 24probably the last time that you will hear a Latin phrase 25today.139 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 The AVMA approved the Principles of Veterinary 2Medical Ethics for the first time in 1867 to promote 3exemplary professional conduct and uphold the dignity of 4the profession. The document, of course, is revised as 5need be, to assure relevance to current professional 6practices and expectations. 7 The AVMA Principles address professional 8behavior in a number of areas, ranging from what's 9appropriate in consulting and referring clients, what 10are improper influences on judgment, keeping appropriate 11medical records, inappropriate fee arrangements, 12advertising, and the topic under examination today, the 13prescribing and dispensing of products to clients for 14use on their animals. 15 As explained previously, state governments 16license, regulate, and discipline veterinarians. So, 17while the AVMA Principles on their own are not 18enforceable, keep in mind that 12 states have 19incorporated these Principles into their disciplinary 20standards. And in the other states, certainly the 21AVMA Principles are a guiding tool to help those state 22veterinary boards determine what is unprofessional 23conduct. 24 Section III(c) of the AVMA Principles state that 25dispensing or prescribing a prescription product140 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551requires a VCPR. Now, almost every state has adopted 2this language in some form. The VCPR is required for 3treating a patient, but also for prescribing or 4dispensing. 5 The VCPR requirement is also specifically 6incorporated into the federal rules in three places, 7which I'm going to show briefly. I don't plan on going 8into too much depth here. I wanted you to have the Code 9of Federal Regulations citation if anyone wants to do 10some follow-up on this, but autogenous biologics is one 11area, extra label drug use, VCPR definition was 12incorporated in this FDA rule, and veterinary fee 13directive, which applies more to food animals, but I did 14want to mention that the VCPR is also mentioned in those 15requirements. 16 Another AVMA Principles provision that is of 17interest here is paragraph III(c), a veterinarian should 18honor a client's request for a prescription in lieu of 19dispensing. Now, let's take a look at how states have 20addressed this provision. We have the 17 states that 21you see in green, that have a specific law or regulation 22or policy statement that basically mirrors that 23provision of the AVMA Principles that clients, when they 24request a prescription, the veterinarian should honor 25that client's request.141 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 So, we have these 17 states. In an additional 2ten states, the AVMA Principles of Veterinary Medical 3Ethics, which again, incorporate that provision, 4officially is part of the disciplinary rules. There's 5some overlap. There are two states with both a specific 6law and which have incorporated the Principles. But the 7total, if you take the two groups, you're looking at 27 8states with something specific in writing on the books 9that require a veterinarian to honor that client's 10request. 11 So, what happens in the other 23 states? I'm 12sorry, let me mention a couple of unique regulations 13that have to do more with notice, providing notice. 14Arizona, for example, has a law -- it's actually an 15administrative regulation -- that requires a dispensing 16veterinarian to notify the owner that some prescription 17drugs and controlled substances may be available at a 18pharmacy, and there are three ways of providing this 19notice. Note that under paragraph (B), however, a 20dispensing veterinarian may -- and it's permissive, not 21mandatory -- may provide a written prescription to the 22owner if requested. 23 Well, California has a slightly different 24statute there. The prescriber also must offer notice, 25but also the prescriber in California, prior to142 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551dispensing, must offer to give a written prescription to 2the patient that the patient can then elect to have 3filled with a pharmacy, or with a prescriber. So, 4California has a notice requirement, and in addition to 5that, also a requirement that the prescriber must offer 6to write a prescription. 7 Before we leave California, though, I did want 8to talk a little bit about the other 23 states, because 9I don't want to leave you with the wrong impression. 10It's important to note that even in states without 11specific laws or regulations, the state boards of 12veterinary medicine, as we heard before, regulate the 13profession. They could easily find in acting on a 14complaint that failure to honor a client's request for a 15prescription constitutes unprofessional conduct, which 16can lead to discipline. 17 Unprofessional conduct generally refers to a 18departure from or failure to conform to the standards of 19acceptable and prevailing practice of veterinary 20medicine. State boards do routinely look at the AVMA 21Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics as a guiding 22tool or principle in how to define unprofessional 23conduct. 24 In addition to the threat of disciplinary 25action, veterinarians also have some other practical143 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551disincentives for not honoring a client's request, 2whether those are business reasons; alienating the 3client is probably not a real good idea; or even the 4threat of legal exposure when that particular pet needs 5medication on a timely basis, and failure to honor that 6request for prescription could actually expose the 7veterinarian to some liability. 8 So, let me touch on the pending Federal bill, 9H.R. 1406, titled Fairness to Pet Owners Act. This is 10legislation that was introduced in the U.S. House of 11Representatives in April 2011 by Representative Jim 12Matheson from Utah and Representative Lee Terry from 13Nebraska. Congressional co-sponsors include 14Representatives Phil Gingrey, Walter Jones, Jim Moran 15and Jim Sensenbrenner. 16 H.R. 1406 would require veterinarians to provide 17pet owners with a copy of the prescription, regardless 18of whether the client requests a prescription; and 19provide a written disclosure that the pet owner may fill 20the prescription through the prescriber or through a 21pharmacy determined by the pet owner; and finally, it 22would require that the veterinarian must provide or 23verify the prescription by electronic or other means to 24any person designated to act on behalf of the owner. 25 The legislation also would prohibit144 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinarians from requiring owners to purchase a 2prescribed drug as a condition for providing that 3prescription; would prohibit requiring payment for 4providing or verifying a prescription; and would 5prohibit requiring an owner to sign a waiver or disclaim 6liability as a condition of providing or verifying a 7prescription. 8 H.R. 1406 would also require the FTC to 9promulgate rules implementing and enforcing the act 10within 180 days of its enactment and violations of the 11rule would be treated as unfair or deceptive practice 12under the Federal Trade Commission Act. 13 While the AVMA is supportive of a client's 14ability to have a copy of the written prescription 15should they request it, AVMA, as you've heard earlier 16today, strongly opposes this federal mandate every time 17a written prescription is prescribed, and we look 18forward to explaining our rationale the rest of today. 19 I want to mention, there are other organizations 20opposed to this legislation, including some in the 21pharmacy community, such as the American Veterinary 22Distributors Association and the Society of Veterinary 23Hospital Pharmacists, and they are also opposed to 24federal mandates when the states are governing this 25issue adequately.145 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 That's my presentation, and thank you for your 2attention. 3 (Applause.) 4 MS. KOSLOV: While we have all of our panelists 5coming up and taking their seats, I will remind, 6especially those who are watching via webcast, that you are 7welcome to submit questions at the hash tag #FTCpets. We 8will also be taking questions here on comment cards if 9anyone in the audience wants to pass them along. 10 I would also like to take this opportunity to 11introduce my co-moderator, my colleague Christopher 12Grengs, also from the Office of Policy Planning. 13 So, we will follow a similar format here. We're 14going to have each of the panelists make brief 15introductory presentations and then we will move to a 16panel discussion. 17 We are going to start with Dr. Race Foster. He 18is a licensed veterinarian and co-owner of Drs. Foster & 19Smith Pet Supplies. 20 DR. FOSTER: I would like to thank the FTC for 21inviting me to come participate. My name is Dr. Race 22Foster. I have had the privilege of serving the pet 23supply and pharmacy needs of American pet owners for 29 24years through our company, Drs. Foster & Smith. 25 In addition to being a licensed and practicing146 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinarian, we have three other veterinarians on staff 2and have a full team of pharmacists to sell 3prescriptions in all 50 states. Our pharmacy is both 4Vet-VIPPS and PCAB certified. For 29 years, we have 5dispensed thousands of prescriptions each year and have 6never had a single state or federal dispensing violation 7or even a reprimand. That is a record I am very proud 8of. 9 It is our sterling pharmacy record that is one 10of the frustrating touch points regarding the subjects 11being discussed at this workshop, namely restricted 12distribution and prescription portability. In my 13definition, portability ends with filling the 14prescription, not just obtaining it. What I mean is 15that you cannot have true prescription portability 16without medication availability. So, while this panel 17is discussing prescription portability, written 18prescriptions are worthless without a product supply. 19 Today, in our pharmacy, we have more 20prescriptions on file than we are allowed drugs to fill. 21And I hope you don't forget that point, because I heard 22in this morning's session that drugs were freely 23available. Not. 24 The reason I suggest that our sterling record is 25a frustrating touch point regarding prescription147 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551portability, is the false impression some drug 2manufacturers create as they suggest to the public or 3clients that all online pharmacies are not trustworthy. 4We have a proven track record and the appropriate 5accreditations showing that we are trustworthy. 6 The AVMA suggests that Vet-VIPPS certification 7is something a veterinarian and their client should look 8for when evaluating an Internet pharmacy. We have that 9certification. And just so you know, to be Vet-VIPPS 10certified, pharmacists have to do the dispensing. So, 11I'm not sure why sometimes we question that. It's if you 12want to be Vet-VIPPS certified, which is what the AVMA 13suggested, you have to have pharmacists do the dispensing. 14 When it comes to compounding of medications, it 15is PCAB accreditation that matters. We have that 16accreditation. When it comes to pharmaceutical 17qualifications, we have a pharmacy license to fill 18prescriptions, even human prescriptions, in all 50 19states. When it comes to the question of understanding 20how medications affect animals, we are a company owned 21by veterinarians, which has veterinarians on staff. I 22am a veterinarian. We have both veterinary and pharmacy 23qualifications. You can imagine our frustration when 24the very drug companies that will sell us human 25medications refuse to sell us pet medications, implying148 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551that such medications should only be dispensed through 2veterinarians. I am a veterinarian. Moreover, do they 3really mean to say that we are qualified to dispense 4medication for a child but we are not qualified to 5dispense medications for a dog or cat? 6 Now, in closing, let me get that straight. Our 7pharmacy has veterinarians and pharmacists on staff 8every day. We have over 80 years combined experience 9amongst the veterinarians, thirty right here. We have 10over 150 years combined experience in our pharmacists. 11We are FDA-inspected, DEA-inspected, Vet-VIPPS 12certified, PCAB certified, and have never had a single 13violation in 29 years. 14 We can buy all human drugs from companies such 15as Pfizer, Merial and Lilly to fill your prescriptions 16for you and your kids. But somehow I'm not qualified to 17buy their medications to fill prescriptions for your cat 18or even your pet rat? I mean, does it make sense to any pet 19owner in the audience? Really? 20 And while this may sound like a subject for the 21previous panel on restricted distribution, it is not. 22Prescription portability cannot exist without medication 23availability. I think pet owners deserve better. 24 Thank you. 25 MS. KOSLOV: Thank you, Dr. Foster.149 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 Next, we welcome back Nate Smith, previously a 2retail product strategist at Walmart. 3 MR. SMITH: Thanks for having me back, and 4thanks for the workshop. 5 I commend the Federal Trade Commission for 6starting into this, and as I mentioned before, I think 7this needs to be the start of a process of creating a 8solution. 9 As Dr. Foster has pointed out, right now, if 10your child needs medication, you as a consumer have 11protection. The doctor gives you a copy of the 12prescription, without you having to ask, sign a waiver 13or pay a fee. You can take that prescription to the 14pharmacy of your choosing. Once you get there, you 15frequently have the option of a generic alternative. 16Alternatively, if your dog needs medication, you have no 17right to automatically receive a copy of the 18prescription. Once you get the prescription, you are 19limited as to where you can go to get it filled. When 20you do get it filled, odds are it will be with a name 21brand pharmaceutical as opposed to a generic. 22 So, when your child needs an antibiotic, you can 23go to a pharmacy and pay $4 or $5 for a full series of 24antibiotics. When your dog needs the same antibiotic, 25your vet will charge you $30 or $40 for the same150 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551treatment. Something is obviously amiss and we need to 2change how this practice is working. 3 I have five points that I would like to make: 4First, this is an issue which affects most Americans. 5As was pointed out this morning, two-thirds of Americans 6own a companion animal. We spend about $7 billion a 7year on medicines and health-related products for our 8pets. Many Americans, if not most, view their pets as 9members of the family. They want the right to 10comparison shop for their pet's medication, just like 11they do for their own meds and for the meds of their 12children. They do not understand why they cannot. 13 Number two, there is a central conflict of 14interest where the veterinarian is also the retailer and 15can prescribe or recommend brands sold exclusively 16through prescribers. In a marketplace like this, the 17government must set rules to assure consumer choice and 18competition, just as the government has done with 19eyeglasses and contact lenses. The government needs to 20act, because the prescription requirement, plus the 21inherent authority which comes from wearing a white 22coat, puts the veterinarian in a unique position of 23power. This power can be used by the veterinarians to 24dictate the consumers' purchasing decisions, or in the 25case of non-prescription products, to heavily influence151 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551what a consumer buys under the belief it is best for 2their pet's health. 3 Number three, and I think potentially the most 4important, having the prescription put directly and 5automatically into the hands of the consumer, without 6requiring the consumer to ask for it, sign a waiver or 7pay a fee is absolutely key. That piece of paper lets 8the consumer know he or she has a choice. It is the 9most effective, most efficient means of creating a 10consciousness of choice. 11 Number four, pet care is a discretionary 12expense. If a choice is spurred and competition 13encouraged, prices will drop, convenience will be 14created, and Americans will buy more pet care to the 15benefit of all, to the pet owner, to the manufacturers, 16to the veterinarian communities, everyone. 17 Number five, we must not lose sight of the big 18picture. This is a very tough economy. Every 19indication is that it will stay tough for the 20foreseeable future, and Americans at most income levels 21are looking to save money. It is also a different 22economy. Many families are burdened by severe time 23constraints, so convenience matters. The Internet and 24purchasing using the Internet has become the norm rather 25than the exception. So, while a couple of decades ago,152 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551buying pet medication only from your vet may have been 2the only practical choice, the world is much different 3today. 4 The Federal Government is already in this 5marketplace It bars pet owners from buying most 6medications without a prescription. I hope the 7government will step in again to allow this marketplace 8to operate like those for other prescription items, 9whether that is a prescription drug, eyeglasses, or 10contact lenses. Doing so will allow consumers to reap 11the full benefit of technological advancement and have 12the freedom to purchase their pet meds where they want, 13based on the best price, service and convenience. 14 It was a decade ago that the FTC, in issuing the 15Eyeglass Rule, recognized that automatic prescription 16release is essential to letting consumers know they have 17a choice. As the FTC stated in its 1997 review of the 18rule it issued, this automatic release requirement, 19based on finding of consumers' lack of awareness that 20eyeglasses could be purchased separate from the exam. 21Automatic release is still the most effective and 22efficient means of letting consumers know they have a 23choice. 24 As the FTC stated in its 2004 review of the 25Eyeglass Rule, \"Release might not occur in the absence153 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551of a federal release requirement\" and \"release of 2prescriptions enhances consumer choice at minimal 3compliance cost to eye care practitioners. . .\" 4 I urge the Commission to apply these same 5principles and rules to pet meds. 6 MS. KOSLOV: Thank you, Mr. Smith. 7 Next we have Dr. Wendy Hauser. She's managing 8DVM of Coal Creek Veterinary Hospital in Centennial, 9Colorado. 10 DR. HAUSER: I am honored to participate in this 11workshop examining the very complex issues surrounding 12pet medications. 13 I am Dr. Wendy Hauser, I'm a small animal 14practitioner, from Centennial, Colorado, which is in the 15Denver metro area. I graduated in 1988 from Oklahoma 16State University's College of Veterinary Medicine. I 17practiced as a small animal veterinarian in New Jersey, 18Pennsylvania, and Parker, Colorado, prior to starting a 19start-up veterinary hospital, Coal Creek Veterinary 20Hospital, in 1998. 21 In 2008, I successfully transitioned from 22practice ownership when I sold my hospital to a national 23corporation. I continue to practice at Coal Creek where 24I do serve as the managing DVM. 25 I am a veterinarian because I love helping154 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551people by helping their beloved pets. By forming strong 2partnerships with my clients, my patients benefit. 3During the course of a patient visit, client concerns 4are identified, an examination occurs, and clinical 5recommendations are presented. Those recommendations 6may include diagnostics, lifestyle modifications, and 7medications. 8 In prescribing medications to a pet, the best 9medication for the disease process is the reason that I 10select a drug. Additional considerations include: 11species, age, size, breed, existing medical conditions, 12potential for adverse drug reactions, and client input. 13Client education and communication is critical for 14satisfactory outcomes. 15 If there are several good options that exist, 16dialogue with a client occurs, and that includes the 17drug differences, also discussing cost. I routinely 18offer to write prescriptions if I'm aware that there are 19significant cost savings at human pharmacies. I acknowledge 20that health care for pets is expensive, or can be 21expensive, and I feel it's my obligation to lessen those 22costs when possible. 23 Today we're examining pet medications, 24specifically, and you haven't heard a lot about this, 25but specifically in regard to H.R. 1406. There are155 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551significant concerns regarding this proposed 2legislation. Those concerns include compliance and 3safety. 4 I feel confident that when I dispense a 5medication to a client directly, that there's a high 6likelihood that my patient is going to receive the 7medication, cautionary adverse drug reaction statements are 8printed on the label, and the client is directly 9counseled regarding potential complications. When I 10provide a written prescription to a client, I don't 11know if that prescription gets filled, I don't know 12how it's filled, and I don't know what my client's told. 13Furthermore, default human adverse cautionary 14statements are usually attached to those prescriptions, 15which often times are not applicable to our veterinary 16patients and create confusion. 17 I fail to see how my client and their pet 18benefit from the latter scenario. I feel a tremendous 19sense of responsibility for my patients' well-being. 20Our veterinary oath dictates, and you've seen it once 21already today, above all, do no harm. I believe if H.R. 221406 is enacted, that drug-induced adverse events will 23occur and will cause harm. 24 MS. KOSLOV: Thank you, Dr. Hauser. 25 Next we welcome back Dr. Aspros, a practicing156 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinarian and also president of the American 2Veterinary Medical Association. 3 DR. ASPROS: Thank you. I am still Dr. Doug 4Aspros, president of the American Veterinary Medical 5Association, and represent the interests of more than 682,000 veterinarians, approximately 83 percent of the 7profession. We're dedicated to the science and the art 8of veterinary medicine. 9 I've practiced companion animal medicine in New 10York since my graduation in 1975 from Cornell 11University's College of Veterinary Medicine. I'm a 12partner at Bond Animal Hospital in White Plains, New 13York, and in Pound Ridge Veterinary Center in Pound 14Ridge, New York. I'm also the managing partner of the 15Veterinary Emergency Group in White Plains. 16 Every day, my staff and I strive to serve the 17best interests of both our animal patients and, as Wendy 18said, their human owners. Whether we're seeing a dog or 19a cat, a bird or a lizard, a ferret or a rabbit, our 20focus is on optimal care for that patient, and that care 21often includes the prescribing or dispensing of an 22animal product. 23 As we gather together to examine competition and 24consumer protection issues in the pet medication 25industry, I want to assure you that our utmost concern157 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551is with the well-being of our patients. The AVMA does, 2therefore, have concerns with proposed federal 3legislation and the underlying premise that there's a 4need for such legislation. We stand behind AVMA's 5Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics, which 6encourage veterinarians to honor a client's request for 7written prescriptions, and we continue to educate 8veterinarians about prescription drug rules and the 9importance of following these Principles. 10 The proposed federal legislation, as written, 11leaves veterinarians open to potential ethical and legal 12liabilities and would negatively affect the strong bond 13of trust that veterinarians have earned with their 14clients. Pet owners may encounter misinformation or 15inappropriate substitution from pharmacists who are not 16trained in veterinary pharmacology, who are prepared to 17discharge all of the responsibilities of a pharmacist 18when dispensing to a pet. Even worse, it increases the 19likelihood that pet owners will obtain counterfeit product 20online. The AVMA believes that veterinarians are uniquely 21qualified to provide professional guidance, support and 22education to pet owners when it comes to dispensing and 23administering prescription products to pets. 24 While we are not supportive of a federal mandate 25on veterinary prescription writing, the AVMA is158 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551supportive of clients' right to choose where they have 2their prescriptions filled. We are, therefore, taking 3several steps to promote optimal outcomes for consumers 4who obtain prescription products for their pets from 5independent pharmacies. We are interacting with pharmacy 6stakeholders to help ensure that licensed pharmacists 7better understand their roles and responsibilities when it 8comes to counseling and educating pet owners when filling 9veterinary prescriptions. We are also collaborating with 10pharmacy industry to help determine how best to train 11licensed pharmacists on basic veterinary pharmacy issues. 12 We're honored by the ongoing confidence and 13trust of pet owners and to be a part of this important 14workshop, and we look forward to maintaining that trust. 15 Thanks. 16 MS. KOSLOV: Thank you, Dr. Aspros. 17 Next we'll hear from Dr. Elaine Blythe. She is 18a pharmacist, PharmD and an associate professor at St. 19Matthew's School of Veterinary Medicine on Grand Cayman 20Island. 21 DR. BLYTHE: Thank you. 22 I appreciate the invitation today from Chris and 23his team. I have come here today to participate and 24share some view points as a pharmacist educator. My 25contributions to the panel discussion are focused on the159 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551educational offerings in veterinary pharmacy for 2practicing pharmacists, as well as pharmacy students. 3 As a licensed pharmacist, I may also be able to 4offer some insight into the changes that have occurred 5to the practice of pharmacy via the advent of third 6party payers, that is very common in the managed health 7care market that we all experience today. 8 I'm a firm believer in the development of close 9working relationships between pharmacists and 10veterinarians. I think there is a tremendous amount of 11opportunity for the two professions to work together 12here for the betterment of animal health. I am an 13absolute and firm believer in that. 14 But about some of the educational offerings that 15are available out there today, with the support of the 16University of Florida College of Pharmacy, I have 17offered a two-credit hour online course in veterinary 18pharmacy to any interested pharmacy student in the 19nation -- and I also get students from outside the United 20States -- that is open and available to, like I said, any 21interested pharmacy student in the nation. The same 22course materials are also available and open to any 23interested practicing pharmacist in the United States in 24a continuing education format. 25 So, to add some numbers to these, since the160 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551inception of the course in about 2003, I've educated 2over 1,800 pharmacy students through this online course 3offering, and I've educated over 200 practicing 4pharmacists through the continuing education offering of 5the same course materials. 6 In addition to this, I can also speak to, 7perhaps later in the discussion, individual offerings 8that are made at individual schools of pharmacy in 9veterinary pharmacology, veterinary pharmacy in 10face-to-face teaching formats, as well as advanced 11pharmacy practice experiences typically called clinical 12rotations. 13 To kind of give you an idea of the content of 14these classes, for the most part, they certainly focus 15on the most common, chronic and preventative medications 16used in dogs and cats. They may be FDA-approved 17medications, they may be compounded therapies that are 18used to treat some of the most common conditions and 19disease states that we see in dogs and cats, such as 20heartworm preventatives, nonsteroidals for progressive 21musculoskeletal disorders, drugs for diabetes, for other 22endocrine type disorders, urinary incontinence, as well 23as seizure control. Also a fair amount of space is 24given to legal regulatory issues, as well as veterinary 25informatics.161 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 Now, someone coming from academia, I can tell 2you it is absolutely impossible to teach a student 3absolutely everything they need to know about every 4topic. One of the most important things that you can 5equip students with is the knowledge of where to look 6their questions up and how to research them, and where 7to go for guidance and verification and additional 8information. 9 In a full-time position, I teach seven credit 10hours of pharmacology to vet students at one of the 11off-shore vet schools in the Caribbean, St. 12Matthew's University School of Veterinary Medicine 13located on Grand Cayman Island. So, I am a pharmacist 14who is actively educating veterinary students on a daily 15basis in vet pharmacology. 16 I can also bring the perspective of someone who 17has 15 years of experience in regulatory affairs and 18regulatory compliance for several large veterinary drug 19distributors. So, I have actively participated in 20acquiring Vet-VIPPS accreditation for some pharmacies, 21as well as VAWD accreditation, Verified Accredited 22Wholesale Distributors, which is also a program offered 23through NABP. 24 I can also offer the perspective of the 25pharmacist. I have for going on eight, nine years162 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551now on a weekly basis, I provide consulting services to 2Midwest Vet Specialty Referral Hospital in Omaha, 3Nebraska, as well as the Nebraska Humane Society. I 4help them with their compounding therapy needs, 5obtaining drug vendor sources, client education and 6compounding on a weekly basis, as well as all of their 7controlled substance recordkeeping. 8 If you will allow me, I am running short on 9time, so I will simply close by saying, I have devoted 10my career to academia, pharmacy academia, veterinary 11academia, it is close to my heart. I believe there 12are opportunities out there to educate pharmacists 13to fill some of the prescriptions that we have been 14discussing today. 15 I hope I have the opportunity to further 16differentiate some of the pharmacists who have training 17versus those who don't, because I think that's an 18important concept to discuss, and where the current 19educational efforts are focused. I am absolutely a 20firm supporter of collaborative working relationships 21between pharmacists and veterinarians for the betterment 22of animal health. 23 MS. KOSLOV: Thank you, Dr. Blythe. 24 Next we'll hear from Deborah Press. She is the 25regulatory affairs manager in the Government Relations163 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551Office of the American Society for the Prevention of 2Cruelty to Animals. 3 MS. PRESS: Thank you for the opportunity to 4participate and for organizing this panel. 5 I'm here to speak on behalf of pet owners, and 6really on behalf of our nation's pets and our shelter 7animals. The ASPCA supports the concept of prescription 8portability, because it will make pet care more 9affordable. More choice encourages competitive pricing, 10and competitive pricing makes it more affordable to be a 11pet owner. 12 Our support for prescription portability and for 13the Fairness to Pet Owners Act comes down to two basic 14points, both related to the affordability of pet care. 15The first point is that making vet care more affordable 16is good for animal health. It means that more animals 17who need medical care will get it, and more animals can 18avoid medical intervention by access to affordable 19preventative treatments. 20 The second point is that making pet care more 21affordable encourages pet ownership, and that means 22getting more animals out of shelters. Making quality 23pet care more affordable is really the broad goal here, 24and giving the pet owners the choice to take advantage of 25less expensive sources of medicine is a small but164 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551logical step toward that goal. 2 A little bit of background about the ASPCA. 3Animal health is a cornerstone of our mission. The 4Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital was founded in New York 5City in 1912. We serve 20,000 patients a year. We have 622 vets on staff, and we provide general and specialized 7veterinary services to pets. Our hospital also treats 8our shelter animals. We run a large adoption center in 9New York City. We have 300 animals at any given time, 10and last year we adopted between 3,500 and 4,000 animals 11out to the public. Our hospital also treats victims of 12animal cruelty. The ASPCA has a humane law enforcement 13division that investigates thousands of animal 14cruelty cases every year. We treat those victims at 15our hospital as well. At our hospital, we do release 16prescriptions when it would benefit the client and 17patient. Vets at Bergh provide either written 18prescriptions or they will call prescriptions in to 19retail pharmacies. Our vets will affirmatively suggest 20the clients fill prescriptions elsewhere if they know 21that doing so will be significantly less expensive. 22I'm going to go back to those two main points that I 23mentioned to elaborate a little. 24 The first point was that affordable vet care is 25good for animal health because it means wider access to 165 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) is the number 2one preventable cause of death of dogs and cats in the 3United States, and the highest euthanasia rates are 4associated with the neighborhoods of highest poverty. 5Studies have shown that cat mortality rates in shelters 6were three-and-a half-times higher in poor neighborhoods 7than in wealthy ones. So, one's ability to afford pet 8care really does impact health outcomes. We also know 9that affordable access to preventative meds impacts animal 10health in the poorest communities. In some poor areas of 11the South, the majority of dogs entering shelters test 12positive for heartworm, and it's a disease that is 13difficult and expensive to treat, but easy to prevent. 14What all this together tells us is that the most at-risk 15animals belong to the most at-risk people, and for the 16sake of the health and welfare of these pets, it's 17important to take steps that make their care more 18affordable. We think that prescription portability is 19one way to do that. 20 The second point is that making pet care more 21affordable encourages pet ownership. We want pet care 22to be more affordable, to encourage adoption and get pets 23out of shelters. Costs are a real issue. Vet care 24costs and general care costs are cited as prohibitive 25factors to pet ownership. Survey data shows that vet166 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551care costs are the number one reason people who 2previously owned dogs currently don't have them. 330 percent of previous dog owners, and 25 percent of 4previous cat owners, cited vet care cost as the reason 5they don't currently have pets. Budgets are tight today 6and pet ownership is down for the first time in 20 years. 7So, if we can take steps to keep pet care costs down, 8we'll encourage pet ownership and hopefully that will 9occur through adoption so we can get more animals out of 10shelters. Prescription release will be a helpful step 11towards keeping costs down. 12 To sum up, the ASPCA does support the Fairness 13to Pet Owners Act and we support prescription 14portability. For pets requiring ongoing medication for 15chronic conditions, the cost savings could be 16significant. Costs are also significant for pet owners 17with limited financial resources. These are the pets 18and pet owners for whom prescription portability is 19especially important. 20 MS. KOSLOV: Thank you, Ms. Press. 21 Finally, we will hear once again from Michael 22Hinckle, he is a partner at K&L Gates where his practice 23focuses on FDA regulatory matters. 24 MR. HINCKLE: Thank you, Tara, and thanks to the 25FTC again, and it's me again. I'm back up on my stump167 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551on the generic drug issue again. 2 Let me just say, starting out, that we talked 3earlier in the last panel about how distribution issues 4affect the ability of real substitutable generics to get 5in the market and provide that competition and low priced, 6affordable products that we see on the human side. But 7I will say that the lack of prescription portability is 8probably the primary reason why consumers are currently 9denied access to affordable generic drugs. 10 When I say generic drugs in this context, I'm 11talking about substitutable generics. We see branded 12generics that are sold as a generic that's approved 13through the abbreviated new animal drug process, so it 14is a generic drug in the FDA sense, but they're sold 15with a brand name. 16 So, when we think about what makes a generic 17drug affordable to consumers, it's really two things. 18It's one, you don't have to repeat all the R&D work. 19There's still an expense to doing the bio studies that's 20necessary to get a generic approved, generic animal 21drug, but you don't have to repeat all that R&D work, 22because you get to piggy-back off the pioneer drug. 23 But there's also the cost of branding and 24marketing a product -- selling the product out to 25veterinarians, paying through the distributors to have168 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551their reps sell the product, all those marketing costs. 2You don't pay those on human generic drugs, because of 3generic drug substitutability. That is, on the human 4side, when the physician writes for the drug, he or she 5writes for the brand drug, it goes to the pharmacy, and 6the pharmacist then dispenses the generic if he has 7the generic available. In many states, that's required by 8law to make that substitution if Medicaid is paying for it. 9If state Medicaid is paying for it, it's required to make 10the change. You say, well, why is that the case? Well, 11if the government or insurance companies are paying for 12drugs, they're going to demand that they pay for the 13low-cost generic. We don't have that market pressure on 14the animal drug side, so we don't see these animal drug 15generic substitutable products available at the 16pharmacy. 17 But for all this to work, for all this to work 18at the animal drug side and provide these kind of 19savings, there has to be a prescription. If that client 20walks out of the vet's office and has been dispensed a 21drug instead of the prescription, this whole generic 22drug substitutability process and the savings that can 23flow from that just aren't going to happen. 24 Now, there are some challenges besides the 25prescription issue, that's for sure. The state laws169 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551present some issues with regards to substitution. FDA 2presents some issues. They published the approval of 3generic drugs in a different book. The states haven't 4caught up sometimes. The state pharmacy laws aren't 5clear as to when you can substitute -- there's probably 15 6states that aren't sure when a pharmacist can substitute 7a generic animal drug. 8 But those are things that can be overcome, as I 9think the distribution side can be, too, if there's a 10demand. Right now, there is no demand for these 11products at the retail pharmacy level because those 12prescriptions aren't there. 13 Now, we talked about ethical veterinarians, and 14I expect everybody that's sitting here is an ethical 15veterinarian, you're taking the time to be here. Most, 16if not all, ethical veterinarians do provide prescriptions 17when they're requested. I expect that's true even in 18states where it's not required by law, regulation, or board 19policy. The problem really comes to this, that just as a 20matter of historical business practice, they're just not 21offered. The drug was just dispensed and given, and the 22bill was given. There are incentives for veterinarians to 23dispense more drugs, the pioneer drug companies provide 24those incentives. But even that, I think it's more just 25a sort of historical practice that people don't170 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551question. 2 I think Nate talked on that, they sort of white 3coat the idea that people just don't question and they 4pay for it and they don't realize that maybe the savings 5that they receive on their generic drug, or actually the 6government or their third party payer receives on their 7human generic drugs, could be available to them if they 8had a prescription and if there was a distribution 9process that would allow the substitutable generics to 10get into the retail pharmacies. 11 Let me just close by saying, on behalf of my 12clients, that generic drug companies are not 13anti-veterinarian, any more than human generic drug 14companies are anti-physician. They're supplying a 15product that is able to be sold at a very affordable 16price, because they don't have to expend the resources 17on extensive R&D and marketing. At some point, pet 18owners should not be paying brand drug monopoly prices 19for a drug that's been off patent for ten years. At 20some point, there should be a generic that's available, 21and the only way that's going to happen is if we get 22prescriptions from veterinarians that can then be 23dispensed at the retail pharmacy. 24 Thank you. 25 MS. KOSLOV: Thank you, Mr. Hinckle.171 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 Well, obviously we have a tremendous amount of 2expertise on this panel and they have raised a wide 3variety of issues. Chris and I are going to do our best 4to unpack some of those a little bit and explicate them 5some more. 6 So, the way we thought we would begin is framing 7this by looking first at what we would call, as 8antitrust lawyers, the demand side, and then looking at 9the supply side. So, on the demand side, looking at 10situations where pet owners are likely to seek portable 11prescriptions, and then look from the supply side at how 12veterinarians tend to respond when they get those 13requests. 14 So, let's start with the idea of when pet owners 15seek portable prescriptions. Are there instances where 16clients are more or less likely to seek a written 17prescription and also looking at how often that's 18happening? 19 So, Dr. Hauser, do you want to start us off on 20that? 21 DR. HAUSER: Sure, that would be great. Thank 22you. 23 There are several times that prescriptions are 24either requested or provided by the veterinarian, and 25some of the times that that would be would be if the172 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551drug is not stocked in the hospital. And that may be due 2to a low demand or perhaps due to human abuse potential. 3It's sometimes a little bit better for our veterinary 4hospitals not to keep those things readily in stock. 5 When there's a need for compounding, we've heard 6a lot about compounding this morning. I think you need 7to look at there are cost variations, especially with 8chronic medications, and I would say that of the 9prescriptions that are requested in my practice, it 10tends to be mainly for the chronic anti-inflammatory 11drugs and the heartworm medications. 12 I also think you have to take a look at the type 13of the practice that you're in, the setting. I'm 14limiting my comments today to small animal medicine, 15because I'm a small animal practitioner. But in talking 16to some friends that are mixed animal practitioners and 17large animal practitioners, they'll tell you, this ship 18has already sailed for them. Large animal lost that 19prescribing, dispensing, or I should say the dispensing 20aspect years and years ago when the drugs went into the 21feed stores. 22 So, what you're looking at is this, is an issue 23that's going to impact primarily small animal 24veterinarians. I believe, I don't have proof, but I 25believe it's going to impact veterinarians that are in173 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551more suburban and urban areas. I used to live very 2rurally. My husband still thinks we live rurally, but I 3don't quite think ten miles out from town is rural. And 4quite frankly, if you live in a very rural area, it's 5more convenient for you to get the drug from the vet 6than to drive 25 or 30 miles, like my parents would have 7to go, to a Walmart. 8 So, I think that the location also plays a role, 9and I do think that the types of clinical settings play 10a role. I spoke with a lot of stakeholders to make sure 11that I was fairly representing as broad of a spectrum of 12veterinarians as I could, and I wanted to keep my own 13biases out of this. Certainly my experience will come 14in, but I think it's their voices you need to hear. 15 I have a friend that owns an emergency and 16specialty practice, he sees this as a very minimal 17consequence for him for the number of prescriptions 18will actually not be filled at his facility. When we 19get into some of the other issues, it's going to have 20impacts of huge magnitude on his operational efficiency. 21But right now, he says, no, people need it, it's an 22urgent situation. It's not a low-grade chronic pain 23medication where the owner isn't even sure that they 24fully believe you that their dog is in pain, it's that their 25dog is seizing and they need to take the medications home.174 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 So, those are some of my thoughts. 2 MS. KOSLOV: Did anyone else have anything to 3add on those points? I don't know if Dr. Foster, did 4you have anything else you wanted to add to that? 5 DR. FOSTER: No, but I agree pretty much with 6what she said. I mean, it's the long-term therapeutics and 7the preventatives where the pet owner is getting gouged. 8That's where the prescriptions are going to come in. 9Compare the prices, you'll see. 10 MS. PRESS: I'll briefly highlight the 11convenience issue, but I want to highlight a 12slightly different aspect, and that is just access. Most 13neighborhoods have access to a pharmacy, not all 14neighborhoods are served by veterinarians. I live in a 15city and I don't have a car, so getting to the 16veterinarian is always a little bit of a problem. If I 17need to refill my prescription every month, it's just a 18lot easier to do at a local pharmacy. So, access to 19veterinarians is another issue that affects neighborhoods 20differently. 21 MS. KOSLOV: Dr. Aspros? 22 DR. ASPROS: I was going to say that we really 23have very little data, maybe no data to really answer 24this question. It's really anecdotal, and some of these 25things sort of make sense, but whether or not there's175 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551any truth in any of them is hard to say. 2 MS. KOSLOV: Do any of the panelists have any 3sense of whether there are differences based on client 4socioeconomic status in terms of whether they are more 5or less likely to seek a portable prescription? 6 DR. HAUSER: Not in my practice. In my 7practice, I certainly have clients that are very cost 8sensitive, and you can bet those are always the ones 9that I offer the prescriptions to. And I am surprised 10that probably about 50 percent of them will look at me 11and say, you know what, I would just rather get it from 12you. I would just rather get it while I'm here, I want 13to get him started on the medication. 14 So, I cannot see a lot of socioeconomic 15variations, but I should also reference that by the fact 16that I am in a very stable neighborhood from a 17socioeconomic point of view. 18 MS. KOSLOV: Did anyone else have any 19perspectives on that question? 20 MS. PRESS: I'll just say that I don't know if 21we can link it to socioeconomic status, but some people 22are savvier shoppers than others. Some people are more 23assertive than others when it comes to speaking out and 24being advocates for themselves. So, some people just 25may be more comfortable asking questions of their176 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinarian than others. We like making prescription 2release automatic, because it just does away with that 3information disparity, that disparity and comfort. 4 So, again, I can't say it's necessarily linked 5to socioeconomic status, but there are certainly 6differences across the board in people's comfort. 7 DR. FOSTER: Can I add something to that? Are 8we supposed to put our cards up? 9 MS. KOSLOV: Ideally, yes. We're a smaller group 10and Chris and I placed ourselves in the middle, so we 11could try and keep track of all of you. 12 DR. FOSTER: I think we're talking about the 13comfort level of pet owners when they go ask a 14veterinarian for a prescription. Sometimes that's 15intimidating, and it's especially intimidating when they 16say something like, well, you can do it, but we'll have 17you sign this waiver. Has anybody here ever signed a 18waiver when they went to their physician? 19 Dr. HAUSER: I have. 20 DR. FOSTER: Is it part of routine? 21 Dr. HAUSER: Um-hmm. 22 DR. FOSTER: How about when you transfer a 23prescription from a pharmacy to another pharmacy? Does 24that pharmacist say, well, you've got to sign that 25waiver or I'm not going to transfer your prescription?177 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551My son is a physician, and has never had a client sign a 2waiver, by the way. 3 I realize that the AVMA's position is it 4should be up to the practicing veterinarian to 5determine that, at least I shouldn't say it's the AVMA's 6position, I saw that in the Texas association in their 7letter they wrote to the FTC. What I'm trying to tell 8you is it can be very intimidating for a consumer to 9have to do that. 10 We have a file this deep of waivers and 11complaints, and for routine medications I'm talking 12about, not chemotherapeutics that are unapproved. 13Waivers are common then. But there is this 14intimidating factor, and it ties to the socioeconomic 15factor because typically the more educated the consumer 16the more likely they are to question it. If you're a 17lawyer, or you're a nurse, you're educated, a doctor. 18Like why do I have to sign this to get Amoxicillin for 19my dog? Geez, I just filled my prescription for my 20child and I didn't have to sign anything. 21 I think we've got to clean that up. I'm on the 22side of the veterinary profession, but I'm also on the 23side of the pet owner. We just have to clean it up and 24act like physicians do and other professionals that are 25involved in animal health care. When we charge an178 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551extra fee for a prescription, or we have you sign a 2waiver and make statements like, well, maybe it's going 3to be counterfeit. Well, yeah, that can be counterfeit. 4There's lots of counterfeit products in human medicine, 5too, but there's still Medco, CVS, and others that we 6don't throw the pharmacies out because there might be a 7counterfeit. 8 And, you know, the most likely thing to 9cause counterfeit is restricted distribution, because 10if the real product's there, they're not going to make 11much money on counterfeit. We've just got to think 12logically as a profession. 13 Thank you. 14 MS. KOSLOV: So, are any of the panelists aware 15of whether or would you characterize that there have been 16any trends in the relative number of requests for 17portable prescriptions over time? 18 DR. FOSTER: I can answer that. I've been 19taking prescriptions since 1983. There's no question 20that the veterinary profession today is more likely to 21give out a prescription. I think the American 22Veterinary Medical Association has done an excellent job 23of talking to their constituents and educating them. 24And again, it only makes sense, if you would get one for 25yourself. Remember, you've already had the179 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551client-patient relationship, that's at the point where 2the drug is prescribed. Now we just have to count the 3pills and fill it. 4 Yes, pharmacists have some other roles, and in 5our pharmacy, veterinarians serve some of those roles, 6too, to speak with a client. But it's not like we're 7this far apart. Guys, I served some time on the board 8at Michigan State University. To the best of my 9knowledge, of the 25 colleges that have pharmacies in 10their veterinary school, 24 of them have pharmacists in 11charge, not veterinarians. It's a common thing. Just 12think about that. Michigan State is one of them. 13 MS. KOSLOV: So, I think with that answer, we 14have transitioned to what I had called the supply side, 15I'm talking about how veterinarians respond when clients 16seek a portable prescription. So, to paraphrase what I 17think we heard from Adrian Hochstadt's introductory 18presentation and what we just heard from Dr. Foster, and 19some of the presentations this morning, it seems as though 20what we're hearing is that most vets do supply prescriptions 21upon request. I just wanted to see, would anyone on this 22panel disagree with that statement or want to clarify 23that statement? 24 DR. ASPROS: No, I would absolutely agree that 25AVMA's Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics requires180 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinarians to honor clients' requests. AVMA supports 2client choice, and I think veterinarians have done a 3very good job. If they had not done that, I don't think 4Race Foster would be here, because he wouldn't have a 5business to represent. 6 DR. FOSTER: I would be selling more live fish. 7 MS. KOSLOV: Looking at it from the vet 8perspective, one of the other issues we wanted to 9explore is are there situations where vets proactively 10might offer prescriptions to their clients on their own 11initiative as opposed to waiting for a client to request 12a prescription? 13 Dr. Hauser, is that something that you do? 14 DR. HAUSER: I absolutely do. I would say that 1595 percent of the medications that I dispense on a daily 16basis are human generic drugs. So, if I'm aware of 17significant cost savings, I will absolutely let that 18client know that there is a cost saving, and do they 19want to go pick that prescription up. And again, I 20would say it's about a 50/50 split with my clients. 21 MS. KOSLOV: Dr. Aspros? 22 DR. ASPROS: Yeah, there are drugs that -- and 23again, I'm speaking for myself, not for AVMA, as a 24practitioner -- there are drugs that we can't 25easily stock, because there's just not enough demand for181 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551them, and yet there's a need for them on the part of our 2patients. Those we assertively write prescriptions 3for our patients. 4 MS. KOSLOV: Ms. Press, do you have any 5perspectives from the ASPCA's animal hospital 6perspective? 7 MS. PRESS: Yeah, I mean, our policy is very 8similar to Dr. Hauser's. When we know that it will 9result in significant cost savings, we will 10affirmatively suggest that the prescription be filled 11elsewhere, and when it will benefit the client and the 12patient, that's what we do. 13 Certain medicines, we can't do this for. They're 14not available at retail pharmacies. But yeah, when we 15know it will help, when we know that there will be a 16significant cost difference, we will suggest it. 17 MS. KOSLOV: So, go ahead. 18 DR. ASPROS: I also am the managing partner of 19an emergency clinic and I would say that that's one 20situation where we don't do that because of the time 21frame. These are emergent conditions -- it's frequently 22the middle of the night, on holidays, on weekends. It's 23important that the patient begin treatment as soon as 24possible. It's often not easy for the client, or even 25possible for the client, to fill that prescription in a182 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551convenient or timely way. 2 MR. SMITH: Could I make one comment? I think 3that one of the main issues is does the customer really 4have the right to choose? The comments of the panelists, 5who I think have an outstanding position of being fast 6and immediate to release a prescription upon request, I 7think Dr. Foster's sense of there's a pile of 8veterinarians who don't behave that way. And the FTC 9recognizing in the past that release might not occur 10unless a federal requirement is there for a release of 11the prescription, needs to be factored in. The voices 12here I don't think represent all practices or the ways 13veterinarians work. 14 I also want to just stress that point that if 15I'm dependent on my vet to continue to take care of my 16family member and I feel like I'm taking something away 17from them when I ask for the prescription to go fill it 18somewhere else, and the vet clearly has an economic 19interest of wanting to sell that product to me and make 20money, what happens the next time I come in to get my 21routine service, like the real practice of medicine? Do 22I feel like I've somehow degraded or compromised that 23relationship? No customer wants that. 24 I think that what a customer wants is the real 25right to choose. And as I mentioned in my opening183 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551remarks, every person knows that when I'm handed a piece 2of paper from my human physician, that gives me the 3chance to go where I want to fill it where I think is 4the best for me, whether it be for convenience or 5economics or whatever the case is. And I don't think 6anyone will argue that the prices online are generally 7much lower than in a veterinary clinic. 8 So, if I'm given a prescription every time, my 9mind changes in the way that I think about how I can 10access these medications, and I'm now more conscious of 11the fact that I have different options of where I can go 12to get a medication filled. I think that change in the 13consumer mentality will cause a significant shift in 14where products are being sold when consumers start to be 15more aware of the market condition they live in. 16 One final point, I do acknowledge and I have 17sympathy for the fact that if we leave it the way it is, 18the veterinarian has a stronger influence in the way 19that a treatment is administered and the way that 20people get their medications. But it comes with an 21expense, an expense that will limit the number of pet 22owners who can seek out -- this is the ASPCA's point of 23view -- who can seek out and get those medications in 24the first place. 25 So, is the additional therapeutic value of184 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551having your vet so closely administer the release of 2Heartgard worth the fact that the inefficiencies are keeping 3the prices so high that far fewer consumers can avail 4themselves to those treatments? 5 I think we'll discover in the next panel about 6how that worked with contact lenses, that when prices 7came down, more consumers started to use contact lenses 8as prescribed and wouldn't wear them longer and created 9kind of a better patient health and safety outcome. The 10same thing will happen here. More dogs will get the 11treatments they need when they become more affordable, 12and the value of that oversight I think diminishes the 13total gain or the total benefit of consumers. 14 MS. KOSLOV: So, we don't want to steal too much 15thunder from the next panel, which will be discussing 16the contact lens issue in more detail. I did want to 17pick up, Nate, on one point that you raised and just 18open this specific point up in case other panelists have 19any thoughts on it. 20 So, what economic incentives or other incentives 21might affect the perspectives that vets might have on 22providing a written prescription? So, Nate raised the 23idea of the vet's economic interest. Are there any other 24points anybody wants to raise on that topic? 25 DR. FOSTER: As I mentioned before, I think the185 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinary profession has to get smarter. Guys, we have 2a profession where drug companies dictate what we do. 3We take kickbacks, we take incentives, we take free 4trips, we get free drugs. Do you know what that really 5means? Does every veterinarian prescribe the drug 6that's right for your dog or where he makes the most 7money? 8 Think about that question. Now, I don't think 9most veterinarians do that. But you know they took that 10away in human medicine by not letting the physicians 11charge for the drugs, for the most part. The drug 12companies are driving this with their incentives. Their 1312/12/12 programs. What does that look like to the 14consumer? I don't think it looks very good. I don't 15think it passes the smell test. 16 Guys, I know 90 percent of the veterinarians 17don't do that, but why do we have restricted 18distribution and incentives, if it's not about money? 19Why do we have it? Why don't we just let vets do the 20therapeutics, do their treatments, sell the medications 21when they need to, especially in the acute cases, that's 22what they do, allow the portability, and any qualified 23place can fill them? 24 As the Iowa Veterinary Medical Association said in 25their submission to the FTC, that would let normal market186 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551forces dictate. Why don't we just do that? 2 MS. KOSLOV: Dr. Hauser, I think you're anxious 3to respond. 4 DR. HAUSER: Certainly I am. I have a lot of 5responses, I am going to hope that more pertinent points 6will come up a little bit later in the conversation. We 7have about a half hour left. 8 I have a lot of responses back to what 9Dr. Foster just said, but I'm going to limit them to the 10question that was actually asked. What are our concerns 11that would affect vet perspectives? As a veterinarian 12that's practiced for 25 years, as a veterinarian that 13has been I would say 99 percent responsible for 14deciding, with input from my associates, what goes in my 15pharmacy, those drugs are selected not based on buyback 16programs or buy-in programs, and percentage discounts. 17They're selected because they're the best medications 18that I can offer my patients, period. So, that was 19actually very offensive to me, and you can tell. 20 So, to get back to the question at hand, 21compliance is a huge issue. Safety, especially with 22diverted drugs. You bet I have my clients sign a waiver 23if they want to order online, and the reason that I do 24is because I can't guarantee the safety of those drugs. 25I love my patients. And I love my clients, and if I187 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551wouldn't give that drug to my pet, why in the world 2would I have them give it to theirs? I'm happy to write 3the prescription. They're never just handed a waiver 4and said, hey, fill this out. It's explained to them. 5I look at that waiver as informed client consent, 6period. 7 I do like the fact that I feel it releases me 8from some liability. Misfilling the scripts, yes, it's 9happened and it's happened to me, as well as illegal 10substitutions. Those tend to be more in the 11brick-and-mortar pharmacies that that's occurred, as 12opposed to the online. 13 I think the big issue here is that when that 14client comes in to pick up a refill on medications, 15every veterinarian here will tell you that their team 16loves seeing those clients. They love that touch point, 17and that's a very informal way to make sure that George 18the Bulldog is still doing okay. Hey, Mrs. Smith, how's 19he doing? 20 We have had so much fragmentation within our 21industry, that this is one more way that we're going to 22lose touch with our patients. I think inappropriate 23drug requests are another reason that we have concerns. 24If the blood work isn't accurate, if the drug isn't safe 25and appropriate for the patient.188 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 MS. KOSLOV: I'm going to transition us to the 2next topic, and I have a feeling you'll have an 3opportunity to raise some other points here. As we were 4preparing for this panel, we realized that the bottom 5line question we're really trying to get at with this 6panel is: how is this pet medications marketplace working 7right now from the perspective of pet welfare and from 8the perspective of consumer choice? 9 So, with the particular emphasis on the role 10that the portability issues play in that, because 11obviously this morning we talked a lot about the 12distribution issues come into play. But the bottom line 13question really is: is the market functioning well today? 14 I would open up that question to anyone here on 15the panel who wants to try to get at that bottom line 16question. 17 DR. ASPROS: I would submit that the market is 18functioning quite well today. It's diverse, there's new 19products coming on to the market all the time, consumers 20have choices like never before. The Internet and 21transparency and pricing has probably been a part of 22that, but we believe, I believe it's a very, very 23vigorous and well functioning marketplace. Maybe not 24for quite everybody on the end of the table here, but I 25believe for consumers and for our patients.189 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 MR. HINCKLE: Can I comment on that one? 2 MS. KOSLOV: Mr. Hinckle? 3 MR. HINCKLE: I think I probably disagree. 4It's not necessarily well functioning right now and 5it's probably going to get worse if there's not 6prescription portability and some true interchangeable 7generics. Because as we see more and more, as the 8companion animal market becomes more lucrative and new 9drugs come out that are wonderful drugs to help with the 10quality of life for our pets, but those drugs are going 11to go off patent sooner or later. When those drugs go 12off patent, the question is going to be, are consumers 13going to continue to pay those patent monopoly prices or 14are they going to get generics? 15 One of the problems we see, I have here this 16question, why don't you just sell generics through the 17veterinary channels? That goes to some of the 18distribution issues we talked about in the last panel. 19But we also face the same issues that we faced with the 20medical physicians 15, 20 years ago, where I still have 21clients telling me that they hear from veterinarians 22that are disparaging the quality of generic drugs, the 23FDA approval process, whether these products really are 24equivalent to their pioneer counterparts. 25 So, it's an educational issue that's190 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551going to take time to get through, but without the 2prescription portability, we're just not going to have 3those interchangeable generics. And as more brand 4products go off patent, people are going to continue to 5pay the high prices. 6 MS. KOSLOV: So, just to refine the question a 7little bit, we had talked a little bit about this 8chicken and egg perspective on the question. Do we 9have a situation where either the market is fine the way 10it is? Do we have a situation where we need greater 11prescription portability which might spur the 12development of a more robust marketplace? Do we need the 13market to expand first which would then drive consumers 14to demand more prescription portability? What do we 15think about that? 16 DR. FOSTER: The problem is not the 17veterinarian. The problem is supply of product. Again, 18it was brought up this morning that superficially it 19seems all happy and hunky-dory because catalogers and 20Internet sites have product. Guys, we're charging you 21five to ten percent more than we have to because the 22availability is not there. I submitted that to 23Stephanie, in writing, showed her receipts of products, 24we paid the mark-ups that are on there throughout the 25various distribution things. The pet owner is suffering 191 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551the price game. They're not suffering because veterinarians 2are not issuing prescriptions. 3 And it looks like there's a supply out there, 4but guys, they've tightened up. Pfizer has cut us off 5after 25 years. There will be no supply of chewable 6Rimadyl in the next few weeks. That's a fact, if it 7doesn't loosen up. Which means the only place you can 8buy it is at a veterinary clinic or one of the central 9fills, because they can buy direct and I cannot, even 10though I'm a veterinarian. 11 But remember, this isn't about me. We need a 12supply of product. We do need veterinarians to have 13portability, and I think they're working in that 14direction. I think it's getting better. I think we've 15thrown up some obstacles that are not logical. But I do 16think there's a big issue facing the pet owners. They 17are paying more today than they should be for things 18like Heartgard preventatives, flea and tick 19preventatives. That's a fact. 20 MS. KOSLOV: Nate, did you want to respond? 21 MR. SMITH: Real fast, if I ask the question is 22the market working well today from the consumer's 23perspective, I would look at the prices available and 24say, Amazon.com is selling Frontline for $10 a dose, and 25a vet clinic is selling it for $16. So, I walk into my192 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551vet and I hey, why are you $16 and they're $10? 2And it's a bad example. 3 I should use Heartgard, because Heartgard is an 4Rx drug. But if I see the price of Heartgard and I see 5the price of Heartgard in a vet clinic and I say to my 6vet, I would like the prescription because I would like 7to go get Heartgard for much less money. Well, okay, 8then you need to sign this waiver and this consent 9because all hell is breaking loose out there, this could 10be bad product, it could be degraded. 11 So, then there's no generics in the market. So, 12from the consumer perspective, is the market working 13efficiently when I see the price differences and I'm 14told by my trusted vet that this is dangerous territory, 15you've got to sign this consent if I'm going to release 16a prescription. That doesn't sound like a well-tuned 17market to me. 18 I think we've all talked about the diversion 19issue, and have largely vilified it as if it's evidence 20of it not working correctly. So, this idea that the 21market is robust and competitive when distribution is 22limited, that just makes no sense. 23 MS. KOSLOV: Dr. Aspros or Dr. Hauser, does 24either of you have a perspective on whether 25veterinarians are responding on price based on any193 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551additional competition in the marketplace? 2 DR. ASPROS: I think AVMA does not have data on 3that. I don't think anybody collects data on that. I 4can speak from my perspective as a companion animal 5practitioner, and I would tell you that most of the 6time, unlike what Nate Smith said, most of the time 7we're actually cheaper. We're not in business to sell 8drugs, we're in business to serve clients and our 9patients, and a lot of the pharmaceuticals that we 10carry, we carry because it's convenient for clients. 11 We know we need to put patients on medications 12in order to keep them safe and living longer, and we are 13aware of the fact that there are lots of other 14opportunities for clients to obtain prescription 15medications, and I think most of the time we are more 16than competitive, because it's easy to check. 17 I mean, there is pretty much price transparency 18these days. My clients are as smart as I am, I'm no 19smarter, but I can go on Amazon, so I know what pricing 20is, and should be, and so does anybody else who's 21connected to the Internet. Pricing, by and large, is 22competitive. If it's not competitive, then the clients 23are going to ask for a prescription and we're not going 24to sell the product because we can't do that or we're 25going to write them a prescription.194 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 DR. FOSTER: I would encourage you to do your 2own study on the pricing. Sorry to interrupt. Some are, 3some aren't. 4 MS. KOSLOV: So, we have two other topics that 5we're going to try and address in the remaining 20 6minutes of this program. I'm going to turn it over to 7Chris to migrate over to those. 8 MR. GRENGS: This morning we heard the topic of 9qualifications for pharmacists to fill animal 10medications prescriptions, and this is a topic that's 11also come up in some of the written comments that we 12have received and I thought I would ask Professor Blythe 13if she can give us a quick summary of the types of 14education and training opportunities that are available 15to pharmacists during their formal education, and after, 16whenthey're practicing, and any other types of 17supplementary information or training that they might 18receive. 19 MS. BLYTHE: You bet, Chris. 20 I think in the context of today's discussion, 21you can take pharmacists and all licensed pharmacists 22within the continental United States and you can almost 23divide those out into three different groups. The vast 24majority, the large majority are pharmacists who do not 25have any training in veterinary pharmacology or195 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinary pharmacy and they typically do not feel 2comfortable filling those types of prescriptions and 3frequently they will self-identify as, boy, I don't know 4on this, I'm not comfortable. 5 You then have kind of a second group of 6pharmacists who have had access to elective courses 7within the pharmacy curriculum. They could have been in 8the form of didactic electives or clinical electives via 9rotations. So, those types of pharmacists have had 10opportunities via education while they're in the PharmD 11program, after they exit the PharmD program, whether it 12be continuing education courses or other courses that 13are offered by veterinary organizations, or even more 14commonly, pharmacy organizations. 15 So, there's a subset of pharmacists who have 16sought additional training and education. They have an 17interest in veterinary pharmacy and they are motivated 18to self-educate, and typically will seek avenues to 19shadow, consult a veterinarian, and they are typically 20very proactive in developing positive working 21relationships with veterinarians within their community. 22 Even a third subset is some highly specialized 23pharmacists who have had a great deal of post-graduate 24training. Perhaps they've had anywhere from five to ten 25to 20 years of hands-on clinical experience in a196 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinary teaching hospital, an online pharmacy, a 2brick-and-mortar pharmacy that specializes in veterinary 3pharmaceuticals only or in teaching academia. So, 4that's an even smaller subset of pharmacists out there. 5 So, certainly groups two and three, I think with 6education and training and on-the-job training, peer 7training, can educate each other and they can get to the 8point where they can safely and confidently field some 9of your most common chronic and preventative medications 10used in companion animals, and by that I say largely 11cats and dogs, much as Dr. Hauser has referenced. 12 So, those are kind of the three, how they shake 13out. 14 With regards to specific numbers, let me start 15by saying there is no requirement that a pharmacy 16student take any type of course in veterinary 17pharmacy. If they are available, they are entirely 18elective. So it could be a didactic course in a 19face-to-face environment, it could be an online course, 20or it could be a clinical course that they take typically 21in the fourth year of their pharmacy education and we call 22it a clinical rotation or an advanced pharmacy practice 23experience. 24 So, those are the types of educational offerings 25that occur today within the doctor of pharmacy197 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551curriculum. Of those, of the schools that are currently 2accredited by ACPE, and that is the Accreditation 3Council of Pharmacy Education, there are 127 accredited 4pharmacy schools in the United States, of those 102 have 5full accreditation, 17 have partial accreditation, so 6they are the newer schools, and then there are two that 7have pre-accreditation status. But collectively, we 8have 127 schools that are taking pharmacy students in 9today in the United States. 10 Of those, to the best of my ability to 11collect data and knowledge of my peers from being in 12pharmacy academia for so long, roughly 20 to 25 percent 13of those schools will have a faculty member on staff who 14is offering a face-to-face didactic elective in 15veterinary pharmacy and/or a clinical rotation in 16veterinary pharmacy for those students. 17 If that is not an option, which is the case for 18the majority of pharmacy schools in the United States, 19there is always the option to take online courses in 20veterinary pharmacy. They are available to everyone 21within the continental United States, for interested 22students as well as a continuing education course for 23practicing pharmacists. 24 So, that's kind of how it shakes out with 25regards to numbers, what is currently available, and so198 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551perhaps that will give some data for a framework to 2reference here. 3 I can confidently say that the number of courses 4in veterinary pharmacy within the schools, whether they 5be didactic or clinical education experience, has been 6on the increase in the past ten years. Without 7question, more schools are recognizing the need to train 8pharmacists in those types of medications, more schools 9are embracing faculty to offer those specialty services 10or have knowledge in that area or their area of 11expertise. More pharmacy schools are actively working 12with other stakeholders within the pharmacy profession 13to somehow make educational opportunities available for 14their students or for practicing pharmacists within 15their state. 16 So, definitely I think the increase in 17educational offerings is reflective of the increase in 18prescriptions that are being outsourced to community 19pharmacies, in your typical retail community settings, 20by veterinarians for your chronic and preventative 21medications in dogs and cats. 22 MR. GRENGS: Anybody else on the panel have any 23follow-up thoughts about the training that pharmacists 24receive? 25 DR. FOSTER: I would like to add something.199 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551First of all, I think ongoing continuing education is 2absolutely essential. At our place, at Foster & 3Smith, we use University of Wisconsin. They have some 4continuing education classes. The pharmacist's letter 5also has some that they have taken for CE. I am not 6going to ever sit here and say that the pharmacists are 7trained as well as the veterinarians right now, but 8remember, they're not prescribing, they're dispensing. 9And there's room for improvement. 10 I think what Elaine said, if pharmacists 11want to participate in the field of veterinary medicine, 12it should be mandatory that they have CE, I think, in 13this field. Just my opinion. 14 MR. GRENGS: And to follow up on that point, are 15there any other types of best practices that you feel 16are important in running a pharmacy? 17 DR. FOSTER: I think that the AVMA already has 18established some of that by their recommendation of a 19VIPPS-certified pharmacy. And there's I believe 16 20VIPPS, there might even be more today, certified 21pharmacies. That's some assurance. 22 That's the best standard that we go by today. 23Other than that, remember, we're governed by the Board 24of Pharmacy. And in my case, our pharmacy is licensed 25by the Board of Pharmacy. The veterinarians work under200 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551the Board of Veterinary Medicine. You don't just mess 2up for the heck of it, you lose your license. I mean, 3we do have severe guidelines and punishment if we don't 4go by the letter of the law. Thank you. 5 MR. GRENGS: And with that, I thought we would 6turn to some interesting policy questions, including 7legislative approaches to prescription portability, 8among them H.R. 1406. And just to follow up on Adrian 9Hochstadt's introductory presentation, H.R. 1406 was a 10bill that has been introduced in Congress, but the FTC, 11to be clear, had no role in developing that legislation, 12and FTC staff don't have any particular position on it, 13and to my knowledge, none of our five commissioners have 14any current positions on the bill either, but it has 15obviously raised a number of interesting policy issues. 16 So, I will start off with a basic question, is 17H.R. 1406 or other legislation needed? Is there a 18problem, or is this a solution in search of a problem? 19 MS. KOSLOV: If I could just embellish that 20question a little bit, only because in the interest of 21time I want to make sure we get this point out as well. 22So, to the extent that H.R. 1406 might impose some 23burdens in the name of notice, if you have ideas for 24alternative approaches or less burdensome approaches for 25those of you who might oppose the legislation, in201 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551particular, you can maybe address those as well. 2 DR. ASPROS: Well, I will start out repeating 3something that we said earlier today, this looks like a 4solution looking for a problem, in search of a problem. 5 AVMA is unaware of any data, any data, that 6suggests that there's a problem associated with 7veterinarians providing written prescriptions that this 8is a problem that requires a solution, a legislative 9solution in Congress. 10 If there is any issue, there's certainly no 11federal recourse required to resolve it. State boards 12of pharmacy and state boards of veterinary medicine 13certainly have the tools they need to identify and solve 14this problem if they decide that there is one. 15 MS. KOSLOV: Ms. Press? 16 MS. PRESS: Yes. So, the ASPCA does support 17this bill, and we think that there is a federal problem. 18We think it's also a problem of consumer education. We 19think both are issues here. Right now, there's no 20uniform framework to guide consumer expectation, and the 21benefit of a federal solution is that consumers know 22what to expect every time that they go to the vet. 23They're going to walk out with a prescription in hand 24and they can choose to fill that with a vet or fill that 25elsewhere. So, there's going to be certainty.202 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 So, we do see benefits to a federal solution to 2this issue. 3 MR. GRENGS: Mr. Hinckle? 4 MR. HINCKLE: Yeah. There definitely is a 5problem that needs a solution, and again, coming back to 6American consumers, when Congress passed the Generic 7Drug Act for animal drugs, it had a reason to believe that 8eventually they were going to get affordable generic 9drugs. That's not happening, and I think it's in large 10part because there's not enough demand because people 11just don't ask for the prescriptions many times. For 12whatever their reason may be. 13 That lack of demand means that there's not a 14market for the generic drugs. We talked about prices 15 are competitive. Well, prices are too high. Prices 16should be lower. Prices would be lower if we had a 17robust, generic industry, and it would also be helpful 18for everyone in the sense that a robust generic industry 19drives the innovator companies to develop the new 20generation of products instead of using marketing 21techniques to continue to evergreen their existing 22products. 23 So, I kind of keep tooting the horn here, but 24that's what this industry is missing is a real robust, 25substitutable generic business.203 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- Smith? 2 MR. SMITH: I think it depends on who you ask. 3If you ask the consumer is there a need or a problem, I 4think a consumer would quickly tell you that they 5believe that this is something that would border on a 6right, just like it is in a human situation. If 7someone is going to prescribe me something, isn't it my 8right to be able to take that prescription and go to 9somewhere where we all can create a safe place to have 10it filled? We talk a lot about what the manufacturer, 11the pharmacy or the veterinarian thinks. As a consumer 12myself, I feel like I should have the right when a 13prescription is granted for my dog, why don't I have 14the right to the piece of paper? It seems reasonable. 15 MR. GRENGS: Dr. Foster? 16 DR. FOSTER: I think there's a problem, but I 17don't believe it's the veterinarians. It's the drug 18companies. We've just got to say it. When they 19restrict distribution, that's the problem. When there's 20no drugs to fill your prescription, that's the problem. 21It doesn't mean we can't improve as a veterinary 22profession or as a pharmacy profession. It doesn't mean 23we don't have some bumps in the roads, but I've been in 24it since I was a kid, and I've seen a lot of positive 25changes in the profession. I think Dr. Aspros and the204 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551rest of the AVMA members have done a good job. 2Do I agree with everything they do? No, I don't. But I 3think it's improving. I don't believe the problem is the 4veterinarian. It's not going to be in the future, either. 5It's the drug companies. It's got to be dealt with. 6 It doesn't matter how many prescriptions we 7issue where you walk out with or are sent to Foster & 8Smith. They won't be filled. Or if they do, they will 9be done at a higher price because we have to protect our 10supply, for refills. You just can't -- the consumer is 11losing in this. And it's real. But guys, it's not the 12veterinarians. 13 MS. KOSLOV: So, I would like to make sure that 14we do get a veterinarian perspective specifically on the 15question of H.R. 1406, and from your perspective, the 16burdens that it might impose and whether there are 17better alternatives if, in fact, there is some value. 18My question presumes that there may be some value in 19educating consumers and giving them more notice that 20they have options out in the marketplace. If you 21disagree with that, by all means, go ahead. 22 DR. ASPROS: I would say that there are 23significant unresolved issues with the specific 24legislation 1406. One is, as we had mentioned earlier, 25veterinarians are allowed to, under state law, to205 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551dispense for their own patients under a VCPR. That 2doesn't make a veterinarian a pharmacist. 3 Veterinarians in at least every state that I 4know of may not act as a pharmacist and fill 5prescriptions for other pet owners for which they're not 6the veterinarian who's established a VCPR. 7 If, in fact, under 1406 we are writing 8prescriptions for every potential dispensed product, 9it's really unclear to me what we're supposed to do and 10under whose authority are we filling those 11prescriptions, even for our own patients for whom we've 12just written the prescription to, and I'm not sure that 131406 makes that clear at all. 14 My license as a veterinarian is governed under 15state law. Pharmacy is governed under state law. And 16suddenly we have this overlay of Federal legislation 17over both of those licensed professions, and it's not 18clear how that's going to be managed. It's clearly not 19a zero sum game in terms of the very small businesses 20that veterinary practices represent. As I said earlier, 21the typical veterinarian practice has one veterinarian 22and six staff working at the practice. These are 23burdensome regulations that 1406 would apply. 24 MS. KOSLOV: If I could follow up on one point 25that you raised, and Dr. Hauser, I know this is206 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551something you have thought of as well and this also 2responds to one of the many questions that we received, 3but I do want to pick up this one in particular. If 4there is greater prescription portability, how does 5this affect the financial viability of veterinarian 6practices? Is this something that you've thought about 7and would we see a situation where perhaps the price of 8the medication goes down but the price of services goes 9up? 10 DR. HAUSER: So, before I answer that, I want to 11further a little along what Dr. Aspros just said in 12relation to what Dr. Pion also said this morning. 13Veterinarians want an equal playing field. The point 14that needs to be perfectly clear is, at least in 15Colorado, I am happy to write those prescriptions for my 16clients. When I have other clients bring in 17prescriptions from other hospitals, I can't fill them. 18So, it's not an equal playing field under 1406. Any 19retail pharmacy, any online pharmacy, and obviously, the 20VCPR veterinarian will be able to fill those 21prescriptions. So, I just wanted to clarify that. 22 As far as the economics, they're significant, 23and make no mistake about it. I love listening to 24Ms. Press say how lovely it's going to be in this ideal 25world when pet prescriptions drop and the cost of207 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551veterinary care drops. If you own a small animal 2business -- not small animal business, just a small 3business -- and you look at losing 17 percent, which is 4the number we heard today, and that by some accounts is 5a conservative number, 17 percent of your total gross 6revenue, how are you going to keep the doors open? 7You're going to have to increase costs somewhere else. 8The most likely place is going to be through 9service-based increases. 10 I had a dialogue with a gentleman earlier this 11morning. When I sold my practice in 2008, it cost me 12$3.75 a minute turnkey cost. I think that was the last 13time I calculated it. But $3.75 a minute. So, for every 14minute that I was open, that's what it cost me, without 15compensating my doctors. So, that was just the fixed 16costs, not variable costs like pharmacy. 17 So, if I have a 30-minute office visit, the true 18cost to have that client in the building is over $120, 19and I charged, at that time, actually $55. 20 So, there's a sharing perspective that goes 21along to keeping those doors open, and I would love to 22be seeing a client every single minute that I am in that 23hospital, but that does not work either. So, you talk 24about the economics of it, you can't have it both ways. 25I do not predict -- my personal opinion -- that you will 208 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551see veterinary prices go down. The veterinarians, we 2have the fragmentation in the industry, actually for the 3first time in 20 years, a 2012 AVMA study just showed a 4decrease in pet ownership. We know since 2003, we've 5had decreasing patient visits. This is a really scary 6time to own a business or to run a business. 7 MS. KOSLOV: Ms. Press? 8 MS. PRESS: So, I'm not a vet, so I can't really 9speak to how vets decide to set their prices in their 10practices. I can speak about responsible pet ownership, 11and I think pet owners appreciate vets who provide good 12value, and we tell the public that they should shop 13around for caring, quality, affordable vet care and pet 14meds. Part of being a responsible pet owner is being a 15smart consumer, and I know that Dr. Hauser appreciates 16that. I think that's something that vets understand and 17appreciate. 18 We want affordable prices for pet meds and it 19doesn't matter to us where those affordable meds come 20from. If the vet can offer the lowest price on those 21pet meds, that's great, that offers a lot of advantages. 22We just want the competitive environment to be there so 23that those prices are available. 24 MR. GRENGS: I would just ask one follow-up 25question. To what extent is prescription portability a209 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551legal or policy issue that requires a particular formal 2solution, if it does, or to what extent is this really a 3consumer education and awareness issue about their 4ability to get a prescription and take it elsewhere to 5be filled outside of a veterinary clinic? Are there any 6thoughts on the state of consumer awareness about their 7ability to get a prescription? 8 Dr. Hauser? 9 DR. HAUSER: I do believe portability exists. I 10write prescriptions not infrequently in my hospital. I 11think that client education would help to maybe breach 12part of this divide. Again, looking at the clients that 13I serve, they're very well-educated. They're very 14consumer savvy. And I would be very surprised if very 15many of them think that you can't get your prescriptions 16filled elsewhere. I mean, they do. They know that we 17use a lot of the same medications. 18 DR. ASPROS: I would say that just one company, 191-800-PetMeds, has spent more than $200 million in the past 20ten years letting the pet owners know that they can 21ask for prescriptions and fill them online. I don't 22think that this is something that consumers are unaware 23of. 24 Again, I think this is a solution looking for a 25problem. This is a very robust marketplace with I think210 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551pretty fine margins and veterinarians are doing the best 2thing possible for their patients, and consumers I think 3have many options that they're aware of. 4 MS. KOSLOV: So, in the interest of time, I 5think we'll have to let that be the final word for now. 6I do want to note that we've gotten a ton of great 7questions from the audience, as well as from the Twitter 8feed. Some of the questions I think got answered 9implicitly or explicitly during the discussion. 10 As for some of the other questions, we will 11definitely take note of those and staff will do our best 12to follow up on those as we decide what our next steps 13will be. 14 I would like to thank our panelists for an 15extremely productive conversation, and I hope you'll all 16stick around for the next panel where we'll try and 17apply some of what we've been hearing about over the 18course of the day and look at the contact lens 19experience and see what, if any, lessons we can draw 20from that. 21 Please join me in thanking our panelists. 22 (Applause.) 23 MS. KOSLOV: We will reconvene at 3:00. 24 (Whereupon, there was a recess in the 25proceedings.)211 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25212 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 PANEL THREE 2 LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CONTACT LENS INDUSTRY 3 MR. GILMAN: Hi, I wonder if people could start 4to make their way to their seats. 5 So, let's get started. A couple of 6preliminaries. So, I would like to welcome you all back 7to this, our third and final panel of the day. I hope 8it's been an interesting and fruitful day for everyone 9here. I would like to introduce our panelists to Erin 10Flynn, who is sitting in front of me, for two reasons: 11One is Erin is an honors paralegal here at the FTC, she 12has been terrifically helpful to us in preparing for 13this workshop, and it's sort of unsung work, and so I 14would just like to say thank you. 15 (Applause.) 16 MR. GILMAN: For our panelists, I just want to 17say that Erin will be the timekeeper and enforcer on 18your brief presentations. She will hold up a little 19sign warning you when you've got one minute to go, 30 20seconds to go, and no time whatsoever, and I'll just ask 21that you sort of look her way as you're going through 22your presentations. No need to be mindful of her six 23black belts in different martial arts. 24 So, here we go. This panel could have been 25titled, \"And now for something completely different.\"213 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551We're not going to talk so much directly about animal 2medicines. We're going to talk about the FTC's 3experience with and learning about the contact lens 4industry. The reason for that is that this isn't 5something wholly different, although there are 6differences and we want to keep them in mind and ask 7when and to what extent they're important. 8 So, there are some salient similarities here. 9This is part of the FTC's general interest in 10e-commerce, and it's an area where we've got 11considerable experience in optical goods and contact 12lenses. There are some common issues. The common 13prescriber/vendor model, some common competition and 14consumer protection issues, questions have been raised 15about restrictions on distribution or what might be seen 16as private vertical restraints. Prescription release 17and portability questions have been raised. Consumer 18credence issues for established and new markets have 19been raised. Quite a lot of flux in the market is also 20true. 21 So, we want to explore the basic question, what 22we've learned about our experience with the contact lens 23industry and enforcing the FCLCA and the Contact Lens 24Rule, and whether or to what extent that learning might 25inform our thinking about issues in this new space.214 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 So, to sort of kick this off and to provide some 2background, we're fortunate to have our colleague Sydney 3Knight. Sydney is an attorney in the Division of 4Advertising Practices here at the Federal Trade Commission, 5that's in our Bureau of Consumer Protection, 6which is actually charged with the enforcement of the 7Contact Lens Rule, which is the FTC's implementation of 8the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act. So, I would 9like to introduce Sydney and give him an opportunity to 10provide some framing remarks for our discussion. 11 MR. KNIGHT: Thank you very much, Dan. 12 Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Sydney 13Knight, and as Dan said, I'm an attorney in the Federal 14Trade Commission's Division of Advertising Practices 15here in the Bureau of Consumer Protection. 16 Today, I would like to provide you with a brief 17overview of the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act, 18and the FTC's implementing regulation known as the 19Contact Lens Rule. 20 Now, obviously this is mainly background to the 21main focus of your discussions here today; however, we 22believe that these measures set forth in this statute 23could provide some guidance for your consideration. But 24before I go any further, let me state our usual 25disclaimer, that my comments today reflect my own views,215 For The Record, Inc.

Now, it turns out that 5during the decade that preceded the enactment of that 6statute, the use of contact lenses had seen a tremendous 7growth throughout the United States. In fact, in 2003, 8it was estimated that American consumers were spending 9approximately $3.5 billion annually on 10replacement contact lenses. 11 However, along with this phenomenal growth in 12the industry, concerns were raised about the lack of 13competition in the industry. Particularly in light of 14the prevailing practice at that time where various state 15laws permitted a prescriber to be the only entity that 16could fill the prescription. 17 So, to address these concerns, Congress held a 18series of hearings. Congress then determined that the 19practice of contact lens prescriptions being filled only 20by a prescriber resulted in an unnecessary limitation on 21the consumer's ability to shop for the best price for 22their contact lenses. So it was that Congress passed 23the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act to increase 24competition in the sale of contact lenses and to bring 25substantial savings to America's consumers and contact 216 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551lens wearers. 2 So, let's take a look at the specifics of the 3statute itself. At the very heart of the Fairness to 4Contact Lens Consumers Act is the requirement that 5prescribers must give their patients a copy of their 6contact lens prescriptions at the end of the contact 7lens fitting, even if the patient doesn't ask for it. 8 Now, in giving the consumer this right to a copy of 9their prescription, Congress clearly understood that 10this right would be meaningless unless the consumer 11could also fill the prescription at the business of 12their choice. 13 So, the statute states that once the consumer 14receives a copy of their prescription, the consumer 15could then take the prescription to any seller of 16contact lenses, either in person, by mail, or by 17facsimile to be filled. However, as we know, it is not 18always possible for a patient to present a copy of the 19prescription in person, by mail or by facsimile as 20required. For example, Internet sites. So, in these 21situations, the act also imposes a requirement that 22prescribers provide verification of contact lens 23prescriptions that were written by the prescriber. 24 Now, it should be noted that this requirement is 25one that was filled with some element of controversy at217 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551the time, due obviously in part to the inherent 2competitive tug of war between third party sellers and 3doctors who also sold contact lenses. However, Congress 4resolved these issues by setting up a system that allows 5for the contact lens prescription to be verified in one 6of three ways. The statute provides that the 7prescription can be verified if the prescriber confirms 8the accuracy of the prescription by direct communication 9with the seller. In this instance, a seller seeking to 10verify a prescription would simply contact the 11prescriber, by phone, often times, and provide the 12prescriber with certain information about the consumer 13as well as the prescription that was provided by the 14consumer. Now, once that prescription is verified by the 15prescriber, the seller can go ahead and fill the 16prescription. 17 The second method for verification of 18prescriptions is where the prescriber verifies the 19prescription by correcting any inaccuracy in the 20prescription. This would cover such things as 21incorrect name spelling or incorrect address, things of 22that sort. 23 The third method of verification occurs 24when the prescriber fails to respond to the seller 25within eight business hours after receiving the request218 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551for verification. In this instance, if the prescriber 2does not respond, the statute says that the prescription 3is deemed verified. Thus, this is clearly a passive 4verification method whereby the prescriber simply cannot 5ignore the request for verification and thereby 6frustrate the wishes of the consumer. 7 Moreover, the act also provides a few other 8provisions designed to ensure that prescribers do not 9impose other requirements as a condition of providing or 10verifying the contact lens prescription. For example, 11the act also mandates that prescribers may not require 12the purchase of contact lenses from the prescriber as a 13condition of release of verification of the prescription. 14So, obviously the prescriber cannot say, well, you've got 15to purchase additional lenses in order for me to verify 16the one that you would like to have filled by another 17seller. Secondly, the prescriber may not require the 18patient to pay additional fees as a condition of release 19of verification of a prescription. And third, 20prescribers may not require the patient to sign a waiver 21or release in exchange for the release of verification 22of the prescription. 23 Now, as far as the implementation and 24enforcement of the act is concerned, Congress turned to 25the FTC by mandating that the FTC exercise its authority219 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551under the Federal Trade Commission Act and that the FTC 2also undertake enforcement responsibility for the rule. 3 Well, it turns out that the FTC did have some 4previous involvement with other rules regarding eyewear. 5In fact, in 1978, the FTC issued the Prescription 6Release Rule, otherwise known as the Eyeglass Rule. 7Under that rule, an optometrist or ophthalmologist must 8provide the patient, at no extra cost, a copy of the 9patient's eyeglass prescription upon completion of an eye 10exam. 11 Now, prior to the rule, the FTC conducted a 12number of comprehensive surveys of state licensing laws 13and of private associations' codes. Based upon these 14surveys, it was found that more than 50 percent of 15optometrists imposed some restriction on the patient's 16ability to obtain a copy of their prescription. 17 So, with that background in mind, the FTC was 18called upon, by Congress, to issue its own rules to 19enforce the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act, and 20that the FTC did in 2004. Although the act as passed by 21Congress did set forth a number of specifics, as we 22discussed above, it was the FTC's Contact Lens Rule that 23filled in a number of other specific requirements. For 24example, the Contact Lens Rule sets forth the manner in 25which the eight business hours required for verification 220 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551of a prescription would be calculated. 2 So, according to the Contact Lens Rule, a 3business hour is defined as one hour between 9:00 a.m. 4and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding 5holidays. So, essentially, if a verification request is 6received at 4:00 p.m., the clock stops running at 5:00 7p.m., and then will continue running at 9:00 a.m. the 8next business day. Therefore, it's not 24 hours, eight 9hours whenever. It has to be within those business 10hours, 9:00 to 5:00, except the FTC also allowed a 11business hour to include a prescriber's regular business 12hours on Saturdays, if the seller has actual knowledge 13that the prescriber has Saturday hours. So, if the 14prescription comes in at 4:00 p.m. on Friday, and the 15prescriber has Saturday hours, then those hours count 16towards the eight hours. 17 Another important provision of the Contact Lens 18Rule specifies that sellers of contact lenses maintain 19certain types of records, including the seller's 20verification requests. Such recordkeeping 21provisions provide the FTC with an opportunity to 22investigate whether there has been a rule violation by 23the seller, and in some instances to seek civil 24penalties for such violations. 25 Pursuant to the FTC's enforcement authority, 221 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551the FTC has investigated and brought a number of cases 2under the Contact Lens Rule. In fact, since the 3issuance of the Contact Lens Rule in 2004, the FTC 4has brought ten different enforcement actions against 5various individuals and entities. Here's a list of 6those cases, and they can all be found on the FTC's 7website. 8 Now, I won't go into the details of every 9individual case, but just to give you a sense, our 10settlement orders have generally provided injunctive 11relief which, for example, would prohibit the seller 12from selling contact lenses without obtaining a 13prescription from a consumer. It would also prohibit 14the seller from selling contact lenses without verifying 15the prescriptions first, by communicating directly with 16the prescriber. It would also prohibit the seller from 17failing to maintain records of prescriptions and 18verifications. As I said, in some instances, we have 19actually obtained civil penalties from some of these 20sellers. 21 Finally, I would like to point out to you some 22additional resources about the Contact Lens Rule that 23are available from the FTC. The FTC has some online 24resources available, one publication known as The 25Contact Lens Rule: A Guide for Prescribers and Sellers,222 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551and as you can see, it's available on the FTC's website. 2We also have another very important brochure that 3provides Qs and As for how do you comply with the 4Contact Lens Rule. 5 Now, these are just some of the materials that 6you can find on the FTC's website. You can also contact 7individuals at the FTC. We have a number there that is 8the Division of Advertising Practices number, and you 9can call that number to get additional information if 10you need to do so. 11 Thank you. 12 (Applause.) 13 MR. GILMAN: Thanks very much, Sydney. 14 My colleague, Joel Schrag, and I look forward to 15discussion with this very fine panel that we've been 16fortunate to assemble here. I commend to you their 17biographies, which are on the workshop webpage. We'll 18just go down in sequence as before, introducing people 19by name and title. 20 First off, we are glad to have with us Joe 21Zeidner, who is the chief legal officer and general 22counsel and corporate secretary for 1-800-Contacts. 23 Joe? 24 MR. ZEIDNER: Thank you, Dan. 25 As you mentioned, my name is Joe Zeidner, I'm223 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551general counsel of 1-800-Contacts, our country's largest 2direct seller of replacement contact lenses. I thank the 3Commission for allowing me to participate in today's 4workshop on pet medications. 5 The marketplace for pet meds looks a lot like 6the contact lens marketplace looked before the Federal 7Government stepped in to promote competition and 8consumer choice. I am here to talk about three things 9that we learned from our experience. 10 First, when the government decides to require a 11prescription for a good, they also have to give 12consumers the freedom of choice and allow them to 13benefit from competition on filling that prescription. 14 Second, by-request laws do not work. And by 15request, which you heard about in the other panels, are 16when a consumer has to ask for a copy of the 17prescription instead of getting it automatically. These 18are unenforceable, they're discriminatory, they put 19consumers in the middle of a conflict of interest, and they 20create an unfair playing field between doctors who 21freely release prescriptions and those who don't. They 22discourage choice, since doctors can ask for a fee or a 23waiver. 24 Number three, giving consumers their 25prescriptions and the right to choose where they fill224 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551them will save consumers money, assure them better 2service, meet their needs for convenience, and promote 3health. 4 Twenty years ago, consumers had no right under 5federal law to a copy of their own contact lens 6prescription. Even if they could get a copy, they were 7limited in their ability to shop around. There was 8evidence that contact lens manufacturers and 9optometrists were colluding to lock in consumers. Today, 10contact lens consumers have a right to a copy of their 11contact lens prescription automatically, without having 12to ask, without having to pay and without having to sign 13a waiver. They can fill that prescription at the 14retailer of their choice. When that retailer is someone 15other than their prescriber, they have a right to have 16that prescription verified. 17 How did we get here? There are a number of 18touch points. First off, as Sydney talked about, there 19was the Eyeglass Rule that gave eyeglass wearers a right 20to their eyeglass prescription. Second, in 1996, attorneys 21general from 32 states had a national class action of 22consumers brought an action against the American 23Optometric Association and the major contact lens 24manufacturers for conspiring to impede competition from 25contact lens sellers. Bob Hubbard, who is on this panel, 225 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551will speak a lot more about that. 2 What's important is in that settlement, the 3parties eventually settled with the manufacturers, 4agreeing to abandon their restrictive policies on 5distribution, and the AOA agreed that it shall not make 6claims that ocular health is impacted by the channel 7from which consumers purchase their replacement lenses. 8 Also in 2002, the FTC staff testified in a 9regulatory proceeding in Connecticut. The FTC suggested 10that passive verification was the correct system to 11settle the conflict of interest between an eye doctor 12who also sells what he prescribes, and an outside 13seller. The FTC also documented how the cost to a 14consumer in time and travel in picking up their lenses 15from a brick-and-mortar store could exceed the dollar 16cost of the contact lenses themselves. 17 What has been the impact on consumers? They're 18saving money, they're buying more lenses, they have more 19choices, they go and have more exams, and they are 20benefitting from technological advances. 21 I am hopeful that for the FTC's workshop today, 22this is the beginning of a process, and in the end, all 23Americans who own pets, and that's most of us, can have 24the chance to benefit the same way that contact lens 25consumers have.226 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 Thank you. 2 MR. GILMAN: Thanks, Joe. 3 Our next panelist is Dr. Clarke Newman, a fellow 4in the American Academy of Optometry, and a long-time 5member of the American Optometric Association. 6 DR. NEWMAN: Thank you for allowing me to attend 7and to address the FTC workshop. 8 I am a doctor of optometry and I have been a 9contact lens specialist in private practice in Dallas, 10Texas for 27 years. I have been asked by the American 11Optometric Association, or the AOA, to address the 12optometric experience with the Fairness to Contact Lens 13Consumers Act, and I'll call it the Lens Act for short. 14 I also cite the official position of the AOA is 15contained in the letter to the FTC by Dr. Robert Jordan, 16chair of the AOA Federal Relations Committee, and I 17incorporate those comments here as I expand on some key 18points. I have provided expanded written remarks, since 19time is short. 20 Our experience with the Lens Act, I think, is 21quite instructive for all pet medication stakeholders, 22legislators and regulators as they consider the passage 23and the promulgation of rules under the Fairness to Pet 24Owners Act of 2011, which I'll refer to as the Pet Act. 25 The Lens Act was a very good thing for the227 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551consumer by creating a framework for prescription 2acquisition that enabled the patient to shop for the 3best deal on lens prices. The Lens Act was also a very 4bad thing for the consumer because the process of 5passive verification, in particular, created 6significant opportunity for abuse by the suppliers and a 7nearly impossible enforcement burden which, due to the 8limited resources of those charged with enforcing the 9act, often failed -- as witnessed by the fact that a 10Shell Station down on I-35 south of Dallas has a wider 11selection of tinted lenses than I do in my practice. 12 Without the full enforcement of the Lens Act, 13lenses are frequently purchased without prescriptions or 14with expired prescriptions. When a patient's ability to 15purchase a medical device that is worn on the eye is not 16well controlled, the public is harmed. 17 The claim has been made that optometrists and 18now veterinarians are unique in that what we sell we 19prescribe. That view is foundationally wrong. In the 20fee-for-service health care paradigm, all doctors profit 21from their recommendations that they make, whether 22they're surgeons or dentists or whoever. That's a 23failed assumption. 24 It has been suggested that health care claims 25about contact lens distribution should be viewed228 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551skeptically unless one can provide substantive evidence 2of health care issues related to sale of prescription 3products by alternative sellers, and I certainly agree 4with that. 5 We now have that evidence and it is compelling. 6In a 2008 study, a large prospective population 7surveillance study was published in one of the most 8respected peer-reviewed ophthalmological journals by a 9group of highly respected researchers in eye care, led 10by Dr. Fiona Stapleton. Since the annualized incidents 11of microbial keratitis is small, the rare disease 12assumption can be applied and the odds ratios 13approximate the relative risk, and therefore one sees a 14fourfold increase in the risk of the most severe 15complication, microbial keratitis, by those who purchase 16their lenses on the Internet or through the mail order. 17 Let me state that again. The multivariate 18isolated relative risk of developing the worst contact 19lens complication is just about four times greater for 20alternative distribution channels. 21 In an email exchange between Dr. Stapleton and 22myself yesterday, she states that there has been an 23increase in Internet and mail order purchases and we are 24currently seeing about 18 percent of orderers obtaining 25lenses in that way. These original conclusions are229 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551based on multivariate analysis controlled for wearer 2demographics and lens wearer modality. We have found 3these findings to be fairly robust. 4 Further, in 2010, Yvonne Wu, Nicole Carnt and 5Dr. Stapleton published data that shows a significant 6difference in the after care awareness of those who 7purchase their lenses from alternative channels of 8distribution. We find that compliance with contact lens 9care recommendations is low, ranging from 59 percent 10down to nine percent. 11 In 2008, Fogel and Zidile found that Internet 12purchasers were more likely to engage in harmful eye 13care practices and to trust non-evidence-based 14information found on the Internet rather than seeking 15out the best practices as recommended by their 16prescriber. Only two-thirds of the sellers ask for 17prescriptions. Three out of four ordered lenses even 18though they knew their prescription was expired. Three 19out of four Internet purchasers did not have annual eye 20exams, while three out of four who purchased them from 21their provider did have annual eye exams. 22 I really don't have a dog in the pet fight, 23that's a bad pun, I know, but I think it's important not to 24make the same mistakes when contemplating what to do with 25the Pet Act. Since we are dealings with drugs that have230 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551significant potential harm, even when used correctly, 2and since the end-consumers of these medications cannot 3advocate for themselves, it would be far better to err 4on the side of patient protection than consumer 5protection. That is the lesson one should take from the 6Lens Act experience. 7 Knowing what we know now about the increased 8risk of alternative channels of distribution for 9disposable contact lenses, more respect should be given 10to preventing needless injury to the public while 11crafting any law or regulation aimed at protecting 12consumer rights. 13 Thank you very much. 14 MR. GILMAN: Thanks. 15 So, our next speaker is Bob Hubbard. Bob is 16assistant attorney general in the Antitrust Bureau of 17the New York State Attorney General's Office, a position 18he has held since 1987. 19 MR. HUBBARD: Hi, good afternoon, pleased to be 20here. I was pleased that Sydney finally said the 21disclaimer that I thought always was here, I speak only 22for myself and not for any state. 23 I had the opportunity to prepare a statement and 24it goes into a lot more detail about the history of how 25states dealt with contact lenses. I had the pleasure of231 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551being the chair of the Plaintiff States Steering 2Committee in the contact lens litigation that consumed 3about eight years of my life. So, this is somewhat like 4going to a high school reunion for me, you know, these 5themes coming back that I thought I had moved beyond. 6 But it is very interesting and I found this very 7thought-provoking and I appreciate the invitation and 8the opportunity. 9 Now, the Disposable Contact Lens Antirust 10Litigation was an antitrust claim. I think that what 11we're talking about here is a legislative fix that if it 12were an antitrust violation, we wouldn't be talking 13about this. We would be talking about whether there was 14enough enforcement and stuff. But in contact lens, they 15did a whole lot more than what you've heard about here. 16 The AOA and the practitioners had something we 17call the supply restraint that go to the contact lens 18manufacturers. They say: \"We know how to write 19prescriptions, we know that we can limit the prescriptions 20so that only J&J lenses are sold. We can limit them to 21only Bausch & Lomb lenses if you'd like. So, because you 22know we have that power, we don't want you to sell to 231-800 anymore.\" And they reached an agreement. They 24were pretty blatant about those kind of things. 25 In addition to that, they had something that we232 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551labeled the demand restraint. The optometrists knew 2that the power over prescriptions gave them a 3competitive advantage. They knew that as soon as a 4consumer had a prescription, there were things that that 5consumer could do with that prescription. And so they 6did things to prevent, as some of the documents talked 7about, the prescription from walking out the door. So, 8they had training films about how to prevent the consumers 9from asking. They had these forms that if you signed it 10you thought that your firstborn was going to be committed 11for the rest of your life. There were all sorts of very 12burdensome requirements and the disclaimers and other 13things that restricted the demand for using alternatives 14that we challenged in the disposable contact lens 15litigation. We went all the way to five weeks of trial. 16We settled. We got the kind of stuff that Joe mentioned, 17sort of in passing, and I go through in more detail in my 18statement, more of that information. 19 But even after we had finished all of that, we 20didn't think we were done, because one of the things 21that happened was that the prescription gave a power to 22the prescriber that you usually don't have in 23competitive markets. They had the ability to restrict 24the access to competitive alternatives. That didn't 25necessarily happen through collusion, but it could233 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551happen individually within an individual optometrist or 2an individual ophthalmologist. 3 So, we thought that it was important to make 4sure that the prescriptions got released. We urged the 5FTC in 1997, just after we had filed, in December of 6'96, to extend the Eyeglass Rule to contact lenses. We 7thought that contact lenses had become manufactured in 8an easy, replicable way. No longer did you 9individually fit the lens on the eye. They were a 10replacement, you replaced them much more frequently than 11otherwise. We argued that the rule ought to be extended 12to contact lenses. We were happy that the FTC didn't 13rescind the Eyeglass Rule, but they did not extend it to 14contact lenses. 15 So, the effort went to legislation, and we wrote 16letters in support of separating the power of prescription 17from the power of selling. There were three AG letters in 18support of that. There were also provisions that we 19supported that tried to prevent the restricted distribution 20practices that were built on the power of prescription, 21where the manufacturers would limit to whom they would 22sell. I had the pleasure of testifying in support of 23that legislation that was passed. 24 I do have to add but one additional point. The 25problem here was not with state law. State law allowed 234 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551that prescribing and dispensing were two separate 2things. In the litigation, they argued that -- like 3usual, they tried to blame the victim -- it was the state 4law problem. It wasn't the state law problem, and we 5fought that. But we passed that legislation. That 6legislation got passed, I'm happy it did. It separated 7the prescription power from the sale of the prescribed 8products, and I think that that was all quite useful. I 9think that it promotes healthy results, and it brings 10value to consumers. 11 MR. GILMAN: Thanks, Bob. 12 Our next speaker is Rob Atkinson. Rob is the 13president of the Information Technology and Innovation 14Foundation, a non-partisan research and educational 15institute that deals with issues in technology policy in 16electronic commerce. 17 Rob? 18 MR. ATKINSON: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be 19here. 20 I've been writing and speaking about this issue 21of intermediary resistance to e-commerce since 2000, and 22it's been amazing to watch the proliferation of 23industries and professions that fight back against 24consumer choice. They all use exactly the same logic 25and argumentation. This is car dealers, wine235 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 (800) 921- 55551wholesalers, lawyers, realtors, undertakers, 2optometrists, and now veterinarians. 3 My favorite of all time was when I debated the 4head of the Texas Car Dealers Association at the 5National Conference of State Legislators who told me if 6you bought a car over the Internet from a producer, that 7you would get ripped off, unlike when you buy it from a 8car dealer. 9 They engage in this through three principal ways. 10One is collusion with producers. Bob talked eloquently 11about that. The second is limiting access to key resources. 12We've heard about that with prescriptions, and that's in 13theory what the 2003 Contact Lens Rule was designed to 14do. But I say designed because as late as 2007 in 15Contact Lens Spectrum Magazine, a professional magazine 16for optometrists who surveyed optometrists and found 17that in 2007, \"Despite this federal legislation, only 18half of the respondents replied yes to every patient 19when asked if they release contact lens prescriptions, 20even though they're required by law,\" which makes you 21wonder not only their ethics, but their intelligence for 22why they would answer a question that is illegal to take 23in a professional survey. So, clearly even when the law 24passed, you had optometrists who would resist this. And 25the third is they passed an array or supported the passage236 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551of an array of laws, including state laws requiring 2face-to-face transactions, limited sales, et cetera. 3 So, what can we learn from FCLCA? I think 4several things. One is that we learned that 5optometrists would oppose any threat to their business 6model and do virtually anything and say anything to keep 7their business model intact. We can also learn that 8ultimately optometrists benefitted from this law because 9of the change in the examination rule. Third, we can 10learn that really despite what you've heard, there's 11very little evidence of adverse health impacts. 12 The study that was cited here earlier, the Fogel 13and the Zidile study, which we have an article in there 14rebutting, is really a study when you look at it, that 15it's just chock full of methodological errors. It's not 16a study that would pass a rigorous statistical journal 17for peer review. I'm not going to go into detail on 18that. 19 The other one that we heard about, the 20Australian study that had multivariate analysis, which 21if you look at that, that fourfold increase, what that 22is a fourfold increase of has two problems. One is that 23the increase is very, very small. So, it might be a 24fourfold increase, but it's off of a base that is 25incredibly minute. The biggest risk in that study is237 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551sleeping with your contact lenses on all night, that's 2the giant risk. The teeny little risk is this other 3one. 4 Secondly, I'll just mention this Australian 5study, which the AOA representative cited, the study 6says, \"The risks associated with Internet mail order 7purchase may be related to contact lens care attitudes 8and behavior, not Internet sales.\" So, in other words, 9they haven't controlled for that and they admit that in 10the study. 11 Now, the other argument you will hear is that we 12don't, and James may make this argument, that even with 13the passage of this law, we haven't seen significant 14consumer benefits, that essentially the market is the 15same way it was, and that the contact lens providers 16have not lowered their prices. James Cooper has written 17a study on this, which he may talk about, but let me 18just comment on the study. 19 One of the things that James did in his study, 20he looked at 2004 as the base year, and 2007 as the 21final year. The big problem with that is in 2004, the 22act was already in existence. So what he was trying to 23look at is did optometry prices, getting your lenses from 24optometrists, did they actually go down relative to online 25over this period? But it was actually after the law was 238 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551passed, so you would expect a price impact right away, 2not later. 3 The second problem is that the base year, the 4end year, 2007, which we haven't talked about, was still 5right around the time that the CooperVision restrictions 6were in place, and CooperVision was not under this AG 7restraint. They were able to sell and basically sell 8lenses to optometrists that were doctors only. So, they 9would prescribe this lens, you simply couldn't buy it 10anywhere else. Luckily, they've been stopped, they have 11stopped doing that. 12 Just anecdotally, by the way, a sample of one, 13if you go out to Montgomery Mall and you go to 14LensCrafters, I took this picture last night, I'm sure 15you can all see it, but basically what it says, and I'm 16happy to give you a copy, basically it's a doctor there 17providing a little price description, and it says his 18prices or her prices are lower than 1-800 and Walmart. 19So, actually what it says is 1-800 and Walmart prices, 20and then Dr. Solomon's prices. It appears to me that that 21doctor is competing on the basis of price with Walmart and 221-800-Contacts and is trying to tell his or her customers, 23yeah, I'm going to compete on price and you should buy 24here. 25 Now, let's just say hypothetically that that's239 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551what's going on. That, to me, is pro-consumer and 2suggests that consumers have benefitted from the law, and 3I would suggest that consumers would benefit from a pet 4meds law as well. 5 Thank you. 6 MR. GILMAN: Thanks, Rob. 7 I would like to welcome back to the FTC James 8Cooper, who depending on his perspective is either an 9alumnus of or a refugee from the Office of Policy 10Planning, where he has served both as deputy director 11and as acting director. These days he's at George Mason 12University Law School where he is director of research 13and policy at the Law and Economics Center and a 14lecturer in law. 15 James? 16 MR. COOPER: Thanks, Dan. 17 It's great to be back here. It does feel like 18old times. I'm here, I think, I don't know, because 19they couldn't find anyone else, but I did some work on 20this Contact Lens Rule. It was one of the first things 21I did here as an attorney advisor in the Office of 22Policy Planning. I worked on the Contact Lens Rule and 23the study that was mandated by Congress, and it's the 24gift that keeps on giving, right? I'm back here. I've 25been asked to I don't know how many panels I've been on240 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551because of this, really not very many, to be honest, 2this is it. 3 In my very limited time, what I want to talk 4about here is I have done some empirical work. Some of 5it comes off of the Contact Lens Report, where we did 6gather some data, and then on my own, after that, I 7gathered some more data. So, one paper that I have right 8now, it's 9currently a working paper, it's under review at a 10journal, we'll see what happens, I'll keep you posted if 11you're interested, but it is to see if the prescription 12release requirement, how that affected prices. 13 I'll go forward with the punchline is I don't 14really find any evidence, but my takeaway from that 15isn't that it was a bad idea or that consumers didn't 16benefit. So, the methodology of the study is I did look 17at prices, we collected for the contact lens study in 182004, that was about a month after the Contact Lens 19Rule, the act passed, but it didn't go into effect until 20the Contact Lens Rule. It's a weakness in the study and 21it's front and center in the report. I devote about 22three pages discussing it in the caveats of the data. 23 However, then we go back in 2007 and collect 24data. So, the idea that if about a month after the 25Contact Lens Rule went into effect requiring241 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551prescription release, you wouldn't see all the effects 2right away, and so you go back three, three-and-a-half 3years later, see how the market has changed. I won't go 4into the pretty rigorous methodology, and what I find is 5really no effect on price. On average, there isn't any 6effect on price. 7 If there's anything that you can tease out of 8the data, it's one, that when places like LensCrafters 9and Pearl Vision, the optical chains, their prices 10actually rose over the time period, vis-a-vis online, 11the gap. So, what I'm measuring is the gap between 12online and offline. If prescription portability worked 13and the idea was that they would compete more vigorously, 14you would expect to see the price gaps narrow. The gap 15between warehouse clubs and online maybe shrunk a 16little. 17 So, but overall, you don't see much of a change. 18 I'm quickly running out of time. So, I will 19skip through to another little bit of empirical work I 20did in 2007 looking at the limited distribution 21strategies, and as alluded to already through Coopervision, 22lenses that have limited distribution, I did some 23empirical work there. I didn't really find that the 24margins or prices of those limited distributed lenses 25were statistically distinguishable from other lenses242 For The Record, Inc. 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551like Acuvue, et cetera, that were not limitedly 2distributed. 3 So, I hope we talk more about this in the panel, 4is prescription release, why do we not see a market 5effect? Maybe doctors aren't obeying the rule, that's 6one possibility. The other is something called ordered 7search, where search is costly and consumers are already 8there, and they think, okay, I'm going to buy from the 9first price draw I have, and doctors take advantage of 10that. They know it's costly to go and find something, 11so they charge a premium for that. 12 Limited distribution, I would just make the 13point here that there is a presumption in the antitrust 14laws that vertical restraints, both price and non-price, 15are efficient. The burden is on the moving party to 16show why they're inefficient. So, I think that's a 17pretty high burden. We should make sure to distinguish 18between horizontal collusion, which is going on in Bob's 19case, and unilateral vertical restraints, I think that's 20important when we think about policy. 21 Thanks a lot. 22 MR. GILMAN: Thanks, James. 23 Next we have Dr. Link Welborn of the American 24Veterinary Medical Association. 25 DR. WELBORN: Thank you. I would also like to243 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551thank the Federal Trade Commission for this opportunity. 2 I have been asked to speak to the similarities 3and differences between the contact lens and pet 4medications industries from my perspective as a 5practicing veterinarian. Both eye care professionals 6and veterinarians prescribe and dispense products for long- 7term use in their patients. 8 These products, contact lenses for people, and 9parasite control medications for pets, are typically 10sold in six-month supplies. However, these medications 11represent a minority of those prescribed by 12veterinarians. Most medications are acute short-term 13care medications and are much more varied in form, 14function and efficacy than contact lenses. 15 In addition, the potential for and severity of 16side effects associated with pet medications is much 17greater than with contact lenses. For example, the most 18commonly prescribed oral flea control medication and the 19most commonly prescribed treatment for mange will often 20cause a life-threatening side effect if administered to 21a dog within days of each other. 22 Further, some medications can be life-saving in 23one species and life-threatening for another, or even 24another breed within the same species. 25 While both large and small animal practice244 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551entities exist among eye care professionals and small 2animal veterinarians, the vast majority of pet practices 3are very small businesses and tend to be less profitable 4and less sophisticated from a business perspective than 5eye care professionals. Accordingly, veterinary practices 6are less able to absorb the expense and management effort 7associated with any additional regulatory burden without 8passing the additional costs on to consumers. 9 The veterinary profession is currently 10experiencing numerous economic challenges. While these 11challenges intensify during the recession, they 12certainly predate the downturn in the U.S. economy and 13will persist even as the overall economy improves. 14Included among these are the progressive margin compression 15on veterinary medications that spans more than a decade. 16While this has reduced the profitability of veterinary 17practices, it has been beneficial to consumers in that it 18has reduced the cost of pet medications and it is an 19example of successful function of the free market. 20 Today, the mark-up for the most commonly 21prescribed parasite control medication in my practice is 22about half of what it was ten years ago, even though 23there is still no generic competition for that 24medication. 25 As I understand it, the price competition among245 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551sellers of contact lenses has intensified significantly 2since the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act was 3passed by Congress in 2003. Even though it is 4impossible to determine how much has been the result of 5this law and how much occurred independent of it, the 6competitive landscape has obviously changed greatly 7within many industries, including pet medications, over 8the last nine years, because of increased consumer 9utilization of online merchants and large discount 10retailers. 11 Consumer awareness of a large number of online 12and discount retail sources of pet medications has 13increased greatly since 2003, as a result of millions of 14dollars of advertising. As a result, virtually every 15pet owner that I see in my practice is aware of these 16options. Just as Ms. Press indicated relative to the 17ASPCA veterinarians and tens of thousands of other 18veterinarians across the country, the other 19veterinarians in my practice and I write prescriptions 20for pet medications daily. Some at the request of 21clients and some at the suggestion of the veterinarian. 22 Clients commonly request prescriptions for the 23parasite control medications with the expectation that 24the cost of these medications will be less from another 25source. Once again, free market forces have been very246 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551effective in the pricing of these medications within 2most veterinary practices as set based on the prices 3available through online outlets. 4 In our practice, clients are often surprised to 5find that the pricing in our hospital is slightly less 6than that available from online sources. The reality is 7that most practices set prices at, slightly above or 8slightly below the prices of online outlets with many 9practices matching the lowest price available online. This 10price parity exists because practices want 11to serve the needs of their clients and patients, but 12also because we want our clients to have the impression 13that we are fairly priced throughout the products and 14services that we offer. 15 Unlike eye care professionals, third-party 16payment for veterinary care is rarely available. 17Further, pet owners rarely budget for this care. For 18these reasons, virtually every veterinary visit includes 19two conversations: One about care, and another about 20cost. 21 Since many local pharmacies advertise the 22availability of low or no-cost medications for both pets 23and people, it is common for veterinarians to suggest 24that they write a prescription for a medication in order 25to help clients afford recommended diagnostics or247 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551treatment procedures. 2 If I have a patient with a fever of undetermined 3origin, I would rather write a prescription for a free 4antibiotic from a local grocery store or pharmacy and 5utilize the pet owner's funds to perform blood tests to 6learn more about the nature and severity of the 7underlying disease than dispense an antibiotic without 8being able to perform the tests. 9 The bottom line is that veterinarians help 10pet-owning consumers spend their money wisely every day. 11 Thank you. 12 MR. GILMAN: Thanks, Dr. Welborn. 13 Finally, and by no means least, we are glad to 14have Dr. Kent McClure, who is general counsel for 15the Animal Health Institute. The AHI represents 16research-based manufacturers of animal health products. 17 MR. McCLURE: Thank you. 18 I see my role here today, as we talked about 19leading up to this panel, as helping to identify some of 20the differences between the animal health products 21industry and the contact lens industry. A major 22difference is the scope and complexity. Unlike products 23intended for human use, animal health products are 24labeled for use across a wide variety of species and 25indications.248 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 Importantly, veterinarians may appropriately use 2them in a manner that differs from their approved 3labeling. They are regulated by three different Federal 4agencies, drugs and devices by FDA, biological products 5by USDA, and pesticides by the EPA. The intended species 6for these products may range from dogs and cats, livestocks 7and horses, to an extremely diverse range of minor species. 8There are many dosage forms, including oral, it 9could be liquid or solid, injectable, topical, pet food, 10aerosol, intranasal, or they may utilize sophisticated 11and specialized delivery devices. The intended uses for 12these products impact every conceivable animal system. 13 Contact lenses for human use represent a single 14subcategory of medical devices that are used topically on a 15single organ system primarily for vision correction. The 16distinction among soft contact lenses primarily involves 17differing plastic polymers and shape. It's our 18understanding that the Contact Lens Rule generally relates 19to the ability of a consumer to order standardized contact 20lenses that are dispensed for use in accordance with their 21labeling by a dispenser who must only be familiar with one 22species, and when it's not an eye care professional, they 23are essentially just matching the correct box to the correct 24person. 25 The scope and practice of companion animal249 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551medicine, however, is very large, includes the 2diagnosis, prevention, control and treatment of all 3animal diseases and conditions. In the course of such 4practice, most companion animal veterinary hospitals are 5analogous to human hospitals, providing inpatient, 6outpatient and emergency care, surgical, medical imaging 7and clinical laboratory services. In this context, a very 8wide variety of animal health products will be utilized for 9many different purposes. 10 On the other hand, according to the contact lens 11study, the interaction of eye care professionals with 12their patients relative to the fitting of contact 13lenses, is on an outpatient basis, and is typically 14limited to an examination of the eye to determine eye 15health, lens power and contact lens curvature and 16diameter. 17 With respect to pharmacists, they are an 18integral part of the delivery of human health care and 19their training is primarily oriented to human health. 20However, as we heard on several panels earlier today, 21pharmacists are not trained in the physiology and 22pharmacology of companion animals in a manner similar to 23veterinarians, and as such their participation in the 24delivery of veterinary health care has been limited. 25 In our industry, the veterinarian plays a250 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551critical role, matching the correct product with the 2correct patient is important for many products and 3extends beyond just prescription products to encompass 4other types of animal health products, particularly as 5veterinarians frequently and appropriately use them in a 6manner that differs from their approved labeling, such 7as treating a different species, using a different 8dosage regimen or a different indication for use. 9 In this environment, the veterinarian is the 10primary source of information about animal health 11products for pet owners. Veterinarians have typically 12counseled clients regarding the use of products, and 13many manufacturers have invested tremendous resources to 14educate veterinarians about their products. 15 Veterinarians also have ongoing close 16interaction with their clients and have been the primary 17monitors of patient use of medication, including 18evaluation for interactions in adverse events. These 19roles for the veterinarian are understandable due to 20their unique training. 21 As was mentioned earlier, products in one 22species may not be safe for another, combinations in one 23species may not be safe in another. Involvement of the 24veterinarian should not be discounted as many in our 25industry believe that the safety and efficacy profiles251 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551for many of their products are positively impacted by 2the comprehensive role of the veterinarian. 3 MR. GILMAN: Well, thank you. 4 So, we are going to hope to kick off a 5discussion here. I'm going to let my colleague, Joel 6Schrag, start things off. 7 MR. SCHRAG: Thank you very much, Dan, and I 8think these opening presentations have put a lot of 9issues out on the table that hopefully we will be able 10to address. 11 During the panel discussion, if any panelist in 12particular wants to respond to something that I raise, 13please raise your table tent, as Dr. Newman has already 14done, perhaps he anticipated my first question. 15 Dr. Newman, was there something specific from 16the opening presentations that you wanted to respond to? 17 DR. NEWMAN: Yes, there was. 18 MR. SCHRAG: Okay, why don't we take a minute, 19then, for that. 20 DR. NEWMAN: A couple of things. It was 21proffered to you all that this information that were in 22the three studies that I presented was somehow suspect 23and that's simply not the case. These are all published 24in peer-reviewed journals that went through vigorous 25vetting, and again, these numbers do say what they say.252 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 You said that there was an increase in eye exams 2and that's not true. Among those that purchased their 3lenses, three out of four don't have annual exams, 4whereas three out of four who purchased lenses from the 5provider do have annual exams. Okay. 6 MR. SCHRAG: If the moderator can break in, it 7sounds as though we maybe should start under the broad 8overarching question that people will have a reaction 9to, which is have consumers benefitted from the FCLCA, 10Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act, the associated 11Contact Lens Rule and the distribution changes that were 12brought about by the state attorneys general lawsuit. 13So, why don't we just open with a general round table on 14have consumers benefitted. 15 Dr. Newman? 16 DR. NEWMAN: I'm surprised to hear the data 17about the lens cost because I thought it went down, and 18see that's the neat thing about research is we can think 19whatever we want, but the data tells us otherwise, and 20provides us with inconvenient truths. 21 One other thing: We're not required to release 22every prescription. There are a lot of us that 23prescribe rigid contact lenses that are custom 24prescribed, and so those numbers are not ever going to 25be 100 percent on the surveys of whether we release253 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551prescriptions or not. 2 But if you say that, I mean, I think that 3patients have their prescriptions, but if the cost isn't 4going down, and we're seeing morbidity that's isolated 5on a multivariate analysis to this particular group that 6purchase lenses from alternative distribution channels, 7have we helped the public or not? That's a good 8question. 9 MR. SCHRAG: Well, thank you for your comment. 10 Why don't we just move down the line. First, 11Joe Zeidner, please. 12 MR. ZEIDNER: Thank you. I know from our point 13of view, the passage of a law, we did a test in Texas 14and in California. In California, people were able to 15purchase through passive verification. There was a law 16that passed in California before the Federal law passed, 17and passive verification means you don't have to get a 18copy of your prescription from your doctor, that the 19seller will contact the doctor and verify if the 20information is correct. Then the doctor can choose if 21he wants to get back to us or not. If there's a 22problem, we hope he gets back to us and lets us know. 23 In Texas, we had an agreement with the Texas 24Optometric Association, and they said that if we would 25agree to wait to get a copy of the prescription, they254 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551would make sure that all the doctors gave us a copy of 2the prescription when we requested. They didn't. There 3are over 60,000 complaints filed with the Texas Optometric 4Board and they said, we're sorry, we told our doctors to. 5So, there is definitely a problem. 6 When you said that all doctors profit from their 7recommendations, it's very interesting, because I 8thought that was a kickback. And I know that if you 9recommend someone to go down to get an MRI, you're not 10allowed to profit from that. But even if that were 11correct, and it's not. 12 DR. NEWMAN: It is correct. 13 MR. ZEIDNER: You get paid for a recommendation 14when you do a contact lens fitting. That is your 15payment for the exam. Paying for a product is something 16separate. You weren't there during the hearings when 17the bill was first heard by Congress, but the 18optometrists were asked if they would rather have a bill 19that said you don't sell what you prescribe, because 20that would definitely fix it. There wouldn't be any 21conflict of interest, and there was, and AOA said, no, 22actually we would rather have the FCLCA, they signed on 23to support it. So, I don't know at this point what the 24difference is. 25 DR. NEWMAN: I'm not speaking against that.255 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551What I'm saying is that when a surgeon recommends a 2surgery, there is still a profit motive in place and 3there are a lot of people, in fact there was a whole 4thing, a whole study about this just released recently 5about this whole health care paradigm being a 6fee-for-service. You know, we don't want you to die, we 7don't want you to get well, we need a whole new system. 8 MR. ZEIDNER: But they don't sell prescriptions 9to the people. 10 DR. NEWMAN: Well, let's take an example. 11Ophthalmologist says you need cataract surgery. Well, 12the intraocular lens comes in a box, it's packaged in a 13commodity way. Why are we not requiring the 14ophthalmologist to allow the patient to shop for their 15intraocular lens before they have their cataract 16surgery? Heart stents are the same way. This notion that 17because it's packaged and can be put at the front desk 18of a Walmart or Walgreens for sale somehow changes 19the ethics of the whole thing is not true. 20 That was my point, is that we have an ethical 21construct to prescribe and to dispense products, whether 22they're eyeglasses, contact lenses or whatever, in an 23ethical manner, just like the veterinarians do, and just 24like general physicians do, just like dentists do. 25There's really no distinction.256 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 What I objected to was the false distinction 2that we are somehow different from everybody else, and 3we're not. That's what the point I was trying to make. 4 MR. SCHRAG: So, now maybe Bob Hubbard would 5like to react. 6 MR. HUBBARD: Yeah. No, I mean, this really 7does bring back memories for me and I remember when the 8testimony on the legislation was going on, similar 9fights were going on, and I was sort of sitting in the 10middle, and I tried to represent consumers as best I 11can. 12 So, I want to give as many alternatives as I can 13to consumers, and the portability of the prescription is 14one thing that that does. If there is an adverse health 15consequence, that's something that the regulatory system 16should address, and that should be discussed with 17evidence, and we should go forward from there. 18 So, I think that the better alternatives 19available to consumers are what's better, and in terms 20of like if everything is broken, so let's not fix what 21we can see that's broken, I've never particularly liked 22that idea. When people come in and say that everybody 23in the industry is doing it, I say, I'm open to evidence 24about your competitors. I'm willing to name them as a 25defendant, also, if you'd like.257 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 So, from my perspective, if the financial 2incentives are screwed up, and if there's a potential 3for abuse of power over the prescription, we ought to 4fix that. If there are problems elsewhere, then we can 5address those problems when they're articulated and we 6can go forward from there. 7 MR. SCHRAG: Rob Atkinson I believe wanted to 8weigh in. 9 MR. ATKINSON: Yeah, just a couple of things. 10On the claim that, again, one of the studies that AOA 11cites is this Optometry Journal study. I wouldn't call 12that a peer-reviewed study. This is a journal for the 13industry by the industry that accepted an article that 14said everything is fine and if you get your lenses 15online, you're going to have eye health issues. 16 So, I think before we make any claims about the 17health studies, we really need independent, objective 18experts to review the studies that have been put 19forward. Because I can just tell you from a statistical 20point of view, there are serious problems in at least 21one of them. 22 The second point about this is we need to 23understand risk. So, again, if you read the Australian 24study, the risk is very, very low. So, without 25stipulating that there's any risk, because who knows,258 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551the study could be right, could be wrong, it looks like 2there are some problems, but we don't know. That's the 3key point, we don't know. 4 But let's just say hypothetically there is a 5risk of instead of one in 10,000 it goes to one in 68,000, but at the same time, consumers have saved $8 7billion. Is that worth it? Any federal cost benefit 8analysis would tell you that is definitely worth it. 9 So, the notion that there may be risk, and 10again, I don't claim that there is, we don't know if 11there's any risk. To say that that is the objective 12standard for whether this is a good thing or a bad 13thing, you cannot look at risk without looking at 14benefit. 15 Now, to get to the benefit point, just a couple 16of points on James' study. One of the things that James 17did is he looked at basically the control group in his 18study was online sellers. So, he looked at the ratio of 19the changes with a various group of different sellers -- 20ECPs, Walmarts of the world to online -- and saw that it 21didn't change. As I noted, I think there's one problem, 22which is that both that first year and the last year were 23problematic years, and I'll bet if the study were done 24again, we would have seen something different. 25 Secondly, that doesn't tell you very much,259 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551because what if competition, because of the law, forced 2the 1-800s of the world to reduce their prices even 3more, and as a result optometrists had to just keep up. 4Well, that would be a huge consumer benefit, and you 5can't tell which of those is right from the study. 6 Last point, one of the nice things that James' 7study -- if you read it, I encourage you to read it -- he 8does state, \"offline sellers clearly offer the highest 9prices in distribution, the 25 highest priced stores are 10independent ECPs.\" Everybody knows who studies it, ECPs 11have the highest prices, but what's interesting is if 12you look in the last ten years, the share of sales 13online has doubled, which means by definition, consumers 14have saved an enormous amount of money, and you would 15expect that share to keep going up as more people have 16broadband. 17 So, just by definition, even if the people who 18keep going to their optometrist to buy lenses, let's 19just say there hasn't been a price change, which I don't 20agree with, all the people who switched over to online 21have had big benefits, and that's a benefit that we 22can't just dismiss out of hand. 23 MR. SCHRAG: Thank you. 24 James, did you want to comment? 25 MR. COOPER: I have to. Anyway, I would just260 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551say that I think Rob and I actually agree in general. I 2mean, again, I went into this online, off, looking at 3the 2004 to 2007 comparison, completely agnostic, not to 4prove a point one way or the other, just what happened. 5We did this, let's see what happened to the prices. I 6think I do a pretty good study. 7 Again the caveat with the 2004, I admit that, I 8wish we could go back in time, but I didn't have RAs or 9anyone in the FTC willing to collect data for me until 10the fall of 2004. So, again, the Contact Lens Rule is 11what was the triggering event and that went into effect 12in October or September of 2004, and we collected data 13starting in October. 14 So, we did miss a month. I'm doubtful that all 15the price change, if there were increased competition, 16occurred in that one month. We came back three-and-a-half 17years later with the exact same lenses, exact same 18eye care practitioners. So it's a matched sample from 19both. 20 So, I think to the extent, given the caveats, 21the data is pretty well done. With respect to the 2007 22end date, I know this is kind of getting into the weeds, 23but the Proclear compatible. Number one, the 24econometrics I use, I have what's called a 25lens-specific, it's fixed effects. So, I have a little261 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551dummy variable that takes into account any idiosyncratic 2effect of any lens. So, Proclear wouldn't be driving 3the effects. Number two, Proclear is a tiny share 4anyway. So, the 2007 end date is not likely to make an 5effect, but again, I will completely own the caveat of 6the 2004, I don't try to hide it. Read the paper. Go 7to SSRN and download it, so I can up my downloads. 8 But I guess what I would say is again, back to 9agreeing with Rob, is that my punchline here isn't the 10prescription release requirement was bad, you need to know 11the cost side of this, too. I mean, more choice is 12unambiguously good, even if consumers don't use it. 13 So, let's say that my results suggest that, 14well, to get this, but we're not seeing a huge effect, 15they're not using this choice. But we have to know the 16cost. And that's something I don't pretend to know. 17 We've heard debate back and forth here on the 18panel of whether the study suggests that there are costs 19to this, or there are not, but I would not want these 20findings to suggest that the contact lens prescription 21release requirement was a bad thing and I think talking 22about in the pet meds context, I think we would also have 23to know the costs and benefits. I mean, there are 24likely benefits from release, you get more choice. More 25choice I think is unambiguously good, but at the same262 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551time, there could be costs to that. 2 If, as Rob has pointed out, back to the contact 3lens, if the costs were minuscule and increased the risk 4of this micro -- this eye disease, compare that to what 5consumers may have saved, then I think that that cost 6benefit analysis, if those numbers are right, stand up, 7but again, I don't pretend to know the other side of the 8equation here. 9 MR. SCHRAG: Thank you. 10 So, I see that Kent McClure and Dr. Newman and 11Joe Zeidner all have their tents up. I would like to 12just ask that I think it would be useful for us to add a 13little bit more color to exactly how the distribution and 14retailing of contacts has changed since the promulgation 15of the Contact Lens Rule. 16 So, we've heard a lot about some of the 17potential benefits and costs to consumers, I think it 18would be useful to hear more about how things have 19changed and the degree to which that can be tied to the 20Contact Lens Rule as opposed to other things that were 21happening in the marketplace. 22 I want to give Kent McClure a chance to weigh 23in. 24 MR. McCLURE: I will let you get to that in just a 25second, I just want to make a couple of points, because263 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551in listening to this discussion, I can tell you that our 2industry is about providing useful tools that can be 3used by veterinarians in the delivery of health care. A 4cost benefit analysis for us to say, well, gee, we only 5had a little bit of increase in adverse events, but we 6saved some money, those aren't the types of analysis 7that are important to veterinary practitioners. We're 8about providing patient care, not worrying about just, oh, 9there's only a small amount of the increase of adverse 10events that could be prevented. 11 The other part of this that I heard that I 12wanted to comment on is there's a lot of touting of the 13online outlet for these products. To contrast that with 14the pharmaceutical world or the animal health products 15world, concurrent with the planning and preparation for 16this workshop, the Food and Drug Administration has 17undertaken a consumer awareness program warning them 18that approximately 97 percent of online pharmacies don't 19comply with state or federal law. 20 So, it's not like this is just an innocuous 21alternative way to provide product to the consumer, and 22there's just a lot of differences, I think, in a very 23standardized product that's being dispensed versus 24products being used in a myriad of different ways. 25 MR. SCHRAG: Thank you, Mr. McClure.264 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 Dr. Newman? 2 DR. NEWMAN: Just a couple of things, I don't 3want to get off in a ditch on this thing, but the 4Journal of the American Optometric Association is a 5peer-reviewed journal, all three of these articles were 6written by academics, reviewed by academics and 7corrected by academics, and the comment that this is 8a very rare finding and that a four, almost five times 9increase among this one group that has been controlled 10in multivariate analysis, I think is a disservice to the 11public when we're bean counting relative to the cost 12savings. 13 Ford bean counters did that with the Pinto and 14it didn't work. If your kid was one of the 13 percent 15that had permanent vision loss associated with microbial 16keratitis, how many billions of dollars would you be 17willing to trade for that? It ain't rare if it's in 18your chair. Yes, these are not widespread events, but 19they're catastrophic events when they do occur. 20 MR. SCHRAG: Thank you, Dr. Newman. 21 Joe Zeidner? 22 MR. ZEIDNER: Yeah. Just to answer your 23question about how things have changed, I have a slide, 24a couple of slides I was going to add to my presentation 25but ran out of time, but it talks a little bit about the265 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551price comparison in today's dollars, and since we sell 2more contact lenses than anyone, it might be 3instructive, but really, prices have gone down quite a 4bit. 5 If you want to put it up, just for an example, 6the most popular, Acuvue 2 in 2004 in the FTC study was 7$19.95, our price to consumers. In constant dollars in 82012, it's now $24.83. Our current pricing is $18.99 or 9$20.99 if you buy just one box. So, prices have 10definitely gone down. 11 The most important area, I think, is in 2003, as 12indicated in our product brochure, we sold 37 different 13brands and types of disposable lenses. Today there are 1491 different types and brands, and there has been a lot 15of manufacturer research and development. There's all 16kinds of new polymers, more safe polymers that people 17can sleep in, silicon hydrogels that are more 18comfortable and have a higher oxygen permeability, and 19that's what happens in the competitive marketplace when 20manufacturers have to market the products based on what 21the products do instead of who sells it. So, we think 22that there have been some very big differences. 23 MR. SCHRAG: Thank you. 24 DR. NEWMAN: One quick comment? 25 MR. SCHRAG: Yes, Dr. Newman?266 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 DR. NEWMAN: Yes, real quick. That may be true 2that you guys are selling a lot more lenses, but a lot 3of that owes to the fact that a lot of those lenses 4weren't available when the Lens Act first came up. 5 One other point is in the Stapleton study, there 6was no difference in the rates of problems with the 7silicon hydrogels versus the regular hydrogels. 8 MR. ZEIDNER: No, I think that's why there are 9more lenses, because of the act, and that's right. They 10did not exist then, and I believe it's because of the 11competition that we have more now. 12 MR. GILMAN: Thank you. 13 We're having a very useful discussion, I would 14like to make time for a couple of the questions that 15we've gotten from the audience. One of them from a 16couple of sources really sort of has two components, and 17I think points both to similarities and differences 18here. 19 It's a question both about the full range of 20pharmaceutical products that might be prescribed to 21non-human animals, to pets, but also highlights, I 22think, and how much more complex maybe that is than the 23contact lens issue, but we talk not just about 24prescription release here, but about restrictions on 25distribution, and the question also asks whether we267 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551would really want the same treatment for EPA-regulated 2products, for over-the-counter products. 3 So, I guess I would like to ask panelists, now I 4know we have a very few vets here, but we do have 5veterinarian representation on the panel, and I guess if 6we could circle back, I would like to ask whether, on 7behalf of some others, whether that might be a decent 8fit and whether we can think of a good medical or 9business reasons for restrictions on distribution, not 10on the full range of animal medicines, but for 11EPA-regulated, over-the-counter products. 12 Dr. Welborn? 13 DR. WELBORN: I'll weigh in on that. Actually, 14this was a subject that I wanted to bring up, based on 15some of the comments that Mr. Zeidner made. He 16mentioned that there were 60,000 complaints to the Texas 17Optometric Board about individuals' eye care 18professionals that were not releasing prescriptions, and 19my question was, how many complaints have been received 20from consumers about veterinarians not releasing 21prescriptions, but that's sort of the corollary. The 22number that sort of struck me that's somewhere close to 2360,000 was 44,000, that was the number of complaints 24that the EPA received in one year related to consumer 25concerns about adverse events related to268 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551over-the-counter flea and tick control products that at 2one point in time were distributed predominantly through 3veterinarians, and now are to a large degree distributed 4through other outlets. 5 One questions whether or not that number of 6complaints about side effects for those medications 7would have occurred had those products been continued to 8be distributed predominantly through veterinarians. The 9most common adverse event was related to applying a dog 10product on a cat, which can be life-threatening for 11cats. That is very unlikely to happen if the 12veterinarian is dispensing the product because the 13instruction on the use of the product is fairly 14straightforward in that regard, whereas if it's 15purchased from another outlet, there's typically no 16guidance in the use of the product at all. 17 MR. GILMAN: Doctor, can I ask just a follow-up 18question? I mean, one thing we know from the human side 19is that highly trained professionals -- for instance in a 20hospital setting, physicians, pharmacists, nurses -- 21dispensing human medicines all within the building have 22certain incidents -- maybe some find it alarming; the 23Institute of Medicine has found it alarming -- of 24medication errors leading to serious adverse events. 25 I guess that raises the question, these all seem269 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551to be serious safety concerns we might have about one or 2another channel of distribution, but I guess one 3question I would ask is how good is the information, how 4good are the data, what do we really know about the 5incidence of adverse events or medication errors 6associated with sort of the traditional what's sometimes 7called ethical channel of distribution? 8 DR. WELBORN: All right. I don't think I have 9any numbers about the adverse events that are occurring. 10I think one difference relative to veterinary medicine 11from human medicine is that veterinarians and their 12staff members spend a lot more time with their clients, 13with pet owners. I mean, the reality is that we have 14the luxury to do that. We are not nearly as busy as 15human health care providers. We don't have the same 16time pressures to be able to move patients through the 17system as quickly as those pressures that occur in the 18human health care system. 19 So, I think that type of thing is much less 20likely to occur in the veterinary field because we 21simply have more time to spend with our patients and our 22clients. 23 MR. GILMAN: One more question from the 24audience, this is written for one of our participants, 25but I think I would like to pose it to the panel or at270 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551least to Dr. Newman, to James Cooper and to Rob 2Atkinson. Sometimes we have the data we have, and we 3make do, when we can treat it more carefully or less 4carefully. 5 I think one of the things we have seen in the 6discussion here is that both with regard to optical 7goods and with regard to pet medicines, that sometimes 8we don't have all the data that we would like to have. 9So, we have an Australian study, it's not completely 10different, but it does raise the question, what do we 11know about risk in the United States, and parsing 12different categories of alternative vendors, so to 13translate into the pet medicine space, would we treat 14Drs. Foster & Smith the same, lump them for data purposes 15in with bogus websites where there are no pharmacists or 16vets or checking for prescriptions? A study asking, for 17instance, 151 Brooklyn college students what their habits 18are for return check-ups, where they have to do regression 19analysis on insignificant correlations might not be ideal. 20 James has an extensive discussion in his paper 21on limitations on his data, I guess I just ask all of 22you if there are some key data you would like to have 23and key studies you would like to see done that would 24both or either teach us more about the effects of the 25Contact Lens Rule or about what we want, should want to271 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551know for considering policy interventions in the 2veterinary space. 3 Dr. Newman? 4 DR. NEWMAN: First off to address the 5differences between Australia and the United States. In 6Dr. Stapleton's paper, she addresses that up front. 7There are several large-scale epidemiological studies 8regarding the incidence of this one thing that we focus 9on, microbial keratitis, which is the worst of things 10that can happen with contact lenses, but there are a 11whole bunch of other minor complications that can happen 12across the board, and I would like to see data done on 13those elements relative to the mode of distribution and 14controlled well in multivariate analysis. 15 In the Stapleton study, her data was very, very 16consistent and correlated very well with the Poggio and 17Schein studies relative to the risk of microbial 18keratitis. So, the inference from that was that things 19are not that different in Australia versus the United 20States. 21 So, I think we can compare those studies, but it 22would be nice to see that exact same study done in the 23United States as well. I would like to see the same 24type of multivariate analysis that parses out these 25defects in large scale studies done for not only272 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551microbial keratitis, but also for some of the minor 2complications that we see in eye care. 3 MR. GILMAN: James? 4 MR. COOPER: First I would like to have a time 5machine and go back to, say, August of 2004. So, that's 6wish number one. But leaving us and staying in the 7realm of reality, I think one thing that's unclear, my 8results suggest that I have to look indirectly. I'm 9looking at competition, so I'm looking at price. The 10price gap between online and offline, but it would be 11interesting to have direct evidence on kind of 12microdata, what are consumers actually doing at 13prescribers, have a sample of prescribers that you 14follow the prices they're charging. 15 One thing I can't rule out is I don't find an 16effect. I kind of assume that there's a law and people 17are following it, but listening to this panel, it sounds 18like maybe some people aren't. So, maybe the no effect 19is because eye doctors aren't giving away their 20prescriptions. I can't rule that out, that would be a 21piece of data that would be interesting to know to what 22extent is the choice to stick with your prescriber one 23you already have it in your hands and you just decide to 24stay there. 25 One of my hypotheses and a possible explanation273 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551for this data is this thing called ordered search that I 2never really got to, but if you're going to search in a 3predetermined order, and everybody knows that. So, the 4eye doctor knows that he is going to give you the 5prescription and he also sells the lens that he 6prescribes, he is going to be the first draw in your 7price distribution. 8 So, if you're going to search for prices, he 9knows he's always going to be, he or she knows 10that they are always going to be first. Knowing that, and 11knowing that search is expensive, even if I want to go 12somewhere else and look on 1-800-Contacts, or go and 13check with Walmart, it costs something. It's not free. 14So, that allows that first person in the queue of search 15to extract a premium. Maybe that explains this 16persistent prescriber premium we see, or at least some 17extent of it. 18 One thing that would be interesting, and this 19came in the conversations I had with Dan and Joel 20leading up to this conference, is nowadays we all have 21one of these (cell phone in hand) , right, so my doctor says 22I'm going to give you Acuvue 2, and you can pick it up in 23the lobby. Okay, well how much is it? Hold on, let me 24check 1-800-Contacts. I say it half jokingly, but there's 25a large literature on how online and offline, how having274 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551price search engines has perhaps reduced search costs 2and led to more competition among sellers. I mean, here 3you go, you can find prices. 4 DR. NEWMAN: Practically, that's true. I have a 5large-scale long sample of one doctor over years. There 6is no question that I am not that first in the chain. 7In this day and age. Maybe ten years ago, I was the 8first guy in that distribution chain. Now, practically 9every patient I come in contact with already knows how 10much they're selling them for, Coastal and Walmart and 11Costco, when they walk into my office. So, I'm usually 12like the fifth guy in the chain. 13 MR. COOPER: And I guess that's assuming that 14they already know what you're going to prescribe. Are 15these return customers in the sense that they have been 16wearing Acuvue forever? 17 DR. NEWMAN: Most of them, yeah, most of them 18are already wearing them. 19 MR. COOPER: And I think that's going back to 20the data, the sort of fine data to figure out. Because 21there are different incentives with respect to each 22consumer. 23 DR. NEWMAN: One way you could parse that out is 24look at neophyte wearers versus existing wearers, 25because the doctor is almost always the first guy in the275 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551chain. 2 MR. COOPER: And you're exactly right, that's a 3way to tease out that ordered search effect. 4 Let me say one more thing and then I'll shut up, 5but you gave me the floor to talk about the data I want. 6The last thing, this is a theory that let's say that 7there's this lock-in. Let's say that it's right, that 8you can still take advantage, that the eye docs can 9still take advantage of their consumers by locking in, 10they'll say limited distribution lenses or somehow get a 11premium out of that. There's a theory that, well, since 12you're bundling the eye care exam with the lens, the eye 13care, there is a lot of competition to write 14prescriptions. 15 So, if you know once you get a customer in the 16door to write a prescription, you're going to be able to 17screw them over with the high price at the end. Well, 18there's going to be competition up front to get that 19after-market lock-in. 20 So, that leads to a slight inefficiency, a 21distribution inefficiency or allocation inefficiency 22between the price. So, what happens is the price of the 23exam gets driven down below the competitive level, to 24compensate for the price of the lens being above the 25competitive level.276 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 It would be interesting to see, again, I didn't 2have the resources or the ability to get prices of eye 3exams in 2004, and then go back in 2007, but that's, 4again, a theory that would be very interesting to test. 5It may be ripe in the pet meds area as I understand the 6legal landscape is there's a lot of state variation in 7laws, and there's also no federal law at the time. So, 8you could take advantage of that state variation to do a 9much more rich econometrics potentially to look at how 10states vary and you could maybe get vet exam prices in 11different states with different legal regimes. So, 12I'll be quiet now. 13 DR. NEWMAN: One quick comment. 14 MR. GILMAN: Actually, I'm sorry to interrupt, 15but I do want to give Rob Atkinson a chance in case he 16has some thoughts on this. 17 MR. ATKINSON: Just a couple of quick thoughts. 18I actually think that Dr. Newman made my case for me, 19which is that consumers now are coming in and saying 20here's what I can buy, the repeat consumers coming in, I 21can get it from this price and they're demanding and 22expecting that price in return. That to me is an 23unalloyed, direct consumer benefit from having more 24competition from prescription release. 25 I think one of the interesting things that a277 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551couple of people have alluded to in the studies, which 2don't ask, is online really a gross measure? 3Online from Fred the gas station who happens to run a 4little website or online from 1-800-Contacts or online 5from your eye care provider. Nobody asked that 6question. 7 So, that's my other question. If online is so 8bad, why do optometrists run websites? You can buy from 9many optometrists, you can go and get your lenses from 10their website. If online is really the problem, where 11it's leading to ocular health, then why are optometrists 12even prescribing online? So, I think that would be 13useful to put in a study. 14 The other thing I think we need is we need, if I 15were ever king, my first rule would be Congress would 16create the Office of the Federal Statistician, and we 17would send these studies to the Office of the Federal 18Statistician and they would say, these are legitimate 19studies. Simply saying they're multivariate, if you 20know statistics, is essentially saying they're a study. 21I mean, that's a meaningless term. It could be a good 22multivariate study and it could be a bad multivariate 23study. When I took Ph.D. statistics, you learned that 24pretty early in the first couple of classes. 25 So, I think what we really need if we're going278 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551to look at these health effects, we need a legitimate 2objective understanding from people who understand 3rigorous statistics and research methods to look at 4these studies and say they stand up or not, because 5right now we don't really have that. 6 MR. GILMAN: And only inside the beltway can we 7find people who can honestly say that would be their 8first act as king. 9 MR. ATKINSON: I readily admit that. 10 MR. GILMAN: So, I do want to get to Joe Zeidner 11and Dr. Newman before we turn things over for the 12conclusion. 13 MR. ZEIDNER: Yeah, I think one really good 14study that we would like to see done deals with 15prescription release. We know that the FTC found that 16that was a problem with the Eyeglass Rule after the 17Eyeglass Rule was passed. It's been a problem with the 18Contact Lens Rule, even as late as 2007, by admission of 19doctors. 20 We believe that there has been a lot of scrutiny 21of our industry, and we have had a lot of complaints to 22deal with, and we have talked with FTC, Congressmen, 23optometrists. But there has not been a study done on 24whether or not optometrists are releasing prescriptions, 25which could account for some of the lack of data in your279 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551study, James, and we think that that would be something 2that would be a good follow-up is to see if doctors 3really are releasing prescriptions. 4 MR. GILMAN: Thanks, Joe. 5 Dr. Newman? 6 DR. NEWMAN: A couple of comments. I don't 7think that's the problem. Sure, we could do that study. 8The state boards hammer anybody that gets a complaint, 9and so if a patient is not getting a prescription, they 10complain to the state board and they get hammered almost 11immediately. So, I think it's a pretty good -- 12 MR. ZEIDNER: Not in Texas. 13 DR. NEWMAN: Yeah, in Texas. 14 MR. ZEIDNER: No, not with the 60,000 15complaints. 16 DR. NEWMAN: Okay, that happened before the act 17was passed. Don't conflate that. 18 MR. ZEIDNER: That's why the act was passed. 19 DR. NEWMAN: Don't conflate that with what's 20happened since the act passed. 21 MR. ZEIDNER: But they didn't give prescriptions 22when the board told them they were going to. 23 DR. NEWMAN: Okay. Last point. With regard to 24the allocation of access between exams and lens cost, 25and I think the vets in this room would agree with me.280 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551There's an old poker adage that you can sheer a sheep many 2times but only skin them once, and we find that out very 3quickly in private practice. Whether we're talking 4about Medicare, with Physician Compare that's coming 5online, comparing the quality outcomes and costs, this 6is something that's huge in the health care reform 7industry, it's something that we're all feeling 8pressures, whether you're a physician, an optometrist, a 9podiatrist or a doctor of veterinary medicine. If you 10don't toe those lines, then you're going to be out of the 11system, and I think that's something that would factor 12into the cost analysis between exams and lenses. 13 MR. ATKINSON: You shouldn't forget, by the way, 14that in 2007 there was a study done by your professional 15association that says that half their doctors don't 16release their prescription. That to me is pretty 17obvious that there's a potential problem. It may not be 18a problem, there may be a reason, but the fact that half 19report they don't give a prescription. 20 DR. NEWMAN: Well, I mean we need to look at 21that data with your statistician, as we go down the 22line, but it is something that's worth looking at. 23Again, you'll never have 100 percent on contact lens 24prescription release because we're not required to 25release every contact lens prescription.281 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 MR. GILMAN: Thank you. 2 So, I think this has been an excellent and 3animated discussion, and I would like to thank all our 4panelists for participating, and I would also, we can 5see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I would like 6to turn the floor over to Andy Gavil, the director of 7the FTC's Office of Policy Planning, for some wrap-up 8and concluding remarks. 9 (Applause.) 10 MR. GAVIL: Fear not, they are really brief. 11Thank you all for joining us. Obviously we've had a 12very informative and thought-provoking day. We would 13especially like to thank our many panelists who shared 14their thoughts with us on a range of important issues 15affecting the pet medications industry and the millions 16of American pet-owning consumers. 17 Obviously today's panels have left us with a lot 18to chew on in the coming months and a number of ideas 19have been identified that might warrant further research 20and study, and I look forward to working with our staff 21to digest all that we have learned. 22 A few closing points. All slides presented by 23our speakers today will be posted on the pet meds 24workshop webpage. In addition, there will be an 25archived webcast of today's proceeding and a complete282 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551transcript will be forthcoming in the near future, also 2on the webpage. 3 Also, just a reminder that the Commission has 4extended the public comment period to November 1st, so 5please feel free to submit any additional comments or 6responses to today's presentations and discussion. 7 In closing, I would like to thank all of the 8members of the Pet Meds Workshop team, especially our 9panel moderators and co-moderators who have worked very 10hard to prepare for and conduct today's workshop. From 11the Office of Policy Planning: Dan Gilman, Economics: 14Joel Schrag; and from the Bureau of Competition: Kelly 15Signs, Erin Flynn and Lauren Rine. 16 A special thanks to Stephanie Wilkinson from 17OPP, who spear-headed our efforts, kept us focused and 18moving forward, as always with good cheer. Well done. 19It's over, Stephanie, where are you? There she is. 20 (Applause.) 21 MR. GAVIL: And our appreciation to the Office 22of Public Affairs for help with publicity and social 23media, and the staff of the Office of the Executive 24Director for event planning and technical support. Yes, 25it takes a village to put on a workshop.283 For The Record, Inc. (301) 870- 8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921- 55551 Finally, I would like to thank Chairman 2Leibowitz for joining us this morning and for the 3support of his office. For those of you who have been 4obediently sitting and staying as he requested, you are 5now released, but please do heel as you leave the 6building. As a relative newcomer to the Commission, I 7feel reassured by his participation today that we haven't 8been barking up the wrong tree, which might have landed 9me in the doghouse. Yes, I couldn't resist. Thank you 10all for joining us, bye-bye. 11 (Applause.) 12 (Whereupon, at 4:38 p.m., the workshop was 13concluded.) 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25284 For The Record, Inc.
