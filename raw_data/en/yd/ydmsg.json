The aim of these reports is to provide the toxicological background to the Committees' deci-sions for the concerned professional. Those seeking further information on a particular subject can obtain relevantreferences from the Committee's administrative secretary. Members of the COT, COM and COC are appointed by the Chief Medical Officer (CMO). The Committees advise the CMO and, through the CMO, the Government. Committee members are appointed as independent scientific and medical experts on the basis of their special skills and knowledge. They are appointed for fixed time periods, generally three years, and are eligible for reappointmentat the end of their terms. The terms of reference are at Annex 1. The report also contains the commercial interests of committee members. Members are required to declare any commercial interests on appointment and, again, during meetings if a topic arises in which they have an interest. If a member declares a specific interest in a topic under discussion, he or she may, at the Chairman's discretion, beallowed to take part in the discussion, but they are excluded from decision making. Guidance on this is at Annex 2. The report contains, at Annex 4, an alphabetical index to subjects and substances considered in previous reports. A second index, at Annex 5, contains details of the subjects on which the COT has given advice since 1988 as part ofits consideration of the results of surveillance for chemicals in the UK diet. These considerations were publishedformerly in the Food Surveillance Papers which report this surveillance work, rather than in the Committee's annualreports. The usual way in which committee reviews are conducted is that the relevant Secretariat critically assesses all the relevant data and prepares papers for the committee. These normally consist of appendices giving detailed sum-maries of the studies reviewed - methodology and results - and a covering paper in which the available data arebriefly summarised, the most important points highlighted and recommendations presented for discussion by theCommittee. Although original study reports are not routinely circulated to members, they are made available onrequest and are circulated if the study is particularly complex. Definitive summaries are necessary because docu-mentation on any one chemical can amount to many hundreds of pages. The Committees cannot undertake toreview information provided by individuals, industry or other organisations that has not been forwarded through,or discussed with, the appropriate Secretariat. Many of the reviews conducted by the Committees are done so at the request of other Government Departments and the Committee Secretariats liaise closely with colleagues in these Departments. The Committees offer adviceindependent of each other in their area of expertise but will, if need be, work closely together. This is helped by theclose working relationship of the Secretariats. If, for example, during a review of a particular chemical by the COT,it becomes clear that there is need for expert advice on mutagenicity or carcinogenicity aspects, it will be referredto COM or COC as appropriate. These three Committees also provide expert advice to other advisory committees,such as the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes and the Food Advisory Committee. There are alsolinks with the Veterinary Products Committee and the Advisory Committee on Pesticides.About the Committees 374513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 3During 1999 the CMO announced changes to the procedures of the three Committees. These changes will result in greater openness of committee business and include the publication of agendas, finalised minutes, agreed con-clusions and statements. It was also announced that some meetings could be open to members of interest groups,consumer organisations and professional societies to attend. The first of these meetings was held during Februaryin Bath. More information on the changes can be found in a paper at Annex 7. 4 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 4Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food,Consumer Productsand the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 5Preface In keeping with the experience in previous years, the Committee has been fully engaged in the consideration of a wide range of toxicological problems. Whereas these aredescribed in detail in the text, consideration of the topics points to a number of generalmatters which are important to the overall function of the Committee. Together with its sister Committees, the COT has adopted new principles of working in order to increase openness, it is our intention to further increase the degree of openness,through a process of evolution. During the year we held an Open Meeting to discussmathematical modelling in toxicology. This brought together a number of experts andprovided a forum for discussion which will inform future methodology applied to toxi-cological assessment in man. The section on the toxicology of breast implants illustrates how the Committee can act rapidly to provide an opinion. The rapidity of response is dependent upon the willingness of members of the Committee to act at shortnotice and also upon our being able to call upon a wide range of toxicological expertise from within the member-ship of the Committee. During the year two Working Groups were meeting, one considering Food Intolerance and the other Organophosphates. The Report on Organophosphates was published in November 1999 and provided the basis fordiscussion of this topic by other Committees which advise Ministers in relation to policy so far as Organophosphatesare concerned. It is the intention to publish the Food Intolerance report in the year 2000. The report contains information on our consideration of the toxicology of a group of novel molecules (the Salatrims). This work underlines the importance of there being well-conducted human studies which inform theformulation of advice about the inclusion of novel foods within the human diet. A further important general point was raised by our consideration of potatoes genetically modified to produce Galanthus nivalis lectins. During the assessment of genetically modified foods, considerable stress has rightly been laid upon the possible adverse effects of the genetic modification itself. The work on lectins described in the reportunderlines the fact that there exists the possibility of \"downstream\" effects of genetic modification upon the abilityof an organism to produce toxic compounds. This Committee, together with others, are very much aware of theimportance of this type of assessment of genetically modifies organisms. As in previous years, we have been very well served by the Secretariat who have continued to ensure the smooth running of Committee proceedings and have provided working documents of the highest quality.

It is intended for use in a wide range of food products. A case of need for alitame was agreed by the Food AdvisoryCommittee in 1988. 1.2 Alitame was initially considered by the Committee in 1989. A full submission of toxicological data was made, this included repeat dose studies of up to 2 years duration in rats and mice and 18 months duration in dogs, a 2-generation toxicity in rats, studies of foetotoxicity in rats and rabbits and in vitro genotoxicity studies. A tolerance study in human volunteers was also submitted. Alitame decomposes into a /c523-isomer both on storage and in vivo and additional toxicity data were provided on this compound. 1.3 Additional data were submitted to the COT during the period 1990-1994 and in 1998, both in response to requests made by the Committee and as a result of requests made to the company by other regulatory bodies. Atthe request of the company, consideration of alitame by the COT was suspended from 1994 until 1997 when con-sideration of the compound by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives was completed. 1.4 After consideration of all the data submitted during the period 1989-1998 an Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.3 mg/kg bw per day was established. This was derived as follows: a significant elevation in liver weights was found inthe dogs treated with 500 mg/kg bw per day alitame for 18 months. The Committee considered that there was asuggestion that liver weights were also elevated in male dogs receiving the next lowest dose (100 mg/kg bw per day).Whilst this elevation in liver weights was not statistically significant, the Committee considered that this findingwas sufficiently unusual that it would be prudent to regard this as a LOAEL. Consequently, the NOAEL derivedfor alitame was 30 mg/kg bw per day, the lowest dose tested. Uncertainty factors of 10 for interspecies and 10 forintra-individual variability were then applied, resulting in an Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.3 mg/kg bw per day. Breast Implants 1.5 At the request of the Department of Health and the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) an emergency consid-eration of data relating to the safety of breast implants containing soya bean oil was undertaken. This procedure isone that can be undertaken if necessary and with the agreement of the Chairman. It requires the identification ofa limited number of members with particularly relevant expertise and the rapid circulation of the appropriate doc-umentation to them. In such circumstances the outcome does not represent the views of the Committee but is thecollated opinions of individual members. In this instance, the documentation was circulated to some members onThursday, 4 March; their opinions were received by early afternoon on Saturday, 6 March; these were passed to theMDA. MDA and Department of Health advice on the implants, which referred to a voluntary withdrawal of theimplants by the manufacturers, was made public on Monday, 8 March. 2-Chlorobenzylidene Malononitrile (CS) and CS Spray 1.6 At the request of the Department of Health, with the support of the Home Office, the advice of theCommittee and its sister Committees was sought on CS spray in the context of its use as a chemical incapacitantbecause of potential public health concerns. The Committees produced the following joint statement: (i) The advice of the Committees on Toxicity, Mutagenicity and Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT, COM, and COC), on 2-chlorobenzyli-dene malononitrile (CS), specifically in the context of the use of CS spray as a chemical incapac-itant, was sought by the Department of Health, with the support of the Home Office. 7 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 7(ii) CS spray has now been used by some police forces in England and Wales since March 1, 1996 when it was introduced for a trial period which was followed by approval in September 1996.Although the use of CS as an aerosol or 'smoke' was reviewed following its use in Londonderry in1969, 1,2the spray itself has not been subjected to scrutiny by independent expert advisory com- mittees. It was for this reason, and because of the potential public health concerns, that theDepartment of Health was of the opinion that such a referral was appropriate. (iii) This statement incorporates the conclusions of each of the three Committees and is divided into sections concerned with a) the physical and chemical properties of the spray, b) the toxicologicaldata on the compound CS, c) the toxicological data on the solvent, methyl isobutyl ketone(MIBK), and d) the toxicological data on CS spray. The COT considered toxicological data onCS itself and the solvent MIBK itself and then the very limited animal and human data on thecombination, CS spray. Professor K.E. Donaldson of Napier University assisted the Committeein its deliberation and Dr V.S.G. Murray and her colleagues from the Chemical Incident ResponseService (CIRS) and the National Poisons Information Service (NPIS), London Centre describedcases of putative toxic effects of CS spray reported to their service. The nature of CS spray and its components (iv) The CS spray used by police forces in the UK consists of a 5% (w/v) solution of CS in MIBK, comprising 1.5 grams (g) of CS dissolved in a total volume of 30 millilitres (ml), contained in acanister with nitrogen as a propellant. The chemical structures of CS and MIBK are given in theFigure below. Figure 2-Chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS) Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) Exposure to CS spray (v) The COT noted that, although there are reports and studies which describe the effects of CS spray on humans, these do not provide data in respect of individuals who have been sprayed which allowany estimation of their exposure to the constituent chemicals. The guidelines for the use of CSspray that have been provided to police forces for the training of officers were available 3but, in the absence of quantitative evidence relating to operational use, the Committee was unable toestimate exposure in the field. (vi) However, to address this question the Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) of the Home Office carried out a study of 500 canisters that had been used operationally in the UK by policeofficers in the course of arrests of individuals. The Committee has been informed that it is standardCNCN ClO 8 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 8practice to replace a canister after it has been used once. By comparing the weights of the used canisters with the mean weight of unused canisters it was possible to estimate the quantities of CSspray that had been used during each incident. At the maximum flow rate permitted in the spec-ifications, 10% of the canisters had been discharged for a total calculated period of more than 3seconds and had weights corresponding to the release of between 12.0 and 23.7 g of the CSsolution in MIBK. The peak of the exposure distribution corresponded to the release of 4 to 6grams of the solution of CS in MIBK, of which 0.28 to 0.35 g is calculated to have been CS. 4 (vii) The nature of the toxic effects of the spray will depend upon the extent to which exposure occurs to the eyes, to the skin and via inhalation or ingestion. The mass and size of the droplets of theCS solution in MIBK produced during spraying will determine how far the droplets can penetrateinto the respiratory tract. In response to the COT's enquiries about the physical properties of thespray released from the canisters, the PSDB commissioned a study, undertaken by AEATechnology, to address the question of the size distribution of droplets produced under conditionssimulating operational use. (viii) The results of this study indicate that, when the CS spray is used at distances of 2 to 3 metres from a detector, the median diameter of the spray particles is between 417 to 441 micrometres (\u00b5m).There are, however, some particles with diameters of less than 100 \u00b5m and a few with diametersof less than 50 \u00b5m. When the spray was used at distances of less than 0.1 m, (a shorter distancethan that recommended for operational use), the proportion of the smaller droplets decreased.When the spray was allowed to impinge on, and be scattered back from, a solid target the propor-tion of smaller diameter droplets increased. In a further study with 5 canisters of CS spray in whichthe diameter of the smaller particles was measured, none were found to have diameters of less than28 \u00b5m. 5 (ix) The Committee was of the view that, although the CS canisters release, for the most part, a coarse spray, there is a proportion of droplets with diameters of less than 100 \u00b5m which, in the event offull discharge of the can, could transport a maximum of 20 mg of the spray solution into the upperrespiratory tract the smallest droplets of which (diameter 28 to 50 \u00b5m), could reach the large- andmedium-sized airways of the lung. This proportion will be increased if the spray is scattered fromany nearby surface. Since these are the airways that are affected in bronchial asthma, it is possiblethat an asthmatic attack could occur in susceptible individuals. It was also recognised that theincreased rate and depth of respiration occurring in an individual under stress might, in addition,result in a greater dose of the CS spray being inhaled. (x) In a separate study with CS canisters the vapour concentration of the solvent MIBK was measured at 6 positions placed either as close as could be achieved or up to 0.5 m from a target. The targetwas sprayed from a distance of 2.0 m for periods of 1 or 3 seconds or until the canister was empty.The resultant MIBK vapour concentration at each position was then measured at one secondintervals for a period of 15 minutes. In these trials the Short Term Exposure Limit (STEL)* forMIBK of 100 ppm time-averaged over a 15 minute reference period 6was exceeded on four out of eighteen occasions. However, static air conditions were used in these trials in order to achieve agreater reproducibility, 4 such conditions would reduce dispersion and increase average measured concentrations. (xi) Because of the nature of this trial, and the differences in circumstances from operational use where static air conditions would be unlikely, the Committee felt that these results probably did not rep-resent a cause for concern, provided that the spray is used in accordance with the operationalguidelines. 9 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment* An occupational exposure limit defining a level of exposure over a 15 minute reference period which should never be exceeded.6Such values are typically set to protect workers against effects that occur rapidly after exposure eg irritation of the eyes, nose and throat.74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 9Toxicity of CS (xii) Most of the data on the toxicity of CS derive from studies which have used either CS aerosols or pyrotechnically-generated 'smokes'. In both cases respirable particles were produced. Data havebeen obtained on the size of droplets resulting from the use of CS dissolved in an organic solventand delivered in the form of a spray; these are discussed in paragraphs (vii) to (ix) above. Metabolism (xiii) Studies of the metabolism of CS have been conducted on the compound itself and not in the form in which it would be used as an incapacitating agent by police officers. It is readily hydrolysed inaqueous mixtures 7,8, and reacts readily with plasma proteins and glutathione in vitro and in vivo .9,10 It undergoes rapid metabolism and chemical breakdown in vitro and in vivo , initially to 2- chlorobenzaldehyde and malononitrile, each of these then undergo further rapid reactions. Thehalf lives (t 12) of CS and the metabolites, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde and 2-chlorobenzylmalononitrile in one in vivo experiment involving the administration of compounds by intra-arterial injection into cats were 5.4, 4.5 and 9.5 seconds respectively.11After oral administration CS is metabolised and eliminated largely ( circa 70%) via the urine as 2-chlorohippuric acid and 2-chlorobenzoic acid.12Other metabolites have been identified but there is no evidence of dechlorination. It was noted however that the available data were not as comprehensive as would have been obtained ifmodern techniques had been used. In addition, no data were available on the kinetics of CSadministered as a solution in MIBK. Experimental studies in animals (xiv) The acute toxicity of CS following exposure via inhalation is characterised by sensory irritancy followed by prompt recovery. Acute studies in rodents and guinea pigs using pyrotechnically-gen-erated CS smokes indicated that short term exposure (10 to 20 minutes) to concentrations of CSof around 4 grams/metre 3(g/m3), or longer exposure (several hours) to levels of around 30 to 40 mg/m3, resulted in deaths. Death was due to severe lung damage (comprising haemorrhages and oedema).13Animals that survived showed no pathological abnormalities when examined 14 days later. (xv) Studies to investigate skin irritancy in rats, rabbits and guinea pigs indicated that a 12.5% (w/v) solution of CS in corn oil or acetone applied for 6 hours without occlusion produced mild skinirritation. 7No conclusions can be drawn with regard to its potential to induce skin sensitisation from the two animal studies available due to limitations in the methodology used.14,15There are, however, some data in humans to indicate that CS can provoke skin sensitisation (see paragraphxxx). (xvi) The eye irritancy of CS has been shown to be dependent upon the solvent used. A 5% (w/v) solution in PEG-300 (polyethylene glycol) produced severe irritant effects in the rabbit (mild ormoderate keratitis lasting for 2 weeks or more after a single application) whereas a 10% (w/v)solution in trichloroethane produced some conjunctivitis but no corneal damage and no effectswere seen after 7 days. 16,17Results of eye irritancy studies in rabbits using a 7% (w/v) solution in MIBK are given in paragraph xliv; signs of severe irritation were seen initially with recovery after8 days. 10 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 10(xvii) Repeated dose inhalation studies involving exposure for 1 hour a day for 120 days, indicated a NOAEL* of about 30 mg CS/m3in a range of species (mice, rats, guinea-pigs).18At around 200 mg/m3in mice and guinea pigs, deaths of 23% and 48% respectively of the exposed animals occurred in the first month of the experiment. Mutagenicity (xviii) The mutagenicity data on CS were considered by the Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COM). Their conclusions are given in thefollowing paragraphs. In vitro studies (xix) The mutagenicity of CS has been extensively studied in vitro. Negative results were obtained in Salmonella assays, but there were reservations regarding the suitability of the standard protocolsused in these tests with respect to CS in view of its very short half life. 19-23Positive results were noted in assays in V79 cells for gene mutation and also in the mouse lymphoma assay.20,24,25 Positive results were documented also in metaphase analysis for clastogenicity in V79 and CHOcells. 20,26In addition, CS has been shown to induce SCEs (Sister Chromatid Exchanges) in CHO cells.20These data indicate that CS has clastogenic potential. (xx) There is evidence from in vitro studies to indicate that CS has aneugenic effects. It has been shown to interfere with the spindle machinery and cell division in mammalian cells resulting in C-mitosisand metaphase block. 27-32CS has also been shown to induce micronuclei in mammalian cells in vitro.25These data suggest that CS has aneugenic potential. (xxi) The clastogenic effects seen appear to be due to CS itself, or an unknown short-lived intermedi- ate.26The mechanism of aneugenicity appears to differ from the clastogenicity with 2-chloroben- zaldehyde being the important metabolite regarding aneugenicity but not in respect ofclastogenicity. 29 In vivo studies (xxii) Negative results were consistently obtained in bone marrow or peripheral blood assays for micronuclei induction using high dose levels and both the oral and intraperitoneal routes.23,33 (These assays are capable of detecting clastogens and aneugens if the active metabolite reaches thebone marrow.) It was noted that no data were available to indicate if adequate amounts of CS orshort lived reactive metabolites reached the target organ. Data from DNA binding studies in theliver and kidney did not help in this regard as no relevant analysis of tissues of initial contact (ieskin or nasal mucosa) were undertaken. 21Studies using Drosophila (fruit flies) did not provide any meaningful data as the experimental design was unlikely to result in exposure of Drosophila tobiologically active CS. 23It was felt prudent for complete reassurance on the lack of mutagenic activity of CS in vivo to have data from a study to investigate genotoxicity to measure potential mutagenicity at a site of contact, for example in the nasal mucosa. However, some members ofCOM recognised that the design of such an animal study would be difficult both from practicaland ethical standpoints and were of the opinion that these studies were not necessary. 11 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment* No Observable Adverse Effect Level74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 11Carcinogenicity (xxiii) The carcinogenicity data on CS were considered by the Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COC). Their conclusions aregiven in the following paragraph. (xxiv) The US National Toxicology Program carcinogenicity studies provide no evidence that CS had any carcinogenic effects in adequately conducted inhalation bioassays in rats or in mice following2 year exposure at up to 0.75 mg/m 3and 1.5 mg/m3respectively.20These data provide reassurance that CS does not have mutagenic activity in vivo at site of contact tissues, a concern raised by the COM. No further work relating to CS is therefore needed in this area. Reproductive toxicity (xxv) Developmental toxicity (teratogenicity) studies using the inhalation route and an aerosol of CS (1-2 \u00b5m mass median diameter) did not indicate any teratogenic or foetotoxic effects in rats orrabbits exposed to 60 mg/m 3CS (5 minutes per day) on days 6 to 15 of pregnancy.34Similar results were obtained when CS was given by the intraperitoneal route at 20 mg/kg as a single dose on day6, 8, 9, 10, 12 or 14 of pregnancy. (xxvi) There were no data available relating to single or multigeneration reproductive toxicity studies. Effects in humans (xxvii) Most of the data available relates to studies involving CS smoke or aerosol and exposure via inhala- tion. Aerosols were generated by thermal dispersion (particle size about 0.5 \u00b5m) or from a solutionin methylene chloride (particle size about 1 \u00b5m). Studies on volunteers indicate that exposure toabout 0.5 to 1 mg/m 3CS for 90 minutes in an exposure chamber produced profuse tears (lachry- mation), involuntary repeated closure of eyes (blepharospasm), a burning sensation in the mouth,nasal irritation and symptoms of tightness in the chest; in some cases difficulty in breathing wasexperienced, particularly upon initial exposure. 35,36Subjects were able to tolerate exposure at these levels throughout the 90 minute duration of this experiment. In general exposures of about 2.5mg/m 3could be tolerated only for a few minutes. These data relate to subjects not previously exposed to CS. There is evidence for the development of some tolerance if exposures are built upslowly with 7/8 (88%) subjects then being able to tolerate 2.5 mg/m 3for 60 minutes.36Once exposure ceased all symptoms and signs, apart from headache, disappeared within a few minutes.No biologically significant effects were seen on respiratory function, blood chemistry nor in thepattern of electrocardiograms (ECG). However, the observation of effects on the ECG would bevery dependent on the time after exposure at which they were measured and it is not clear fromthe published paper how long a delay occurred after exposure had ceased. 36Dermal exposure of volunteers, by body drenching whilst only lightly clothed, with very dilute aqueous solutions ofCS (up to 0.0005% w/v) resulted in marked transient skin and eye irritation. 37During this period a rise in both systolic (30 to 59 mm Hg) and diastolic (15 to 30 mm Hg) blood pressures wasnoted which took 2 to 25 minutes to fall to within 10 mm Hg of the controls. This was not dose-related and was not exacerbated by exercise. (xxviii) Data from volunteer studies and experience in use, both in the manufacture of CS and its use in riot control, indicate that CS itself is a skin irritant. Volunteers whose forearm skin was exposed todry powder experienced a mild, transient skin reaction. 38The effects were more pronounced if the powder was moistened, when erythema lasted for between 1 to 2 days. Studies have also been carried 12 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 12out on volunteers whose forearm skin was exposed to high concentrations of CS under simulated tropical conditions.39Marked irritant effects could be produced although there was much variabil- ity in response depending on the individual and on local conditions (heat and moisture). A highincidence of dermatitis on the arms and neck has been reported at the industrial site in the USAthat manufactured CS in the past. 39Occupational hygiene standards at this plant were poor, with airborne CS concentrations of levels up to 12 mg/m3(much greater than the Threshold Limit Value TLV* at the time of 0.4 mg/m3). (xxix) Skin problems were common in individuals exposed to CS from grenades when these were used in Hong Kong during rioting at a Vietnamese detention camp, under circumstances where therioters were not able to disperse. 40,41A subsequent review of case records of 184 patients with symptoms consistent with CS exposure revealed a high incidence (52%) of skin problems includ-ing contact dermatitis and minor burns, most of which resolved within 2 weeks. Some of the skininjuries were caused by contact with hot canisters or grenades. (xxx) There is some evidence that CS can also produce skin sensitisation. At the CS manufacturing site referred to in paragraph xxviii, 8% (2/25) of the individuals who were patch tested with CS showedskin reactions consistent with allergic contact dermatitis. 39There are also case reports of CS-induced allergic contact dermatitis in four individuals who were also exposed to CS from tear gasgrenades. 42-44There is, however, no information on the sensitisation potential of CS in solvent for- mulations. (xxxi) D ata on eye irritancy are available from studies in volunteers. Exposure of young male volunteers to 0.1 or 0.25% CS as a slurry in 0.5% polysorbate, either directly (0.25 ml drop) or as a spray (hand-held disperser from 15 feet), resulted in a severe pain response for a few minutes, profuse tears andredness of the conjuctiva for about 10 minutes. 45Comparable effects were seen in volunteers exposed to up to 1% CS in an organic solvent (trioctyl phosphate) using identical methodology.46There was complete recovery after about 30 minutes. Similar effects were seen in volunteers exposed to CSpowder (0.8 mm mass median diameter) at up to 6.7 mg/m 3for 10 minutes.47There were no effects on visual acuity several minutes after exposure ceased. Data from experience in use indicates similareffects with transient pain, profuse tears and conjunctival reddening. There is no evidence from thesestudies of any permanent damage. (xxxii) The question as to whether subjects being treated with neuroleptic drugs are likely to be more sen- sitive to CS spray has been raised. 48There are no experimental data to allow any conclusions to be drawn on this aspect of the toxicity of CS. (xxxiii) The only data on the effects of repeated exposure to CS derived from case reports of workers occu- pationally exposed.2These do not indicate any effects other than local irritant effects seen after acute exposure, but no conclusions can be drawn from these very limited data. Toxicity of MIBK (xxxiv) MIBK is readily absorbed and widely distributed in various tissues of rats and mice following oral or inhalation exposure.49,50The major metabolites in rodents are 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pen- (4-MPOL) which may be further conjugated, ormetabolised and eliminated as carbon dioxide, or incorporated into tissues. 50,51Data on elimina- tion of MIBK are incomplete. Studies in humans suggest that absorbed MIBK is rapidly clearedfrom blood and that very little unchanged MIBK is eliminated in the urine. 52 13 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment* Occupational exposure limit, for an 8 hour time weighted exposure, recommended by the American Conference of Government Indust rial Hygienists in the USA.74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 13(xxxv) Studies using hens have indicated that MIBK has the potential to induce microsomal metabolism carried out by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver after repeated exposure for 3 months. MIBKwould thereby potentiate the effects of other chemicals (including drugs) that undergo activation viacytochrome P450-mediated metabolism. 53These data, however, derived from studies involving pro- longed, repeated exposure and are not relevant to single exposure, as is the case in the use of CS sprayin the field. (xxxvi) MIBK is of low acute toxicity in rats or mice both by inhalation (4 hour LC 50* circa 12 g/m3) or by ingestion (oral LD50** 2 to 5 g/kg b.w.).54-56Studies in rabbits to investigate skin irritancy using an occlusive dressing and 10 to 24 hour exposure resulted in minor transient effects, indicatingthat MIBK has a low skin irritant potential. 57,58Repeated exposure produced drying and flaking of the skin due to the defatting action of MIBK. Eye irritancy studies in the rabbit using neatMIBK (0.1 ml) resulted in transient effects. 54These results indicate that MIBK has low eye irritant potential. (xxxvi) Repeated dose (90-day) studies by inhalation showed effects on the liver and kidneys.59In mice the only effect seen, apart from lachrymation, at the top dose (4100 mg/m3) was a small increase (11%) in liver weight, not accompanied by histopathological abnormalities. A similar effect wasseen in the liver of rats. In addition, nephrotoxicity was seen in the proximal tubules of the mg/m 3of MIBK. Nephrotoxicity was limited to the male rat and was associated with hyaline droplet deposition. It may have been due to binding toalpha-2 urinary microglobulin, a male rat specific protein; this mechanism is believed to be specificto the male rat. 60The NOAEL was 205 mg/m3in the rat and 1025 mg/m3in the mouse. (xxxvii) In an unpublished 90-day oral study in the rat, histological evidence of kidney damage was reported at doses of 250 mg/kg and above, both in male and female animals. There was increasedliver weight, not accompanied by histopathological damage, at 100 mg/kg. 61The NOAEL for this study was estimated to be 50 mg/kg. (xxxviii) There is no evidence that MIBK or its major metabolite 4-OHMIBK have any genotoxic prop- erties. Negative results were obtained with MIBK in the Salmonella assay, a metaphase analysis forclastogenicity in a an DNA synthesis (UDS)assay in hepatocytes and in vivo in a bone marrow micronucleus assay. 62,63Negative results were obtained for the metabolite in the Salmonella assay and metaphase analysis in hepatocytes.62 (xxxix) The developmental toxicity (teratogenicity) of MIBK in rats and mice has been assessed follow- ing exposure between 300 and 3000 ppm by inhalation on gestation days 6-15.64Maternal toxicity and foetotoxicity were observed in both species at 3000 ppm, but not at 1000 ppm. Significantreductions in foetal weight and ossification in the rat at 300 ppm were probably related to littersizes and were not treatment-related. Contrary to the statement in some reports (which have reliedon secondary sources and not the original article), there was no evidence of teratogenicity in eitherspecies, even at the maternally toxic exposure concentration of 3000 ppm. (xl) It was noted that no carcinogenicity bioassays nor any single or multigeneration reproductive toxicity studies have been carried out on MIBK. (xli) The characteristic effects noted in humans relate to local irritant effects and non-specific central nervous system (CNS) effects (eg headache, nausea) at occupational exposures of about 100 ppmand above. 52,65,66 The odour threshold is low (0.4 ppm) and the irritant effects can be detected at about 2 ppm.67 14 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment* Lethal concentration estimated to result in deaths of 50% of the exposed animals. ** Lethal dose estimated to result in deaths of 50% of the exposed animals.74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 14Data on the combination of CS and MIBK (xlii) The Committee noted the sparsity of data on the combination of CS dissolved in MIBK. There are no data available on the metabolism, kinetics, acute toxicity, or skin irritancy of CS whenadministered in MIBK as solvent. (xliii) The only experimental data specifically on this combination consist of a study on the eye irritancy of 7% CS in MIBK (w/v) in rabbits. 68This indicated that spraying 7% CS directly into the eyes of rabbits from close range produced severe irritant effects, including a degree of corneal opacity,which had cleared by day 8 and was not followed by irreversible damage. (xliv) Information was available from experience arising from the use of the spray from studies carried out by NPIS London Centre and the CIRS. 69,70These indicated that there were cases of dermati- tis following the use of CS spray: the effects produced were noted 6 hours after the exposure. Nolonger term follow-up studies have been carried out. There are also case reports of marked der-matitis following the use of CS spray in France. The report describes eleven subjects of whom fivehad multiple exposures to CS. The authors considered that a direct irritant effect was responsible,although an allergic dermatitis could not be ruled out. It is not clear from the published infor-mation whether exposure was to CS in MIBK or to another formulation. In addition, no infor-mation is available on the ethnicity of the exposed individual who developed dermatitis. 71 (xlv) Literature searches did not reveal reports of serious eye damage caused by CS spray. Furthermore such cases were not identified as a consequence of exposure to CS spray in the data provided byNPIS London Centre. Conclusions (xlvi) The Committee noted that there are considerable data available to assess the toxicity of CS itself, and to a lesser extent, the solvent MIBK itself. CS is a potent sensory irritant, particularly to theskin and the eyes. It is rapidly hydrolysed and therefore tissue exposure to CS itself is transient.Experience in use indicates that it is a skin irritant and there are some reports of skin sensitisationoccurring. There are no concerns relating to the mutagenicity, carcinogenicity or teratogenicity ofCS itself. The toxicity of the solvent MIBK is characterised by transient local irritant effects andcentral nervous system (CNS) effects (particularly headache, nausea) resulting from occupationalexposures of about 100 ppm and above. Negative results were obtained in mutagenicity tests andthere was no evidence of teratogenicity in developmental toxicity studies. There is no informationfrom carcinogenicity or multigeneration reproductive toxicity assays. (xlvii) There are very few data on the formulated material. A 7% (w/v) solution of CS in MIBK produced severe irritant effects in rabbit eyes followed by recovery in 8 days. This is consistent with theabsence of evidence of serious permanent eye damage in humans. Experience in use indicates thatit has skin irritant properties, and can cause dermatitis. (xlviii) The Committee's conclusions regarding the health effects of CS spray were based on considera- tion of the toxicity data on CS and MIBK. As noted above there was very little information onthe formulated product. The Committee's advice applies to all individuals exposed to CS sprayduring its use as a chemical incapacitant. (xlix) The Committee considered that the available data did not, in general, raise concerns regarding the health effects of CS spray itself. Local irritant effects are short term and there exists the possibil-ity of skin sensitisation occurring in some individuals. It must be noted that no comprehensive 15 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 15investigation of the effects of CS spray in humans was available, nor has there been any system- atic follow-up of individuals who have been sprayed with CS spray. The Committee has concernsregarding exposure to CS spray in susceptible groups. These are: (a) Individuals with bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive airways disease whose condition could be aggravated by the irritant effects of CS spray on the respiratory tract. (b) Individuals suffering from hypertension or other cardiovascular disease because of the transient effects of CS spray in increasing blood pressure. (c) It was not possible, on the basis of the available data, to comment on whether individuals being treated with neuroleptic drugs are more likely to be sensitive to the effects of CS spray. (l) The Committee noted that adherence to the operational guidelines for the use of CS spray was of particular importance since at the time of exposure it would be exceedingly unlikely that themedical status of those exposed would be known. These concerns, and the uncertainties notedearlier, lead to the conclusion that particular care needs to be taken to follow the recommendedaftercare guidelines for all persons exposed to CS. (li) The Committee considered that further information needs to be obtained on the effects of CS spray in humans. In this regard it was noted that systematic studies in volunteers to investigate thetoxicity of CS spray may present insurmountable difficulties. The Committee thus recommendedthat follow-up studies be carried out on individuals treated for the immediate effects of CS sprayin order to obtain data on whether delayed effects occur. Information should also be collected inthese studies relating to the previous medical history of the individuals involved, particularly withregard to respiratory or cardiovascular disease, or treatment with neuroleptic drugs. Epoxidised Soya Bean Oil 1.7 Epoxidised soya bean oil (ESBO) is a mixture of substances that is produced by the controlled epoxidationof soya bean oil in which the carbon-carbon double bonds are largely converted to epoxy groups. It is used for plas-ticising gaskets in the lids of most glass containers used in this country for baby foods. The Committee was askedto give consideration to the results of a MAFF/DH Joint Food Safety and Standards Group (JFSSG) survey of ESBOmigration from plasticised gaskets in the lids of glass containers used for baby foods. 1.8 The Committee had reviewed the available toxicology data on ESBO in 1989 when it considered a report on plasticiser levels in food contact materials prepared by the Working Group on Chemical Contaminants fromFood Contact Materials of the Steering Group on Chemical Aspects of Food Surveillance. A further review wasundertaken during 1994 when the Committee recommended a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 1 mg/kg bw per day.This was derived by applying a safety factor of 100 to the NOAEL of 100 mg/kg bw per day determined by a two-year feeding study in rats. 1.9 After consideration of the latest survey data, the Committee concluded that it would be prudent that action should be taken to reduce the levels of ESBO in these products in order to restore the safety margin incorporatedinto the TDI. The Food Advisory Committee (FAC) welcomed the action already being taken by industry with thisobjective in mind and noted that the design of the packaging and the use of ESBO in it have provided confidencethat the products are safe. The FAC concluded that action by industry must continue and be done in ways thatcontinue to ensure the highest level of safety of the products. 16 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 16Food Intolerance 1.10 The Working Group on Food Intolerance prepared a first draft report which was discussed by the Committee during the year. The final report is in preparation. French Maritime Pine Bark Extract 1.11 Consideration was given to additional, more detailed toxicological data on a commercial extract of pine barkthat is marketed as a dietary supplement. This matter had been referred to the Committee by the AdvisoryCommittee on Novel Foods and Processes and a statement was prepared in 1998. In 1999 the Committee preparedthe following statement: (i) In 1998 we were asked to consider a submission which had initially been made to the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) seeking food safety clearance of an extractderived from the bark of the pine tree ( Pinus pinaster ). The French maritime pine bark extract is sold in the form of a dietary supplement. The ACNFP had advised that since the extract has beenon sale in the UK and other European countries for a number of years, it would not be consid-ered a novel food. However, the ACNFP did have some concerns regarding the toxicological dataincluded in the submission and it was therefore referred to this Committee. (ii) In our consideration of the submission we identified problems with the data received, as some of the information was in the form of brief summaries of old, unpublished studies. In addition, itwas not clear that the studies had used material which corresponded to that currently marketed.We therefore indicated that an adequate specification of the extract should be provided before anyfurther work was undertaken. The deficiencies in the reporting or execution of the toxicologicalstudies led us to recommend that some studies should be repeated or appropriate new studies beperformed in order to clarify aspects of the toxicity of the extract. In particular we had concernsabout a report, in an abstract, of lesions occurring in the brain of dogs after a 6-month feedingstudy, about potential teratogenic/foetotoxic and endocrine/reproductive effects and also thepossible mutagenicity and allergenicity of the extract. Our conclusions were recorded in the formof a statement. 72 Consideration of new data (iii) We have since received additional documentation which comprises: a) more detailed specifications of the product;73 b) history of the production and nomenclature of the extract;74 c) a new mutagenicity study;75 d) a copy and certified translation of the report of the original 6-month feeding study in dogs;76 e) an expert opinion of the report of the original 6-month feeding study in dogs;77and f) a statement as to the absence of protein in the product.78 17 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 17Specifications (iv) We are satisfied that, within the limitations of the analytical methodology, the specifications and analytical data submitted provide adequate assurance of the consistency of batches of Frenchmaritime pine bark extract prepared by current production methods. 73Although there is an exten- sive history of production of the extract, the analytical data are not available to demonstrate thatthe extract used in early studies is similar to that currently produced. 74 Mutagenicity (v) We have been informed that the recently completed mutagenicity assay (Ames test) has been reviewed by the Secretariat of the Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, ConsumerProducts and the Environment who concluded that the extract was non-mutagenic in the assay.Having seen the report of this study, 75we endorse this conclusion. The 6-month toxicity study in dogs (vi) When we first considered the toxicity data available for the French maritime pine bark extract the only information on this study, carried out in 1975, was a short abstract. A statement about thedevelopment of lesions in the brains of dogs raised concerns that were not resolved by the otheravailable toxicity data. Unfortunately, the full report of the study did not remove these concerns. 76 Although the lesions of the brain and spinal cord occurred only in the group of animals receivingthe highest dose, we note that the study pathologists had not been able to determine whether thelesions were treatment-related or were artefactual, possibly having resulted from some differencein the post mortem processing of the tissues. Lack of detail in the report meant that we were unableto make any judgement on this issue. (vii) Other aspects of this study were of concern. The dosing schedule at the start of the treatment had involved the oral administration of 0, 60, 150 and 500 milligram of the extract per kilogram ofbody weight (mg/kg b.w.) on only six days of each week. Six weeks before the end of the study thetop dose was increased to 1000 mg/kg b.w. administered continuously, which we assume to be onseven days per week. This variation to the dosing schedule of the top dose group makes compar-isons with the two lower dose groups difficult to interpret. (viii) It has been suggested to us that the administration of six doses per week would have been consid- ered reasonable at the period when the study was carried out. 77This is not our opinion, as at that time it was recognised that the use of such a schedule could offer a period of recovery from anyadverse effects of the test substance. Since the report does not provide information to indicate atwhat stage of the weekly dosing schedule animals were killed or samples were taken for haema-tology and clinical chemistry it is possible that some of the changes recorded during the study andat its termination may have been minimised by an intervening period of recovery. (ix) In addition to the lesions of the nervous system there were effects on the heart rate and body weight gain in the top dose group. These were restricted to that group. However, some changes, e.g. inorgan weights, in leucocyte counts and in blood triglyceride and glucose concentrations werereported as occurring in all the treated groups, although there was evidence of a sex-specificity ofchanges in some organ weights. (x) The deficiencies in the study mean that we reiterate our opinion that this study needs to be repeated in order either to dismiss or to substantiate the concerns that it has raised. 18 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 18Allergenicity (xi) We considered a statement which indicated that no nitrogen had been detected in three batches of the French maritime pine bark extract by elemental analysis and that no protein had beendetected by an electrophoretic technique (SDS-PAGE). Without information on the proceduresinvolved and the Limits of Detection for the samples the statement does not provide any reassur-ance as to the absence of allergenic protein in the extract. 78 Reproductive toxicity (xii) Neither new data nor original full study reports have been submitted to address our concerns about possible teratogenicity and endocrine and/or reproductive effects of the French maritime pine barkextract. We have been informed that a consultation with industry is in progress about the labellingof the product in order to indicate that it is a preparation for adults but should not be taken duringpregnancy or breastfeeding. We have been asked whether it would be sufficient to advise that itnot be taken by children younger than 8 years of age. In the absence of data that provide reassur-ance in these matters we would not recommend that the suggested age be lowered from that ofadulthood. Conclusions (a) We accept that, within the limits of the techniques used, the analytical data submitted on batch-to-batch variation of the French maritime pine bark extract provide evidence ofconsistency of the currently manufactured product. (b) The full report of the 6-month dog study has not removed our concerns about the possible adverse effects resulting from the administration of French maritime pine bark extract. We do not considerthat this study is adequate for the determination of a No Observed Adverse Effect Level. Therefore,we reiterate our view that it is necessary to repeat this study to present-day testing guidelines. (c) On the basis of the studies originally and recently submitted we consider that the extract is non-mutagenic. (d) We would wish to see the experimental details, including the Limits of Detection, of the studies undertaken to detect any protein in the extract before accepting that allergenicproteins are absent. (e) We repeat our recommendation that the original reports of the high dose embryo-foetal studies be provided and that in vitro and/or short-term in vivo studies be undertaken to address the question of possible endocrine or reproductive effects of the extract. In theinterim, we support the suggested labelling of the product to indicate that it should be takenonly by adults but not by pregnant women or nursing mothers. Hemicellulase Enzyme in Bread-Making 1.12 The Committee carried out a postal consultation on the toxicological aspects of a submission to the FoodAdvisory Committee requesting clearance for the use of a hemicellulase enzyme in bread-making. It was agreed thatthe enzyme could be given temporary clearance for one year subject to the company's provision of an assurance thatthe frequency of testing for mycotoxins and antibacterial activity would be increased to one batch in four and of 19 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 19evidence to support the company's claim that no residual enzyme activity would be expected in the bread after the baking process. Hypospadias and Maternal Nutrition 1.13 The Committee was asked to review an unpublished paper describing an investigation of the possible role ofmaternal nutrition in the origin of hypospadias in male children. The study had involved a cohort of mothers andtheir children participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC). It was claimedthat there was an association between hypospadias and the mother eating a vegetarian diet. The incidence ofhypospadias in the study population was higher than that recorded in the 1992 figures from the Office of NationalStatistics, however the Committee agreed that it was not possible to be certain that the increase represented a trueincrease in the incidence of this malformation. 1.14 The limited number of cases of hypospadias, as well as the classification of the degree of severity of these, in the group of vegetarian mothers were of concern to members. It was noted that, since random fluctuation in inci-dence could not be ruled out, it was important to validate the classification. 1.15 The biological plausibility of the hypothesis that the concentration of phytoestrogens in the maternal diet was a risk factor for hypospadias was discussed. It was noted that the mother's self-definition of 'vegetarianism' v aried between individuals and that the information on the consumption of phytoestrogens was not detailed enough. 1.16 The Committee concluded that the paper was based on a study with a good prospective longitudinal design but that there were considerable concerns about the possible confounding factors. There was concern that the linkto oestrogen exposure and alternative mechanisms had not been considered. In addition, there were reservationsabout the ascertainment of the hypospadias and about the objective interpretation of the data. Iodine in Milk 1.17 The results of a survey of the concentrations of iodine in retail samples of milk was considered by theCommittee. This survey had been carried out by the Joint Food Safety and Standards Group in response to thepoints raised by the Committee in 1997. The following statement was produced: (i) We have considered a draft Food Surveillance Information Sheet 79describing the results of a survey carried out for the MAFF/DH Joint Food Safety and Standards Group on the concentration ofiodine in cows' milk. Results of the survey (ii) Representative purchases of whole (93 samples), semi-skimmed (107 samples) and skimmed (20 samples) pasteurised cows' milk on sale in the UK were made during the summer of 1998 and thewinter of 1998/1999 from Belfast, Edinburgh, Swansea, Sunderland, Leicester and London andwere analysed for total iodine. We welcome this latest survey of iodine in cows' milk. The overallmean iodine concentration in cows' milk was 311 mg/kg. We note that mean iodine concentra-tions were lower in summer (200 mg/kg) compared to winter (430 mg/kg). The higher concen-trations in winter may reflect greater use of supplemented compound feedstuffs during this period.We also note that the fat content of the milk did not influence these values. (iii) Since 1989 we have reviewed iodine concentrations in cows' milk on a number of occasions, most recently in September 1997. 80In our 1997 review we noted that iodine concentrations in cows' milk were higher than in previous surveys, though the reasons for this were unclear. We consid- 20 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 20ered that these higher concentrations of iodine were unlikely to pose a risk to health but we rec- ommended that the monitoring of iodine in cows' milk should continue. Possible sources of iodinein cows' milk include iodine in the animal diets and the iodophors used as sterilants of cow teatsand milking vessels. Therefore, we encouraged investigation of the bioavailability of iodine iniodophors and the different chemical forms of iodine in cows' milk. This would help to identifypotential sources of iodine in cows' milk. Additionally, we requested study of the differentchemical forms of iodine in infant formulas. We have been informed that research is underway toinvestigate the iodophors and the different chemical forms of iodine in cows' milk and infantformulas. (iv) We note that the concentrations of iodine in cows' milk reported in this latest survey are similar to those we considered in 1997 but are higher than values reported in the earlier surveys. 81-83 Dietary iodine intake (v) Iodine is an important nutrient element and is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. An inadequate intake can lead to a broad spectrum of iodine deficiency diseases. For protectionagainst iodine deficiency the Department of Health's Committee on Medical Aspects of FoodPolicy has recommended a Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) for adults of 140 mg/day. The RNIfor children ranges from 50 mg/day (for children aged 0-3 months) to 140 mg/day (for childrenaged between 15-18 years). 84However, a high intake of iodine can result in functional impairment of, and tissue damage to, the thyroid gland and death has been caused by extremely high intakes.In our previous review. 80we took reassurance from a study in which 1-11 year old children were given doses of iodine up to 1000 mg/day over a period of 4 months without signs of toxicity.85In order to protect individuals against the toxic effects of excessive iodine intake the Joint ExpertCommittee on Food Additives (JECFA) of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and theWorld Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a Provisional Maximum Tolerable DailyIntake (PMTDI) of 0.017 86This is applica- ble to individuals over the age of 12 weeks and is equivalent to 1000 micrograms (mg)/day for a60 kg adult (the equivalent values for children are reported in Table 1). (vi) There are few data on which to base estimates of the potential intake of iodine by different age groups. Iodine intakes from milk have been estimated for adults and for children aged 1 12- 212, 212- 312, and 312- 412years, using mean iodine concentrations in milk from this survey79and con- sumption data from the National Dietary and Nutritional Survey.87,88No intakes were estimated for schoolchildren as the available consumption data for this age group are limited and outdated.It is understood that new data to address this point will be available soon. To estimate the currenttotal dietary intake, incorporating the latest concentrations of iodine in milk, the mean popula-tion dietary intake estimated from the 1995 Total Diet Study 89minus the contribution from milk was added to the intakes from milk alone estimated from this survey. These intake estimates frommilk alone and from the total diet are presented in Table 1. We note that the estimate of meanpopulation dietary intake is based on household, rather than individual, consumption. Thereforethe estimate of the non-milk intakes will be biased by the intakes of adults in the household; inconsequence the value added for non-milk sources (123 mg/day - see Table 1) is likely to be anoverestimate for children. (vii) Calculations for adults suggest that the average and high level (97.5th percentile) consumer of milk would ingest 194 and 301 mg/day respectively from the total diet (including milk), whichare both within the guideline intake calculated from the JECFA PMTDI of 0.017 mg/kg b.w. Asdetailed in Table 1 the estimated total dietary intakes for average level consumers of milk in the1 12- 212, 212- 312, and 312- 412age ranges are 221, 215, and 204 mg/day respectively, which are 21 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 21close to the guideline intake. For high level consumers of milk in the 112- 212, 212- 312, and 312- 412age ranges the estimated total dietary intakes are 362, 379, and 330 mg/day respectively, all of which exceed the relevant guideline intake. For high level consumers of milk in the 112- 212and 212- 312age ranges, though not the 312- 412age range, the estimated intake from milk alone exceeds the relevant guideline intake. As shown in Table 1 exceedence of the guideline intake occurs mainlyin the 1 12- 212and 212- 312age ranges and after children reach the age of 312exceedence is restricted to high level consumers only. Recommendations (viii) Our recommendations are: (a) The revised dietary intakes estimated from the results of this survey support our conclusions of September 1997 that monitoring of iodine concentrations in cows' milk should continue; (b) We have been informed that the UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals will be reviewing the toxicity of iodine in due course and we may wish to reconsider these surveyresults in the light of the findings of that group; (c) The revised dietary intakes increase the need for data on the different chemical forms of iodine in cows' milk and infant formulas and on the bioavailability of the iodine iniodophors. We therefore request that we see the results on the studies on the differentchemical forms of iodine in cows' milk and infant formulas at the earliest opportunity and wereiterate our previous recommendation that the bioavailability of the iodine in iodophors isinvestigated. Conclusions (ix) We have made a number of recommendations, including investigation of the bioavailability of iodine from iodophors in milk. However, we conclude that the new data from this latest surveydo not alter our previous advice that the concentrations of iodine in cows' milk are unlikely topose a risk to health, even in those children who are high level consumers. 22 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 22Table 1.1: Estimated dietary iodine intakes of adults and young children Malachite Green and Leucomalachite Green in Farmed Fish 1.18 The Committee has previously reviewed the toxicity of malachite green and was asked to consider the results of a new survey of the concentrations of this compound and its metabolite, leucomalachite green in farmed fish.It prepared the following statement: (i) The Committee has been requested by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to consider the results of recent surveillance for thecompounds malachite green and leucomalachite green in farmed trout. The Committee wasinvited to comment on the results and any possible consequences for the safety of consumers andthe operators of fish farms. Background (ii) The triphenylmethane dye malachite green has been used in aquaculture throughout the world for the treatment of parasitic and fungal infections in fish and shellfish. Within the UnitedKingdom (UK) trout industry it has been used for many years as a general hatchery disinfectant,to treat fungal conditions on trout eggs and for the control of certain ectoparasites.

For example, to estimate th e average total dietary intake for adult consumers during the summer the intake from milk i.e. 46 mg/day, is added to 123 mg/day to give a final value of 169 mg/day 2This guideline intake, calculated for the purposes of this statement, is equivalent to the JECFA PMTDI of 0.017 mg/kg b.w. when expressed on a total body weight basis. For example, for children aged 112- 212years weighing 12.3 kg the PMTDI is equivalent to 210 mg/day (rounded to 2 significant figures) 23 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 23it has been found to be effective in the treatment of 'proliferative kidney disease', a systemic pro- tozoal disease in trout. Leucomalachite green is the major metabolite of malachite green. (iii) Malachite green is used as a dye for fabrics and is freely available. It is not a licensed veterinary medicine and there are no regulations on dosage or mode of use in fish farming. The Committeeunderstands that operators apply a solution of malachite green at the water inlet of the fish tanksor transfer the fish that require treatment to a separate container. Advice has been provided to thefarmed and game fish industries about the precautions that should be taken to reduce the occurrenceof malachite green and its metabolites in the fish that are sold on the retail market ( vide infra ). The 1993 review (iv) In 1993 the VMD sought the advice of the Committee on the possible risk to consumers from residues of malachite green that had been detected in some samples of farmed trout purchased atretail outlets. As only low concentrations, 1 to 7.4 \u00b5g/kg, of malachite green had been detected inabout 7% of the samples the Committee concluded that these residues would not adversely affectthe health of consumers. Nevertheless, the Committee had reservations about a) the chemicalcharacterisation of the malachite green used in toxicological studies and in fish farming, b) simi-larities of the structure of malachite green to compounds that are carcinogenic and/or mutagenic,and c) the existence of evidence of foetotoxicity in rabbits, with there being some evidence tosuggest that it may also be teratogenic. These reservations led the Committee to conclude thatthere were insufficient reliable toxicological data to permit a full safety assessment. 90 (v) The Committee's advice was passed to the Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) in 1994. The VPC noted the Committee's views and agreed with its conclusions. The 1995 review (vi) In 1995 the Committee considered further data from 406 trout samples analysed in three surveys between July 1993 to March 1995. Sixty-seven of the samples, about 16%, contained malachitegreen at concentrations of 2 to 50 \u00b5g/kg. The Committee considered there were still insufficientdata to reach a conclusion about the safety of this substance, and concern was expressed about theapparent increase in residue levels. Although the concentrations of residues found were consideredto be unlikely to affect the health of the consumers if the substance continued to be used, theCommittee recommended that toxicity data should be obtained and, in the first instance, appro-priate genotoxicity studies should be carried out on malachite green and its major conversionproducts in fish, the carbinol derivative and leucomalachite green. 91 Subsequent actions (vii) The Committee has been informed that, in the light of the results in 1995, the British T rout Association (BTA) issued a briefing note to their members stressing the need to ensure that anytrout placed on the market did not contain residues of malachite green. As part of a package ofprecautions, the BTA advised members that malachite green should not be administered to fryover 5 grams in weight. In support of this initiative, the VMD wrote to all registered trout farmersin the UK in July 1995 underlining its concerns about the results and repeating the BTA advice. (viii) In 1996, the BTA further advised its members to limit malachite green to use only in the hatchery, on eggs and, if essential, to alevins and first feeding fry on grounds of welfare. So that due regard 24 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 24for consumer safety should be taken into account, the fish should only be sold on to the next stage of the production chain once they were confirmed as being free of malachite green residues. TheVMD endorsed this advice by writing in August 1996 to all registered trout farmers in the UKand to over 500 fisheries producing trout for game. Additional survey data (ix) We have been informed that malachite green was detected in 15 of 208 samples tested in a survey of retail trout in 1996. In 1997 there were only two trout, out of 137 tested, which containedresidues of malachite green (Table 1.2). Subsequently a new method of analysis, capable of deter-mining both malachite green and leucomalachite green, was tested on the samples from 31 of the137 trout that had been tested in 1997. These samples were randomly selected although theyincluded the two which had contained malachite green residues. Residues of leucomalachite greenwere detected and quantified in seven samples. The most recently received sample which had beenpositive for malachite green still contained residues of malachite green and also the highest con-centration of leucomalachite green (Table 1.3). Surveillance for residues of malachite green andleucomalachite green in trout has been undertaken in 1998 using the new analytical method. Ofthe twenty seven samples collected in January to August, one was found to contain both malachitegreen and leucomalachite green and five others were found to contain leucomalachite green alone(Table 1.2). (x) We have queried whether there is information about any additional sources of malachite green or leucomalachite green that might result in their accumulation in the fish but have been advised thatsuch information is not available. Additional toxicological data (xi) We have had the opportunity of considering full reports of short-term (28 day) range-finding studies in rats and mice which have been carried out on malachite green and leucomalachite greenby the National Center for Toxicological Research in the United States (US) in preparation forpriority carcinogenicity testing of these compounds as part of the US National ToxicologyProgram. 92,93 (xii) The results of these studies show that leucomalachite green caused a greater number of, and more severe, effects in rodents as compared to malachite green. Changes in body weight and liver tobody weight ratio generally occurred at lower doses of leucomalachite green as compared to mala-chite green. In male rats, a dose-related increase in midzonal and centrilobular hepatocyte vac-uolisation was observed in the groups fed leucomalachite green at 580 and 1160milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg), whereas hepatocyte vacuolisation was observed in the malachitegreen-treated rats of either gender only in the group fed 1200 mg/kg diet. The dose levels of 1200mg/kg of malachite green and 1160 mg/kg of leucomalachite green are approximately equimolarand were the highest doses tested. (xiii) Morphological evidence of cell death in the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder was observed in all female mice fed 1160 mg/kg diet of leucomalachite green, but not in female ormale mice fed 1200 mg/kg diet of malachite green. (xiv) There were histopathological changes in the thyroid glands of some female mice and male rats fed the highest concentrations of leucomalachite green. However, the number of animals affected wasnot statistically significant. Changes in the concentrations of total thyroxine (T4) and thyroid 25 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 25stimulating hormone indicative of alterations of thyroid function were observed in male rats fed leucomalachite green at 1160 mg/kg diet for 4 or 21 days. Such changes were not observed in malerats fed malachite green at 1200 mg/kg diet although alterations to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine andT4 concentrations were observed in the female rats after 21 days at this dietary concentration. (xv) In a separate study, the formation of liver DNA adducts was demonstrated by 32P-postlabelling in rats or mice fed either 100 or 600 mg/kg diet of malachite green for 28 days. Increased concen-trations of adducts were observed in the livers of rats fed 96 or 580 mg/kg of leucomalachite greenfor the same period, but not in the livers of mice. (xvi) Concerns about the possible genotoxicity of malachite green and its major conversion products, i.e. leucomalachite green and the carbinol, had led to our 1995 recommendation that appropri-ate genotoxicity studies should be carried out on these compounds. The additional data availablenow have led to our seeking the views of our sister committee, the Committee on Mutagenicityof Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, on the possible mutagenicity ofmalachite green and leucomalachite green. They have advised us that it would be prudent toconsider both malachite green and leucomalachite green as potential in vivo mutagens. 94The full statement of the Committee on Mutagenicity is given below. Conclusions (xvii) (a) We notethat recent surveillance data from the UK, together with a number of other studies, indicate that the predominant residue derived from malachite green in trout from fish farmsis leucomalachite green rather than the parent substance. We notealso that the possible presence of the carbinol derivative of malachite green has not been monitored and that thereare no recent toxicological data on this compound. (b) We recommend that the results of surveillance for malachite green and leucomalachite green should report separately the detected concentrations of these compounds. (c) We notethat leucomalachite green was not measured in surveys of farmed trout in the UK carried out between 1993 and 1996 inclusive. (d) We are concerned that residues of malachite green continue to be detected in farmed trout. The toxicology data are insufficient to allow us to reach a full conclusion about theimplications of these residues of malachite green and its metabolites for the health of theconsumer of farmed trout. However, we notethat, by comparison with the data provided at our review of 1995, there may have been a decline in the proportion of fish sampled that arefound to contain residues of malachite green, see Table 1.2. We are aware that malachitegreen and leucomalachite green are currently undergoing carcinogenicity tests in the UnitedStates. We consider that, in the light of the opinion of the Committee on Mutagenicity (that it would be prudent to assume that malachite green and leucomalachite green are potentialin vivo mutagens), there must be some concern about the health implications for those operators of fish farms who may be exposed to high concentrations of these compounds. 26 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 26Table 1.2: Results of recent Surveillance in the United Kingdom by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate for Residues of Malachite Green and Leucomalachite Green in Trout Muscle Table 1.3: Results of reanalysis of samples of Trout Muscle collected in 1997 for residues of Malachite Green and Leucomalachite Green using the new analytical method Mathematical Modelling 1.19 During 1999 the Committee held its first open meeting.

(ii) We have been informed that the concentrations of arsenic, copper, lead, tin and zinc in the infant foods did not exceed the statutory limits for those elements. (iii) The Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has set Provisional Maximum Tolerable Daily Intakes or ProvisionalTolerable Weekly Intakes for the metals aluminium, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, tin andzinc. 96-98We note that the estimated intakes by UK infants of these metals, other than zinc, in infant foods do not exceed the JECFA tolerable intakes.96 (iv) Although the upper range of the estimated intake of zinc by an infant aged 0-6 months exceeds the JECFA Provisional Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake we are aware that there is a nutritionalrequirement for zinc such that an infant consuming the Reference Nutrient Intake for zinc willexceed the JECFA tolerable intake. However, JECFA tolerable intakes are intended to applythroughout an individual's life with the exclusion of the 12 week period after birth. In addition,all the relevant samples contained a concentration which was within the statutory concentrationrange for zinc in infant formulas. (v) The measured concentrations of antimony, chromium, cobalt, nickel and selenium in the infant foods are all consistent with earlier surveys of foodstuffs or infant formulas. For nickel the esti-mated high level (97.5 thpercentile) intake by infants aged 6-12 months would exceed by 2% a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) derived by the World Health Organization. However, we note thatthis TDI was derived using three 10-fold uncertainty factors to accommodate the lack of adequatedata. 99 Conclusions (vi) We notethat the estimates of intake by infants rely either on assumptions about feeding patterns (infants aged 0-6 months) or on survey data which may now be outdated (infants aged 6-12months). We would welcome new studies to determine the patterns of consumption of foodstuffsin infants. (vii) However, we consider that the consumption of the infant foods sampled in the survey will not result in the intake of such quantities of any of the analysed elements such as would give concernfor the health of infants. 28 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 28Methylcyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl 1.21 The Committee was asked to advise on the toxicological implications of the possible use of the manganese- based additive methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl as an alternative to lead additives in petrol. The useof the additive would lead to a 15% increase in the ambient concentrations of manganese. This compound hadalready been considered as an additive in diesel fuel by the Committee in 1995. 100 1.22 When this topic was first considered members had particular concerns about: a) the possible effects of man-ganese in susceptible sub-populations such as young children; b) the possible effects of manganese in anaemicsubjects; c) whether particle size was important in determining the exposure of individuals to manganese; d) thelack of information on the relative proportions of manganese intake that were derived from air and the diet, and e)the need for clarification of the calculations that had been used to predict the increase of ambient concentrationsof manganese. 1.23 These concerns were referred back to the company who sent a reply addressing these points. The Committee agreed that, of the five points raised, two (the possible effects of manganese in anaemic subjects and whether particlesize was important in determining the exposure of individuals to manganese) had not been addressed adequately. Itwas agreed that the increase in the ambient concentrations of manganese was unlikely to constitute a risk to health.However, members recommended that a study be undertaken to assess the exposure to manganese of groups ofworkers heavily exposed to vehicle emissions, both before and after the introduction of the fuel additive. Multielement Survey of Wild Fungi and Blackberries 1.24 A group of 12 elements were analysed in samples of fungi and blackberries which had been collected in thewild ('free foods'). The Committee produced the following statement: (i) We have considered a draft Food Surveillance Information Sheet 101describing the results of a survey carried out for the MAFF/DH Joint Food Safety and Standards Group on the concentra-tions of 12 elements (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel,platinum, tin, titanium and zinc) in free food, namely wild edible fungi and blackberries. (ii) Wild edible fungi were collected from 34 locations and wild blackberries from 48 locations within Great Britain. Samples were collected from urban and rural areas, and for blackberries also closeto and away from roads. These free foods were then analysed for total concentrations of theseelements, though no attempt was made to distinguish between different chemical species of eachelement. For example, the reported arsenic concentration is the sum of organic and inorganicarsenic. Results of the survey (iii) There were wide variations in the concentrations of the elements found in the different samples of free foods that were analysed. For a number of the elements there were differences when con-centrations in samples from the different locations were compared. We notethat the results for elements that may partially originate from vehicle exhausts, i.e.lead (from leaded petrol) and platinum (from catalytic converters), are indicative of higher concentrations in samples from local-ities with a greater density of motor traffic. We also notethat chromium and tin concentrations appeared to be higher in fungi from urban areas whereas cadmium and zinc concentrations werehigher in fungi from rural areas. For blackberries, the arsenic, chromium and tin concentrationswere higher in urban samples, while manganese concentrations were higher in rural samples. 29 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 29(iv) We notethat there are no legal limits for metals and other elements in free foods that are collected for personal consumption. We also notethat the concentrations of arsenic in the samples of fungi and blackberries were all less than 1 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg), the statutory limit for com-mercial foods. Similarly, the concentrations of tin in the samples were all much less than the legallimit of 200 mg/kg that applies to commercial products. (v) Five of the thirty-four samples of fungi had lead concentrations higher than the legal limit of 1 mg/kg that would apply to commercial samples of fungi. However, we notethat total lead intake of individuals who are high level (97.5th percentile) consumers of both wild edible fungi andblackberries suggest that such individuals would not exceed the Provisional Tolerable WeeklyIntake (PTWI) for lead that has been determined by the Joint Food and AgricultureOrganization/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). 102 (vi) JECFA have also determined PTWIs for cadmium, mercury, and tin.96,97Provisional Maximum Tolerable Daily Intakes (PMTDI) have been established by JECFA for copper and zinc.96In addition, a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for nickel has been established by the World HealthOrganization (WHO). 99Estimates of intake of these elements show that the 97.5thpercentile consumer would not exceed the appropriate tolerable intake. (vii) Estimates of total dietary intake of arsenic suggest that a high level consumer of wild edible fungi and blackberries might exceed the JECFA PTWI.97However, the JECFA PTWI would be exceeded by only 8%. Furthermore, it is estimated that the intake of arsenic via the consumptionof wild edible fungi and blackberries only contributes 5% to the total estimated dietary intake. Aswas indicated in paragraph ii, estimated intakes of arsenic from the consumption of free foods aswell as from the rest of the diet are for total ( i.e.organic and inorganic) arsenic. Inorganic arsenic is more toxic than organic arsenic and this is reflected in the JECFA PTWI, which applies to inor-ganic arsenic only. However, most of the arsenic in the diet is present as the less toxic organicarsenic compounds, with fish and shellfish being the major sources. (viii) Neither JECFA nor the WHO have determined tolerable intakes of chromium, manganese, platinum or titanium. We notethat titanium was included as an indicator of surface contamina- tion of the samples with soil and that there are no estimated total dietary intakes for titanium withwhich to compare intakes from the consumption of free foods. We have been informed that theconcentrations of chromium, manganese and platinum in the wild edible mushrooms and black-berries would not contribute appreciably to the total intake of those elements from dietary sourcesas estimated from the Total Diet Studies of 1994 and 1997. 103-105 Conclusion (ix) Estimated total dietary intakes of the elements cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, tin, and zinc for high level consumers of wild edible fungi and blackberries do not exceed the appropriatetolerable intake and are therefore not a health concern. Although estimated total dietary intakesof arsenic may exceed the tolerable intake, this value applies to inorganic arsenic only whereasmost of the arsenic in the diet is in the less toxic organic forms. Therefore, we do not consider theconcentrations of arsenic in free foods to be a cause for concern. There are no relevant tolerableintakes for the metals chromium, manganese, platinum and titanium against which to compareestimated dietary intakes. However, where the results of previous surveys are available, the con-centrations of each element in wild edible fungi and blackberries would not contribute apprecia-bly to the total dietary intake of that element. 30 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 30(x) Therefore, we conclude that the concentrations of the elements arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, platinum, tin, titanium and zinc in fungi and black-berries collected in the wild do not provide any cause for concern for individuals eating thesefoods. Multiple Chemical Sensitivity 1.25 The Health and Safety Executive sought the advice of the COT on a review of multiple chemical sensitivity(MCS) that had been commissioned from the Institute of Occupational Medicine at Edinburgh (IOM). TheCommittee were also provided with a draft report by the United States Interagency Workgroup on MCS and a bookchapter in press on the topic. 1.26 Members noted that the IOM review was detailed and informative and that there was a degree of overlap between the report and areas under consideration by the Committee's Food Intolerance Working Group. It wasnoted that MCS was a condition largely defined by the patient and that there was no consistent pattern of symptomsor exposure data to define the condition. 1.27 The Committee agreed that, on the basis of current knowledge, there was insufficient evidence to make comments on potential mechanisms or to recommend further research in this area. Openness 1.28 New procedures for greater openness of the work of the Committee were instituted at the start of this year.They include publication of the minutes and Committee papers, subject to commercial confidentiality. These pro-cedures, which apply to all three committees, are described elsewhere in this report. Organophosphates 1.29 During the year the Committee's Working Group on Organophosphates prepared a draft report which wassubmitted to and endorsed by the Committee. The final report was published in November. 106 1.30 Organophosphates are a group of compounds widely used in veterinary medicines (particularly sheep dips)or in pesticide products for agricultural, horticultural or public hygiene use. In addition, one compound (malathion)is used in human medicine for head lice treatment. 1.31 The conclusions in the COT report are that the evidence did not support the view that low-dose exposure to organophosphates caused clinically significant neurophysiological effects or peripheral neuropathy. 1.32 The available data indicated that any risks involved in using sheep dips arose predominantly from exposure to the concentrated formulation. Subsequently, the Veterinary Products Committee recommended that current organophos-phate sheep dip products be withdrawn pending the introduction of new containers that minimised exposure. 1.33 In the case of shampoos for head lice treatment there are no concentrated products available and the diluted products are for intermittent use only. The Committee on Safety of Medicines advised that there is no need for anyregulatory action to restrict use of these products. 31 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 31PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in Marine Fish and Fish Products 1.34 The Committee reviewed the results of a surveillance exercise for the presence of 'dioxin-like' compounds in fish and fish products, the following statement was prepared: (i) We have been informed of the results of a survey conducted by the Joint Food Safety and Standards Group of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Health. Samplesof marine fish, fish fingers and fish cakes were obtained from various sources between November1995 and January 1996. All samples were analysed for the presence of the environmental conta-minants known polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). 107 Tolerable Daily Intake (ii) In 1992 we endorsed a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (2378-TCDD) of 10 picograms/kilogram body weight (pg/kg b.w.) which had been recom-mended by the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe. We recom-mended also that when considering mixtures of PCDDs and PCDFs the TDI could be regardedas being expressed in Toxic Equivalents of 2378-TCDD (TEQs), calculated using internationallyagreed Toxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs) for various PCDD and PCDF congeners. Because of theaccumulation of such compounds within the body and their long elimination half-lives, we con-sidered that it was appropriate to regard the 10 pg/kg b.w. figure as a time-weighted average tol-erable intake. 108 (iii) In 1997, as part of a consideration of the health hazards of PCBs, we considered that the use of TEFs for certain coplanar (\"dioxin-like\") PCBs offered a pragmatic approach to the evaluationof these compounds and that they should be considered in combination with the PCDDs andPCDFs. 109 (iv) Recently, we have reviewed the data used by a 1997 consultation of the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health (ECEH) to derive new Toxic Equivalency Factors (WHO-TEFs) rec-ommended for certain PCDD, PCDF and PCB congeners and endorse the use of these WHO-TEFs to calculate the TEQs in analysed samples. (v) We are aware that a recent WHO International Program on Chemical Safety/ECEH consultation has recommended that a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of the PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs, is 1-4 pg TEQ/kg b.w./day. 111,112 We have not yet had the opportunity to review the data used by the consultation to derive the recently recommended WHO TDI. We willundertake such a review when a full report of the consultation is available and will consider whetherany specific subgroups of the United Kingdom (UK) population might be particularly at risk. In theinterim we have considered the surveillance data using both the current UK TDI and the recentlyrecommended WHO TDI. Evaluation of exposure Adults (vi) We have been provided with estimates of the intake of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs by individuals eating marine fish as part of their diet.107We note that the measured concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in fish and fish products do not result in the average consumer exceeding eitherthe current TDI or the upper value of the recently recommended WHO TDI. However, a high 32 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 32level (97.5thpercentile) consumer of fish in combination with the rest of the diet, might ingest 5.6 pg TEQ/kg b.w. per day, because of the contribution from oily fish ( e.g.herring, mackerel and salmon). This is slightly greater than the newly recommended upper value of the WHO TDI. Schoolchildren (vii) Estimates of intakes of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs by 10-15 year old schoolchildren based on a study of the diets of British schoolchildren113suggest that the average consumer in this age group will not exceed either the current UK TDI or the upper value of the recently recommended WHOTDI. We note that the high level (97.5 thpercentile) consumer in this age group has an estimated total daily intake of 4.7 pg TEQs/kg b.w. per day, just exceeding the upper value of the recentlyrecommended WHO TDI. (viii) However, we note that the data concerning the amounts and the various types of fish and fish products consumed by this age group are limited, as the survey population contained few childrenwho consumed certain fish species. Therefore, these estimated intakes should be viewed withcaution. Toddlers (ix) A survey of the diet of children aged 1 12-412has been carried out.114However, because the detailed records of 'toddler-specific' foods consumed by the survey participants have not yet been codedinto the appropriate species of fish, there is a lack of data to provide reliable estimates of dietaryintake of the PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs by children of this age range. We will review this matterwhen such data are available. Instead, we have been informed of the results of theoretical calcula-tions made by scaling the consumption of fish and fish products by adults by the ratio of the caloricintakes of toddlers and adults so as to provide an estimate of the intake of PCDDs, PCDFs andPCBs from fish and the rest of the diet by the toddler age group. 107We note that these estimates do not allow for possible differences in the proportion of fish in the diets of toddlers and adultsnor for possible differences in the types of fish consumed by toddlers as compared to adults. (x) Calculations using this method suggest that the average intake of a toddler would exceed the upper value of the recently recommended WHO TDI. The total intakes of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBsare estimated as ranging from 5.5-6.5 pg TEQ/kg b.w. per day, depending on age. A toddler whowas consuming at the 97.5 thpercentile level would have total intakes of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs estimated as being in the range of 8.3-10 pg TEQ/kg b.w. per day. As mentioned above, weconsider that these estimates may be unreliable. Environmental factors (xi) We have previously noted109that dietary exposure to PCBs in the UK has declined, as evidenced by a decrease in the concentrations of PCBs between Total Diet Study samples collected in 1982and those collected in 1992. This is compatible with reductions in the concentrations of PCDDsand PCDFs in samples of human milk collected in developed countries between 1988 and1993. 115We anticipate that the measures already taken in the UK to reduce emissions to the envi- ronment will result in a continued decline. We note that the WHO-IPCS/ECEH consultationrecommended that continued efforts should be made to reduce exposure towards the lower endof the range of the TDI that it had determined. This recommendation was made because of theconsultation's recognition \"that subtle effects might already be occurring in the general popula-tion in developed countries\". 33 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 33Nutritional aspects (xii) We have taken into account the advice of the Department of Health's Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (COMA) that there should be an increase in the consumption of oily fishto an average of one portion per person per week. This recommendation was made on the basis ofevidence that increasing the intake of certain long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (for which oilyfish are a rich source) reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. 116Adherence to this advice is likely to provide health benefits for most adults without exceeding the recently recommended WHO TDIand therefore we do not discourage the consumption of oily fish because of their content of thePCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs. Conclusions (xiii) a) We endorse the use of WHO-TEFs for PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in the calculation of the TEQs for these compounds in analysed samples. b) We will be undertaking a full review of the data considered by the WHO-IPCS/ECEH consultation in determining its recently recommended TDI. c) We welcome the evidence that the average UK adult consumer will not exceed either the current UK TDI or the upper level of the recently recommended WHO TDI for PCDDs,PCDFs and PCBs. d) We notethat a high level adult consumer of oily fish will have an intake of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs which falls between the current UK TDI and the newly recommended WHOTDI. We note, however, that such a consumer will be eating more fish than is required tomeet the recommendation made by COMA on health grounds. e) We notethat the estimated intakes of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs by schoolchildren and toddlers do not exceed the current UK TDI but that it is possible that some children, inparticular toddlers, may exceed the newly recommended WHO TDI. We also notethat there are assumptions made in deriving the estimated exposures which mean that they should beviewed with caution. However, we reiterate our view that further monitoring of concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in components of the UK diet should beundertaken to confirm that the trend to lower values continues. f) In order better to assess the implications of the intake of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs for the health of children, we would wish to review the data when additional information on thetypes and quantities of fish consumed by this age group is available. g) We recommend that adults adhere to the COMA advice to eat one portion of oily fish each week as this will confer health benefits and yet will not result in the majority of individualsexceeding either the recently recommended WHO TDI or the current UK TDI for PCDDs,PCDFs and PCBs. 34 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 34Phytoestrogens 1.35 The Committee reviewed the toxicity of phytoestrogens in 1996 as part of a consideration of a MAFF report on Inherent Natural Toxicants in Food.117At that time the Committee had noted that phytoestrogens could cause adverse effects in animals and had concluded that young children who consumed soya-based infant formulas couldbe exposed to concentrations of phytoestrogens that might elicit biological effects. The Committee had recom-mended that research should be undertaken to determine whether the ingestion of soya-based infant formulascarried any risk for infants. 1.36 A extensive programme of research had been started and members were informed that some of the results of the programme were being reported at an international meeting. Since a considerable quantity of data would beavailable within the next year it was agreed that this could best be reviewed in a Working Group established by theCommittee. Potatoes Genetically Modified to Produce Galanthus nivalis Lectin 1.37 The Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes sought the advice of the COT on toxicological aspects of studies involving genetically modified potatoes as components of the diet of rats. The Committeeprepared the following statement: (i) The Committee was asked to provide advice to the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) on the toxicological aspects of certain studies which had been carried out atthe Rowett Research Institute. These unpublished studies involved the administration to rats ofvarious potato-containing diets. The diets contained potatoes either (the bean lectin, Concanavalin A) or potatoes which had been genetically modified to produce the snowdrop lectin. (ii) These studies had received considerable publicity following statements about adverse effects on the rats made on a television programme. Accordingly, the Secretariat of the ACNFP had soughtto obtain copies of detailed scientific reports relating to these studies. However, it had only beenable to obtain certain documents that were already in the public domain and a manuscript sub-mitted for publication by Dr Stanley Ewen and Dr Arpad Pusztai. The documents that were con-sidered by the Committee on Toxicity are listed below. (iii) The Committee was particularly asked to consider the significance of: - the effects reported on the body and organ weights of the rats, - the results of the lymphocyte proliferation assay, and - the histological changes reported in the gastrointestinal tract. (iv) Dr Pusztai and Dr Ewen were invited to attend the meeting of the Committee. Only Dr Ewen was able to be present. He made a presentation to the Committee on the histopathology of thegastrointestinal tract of rats from one of the studies on the genetically modified potatoes. He alsoanswered questions from Committee members during the subsequent discussions. 35 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 35The Committee's Discussions (v) In the course of their consideration the Committee indicated that certain important information about the studies was not provided in the documentation available. Although Dr Ewen was ableto provide additional details on the histopathology he was not able to provide answers to ques-tions relating to the design of the studies or matters relating to the body and organ weight changesand the lymphocyte proliferation assay. (vi) In response to a specific question, the Committee was informed by the ACNFP Secretariat that it was understood that the genetically modified lines of potatoes were not intended for release onthe market and that an application for such a release had not been made to the ACNFP . Body and organ weight changes (vii) The Committee recognised that an exact knowledge of the composition of the diet and the use of appropriate statistical methods were crucial to the interpretation of the changes in body and organweights that had been recorded in the studies. The known adverse effects on the health of labora-tory rats of raw potato starch in the diet were pointed out. In addition, the importance of minorchanges in composition and palatability of diets in determining the body weight in the rat wasstressed. Although it was clear that attempts had been made to ensure that the animals had receivedan adequate diet, there was a lack of critical information that would allow the Committee to satisfythemselves that this had been achieved. In relation to this, concern was expressed about the markeddifferences in composition of the genetically modified potatoes used in some experiments in com-parison with control potatoes, which could have had physiological and metabolic effects on therats irrespective of the genetic modification. Lymphocyte proliferation assay (viii) The variability of the results from this assay has been described in the report of the Audit com- mittee of the Rowett Research Institute.118The Committee noted that this variability meant that large numerical differences would not necessarily indicate a statistically significant effect and thatit was necessary to relate any changes in the immune system to those occurring in other organs ofthe animals. Histopathology (ix) Dr Ewen made a presentation of the histopathology of the gastro-intestinal tract. In this he showed slides recording changes to the thickness of the mucosa in the stomach and sections of the smallintestine occurring after feeding of diets containing genetically modified potato. A commonfeature was elongation of the crypt and villi of the jejunum and ileum. The Committee enquiredas to whether measures that would discriminate between hypertrophy and hyperplasia had beenmade. They were informed that this had not yet been done. The histopathology related only tothe gastrointestinal tract of the rats from one of the studies, 119it was pointed out that it would be usual for a toxicology study to have incorporated a full examination of all the major organs. TheCommittee was of the view that this would have provided an opportunity for seeking an expla-nation of any changes to the immune system or of organ weights. 36 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 36Conclusions (x) On the basis of the information made available, the Committee expressed concern about the design of the studies, e.g. the limited numbers of animals used and the adequacy of the diets. Itappeared that a limited set of studies had been used to address many questions relating to nutri-tional, toxicological and immunological matters. The design of the studies may not have beenadequate for this purpose. (xi) It was agreed that the studies could be used to provide an indication of the investigations and pro- cedures that would be needed in any future work in this area. However, these studies could not beused, by themselves, for defining the effects on the rat of potatoes containing the transgene for theGalanthus nivalis lectin.

Letter of 23 April 1999 to Dr JB Greig, COT Secretariat.124 Short and Long Chain Triacyl Glycerol Molecules (Salatrims) 1.38 In 1997 the Committee had commented, at the request of the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods andProcesses (ACNFP), on the toxicological aspects of a voluntary submission of the Salatrims to the ACNFP . 125Since that date the European Commission's Regulation on Novel Foods and Novel Food Ingredients has come into forceand, in 1999, the company submitted the product to the United Kingdom Competent Authority for considerationunder these regulations. The company had addressed matters of concern to the Committee that had been identi-fied in the 1997 COT statement and the additional data was considered by the COT. The Committee prepared thefollowing statement: (i) In 1997 we issued a statement 125on specific aspects of a submission made to the Advisory Committee for Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) on Salatrims, a family of low calorie fat mate-rials. We had been asked by ACNFP to comment on the toxicological aspects of the data providedat that time under the voluntary system that existed for the evaluation of novel foods. 37 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 37(ii) We concluded that there were three areas of concern that needed to be addressed further, namely: (a) additional pharmacokinetic studies were required to evaluate blood levels of short chain fatty acids in volunteers following consumption of individual Salatrim products before anyconclusions could be drawn regarding the teratogenic risk of Salatrims; (b) a No Observable Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) should be determined for effects of Salatrims on enzyme markers for liver dysfunction in humans; and (c) a NOAEL should be determined for effects of Salatrims on gastrointestinal function in humans. (iii) The EC Regulation on Novel Foods and Novel Food Ingredients was introduced in May 1997, after the initial consideration of Salatrims in 1995-1997. As Salatrims were not on the market inEurope at that time, they are regarded as novel foods and therefore they require clearance underthe Regulation before they can be sold in Europe. An application has now been made to the UKCompetent Authority for such clearance 126and ACNFP has asked for our further advice on the additional information and analysis included in the submission to meet the concerns that we iden-tified earlier. (iv) Our first statement described the toxicological and clinical data available on Salatrims in 1997. This statement, which needs to be read in conjunction with our previous opinion, discusses theadditional data and analyses provided in the submission made under the Novel Food Regulationin response to the concerns that we had identified. Levels of short chain fatty acids and possible teratogenic risk (v) The Committee had previously expressed a concern that the release of butyric acid from Salatrim which is rich in this short chain fatty acid might be sufficient to cause a rise in plasma butyratelevels. This possibility needed to be examined in the light of in vitro data on possible teratogenic effects of high levels of butyric acid. A new study has been conducted 127in which the post-prandial response to a load of 30 grams (g) of butyrate-based Salatrim (known as 4SO) was investigated todetermine, amongst other effects, whether free butyrate would reach the general circulation.Plasma was analysed for butyric acid at regular intervals up to 360 minutes after dosing and at notime could free butyric acid be detected. (vi) The Committee was satisfied by these data. Effects on enzyme markers for liver dysfunction in humans (vii) The Committee had asked that further information be provided to enable a NOAEL to be set for the effects of Salatrims on enzyme markers of liver dysfunction seen previously in the free-livingclinical study. The company has provided further statistical analyses of the serum enzyme datafrom this study and expert assessments of the implications of those statistical analyses. (viii) Small, statistically significant increases were recorded in the mean activities of the enzymes aspar- tate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at the beginning of the exposureperiod in the free-living clinical study, although the mean values for the treatment groups did notfall outside the normal ranges for these enzymes at the laboratory conducting the study. TheCommittee noted that there was some concordance in the increases in liver enzymes AST and ALTwithin individuals and that some temporal trends were apparent. The Committee had also noted 38 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 38that it was possible that the individuals who withdrew from the study may have been atypical and that this could have contributed to the variability of the data. However, the company submittedinformation that shows that those individuals who withdrew from the study, did so mainly becauseof adverse gastro-intestinal effects resulting from consumption of 60 g/day Salatrim. In addition,further analysis of the enzyme activities for those withdrawing from the study in comparison tothose remaining shows that there were no significant differences in changes above baseline forserum hepatic enzyme activities whether or not those subjects withdrawing from the study wereincluded. (ix) In addition, data from a further study conducted by Nestel and colleagues 128were provided. In this five-week crossover study, following a low-fat control phase, subjects consumed diets con-taining margarine rich either in Salatrim or in palm oil ('palmitate'). These subjects were selectedon the basis of their having an elevated blood cholesterol level and the study was designed pri-marily to provide information on effects of Salatrim on blood lipid levels. However, additionalanalyses of serum enzymes from blood samples taken pre-dose and at the end of each dietary phaseshowed that mean activities of AST and ALT, and other indices of hepatic function (g-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase and lactic dehydrogenase) were no different at the end of theSalatrim and 'palmitate' dietary phases. Small increases in serum enzymes were noted after the'palmitate' dietary phase in some subjects, which were of a similar magnitude to those seen in somesubjects consuming Salatrim in the free-living clinical study described above. (x) The Committee concluded that consumption of high doses of Salatrim did result in slight increases in AST and ALT activities in serum, but noted that these increases were within thenormal reference range. The further analyses of the enzyme data satisfied the Committee that therewere no differences in the trends seen whether those withdrawing from the study were includedor not. These enzyme changes, in the absence of any other indications of liver damage, were notconsidered to represent a clear toxic effect. The data from the five-week crossover study 128provided reassurance of a lack of any clear adverse hepatic effect. However, the Committee noted that thereported studies did not include investigations in children or in those with pre-existing liverdisease. Effects on gastrointestinal function in humans (xi) The Committee had noted previously that gastrointestinal effects had been recorded in a number of subjects consuming Salatrim and had asked that further information be provided to enable aNOAEL to be determined. A further analysis of these observations was submitted by the company.The company suggested that the gastrointestinal disturbances reported were the consequence ofsudden changes from an absorbable diet to one containing significant amounts of unabsorbablematerial. Metabolism of Salatrims rich in short chain fatty acids might result in rapid release ofcholecystokinin, which would lead to slow gastric emptying, nausea and bloating. Analysis of thereasons for subjects withdrawing from the study shows that adverse gastrointestinal symptoms(such as nausea, cramps and gas) were the predominant reason for withdrawal from the study inthe 60 g/day Salatrim group. However, there was no clear evidence of any increase in the incidenceof such effects at intakes of 30 or 45 g/day Salatrim. (xii) The Committee considered that the gastrointestinal disturbances seen after consumption of high doses of Salatrim could be the result of individual intolerances, noting the considerable variationbetween individuals and their tolerance to fibre and other poorly digested substrates. Nevertheless,these effects were seen in a significant proportion of individuals after consumption of 60 g/daySalatrim and needed to be considered in the context of estimates for adults of a mean intake of 11g Salatrim/day and of a 97.5 thpercentile intake of 33g Salatrim/day. Salatrims are intended for use 39 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 39in reduced calorie foods aimed at individuals choosing a diet for the control of weight.126The main target consumers would be adults over 16 years of age and the intake estimates therefore werederived only for adults using commercially available databases on UK food consumption in con-junction with information on the types of food in which Salatrim would be used and the likelylevels of inclusion. The application under the Novel Food Regulation is restricted to use in con-fectionery and baked goods only. (xiii) The Committee was of the view that the gastrointestinal effects seen were likely to be linked to intolerances to large amounts of this material rather than any specific toxic effect. However, gas-trointestinal effects might be more common in children because of their relatively higher nutrientrequirement and dietary intake. The Committee further concluded that it was not possible to setany no effect level on the basis of such subjective end points. Conclusions (xiv) On the basis of the new data and analyses now provided, the Committee concluded that: (a) consumption of Salatrim did not result in any elevation in plasma butyrate levels and thus did not pose any teratogenic risk; (b) consumption of high doses of Salatrim did result in slight increases in AST and ALT activities in serum, although these increases were within the normal reference range. There were nodifferences in the trends seen whether those dropping out of the study were included or not.These changes in enzyme activities, in the absence of any other indications of liver damage,were not considered to represent a clear toxic effect. The data from the five-week crossoverstudy in humans provided an additional reassurance of the lack of any clear adverse effect; (c) the gastrointestinal effects reported were likely to be linked to individual intolerances to large amounts of this material rather than to any adverse toxic effect. Furthermore, it is notpossible to set any no effect level on the basis of such subjective end points. (xv) The Committee noted that neither children nor those with pre-existing liver disease were included in the trial groups. However, the Committee understands that products containing Salatrimwould be aimed at adults choosing a diet for the control of weight. 40 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 401999 Membership of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment Chairman Professor H F Woods Professor of MedicineDivision of Molecular and Genetic MedicineUniversity of Sheffield Members Professor P Aggett MB ChB MSc DCH Vice Chairman.

This advice is provided to Government Departments and Regulatory Agencies.The COM is made up of independent scientists and observers from Government Departments supported by a secretariat from the Department of Health. The secretariat provides the COM withcomprehensive data packages upon which the Committee members use their expertise to evaluate both specificchemicals and the effectiveness of test methodologies used. During the year, the COM provided advice on the environmental contaminant 2, 3, 7, 8 - tetrachloro-dibenzo- p- dioxin, (TCDD) and 3-monochloropropane 1,2-diol (3-MCPD) which may occur as a contaminant in flocculantsused during water treatment. The COM also provided advice on the air pollutant ozone and malachite green andleucomalachite green which are used to control parasitic and fungal infections in fish and shell fish. The Committee'sadvice on 2-chlorobenzylidene malonotrile (CS) and CS Spray was published as part of a joint COT/COC/COMstatement. The Committee has undertaken a major revision and updating of their 1989 advice on a strategy forevaluating chemicals for mutagenicity, this resulted in an additional meeting to specially progress this work. Regarding test methodology the Committee considered the role of certain specific mutations in tumours as markers for chemical induced mutagenicity. Major changes in Committee procedures during the year to increase trans-parency of operations has lead to the publication of agendas prior to meetings and minutes and statements whencompleted. Thus, the conclusions reached by the Committee given in this Annual Report are already available onthe COM web site (http://www.doh.gov.uk/com.htm). Members were also pleased to welcome a Lay Member tothe Committee during this year.

It is used in freshwater fisheries for the treatment of external fungal and other infections, its main use beingto stop fungal growth on the eggs. The COT have asked for advice on the mutagenicity of malachite green and thelipophilic metabolite leucomalachite green. In particular the COT has asked for advice on results from recentNational Toxicology Programme (NTP) 32P-post-labelling studies (sub-acute) carried out with range-finding studies prior to initiating carcinogenicity bioassays on malachite green and leucomalachite green in rats and mice. 2.2 The Committee commented on the paucity of the available mutagenicity data, particularly in respect of leu- comalachite green. In many instances lack of information on the purity of the malachite green tested is a particu-lar problem in assessing the adequacy of the available information. Members agreed that the structure of bothmalachite green and leucomalachite green contained groupings which provide structural alerts for potential muta-genicity and thus it was important to evaluate the potential mutagenicity of both malachite green and its lipophilicmetabolite leucomalachite green. Members also noted the results from the 1997 surveillance investigations con-ducted for the Veterinary Medicines Directorate which, for the first time, present information on residues of leu-comalachite green and suggest that, when found, residues of this chemical in fish were higher than those of malachitegreen. The COM conclusions were forwarded to the COT and have been incorporated into a statement publishedby that Committee. They are given below: 2.3 Malachite green (i) There is one report of a Salmonella assay done to an acceptable protocol; malachite green oxalate (>90% pure) was shown to induce mutations in TA98 in the presence of an exogenous metabolicactivation system. 129There is also some evidence of clastogenicity in Chinese Hamster Lung cells.130Malachite green should thus be regarded as having mutagenic potential. (ii) Negative results were obtained in a poorly reported bone marrow micronucleus test in mice using a single oral dose of malachite green oxalate (>90% pure) at the MTD (75% of the LD50).129 Members agreed that the high dose level of 37.5 mg/kg was adequate, but it was difficult to assessthe value of the negative results in the absence of appropriate information on bone marrow toxicityor data to show that malachite green and/or metabolites reached the bone marrow. (iii) Recent 32P-post-labelling studies using a 28 day dietary exposure and carried out with NTP range- finding studies (used in designing carcinogenicity bioassays) indicate that malachite green inducesDNA adducts in the liver of rats and mice. 131,132 (iv) The Committee concluded that although a limited negative in-vivo micronucleus test was avail- able, the results of the recently conducted 32P- post-labelling studies indicated that it would be prudent to assume that malachite green may be a potential in-vivo mutagen. 2.4 Leucomalachite green (i) The Committee were concerned that only limited information was available on leucomalachite green. The lack of information on leucomalachite green prevents an adequate mutagenicity assess-ment for this compound. (ii) The Committee recommended that in-vitro studies in bacteria for gene mutations, in mammalian cells for clastogenicity and a mammalian cell assay for gene mutation (preferably the mouselymphoma assay) conducted according to current OECD guidelines should be undertaken asan important step to evaluating the mutagenic potential of leucomalachite green. 47 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 47(iii) The Committee, however, concluded that the results of the recently conducted 32P-post-labelling studies131, 132 indicated that it would be prudent to assume that leucomalachite green may also be a 1,2-Diol) in epichlorhydrin/amine copolymers used as flocculants or coagulent aids in water treatment. These polyamine flocculants have been avail-able for many years as approved products for use in water treatment and thus 3-MCPD may be present in drinkingwater due to the use of such flocculants. 3-MCPD is a member of a group of contaminants known as chloro-propanols. This group includes some known genotoxic carcinogens in animals such as 1,3 dichloropropan-2-ol. TheCOM was asked to evaluate the available mutagenicity data on 3-MCPD and to provide conclusions for theCommittee on Carcinogenicity (COC) who had been asked to consider the carcinogenicity data on 3-MCPD. 2.6 The Committee was aware that 3-MCPD had been detected as a contaminant of savoury food ingredients, including acid hydrolysed vegetable protein (acid-HVP) and that the EU Scientific Committee for Food had pub-lished an opinion in 1994 where it was agreed that 3-MCPD should be regarded as a genotoxic carcinogen. 133The Committee also had access to published mutagenicity data on 3-MCPD, a safety evaluation prepared by CanTox.Inc(Ontario, Canada) for the International Hydrolysed Protein Council, 134a review document published by the Institute of Toxicology, National Food Agency of Denmark,135and one in-vivo mutagenicity study submitted on an in-confidence basis.136In reviewing these documents, members commented that the available metabolism data on 3-MCPD were relatively old and focused on metabolic pathways following intraperitoneal administration. Therewas no data from oral studies using modern methods to measure absorption and elimination of 3-MCPD. TheCommittee considered the proposal by CanTox Inc regarding the formation of bacterial-specific mutagens andagreed that there was no evidence to support this speculation. 2.7 The Committee reached the following conclusions on the available mutagenicity data. (i) 3-MCPD was mutagenic in Salmonella absence metabolic acti- vation. 137,138,139,140 The addition of S-9 mix did not increase the mutagenic response observed. (ii) P ositive results have also been reported in the mouse lymphoma assay in the presence of metabolic acti- vation but the full report of the study was not available to the Committee. Positive results were alsoreported in tests in yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) 141and in tests for Sister Chromatid Exchange in mammalian cells.135 (iii) The Committee concluded that 3-MCPD had mutagenic activity in-vitro . (iv) Negative results have been reported from a bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice using a single oral dose of up to120 mg/kg bw and sampling of bone marrow at 24, 48 or 72 hours post admin-istration. The authors stated that higher doses would result in significant weight loss and mortal-ity. The Committee noted that there was no evidence for a reduction in the ratio of polychromaticto normochromatic erythrocytes (i.e. ratio of PCE/NCE) and thus there was no evidence to showthat exposure of the bone marrow to the test material and its metabolites had occurred. 136 (v) The Committee agreed that no conclusions could be drawn from the investigation of colonic micronuclei in mice136in view of the limited database available for this assay or from the inade- quately reported dominant lethal assays.142,143 (vi) The Committee agreed that further negative results in an in-vivo mutagenicity test in a second tissue namely rat liver UDS were required in order to provide adequate reassurance that the activityseen in-vitro is not expressed in-vivo . (vii) The Committee concluded that it would be prudent to assume that 3-MCPD is an in-vivo mutagen. 48 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 48TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) 2.8 There are 135 possible polychlorinated- para-dibenzofurans these substances (congeners), predominantly the tetra- through to octa-congeners may be found as trace contaminants in food. The toxicological properties and potencies of PCDDs andPCDFs mixtures have been estimated from the available information on TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) through the use of toxic equivalency factors (TEFs). TCDD thus serves as a model compound for the riskassessment of other PCDD/PCDF mixtures. 144 2.9 PCDDs are produced as a trace contaminant during the manufacture of many and during certain industrial processes such as pulp bleaching using chlorine gas. They are also producedin a number of thermal reactions such as the incineration of municipal waste, sewage sludge, PVC as well as fromautomobile emissions. The highest exposures have predominantly occurred under occupational settings, often fol-lowing accidental release, the exception being the large widespread release of TCDD to the environment with pop-ulation exposure following the Seveso incident in 1976. 2.10 The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded in 1997 that TCDD should be regarded as a known human carcinogen and thus classified as Group 1. 145Previously it had been classified as Group 2A (probable human carcinogen). This change prompted the Department of Health to request COC to review theirearlier conclusion. The COC concluded in 1998 that there were insufficient epidemiological and toxicological dataon TCDD to conclude a causal link with cancer in humans, but it would be prudent to consider TCDD as a'probable weak human carcinogen'. The IARC working group concluded that the \"experimental data indicated that2,3,7,8-TCDD and probably other PCDDs and PCDFs are not agents and that TCDD isconsidered a non-genotoxic substance.\" The previous COM evaluation of TCDD was completed in 1987 and itwas therefore timely for the Committee to reconsider its previous conclusions. The Committee considered a reviewof the relevant literature published since 1990 and noted that most of the newer studies had been negative. 2.11 The Committee agreed that negative results had been obtained in the in-vitro mutagenicity tests conducted in Salmonella and in L5178Y tk+/tk- cells mouse lymphoma cells. 146,147 However, TCDD induced micronuclei for- mation had been reported in one study in human lymphocytes and the cytochalasin B technique.148The same research group had also noted sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in a subsequent publication.149Members com- mented that it was not possible to draw any conclusions based on these results particularly in view of the unusuallylong incubation period of 71 hours prior to harvesting the cells. The Committee agreed that a repeat test would bedesirable in order to validate the method used in these investigations. 2.12 The Committee agreed that negative results had been obtained in mouse hepatocytes following dosing of animals with up to 150 \u00b5g/kg (i.p). 150No increase in SCEs in peripheral blood lymphocytes was noted in Rhesus monkeys, 2 years post administration of a diet containing 25 ppt TCDD for 4 years.151However, a small, but sta- tistically significant increase in SCEs in peripheral blood lymphocytes had been documented in a limited study inrats given weekly gavage doses of 5 \u00b5g/kg for 2 weeks but not at 0.5 \u00b5g/kg. 152Evidence of TCDD induced single strand DNA breaks in peritoneal lavage cells had been documented in rats given a single oral dose of 25 \u00b5g/kg bwup to 100 \u00b5g/kg. 153In addition, a positive result had been reported in a deletion recombination spot test154but not in a separate study which used a similar dosing regime.155Members considered that no weight could be attached to this investigation in view of the limited study design, the concerns previously expressed by Members regarding thesetests and the negative findings reported in a mouse spot test by a separate research group. 49 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 492.13 The Committee agreed the following overall conclusions. (a) \"In studies published since 1987, TCDD has continued to give largely negative results in tests for several different genetic endpoints, such as DNA damage, gene mutations, sister chromatidexchange and cell transformation. In a few studies TCDD has given a positive or equivocal result,often using assays with either highly non-standard or sub-optimal design. Currently the weight ofthe available experimental data continue to indicate that TCDD is not a genotoxic agent.\" (b) The Committee wished to continue to monitor any further genotoxicity publications on TCDD. Ozone 2.14 Ozone is an ubiquitous air pollutant due to its formation in the atmosphere by photochemical reaction between volatile hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. The Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards have recommendeda very low standard (50 ppb as a running 8 hour average) based on its irritant effects on the respiratory tract at 100ppb and above. Ozone is also one of a limited number of chemicals that have been shown to be carcinogenic in themouse (producing lung adenomas/carcinomas in a strain sensitive to such tumour induction) but not the rat. TheCOC have reviewed the need for carcinogenicity bioassay data in the mouse, and as part of this work are consider-ing the public health significance of such apparent mouse specific carcinogens. A key aspect of these is considera-tion of the genotoxic potential of such compounds. The COC felt it important to draw conclusions on thepossibility of a genotoxic mechanism, particularly in the light of recent data on K- rasmutations in lung neoplasms from ozone exposed mice 156; the advice of the COM was thus requested on this issue. 2.15 The following conclusions were drawn: (i) Ozone is a powerful oxidising agent and reacts readily with most biological macromolecules including DNA.157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166 It has been shown to produce gene mutation in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 in the presence or absence of rat S-9.167,168,169 There are no data from in-vitro studies to adequately investigate its clastogenic potential170but it has been shown to induce SCEs in mammalian cells.171,172,173 The available in-vitro data indicate that ozone has mutagenic potential. (ii) The in-vivo clastogenicity of ozone in bone marrow or peripheral blood has been investigated in the Chinese hamsters,174,175,176 mouse174,175 and rat.177Although all these studies have limitations, the results do suggest that ozone is not clastogenic in bone marrow. Only one very limited studyhas been carried out in germ cells; 176this was negative, which is consistent with the bone marrow data. However, clastogenic effects have been demonstrated in lung cells (macrophages) of ratsexposed to ozone gas. 178 (iii) In addition, examination of the K- rasmutational spectra of ozone induced lung neoplasms in mice indicated a high frequency of mutations, including A-T transversions in codon 61.156These appeared to be specific to ozone and did not occur in spontaneous lung neoplasms in mice. Thus, there is someevidence for in-vivo mutagenic activity at the target site for carcinogenicity in the mouse. (iv) Members recommended that additional work to reproduce ozone induced A-T transversions that would provide additional reassurance regarding conclusion (iii). This would comprise an assess-ment of whether ozone induced mutational signatures in-vitro and analysis of lung tumours in mice exposed to an inert particle such as titanium dioxide. (v) The COM concluded that it would be prudent to assume that ozone may have in-vivo genotoxic potential. Members agreed that it would be acceptable for the Committee to adopt the approachnormally used for in-vivo mutagens, ie to assume a linear dose-response. 50 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 502-Chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CJ) and CS spray 2.16 The COM provided advice on the mutagenicity of 2-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile during 1998 which was incorporated into a joint statement published by the Committees on Toxicity (COT), Mutagenicity (COM)and Carcinogenicity (COC) during 1999. 2.17 The conclusions reached by the COM (which should be considered together with those of the COC) are given below: In vitro studies 2.18 The mutagenicity of CS has been extensively studied in vitro . Negative results were obtained in Salmonella assays, but there were reservations regarding the suitability of the standard protocols used in these tests with respectto CS in view of its very short half life. 179,180,181,182,183 Positive results were noted in assays in V79 cells for gene mutation and also in the mouse lymphoma assay.180,184,185 Positive results were documented also in metaphase analysis for clastogenicity in V79 and CHO cells.180,186 In addition, CS has been shown to induce SCEs (Sister Chromatid Exchanges) in CHO cells.180These data indicate that CS has clastogenic potential. 2.19 There is evidence from in vitro studies to indicate that CS has aneugenic effects. It has been shown to inter- fere with the spindle machinery and cell division in mammalian cells resulting in C-mitosis and metaphaseblock. 187,188,189,190,191,192 CS has also been shown to induce micronuclei in mammalian cells in-vitro .25These data suggest that CS has aneugenic potential. 2.20 The clastogenic effects seen appear to be due to CS itself, or an unknown short-lived intermediate.186The mechanism of aneugenicity appears to differ from the clastogenicity with 2-chlorobenzaldehyde being the impor-tant metabolite regarding aneugenicity but not in respect of clastogenicity. 189 In vivo studies 2.21 Negative results were consistently obtained in bone marrow or peripheral blood assays for micronuclei induc-tion using high dose levels and both the oral and intraperitoneal routes. 183,193 (These assays are capable of detecting clastogens and aneugens if the active metabolite reaches the bone marrow.) It was noted that no data were available toindicate if adequate amounts of CS or short lived reactive metabolites reached the target organ. Data from DNAbinding studies in the liver and kidney did not help in this regard as no relevant analysis of tissues of initial contact(ie skin or nasal mucosa) were undertaken. 181Studies using Drosophila (fruit flies) did not provide any meaningful data as the experimental design was unlikely to result in exposure of Drosophila to biologically active CS.183It was felt prudent for complete reassurance on the lack of mutagenic activity of CS in-vivo to have data from a study to investigate genotoxicity to measure potential mutagenicity at a site of contact, for example in the nasal mucosa.However, some members of COM recognised that the design of such an animal study would be difficult both frompractical and ethical standpoints and were of the opinion that these studies were not necessary. Test Strategies and Evaluation Mutational spectra 2.22 DNA sequencing of mutations present in specific genes of tumours have indicated relationships between thesites within a gene, at which mutations have been detected (mutation spectra), and the individual chemicals impli-cated in the aetiology of a specific tumour. The Committee provided advice on the proposals regarding theminimum levels of data necessary to correlate a mutational spectra in a tumour type with a specific chemical. The 51 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 51Committee agreed that it was theoretically possible that selection of spontaneous mutations with a particular effect or in particular genes could give rise to differences in tumour spectra between treated and control animals. Theproposal outlined in the paper to establish whether a compound could induce specific mutations in neutral situa-tions, i.e. where there is no selection through growth advantage as occurs in a tumour, was acceptable, althoughMembers considered that it would be difficult to conduct such experiments with chemicals that were not stableunder in-vitro conditions such as ozone. The Committee noted that there were a number of uncertainties to be resolved in developing a suitable methodology, for example, whether the use of specific non transcribed reportergenes (such as lacZ) would be non-selective resulting in important effects being missed. Topics Under Consideration 2.23 The following topics, which were discussed by the Committee at meetings held in 1999, are still under review: Revision of COM guidelines on a strategy for testing chemicals for mutagenicity Hydroquinone & PhenolDisopropylnaphthalenes 52 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 521999 Membership of the Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment Chairman Professor J M Parry BSc PhD DSc Professor of Genetics.

The secretariat provides the COC with comprehensive data packages uponwhich the Committee members use their expertise to evaluate both chemical activity andthe effectiveness of test methodologies. The Committee has begun to also review papersprepared by the DH Toxicology Unit at the Imperial College of Science, Technology andMedicine. There have been several major pieces of work undertaken by the Committee this year. These include the statements on Drinking Water, Breast Cancer and exposure toorganochlorine insecticides, 3-monochloropropane 1,2-diol (3-MCPD) whichmay occur as flocculants used during water treatment, 2-Chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS) and CS Spray and a review of the animal carcinogenicity data on Ozone.The Committee's advice on 2-Chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS) and CS Spray was published as part of a jointCOT/COC/COM statement. The Committee has started to publish the agenda, on the Internet prior to each meeting, and publishing minutes and completed statements and conclusions when they are agreed at the subsequent meeting. The Committee received a presentation from Dr Denise Robinson of the Health & Environmental Sciences Institute (HESI) part of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) on the collaborative research on alternativemodels for carcinogenicity assessment. This is an important area of work in which the Committee continues to takean interest in. The major changes in Committee procedures during this year has lead to the publication of agendas prior to meetings and minutes and statements when completed. Thus the conclusions reached by the Committee givenin this Annual Report are already available on the COC web site (http://www.doh.gov.uk/coc.htm). Members werealso pleased to welcome a Lay Member to the Committee during this year.

In the mid-1970s, refinements in techniques of chemical analysis resulted in the detection in drinking-waterof traces of chemicals formed when organic chemicals (such as those which may occur naturally in rivers, lakes,reservoirs and other water sources) are subjected to chlorination. In drinking-water, each of these chlorinationbyproducts (CBPs) is typically present at a concentration below 1 part per billion (1 \u00b5g/l). Some however, such and concentrations between 10 and 100 \u00b5g/l. Numerous CBPs have been identified, but many have yetto be detected or characterised. 3.2 Some CBPs, including some of the THMs, are known to be carcinogenic in laboratory mammals given doses far greater than human intakes from drinking-water. Some CBPs are genotoxic the \"Mutagen X\" (MX; 3-chloro-4-dichloromethyl-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone). There have been many epi-demiological investigations into the possible association between chlorination of drinking-water and cancer inhumans and also many experimental studies regarding the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of CBPs which havebeen considered in this statement. 3.3 1992 Evaluations The Committee concluded that the 1986 conclusions (i.e. up to 1992) were adequately founded and that information from subsequent investigations did not alter those conclusions. With regard to furtherepidemiological investigations within the UK the Committee pointed out that it would be very difficultto take account of consumption of chlorinated water in food, bottled water and other beverages. TheCommittee could not recommend that further epidemiological studies should be undertaken in the UKat the present time. 3.4 The COC also reviewed a meta-analysis 194published in July 1992. The authors estimated an overall relative risk (RR) of 1.15 (1.09-1.20) {95% confidence interval, used throughout this statement} for all cancer sites together,with statistically-significant elevated RRs for bladder cancer (1.21 [1.09-1.34]) and rectal cancer (1.38 [1.01-1.87])but not for the other ten categories of cancer which were evaluated. COC considered that the meta-analysis gaveinsufficient evidence for increased concern over the carcinogenic effects of chlorinated drinking-water. It was notedthat no account had been taken of consumption of water other than tap water, but that in fact bottled water andwater used in food was often chlorinated in the manufacturing plant. COC concluded that the meta-analysis didnot change its conclusions, but added a proviso that \"the Committee could not recommend that further epidemiologi- cal studies should be undertaken in the UK at the present time, unless a population can be found with a distinctiv e exposur e to chlorinated drinking-water \". 3.5 In 1996, COC and COM considered the carcinogenicity and mutagenicity data on the THMs, and COC advised that \"The ratio between the lowest dose level giving rise to a carcinogenic effect in animals and the likely human exposure level from drinking-water for each of the four THMs considered by the Committee was in excess of 10,000. Thusthe levels of these THMs in drinking-water in the UK are unlikely to provide a carcinogenic risk to humans\" . New epidemiological studies 3.6 Futher epidemiological studies were considered by the COC in 1999. This comprised the twenty relevant epidemiological studies195, 196, 198,-215 published since COC's 1992 evaluation. 3.7 A mixture of case-control, cohort and ecological studies has been employed to investigate the association between chlorinated drinking water and various cancers. Most of the recent epidemiological studies were carried 59 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 59out in North America. None were from the United Kingdom. The focus for case control studies has been cancers at sites implicated in earlier epidemiological studies, and for which there may be, theoretically, a higher exposure toagents in drinking water. 3.8 Those carcinogenicity studies which have been performed on CBPs do not identify any CBP , or group of CBPs, which appears likely to cause cancer at these sites at the concentrations found in drinking-water. TheCommittee reaffirmed its view that since bottled water products may contain chlorinated water, it was not possibleto identify an unexposed control group. In the absence of an identified aetiological agent, or a precise means of mea-surement, a number of different surrogates of exposure have been employed in these studies including the follow-ing comparisons: chlorinated vs non-chlorinated water sources duration of time exposed to chlorinated water surface vs groundwater sources trihalomethane levels (total and individual substances) high organic content vs low organic content high level of estimated water mutagenicity vs low level. This consequently introduces uncertainty in exposure classification and makes comparison between studies, and interpretation of individual studies, more difficult. 3.9 In addition to these uncertainties, lifetime estimates of actual water consumption cannot be ascertained with any certainty, and exposure to substances occurring in drinking water via other routes (ie inhalation, dermal) orfrom other sources (eg food) may also not be properly considered. Consequently cancer epidemiological studies ofchlorinated water suffer to a lesser or greater degree from deficiencies of study design. 3.10 It is also not uncommon, in those studies where statistically significant relative risks are observed, for these to be typically in the region of 2 or lower. Consequently, the strength of association between health outcomes andmeasures of exposure is considered to be weak, and the elevated risks may be within the range of uncertainty arisingfrom possible confounding factors. 3.11 Of the 20 recent studies, only 4 were particularly well conducted. These comprised two case control studies dealing solely with bladder cancer, 195, 200 one case control study considering colon and rectal cancers201and a prospec- tive cohort study of postmenopausal women198which looked at many different cancer sites including the bladder, colon and rectum. The remaining studies were either ecological in nature or had other serious limitations in design.Overall, however, all studies suffered to some extent from the difficulty of assessing long term exposure to poten-tial aetiological agents in chlorinated drinking water. Additionally there was a lack of consistency of effect acrossstudies dealing with different cancer end points. Many studies were also not directly comparable as they containeddifferent measures of assessing exposure to chlorinated drinking water. 60 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 60Bladder cancer 3.12 Previous epidemiological studies have suggested associations between bladder cancer and CBPs, and eleven of the twenty recent studies have investigated this hypothesis. Five were case-control studies,195, 200, 204-206, 212 two were cohort studies,198, 208 and four were ecological.207, 213-215 Most report some statistically significant elevated relative risks for groups with the highest estimated duration or level of exposure, but the associations are generally weak, withrelative risks below 2. Exceptions are found in subgroups in four of the case-control studies, but are not consistentbetween studies. Thus, in two studies 195, 200 the relative risk was confined to male smokers (respectively, odds ratios [ORs] of 2.3 for more than 60 years of use of chlorinated water, and 3.2 for more than 40 years use of municipalwater). This contrasts with another case-control study 206which found an elevated OR only in male non-smokers (OR 2.59 for 30 years exposure to drinking-water estimated as \"substantially mutagenic\"), and with an earlier large case-control study 216which found associations primarily in non-smokers of both sexes. Members noted that a new eco- logical study215of chlorination of drinking water and cancer mortality in Taiwan had recently been published but agreed that such studies were only useful in the generation of hypotheses and not in respect of the evaluation of risk.A retrospective cohort study in Finland 208found an elevated relative risk for women only (1.48 [1.01-2.18]) but, as noted above, the same group's case-control study206found an elevated OR in male smokers only. In another case- control study205, 209 the highest ORs (2.28-2.58) were seen in groups with 35 or more years of unusually high con- sumption of water with estimated THM levels greater than 50 \u00b5g/l. 3.13 These recent studies of bladder cancer do not show any consistent dose-response relationship with estimated exposures to CBPs or THMs. Colon and rectal cancers 3.14 Since the 1992 evaluation there have been 7 epidemiological studies which have examined an associationwith cancer of the colon and 8 studies investigating rectal cancer. Of these only two studies were considered to beparticularly well conducted, a case-control study of colon and rectal cancers 201and a prospective cohort study in postmenopausal women.198Findings from these two studies were inconsistent; for cancer of the colon, a moderately strong association with increasing duration of exposure was found in the case-control study but no significant asso-ciation was found in the cohort study; conversely, for rectal cancer, a moderately strong association was found inthe cohort study but not in the case-control study. Inconsistent findings were also evident in the other reviewedstudies of these sites. Other sites 3.15 Studies of the other sites were not considered to be of good quality and, although some elevated risks wereidentified, these studies overall also failed to demonstrate any consistent association. Conclusion 3.16 Overall, the further epidemiological studies fail to provide persuasive evidence of a consistent relationshipbetween chlorinated drinking-water and cancer. It remains possible that there may be an association between chlo-rinated drinking water and cancer which is obscured by problems such as the difficulty of obtaining an adequateestimate of exposure to chlorination by-products, misclassification of source of drinking water (including the useof bottled water), failure to take adequate account of confounding factors (such as smoking status), and errors arisingfrom non-participation of subjects. 3.17 We therefore consider that efforts to minimise exposure to chlorination by-products remain appropriate, pro- viding that they do not compromise the efficiency of disinfection of drinking-water. 61 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 61Organochlorine Insecticides and Breast Cancer Breast Cancer Risk and Exposure to Organochlorine Insecticides: Consideration of the Epidemiology Data on Dieldrin, DDT and CertainHexachlorocyclohexane Isomers Introduction 3.18 A number of articles in the scientific literature and general media have suggested that prolonged exposure to certain organochlorine insecticides (OCIs) may cause breast cancer. In 1995, the COC reviewed the available epi-demiological studies on three chemicals isomers /c525- HCH (lindane) and /c523-HCH. The Committee agreed that the available evidence indicated no clear association. It was felt, however, that the matter should be kept under review. It is in this context that the Committee onCarcinogenicity was asked by the Department of Health to review the relevant information on four organochlorineinsecticides (OCIs) in respect of the potential for an association with breast cancer. The additional chemicalincluded in this statement is dieldrin, for which new epidemiological data have recently become available. However,it should be noted though, that only one of the OCIs considered by the Committee, namely lindane, is currentlyused in the UK, whilst pesticidal uses of the other chemicals considered were phased out over a decade ago. 217 Overview of hypothesis that OCIs may cause breast cancer 3.19 The Committee agreed that a number of observations and assumptions had led some observers to suggestthe hypothesis that OCIs and other organochlorine compounds may be associated with an increased risk of breastcancer. These could be summarised as follows: (i) many of the known or proposed risk factors for breast cancer are related to endogenous or exoge- nous hormones (in particular oestrogen). These factors include age at first birth, at menarche, andat menopause, and obesity, parity and use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement, 218 (ii) there is some evidence available to suggest that the OCIs under consideration may have weak oestrogenic activity,219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224 (iii) these OCIs have been shown to induce tumours (predominantly of the liver) in experimental animals,225 (iv) these OCIs persist in the environment and exposure of the population has occurred mainly via the diet.221,226 3.20 The Committee reviewed the evidence that dietary exposure to environmental levels of these OCIs mightinduce an oestrogenic response in-vivo through the consideration of three questions, namely; (i) Do these OCIs have oestrogenic activity in-vivo and if so what is their potency relative to other sources of oestrogens? (ii) Is there any evidence for synergistic effects?(iii) Do these compounds persist in breast tissue? 62 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 623.21 The Committee used the information from this review to draw conclusions on the biological plausibility of the hypothesis that OCIs may cause breast cancer. The Committee then evaluated the available epidemiologicalinvestigations for evidence of an association between the four OCIs considered in this review and breast cancer.Final conclusions on each of these OCIs took account of the potential for an oestrogenic response in-vivo , the evidence for persistence in humans and the available epidemiological investigations. Do these OCIs have oestrogenic activity in-vivo and if so what is their potency relative to other sources of oestrogens? 3.22 A tabulation of the Committee's assessment of the evidence for oestrogenic activity of the OC insecticides under consideration is given below: Table 1: Assessment of oestrogenic activity of OC insecticide OCI Evidence of oestrogenicity in-vitro data Conclusion through effects on i) Oestrogen ii) Oestrogen iii) or by other receptors metabolism mechanisms /c523-HCH Evidence of No data Yes222, 227 Uterotrophic Regard as a very weak available effects in rats weak in vivo oestrogenic and mice228, 229 oestrogen. activity222, 227 Mechanism (ca40,000 x unknown. weaker than oestradiol) Lindane No evidence of Effects noted in No data available Difficult to Considered not oestrogenic MCF-7 cells 231, 232interpret but to have in-vivo activity224, other equivocal oestrogenic investigators evidence for activity.have been oestrogenic and unable to anti-oestrogenic identify effects in rats. xenoestrogens 234, 235, 236, 237 using this test No evidence of system 233uterotrophic effect in reproduction studies in rats and mice. 238 DDT isomers/ Evidence of weak Effects noted in Yes 227, 239, 240, 252 Oestrogenic Regards some Metabolites oestrogenic MCF-7 cells231, 232 effects in DDT (in particular other rodents reported metabolites and p,p' DDE) ( ca1000 x investigators with certain isomers as weaker than have been unable o,p DDD) but mechanisms system 233 not with p,p / possibly DDE 221 involved.

Members agreed that dieldrin appeared to have weak oestrogenic activity in-vitro , but no evidence of an effect had been documented in-vivo in a number of studies in rats and mice. There was no convinc- ing evidence that lindane had oestrogenic activity in-vivo . 3.24 The Committee agreed that it was important to compare the evidence for oestrogenic activity of the OCIs under consideration with other potential sources of exposure to oestrogenic substances. Members were aware thatDr Safe from the USA (Texas A&M University) had published estimates of total oestrogenic potency (i.e. oestro-genic equivalents EQs). 248Thus although there were reservations regarding the use of these calculated data (as the method of determining EQs was based on in-vitro studies) it was agreed that the results presented a useful com- parison of the relative importance of the sources of potential oestrogens to which women might be exposed.248The tabulated information from Dr Safe's paper (reproduced below as table 2) show that organochlorine xenoestrogenscontribute a very small proportion of the potential total oestrogenic burden. Table 2. Estimated mass balance of human exposures to environmental and dietary oestrogens and anti-oestrogens (Abstracted from Safe H (1995). Environmental Health Perspectives, 103, 346-351.) Is there any evidence for synergistic effects? 3.25 The evidence for synergism between xenoestrogens, and in particular in respect of OCIs, arose from the results obtained in in-vitro experiments undertaken by one research group in the USA mainly involving mixtures of dieldrin with endosulfan or methoxychlor.249, 250 The authors subsequently retracted their data after they were unable to replicate the original experiments.251Many other research groups were unable to repeat the finding of syn- ergism using a number of in-vitro237, 240, 248, 252 and in-vivo tests.221, 240, 248 The results of these more recent experi- ments suggest, at most, an additive effect. There is thus no evidence to support the view that low levels of mixturesof xenoestrogens induce a biologically significant oestrogenic effect in mammals by acting synergistically. TheCommittee considered recent claims by one group of authors 253regarding evidence of synergism between certain xenoestrogens and concluded that any significant synergistic interactions in mammals should have been identifiedby the available published experiments. Do these compounds persist in breast tissue? 3.26 The observation that residues of certain OCIs persist in adipose tissue leading to bio-accumulation whichmight result in continuous exposure of breast tissue to weak oestrogenic substances has been cited as an essentialpart of the hypothesis that such compounds may cause breast cancer. 251Many research groups have measured levels of OCIs in human adipose tissue or in human milk samples.254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259 The results published by the UK Working Party on Pesticide Residues (WPPR) show that p, p 'DDE, and /c523-HCH can be detected in samples of fat or milk from most individuals studied whilst dieldrin was detected in fewer individuals. Lindane was infrequentlyfound in human fat (3%) and milk (1.8%) samples, mainly at low levels (i.e. only one human fat sample contained> 0.01 mg/kg). The available literature shows that lindane is more rapidly metabolised and eliminated inSource of oestrogen Oestrogen equivalents (\u00b5g per day) Morning after pill 33,500 Birth control pill 16,675 Post-menopausal therapy 3,350Flavonoids (2.5 x 0.000001) 0.0000025 64 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 64mammals260than other OCIs such as dieldrin261and thus one possible explanation for the low frequency of detectable lindane residues in humans could be due to its metabolism.254, 255 3.27 The WPPR results support the conclusion that the mean concentration of p, p 'DDE and dieldrin in human fat samples has been decreasing for several decades. There is no evidence from the WPPR survey for a decrease inthe mean concentration /c523-HCH in human fat up to 1982/3. However, the mean concentration /c523-HCH in human fat was substantially lower in samples taken in 1995-7 in comparison to the mean concentration of this chemicalreported in human fat samples taken in 1982/3. In other surveys, a significant reduction in adipose tissue concen-trations of /c523-HCH was reported in the USA 259between 1970-1983 but not in a separate study undertaken in the Netherlands during 1968-1986.257 Table 3: Concentrations of OCI in human fat Conclusions on biological plausibility 3.28 Regarding the specific chemicals under review, the Committee agreed that there was sufficient evidence tosupport the contention that some of the DDT metabolites and isomers and /c523-HCH , but dieldrin and lindane should not be regarded as having in-vivo oestrogenic activity. However, taking into account the low frequency of detectable levels of lindane in samples of human fat and milk, there appeared to beno convincing reason for including lindane as a xenoestrogen for examination in epidemiological studies of breastcancer. 3.29 The Committee concluded that the xenoestrogens considered, were, at most, very weak in-vivo oestrogens and agreed that there was no evidence of any synergistic effects between these chemicals. The impact of exposureto oestrogenic chemicals would be the product of oestrogenic potency and bioavailability. As OCIs are of lowpotency and occur at low concentrations, it is most unlikely that the effect of current exposures will represent a sig-nificant risk of breast cancer. Members were aware that other review groups 240had reached a similar conclusion and noted that some recent methodological research had been published to identify appropriate biomarkers of totaloestrogenic body burden from environmental sources. 262, 263, 264 3.30 The Committee agreed that it would be appropriate if further investigations of the potential associationbetween xenoestrogens and breast cancer concentrated on the evidence for risks associated with the effects of thetotal exposure to xenoestrogens. Epidemiology 3.31 In 1995, the available epidemiological data on breast cancer and exposure to OCI were limited, comprising6 case-control studies which investigated a total of 301 women with breast cancer using a variety of exposure analyses(in serum, plasma and breast adipose tissue). 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270 Only one of these studies used a prospective design.270 All six studies investigated DDT (measured as the metabolite p, p 'DDE), with an equal number of positive and negative associations reported between (p, p ') DDE and the risk of breast cancer. The two investigations that con- sidered /c523-HCH gave conflicting results, but no clear association was found. The two studies that considered lindane in breast tissue found no difference in lindane levels between cases and controls. There was no evidence of an asso-OCI Mean concentration (mg/kg) in human fat (Percentage of first reported residue level) 1963-64 1969-71 1976-77 1982-83 1995-97 Dieldrin (42) 0.08 (30.7) 0.02 (7.6)p.p'DDE 2.0 (100) 1.8 (90) 2.1 (100) 1.3 (65) 0.71 (35.5) \u00df-HCH No Data 0.28 (100) 0.27 (96.4) 0.31 (110) 0.12 (42.8) 65 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 65ciation between the concentration of dieldrin in breast tissue and breast cancer in the one limited study before 1995 where dieldrin was measured.266 3.32 Since 1995, eight additional epidemiological studies have been published,271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278 which have considerably increased the number of women studied. Thus the total number of women with breast cancerstudied with respect to (p, p ') DDE has now risen to over 1500. A brief description of these studies and their results is given in table 4 below. The conclusions reached by the Committee with regard to the epidemiological data aregiven below and in paragraph 17.

It wasagreed that completed published studies should be evaluated at a future meeting. Members considered that it wouldbe valuable if such studies included an estimation of total body burden of environmental xenoestrogens as well asan analysis of individual chemicals. The Committee was also aware that it was likely that technological improve-ments will in the future enable the detection of lower levels of OCIs in tissue samples, although this would not nec-essarily imply that such concentrations would be associated with any harmful biological effect. Conclusions: Epidemiology 3.34 The Committee agreed that the following conclusions regarding the epidemiological data for the OCIsreviewed in this paper could be drawn on the basis of the available evidence. (i) DDT There is considerably more epidemiological data now than in 1995 on environmental exposure to DDT and its isomers and metabolites and a possible association with breastcancer. All of the eight studies 271-278 published since 1995 investigated p, p 'DDE, but only two273,275 relatively small retrospective studies found evidence for an association between p, p 'DDE and increased risk of breast cancer. Overall, there is no convincing evidence from epidemiology studies for an elevated relative risk of breast cancer in asso-ciation with DDT (as measured by p, p 'DDE). (ii) Dieldrin There is very little epidemiological information available on dieldrin and its possible association with breast cancer. Of the two recent studies published after 1995, whichconsidered this insecticide, one found no evidence for an association 277and the other found a positive association,274which was considered likely to be a chance finding. Overall, there is no convincing evidence from epidemiological studies for an elevatedrelative risk of breast cancer associated with dieldrin.Study (Reference No) Description Result/Comment Olaya-Conteras P et al (1998)276 Hospital based case-control investigation After adjustment for confounding (Colombia) (n = 155 cases, 153 controls) factors a significant increased odds ratio for serum p,p' DDEconcentrations and breast cancer wasreported for the ofexposure (OR = 1.95 (95%) C/c5061.11-1.32).

Of the three recent studies published after 1995 whichconsidered /c523-HCH, 274,275,276 , none reported a statistically significant association with increased risk of breast cancer. (iv) Lindane There is very little epidemiological information available on lindane ( /c525-HCH) and its possible association with breast cancer. Of the three recent studies published after 1995which considered lindane, 274,275,277 none found evidence for an association with increased risk of breast cancer. The available evidence for environmental exposure to lindanesuggests that body burdens of this chemical are very small, being undetectable in mostindividuals. It is therefore unlikely that further epidemiological investigations of breastcancer based on assessment of levels of lindane in adipose tissue, blood, or breast tissuewould provide additional relevant information. Overall conclusion 3.35 The Committee evaluated the hypothesis that OCIs might increase the risk of breast cancer by virtue of theirclaimed oestrogenic effects ( para 3.19 ). The Committee concluded that the oestrogenic effects (if any) of these xenoestrogens were likely to be small in magnitude, especially compared with those of oral contraceptives orHormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), 218,248 which entail much higher exposures to oestrogens ( para 3.24 and tables 1 and 2 ). Moreover, the Committee concluded that there was no convincing evidence of oestrogenic synergy in mammals between different OCIs ( para 3.25 ). There is also evidence that concentrations in human fat of the OCIs considered in this statement are decreasing in humans which provides some additional reassurance with regardto any potential risk of breast cancer ( para 3.27, table 3 ). The Committee agreed, that further investigations of the potential association between xenoestrogens and breast cancer should concentrate on the evidence for risks associ-ated with the effects of the total exposure to xenoestrogens ( para 3.30 ). 3.36 The Committee was aware of further epidemiological research on the OCIs considered in this statement and agreed that the relevant reports should be reviewed when published. Regarding the specific chemicals under con-sideration (i.e. DDT (and isomers/metabolites), dieldrin, /c523-HCH, and lindane), the Committee came to the fol- lowing overall conclusions, on the basis of the available information. (i) DDT Some DDT isomers and metabolites should be regarded as having weak in-vivo oestro- genic activity. The stable metabolite p, p 1DDE, a marker for exposure to DDT, can be found in samples of fat from most individuals. There is however, good evidence frominvestigations undertaken in the UK that concentrations of p, p 'DDE in human fat samples have been declining for several decades. There are now 14 epidemiological studieswhich have considered p, p 'DDE using both case-control and prospective study designs. There is no convincing evidence for an association with an increased risk of breast cancer.Overall the available data do not suggest that environmental exposure to DDT (andisomers/metabolites) is a cause for concern as a risk factor for human breast cancer. (ii) Dieldrin Dieldrin is not considered to have in-vivo oestrogenic activity. There is thus no rationale to consider that exposure to this chemical should be associated with an increased risk ofbreast cancer. There is good evidence from investigations undertaken in the UK thatconentrations of dieldrin in human fat samples have been declining for several decades.There is no convincing evidence from the five available epidemiological studies for anelevated risk of breast cancer in association with exposure to dieldrin. Overall the avail-able data do not suggest that environmental exposure to dieldrin is a cause for concernas a risk factor for human breast cancer. 68 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 68(iii) \u00df-HCH /c523-HCH be regarded as having weak in-vivo oestrogenic activity. /c523-HCH can be found in samples of fat from most individuals. There is evidence from investigationsundertaken in the UK for a decline in /c523-HCH concentrations in human fat samples after 1982/3. There is no convincing evidence from the five available epidemiological studiesfor an elevated risk of breast cancer in association with exposure to /c523-HCH. It is rec- ommended that the published literature on this chemical should be kept under review. (iv) Lindane Lindane ( /c525-HCH) is not considered to have any in-vivo oestrogenic activity. There is thus no rationale to consider that exposure to this chemical should be associated with anincreased risk of breast cancer. The available evidence for environmental exposure tolindane suggests that body burdens of this chemical in the UK are very small, being unde-tectable in most individuals. None of the five available epidemiological investigationsfound evidence for an association with breast cancer. Overall the available data do notsuggest that environmental exposure to lindane is a cause for concern as a risk factor forhuman breast cancer. 3-Monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) 3.37 3-Monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) can in epichlorhydrin/aminecopolymers used as flocculants or coagulent aids in water treatment. These polyamine flocculants have been avail-able for many years as approved products for use in water treatment and thus 3-MCPD may be present in drinkingwater from their use. 3-MCPD is a member of a group of contaminants known as chloropropanols. This groupincludes some known genotoxic carcinogens in animals such as 1,3-dichloropropan-2-ol. The COC was asked toevaluate and advise on the available carcinogenicity data on 3-MCPD by the Committee on Chemicals andMaterials of Construction for use in Public Water Supply and Swimming Pools (CCM), a statutory committeewhich provides advice to the Secretary of State for the Environment on the approval of chemical substances incontact with public water supplies. 3.38 The Committee was aware that 3-MCPD had been detected as a contaminant of several foods and food ingre- dients, including acid hydrolysed vegetable protein (acid-HVP) and that the EU Scientific Committee for Food hadpublished an opinion in 1994 where it was agreed that 3-MCPD should be regarded as a genotoxic carcinogen. 279 The Committee also had access to published mutagenicity data on 3-MCPD, a safety evaluation prepared byCanTox. Inc (Ontario, Canada) for the International Hydrolysed Protein Council, 280and a review document pub- lished by the Institute of Toxicology, National Food Agency of Denmark.281The COC asked for advice from the Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COM) in respectof the mutagenicity of 3-MCPD. In reviewing these documents, members commented that the available metabo-lism data on 3-MCPD were relatively old and focused on metabolic pathways following intraperitoneal adminis-tration. There was no data from oral studies using modern methods to measure absorption and elimination of3-MCPD. The Committee considered the proposal by CanTox Inc regarding the formation of bacterial-specificmutagens and agreed that there was no evidence to support this speculation. 3.39 The Committee reached the following conclusions on the available mutagenicity data. (i) 3-MCPD has a chemical structure, which suggests that it may be metabolised to genotoxic inter- mediates (particularly glycidol). (ii) The COM has advised that 3-MCPD is an in-vitro mutagen. In the absence of a satisfactory eval- uation of the potential in-vivo mutagenicity, it would be prudent to assume that 3-MCPD is an in-vivo mutagen. The COM had advised that further negative results in an in-vivo mutagenicity test in a second tissue namely rat liver UDS were required in order to provide adequate reassur-ance that the activity seen in-vitro is not expressed in-vivo . 69 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 69(iii) 3-MCPD has been tested in four long-term animal carcinogenicity experiments, 2 in mice and 2 in rats.282,283,284 However three of these studies282, 283 are relatively old and were conducted to inad- equate protocols. The conclusions reached by the COC therefore refer to the one study conductedto contemporary standards. 284The Committee had access to the full study report284and to pub- lished critiques of this study.281,282 The tumour data have been evaluated by a number of statisti- cal methods. The analyses reported below refer to the Fishers pair-wise comparisons with controls. (iv) In the study undertaken by Sunhara et al (1993)2843-MCPD was administered via drinking water to groups of 50 male and 50 female (aged 6 weeks at start) F344 rats for a period of 104 weeks.Concentrations of 0, 20, 100, and 200 ppm were used. These equated to dose levels of 0, 1.1, 5.2,or 28 mg/kg bw/day in males and 0, 1.4, 7.0, or 35 mg/kg bw/day in females. 3-MCPD was alsodetected in the drinking water used in this study at 2.7 ppm and thus control animals were givendoses of approximately 0.1 mg/kg bw/day. There was evidence that doses of 3-MCPD in the highdose group exceeded the Maximum Tolerated Dose level. The approximate decrease in bodyweights, relative to control animals for males and females at the high dose level was 33% and 35%respectively. There was no evidence of any treatment-related increase in mortality in this study.Survival to termination was acceptable (i.e.>50%) in all dose groups with the exception of the highmale dose group where 21/50 animals survived to termination. (v) In males, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of Leydig-cell adenoma was docu- mented at the intermediate and high dose levels. Three animals at the high dose level had Leydig-cell carcinomas. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of mammary glandfibroadenoma was noted in the high dose male group. A statistically significant increase inmammary gland hyperplasia was recorded in the male mid and high dose groups. A small but notstatistically significant increase in the incidence of preputial gland adenoma was recorded in themid and high dose male groups. One animal in the intermediate dose group and two in the highdose group had preputial gland carcinomas. It is difficult to evaluate these findings since only alimited number of preputial glands were examined histologically (5-16/group) in this study. Asmall (not statistically significant) increase in renal tubular adenomas was documented in theintermediate and high dose male groups. A statistically significant increase in the incidence ofnephropathy and renal tubular hyperplasia was also recorded at the intermediate and high doselevels in this study. (vi) In females, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of renal tubular adenoma was recorded at the high dose level. A statistically significant increase in nephropathy and renal tubularhyperplasia was also recorded at the intermediate and high dose levels in this study. A slight butstatistically non-significant increase in mammary gland hyperplasia was reported at the high doselevel. (vii) The Committee noted that the suggestion that all of the increases in tumours noted in this study in rats were mediated by non-genotoxic mechanisms involving either cytotoxicity (kidney) orhormonal disturbances. 280,281,284 Members agreed that the proposed non-genotoxic mechanisms advanced were plausible, but there was no compound specific data to support any of the con-tentions suggested. It was possible that evidence might be produced which would allow a firm con-clusion to be reached in respect of the mechanisms of the tumours observed in rats. (viii) The Committee concluded that it was not possible to draw a definite conclusion regarding the significance of the observed carcinogenic effects of 3-MCPD in the rat. However, in view of theCOM conclusions and need to further investigate the potential for in-vivo mutagenic activity, it would be prudent to reduce exposures to as low as technologically practicable. 70 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 70Ozone (Review of Animal carcinogenicity data) 3.40 Ozone is a ubiquitous air pollutant due to its formation in the atmosphere by photochemical reaction between volatile hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. The Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards have recommendeda very low standard (50 ppb as a running 8 hour average) based on it's irritant effects on the respiratory tract at 100ppb and above. Ozone is also one of a limited number of chemicals that have been shown to be carcinogenic in themouse (producing benign lung tumours in a strain sensitive to such tumour induction) but not the rat. 3.41 The COC have reviewed the need for carcinogenicity bioassay data in the mouse, and as part of this work are considering the public health significance of such apparent mouse specific carcinogens. 285,286 A key aspect of these is consideration of the genotoxic potential of such compounds. The COC felt it important to draw conclu-sions on the possibility of a genotoxic mechanism, particularly in the light of recent data on K- rasmutations in lung neoplasms from ozone exposed mice; 287the advice of the COM was thus requested on this issue. 3.42 The following conclusions were reached on the potential carcinogenic hazard of ozone to humans in the light of advice from COM and the available evidence from the animal carcinogenicity bioassays. (i) Ozone has been tested for potential carcinogenicity in mice and rats in long term inhalation bioas- says as part of the ongoing National Toxicology Programme (NTP) in the USA.288 (ii) There was no evidence of treatment related carcinogenicity in male or female F344 rats exposed to 0.12, 0.5.1.0 ppm 6 hours/day, for 5 days/week, for up to 105 weeks or in a similar study whererats were exposed to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week, for up to 125 wks. Ozoneinduced inflammation and non-neoplastic pathology (hyperplasia and metaplasia) throughout therespiratory tract in both sexes, particularly at the highest concentration. (iii) Long term inhalation bioassays were also undertaken in B6C3F1 mice using exposures of 0.12, 0.5 or 1.0 ppm 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 105 weeks. A separate life-time bioassay was performedusing exposures of 0.5 or 1.0, for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 125 wks. The NTP reported thestatistical analyses of the carcinogenicity data based on evaluation of the combined incidence oflung adenomas and carcinomas. The NTP consider that pulmonary tumours in mice form aspectrum of lesions and adenomas appear to progress into carcinomas with time. The resultsreported in this statement refer to the outcome of the NTP evaluation based on combinining theincidence of adenoma and carcinomas consistent with this approach to the assessment of data. (iv) A statistically significant increase in the incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) was found in female B6C3F 1mice in the long-term bioassay at 1.0 ppm. This occurred in the presence of non-neoplastic pathology (inflammation, hyperplasia and/or meta-plasia) throughout the respiratory tract. Evidence of chronic inflammation was documented insome female animals at 0.5 ppm but no increased incidence of lung tumours (combined adenomaand carcinomas) was reported at this dose level. No evidence of a carcinogenic or inflammatoryresponse was documented in female mice at 0.12 ppm. A slight but statistically non-significantincrease in the combined incidence of lung tumours (combined adenoma and carcinoma)occurred in male mice at 0.5 ppm and 1.0 ppm. (v) A slight but statistically non-significant increase in lung tumours (combined adenoma and carci- noma) was documented in the life-time bioassay in male mice at 0.5 ppm and 1.0 ppm and infemale mice at 1.0 ppm. In separate analyses the increase in incidence of lung adenoma in femalemice reached statistical significance at 1.0 ppm. 71 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 71(vi) Ozone was carcinogenic by inhalation in female B6C3F1mice producing lung tumours; this effect was associated with chronic irritation of the lung. There was equivocal evidence for a carcinogeniceffect in male mice. Ozone was not carcinogenic in male or female F344 rats. (vii) The COM has advised that there is some evidence for in-vivo mutagenic activity at the target site for carcinogenicity in the mouse. Additional work to reproduce ozone induced A-T transversionswould provide additional information regarding this conclusion. The COM concluded that itwould be prudent to assume that ozone may have in-vivo genotoxic potential. (viii) The COC concluded that the mechanism of ozone carcinogenicity in the mouse is currently uncertain, leaving a question about whether the carcinogenic action is due to a genotoxic event(s)or chronic irritation. The carcinogenic activity of ozone appears to be specific to the mouse in thepresence of chronic irritation and has not been observed in the rat. The animal data are thus inad-equate to draw any conclusions regarding the potential carcinogenicity of ozone in humans. (ix) The Committee agreed to review the situation in the future should more evidence of an in-vivo mutational effect by ozone become available. Test strategies and Evaluation 3.43 The Committee was pleased to receive a presentation from Dr Denise Robinson (Health And EnvironmentalSciences Institute (HESI), International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) on the ongoing collaborative program for thevalidation of short-term carcinogenicity tests using transgenic animals. This is an important area of test methoddevelopment previously considered by the Committee in 1997. A full report of the presentation and members dis-cussion is given below. The Committee also considered the proposal from the International Programme onChemical Safety (IPCS) for a framework for the for considering mode of action of chemical carcinogens. It wasagreed that the IPCS should be encouraged to carry out further work in exploring this framework. Members notedthat the framework for considering mode of action was most suited to data rich chemicals such as those undergo-ing regulatory approval. Nongenotoxic Carcinogens: Identification And Significance 3.44 The Committee considered a review paper on nongenotoxic carcinogens: Identification And Significance. Ithas been estimated that approximately 50% of all chemicals tested in animal carcinogenicity bioassays induce anincrease in tumours in at least one tissue. A proportion of these animal carcinogens induce tumours via a directinteraction of the chemical or its metabolites with DNA; these are referred to as genotoxic carcinogens. It is prudentto assume that for these carcinogens there is no threshold dose below which no carcinogenic effect would be expectedto occur and that they are therefore of particular concern to public health. The remainder of the animal carcino-gens act through non-genotoxic mechanisms, for which a threshold may operate. Non-genotoxic carcinogens tendto be tissue and/or species specific. In some cases these are not relevant to human health. At present there are noshort term tests that can be used to identify such compounds and long term bioassays in animals are necessary. Thedevelopment of rapid methods for the identification of chemicals that induce cancer by non-genotoxic mechanismsthat are relevant to humans had been idenitifed by the COC as a priority area for research in 1996. 3.45 They considered information available on the known human carcinogens as evaluated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to identify non-genotoxic carcinogens and information on mechanisms of car-cinogencity which were relevant to humans. The aim of the work had been to review experimental approaches whichcould be used to identify non-genotoxic mechanisms of carcinogenicity and to select the most appropriate short-termtesting approaches which could be considered for further research. One important outcome of this work was to excluderodent-specific carcinogenic mechanisms, such as chemically induced deposition of /c5222u globulin in the kidneys of male rats, which are thought to be unimportant with respect to hazard identification for humans. 72 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 723.46 Members noted that mutations are found in all chemically induced cancers. Members agreed that the most important non-genotoxic mechanisms could be placed into one of four groups, (i) persistent cytotoxicity accom-panied by proliferative regeneration, (ii) chronic inflammation accompanied by the production of reactive oxygenspecies, (iii) hormomimmetic activity and (iv) ligand binding with xenobiotic induction receptors. Members con-sidered that increased cellular proliferation was of particular significance. 3.47 The Committee agreed that it was not practical to design a test to detect all non-geonotoxic carcinogens. However, by focusing on a number of relevant mechanisms it should be possible to identify key toxicologicalresponses in sub-acute studies which might provide an indication of carcinogenic activity. It was very important indesigning a research programme to select appropriate reference compounds and to include as wider range of mech-anisms and target organs as was practicable to study. Members considered the IARC list of group 1 carcinogens asuseful start but felt that consideration ought to be given to chemicals listed as IIA by IARC and under the EUDangerous Substances Directive (EEC/67/548) as category 1 and 2 carcinogens. 3.48 Members considered that future consideration of the application of gene arrays and other approaches to tran- scription profiling would become important in studies of non-genotoxic carcinogenesis but at present there waslittle experience in the use of such methods. Members agreed there was little evidence to support the developmentof in-vitro methods such as cell transformation assays, or the use of the currently available transgenic animal models (such as the Tg.AC mouse). It was possible that appropriate transgenic animal models for certain classes of non-genotoxic carcinogens could be developed in the future. Presentation on validation of short-term carcinogenicity tests using transgenic animals 3.49 The Committee was pleased to hear a presentation from Dr Denise Robinson (Health And Environmental Sciences Institute (HESI), International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) on the ongoing collaborative program for thevalidation of short-term carcinogenicity tests using transgenic animals. This is an important area of test methoddevelopment previously considered by the Committee in 1997. A full report of the presentation and members dis-cussion is given below. In 1997, the Committee had reached a number of conclusions on the utility of short-termcarcinogenicity testing using transgenic animal models following an assessment of the available published literature(Mutation Research 403, 259-263, 1998). Dr Robinson had agreed to provide the Committee with an overview ofthe HESI program of work and the likely times for completion of the work. Presentation 3.50 Dr Robinson thanked the Committee for the invitation to make a presentation. Members were told that ILSIwas a non-profit scientific research and education foundation with a number of work programs related to publichealth. Each program involved participation from industry, government and academia and the topics identified forresearch programs were those most likely to have an impact on public health. HESI was established in 1989 withthe aim of investigating pathology, toxicology, human health and environmental risk issues. HESI identified theutility of short-term animal carcinogenicity tests as a key topic for discussion following the adoption by theInternational Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) of guidelines for the carcinogenicity testing of pharmaceuticals.These included the option for a short or medium term rodent test in addition to a long-term carcinogenicity testin a rodent species instead of requesting long-term carcinogenicity tests in two species. HESI established theAlternatives to Carcinogenicity Testing (ACT) committee in June 1996 as a steering group for this work program.It had been established that there was an inadequate database on performance of alternative assays, there was noaccepted rationale for selection of a model for a second test and there were major differences between regulatoryauthorities in North America and those in Europe and other areas on the acceptability of the new models. 73 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 733.51 ACT set a number of objectives for the work programme, which included expanding the database on the alternative methods, establishment of common experimental approaches, information on the scientific basis of thenew models and the need for public debate on the evolving state of the science. Advisors were appointed to the workprogramme who had been involved in the early stages of the test model development. Fifty-one laboratories fromaround the world, with approximately equal numbers from U.S.A, Europe (including U.K.) and Japan agreed totake part. The outline of the program was considered which included the following issues; i) identification of assaysystems to be evaluated, ii) establishment of standardised protocols, iii) selection of test agents, iv) data collectionsystems, v) data review process, vi) joint data analyses. Some comments made by Dr Robinson on each of these sixissues are given below : 3.52 The test systems selected for evaluation were those identified in the ICH guidelines. 3.53 Dr Robinson noted that transgenic mice cost on average approximately five times more than wild type mice. Given the scale of the HESI program, a number of pragmatic decisions were made regarding protocols. Thus threedose levels were studied per chemical and the number of animals used per dose level was 15 males and 15 females.A vehicle and high dose control in wild type animals were also included. Information from NTP bioassays and a 4-week range finding assay were used to assist in dose selection. In most instances this has resulted in adequate survival.One exception was chloroform where a number of animals had died at the high dose level within the 26 week-dosingperiod. Possible differences between wild type and transgenic mice with respect to the metabolism of chloroformwere to be investigated. Expanded histopathology is being undertaken on control and high dose animals, with tissuesfrom animals in the intermediate dose group retained. More recently it had been agreed that histological analysis ofthe jaw would be undertaken in Tg.AC mice due to several instances of odontoma (a rare tumour in mice) inprevious studies. Genotyping of tumours will be undertaken. 3.54 HESI had selected well-studied compounds with extensive human data, predominantly pharmaceuticals. 3.55 An Assay Working Group (AWG) had been established for each of the models under consideration in order to establish criteria for evaluating tests, to ensure a common format for data collection and consistency inhistopathology. The AWGs would also act as a focal point for data review and analyses. 3.56 The AWGs suggested additional areas for research. Proposals were reviewed from approximately 30 labora- tories in respect of drug metabolism in transgenic mice, mutational analyses of tumours, tissue specificity of mech-anisms, and compound specific mechanisms. Thus proposals funded in 1999 included, i) mechanisms of hormonalcarcinogenesis in transgenic mouse models, ii) an evaluation of drug metabolising enzymes in transgenic andparental strains of mice, and iii) mechanism of carcinogenicity in p53 mice (tumour analysis). 3.57 Data review(s) were expected in late 1999/early 2000 and, histopathology database development by mid 2000. Meetings of the Joint Steering Committee/AWGs in early 2000. Data analyses by around June 2000. An open publicworkshop was planned in Washington DC around November 2000 to tie in with the simultaneous ICH meeting.Test System Tumour Response P53 Knock-out mouse Genotoxic chemicals. 6 month treatment schedule appears adequate for positive controls Tg.AC transgenic mouse Genotoxic and some non-genotoxic carcinogens. Originally a dermal test, but need to also screen for response to oral administration in respect ofpharmaceuticals. Noted that recent results suggested the dermal model did notrespond to glycidol which was an unexpected finding. RasH2 Transgenic mouse Genotoxic and some non-genotoxic chemicals. Broadest available published database. Evidence for target organ selectivity (lung, forestomach). Mechanism ofresponse unclear. XPA Repair Deficient mouse UV light and genotoxic carcinogens. Very limited database available. Neonatal mouse Limited database available. Responds to genotoxic carcinogens.SHE cell transformation assay Some data already available in published literature on this assay. 74 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 743.58 The ICH guidelines had made an impact on the strategy for carcinogenicity tests being adopted by phar- maceutical companies. Information from the Centre for Medicines Research showed that 18 out of 38 companiesasked were using alternative short-term tests. Out of the 49 companies using short-term tests, the predominantmodels being used were the p53 knock-out (26.6%) and ras H2 (20.4%), mouse models were alsobeing undertaken. Members heard that some data were available to show a drift in the response of Tg.AC hemizy-gous mice to the positive control (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate) TPA. Southern Blot analysis of respon-der and non-responding Tg.AC mice showed evidence for a 2kb deletion in the transgene. It was not clear howprevalent the transgene instability was in earlier tests, although action was taken to re-derive the breeding coloniesof mice. Dr Robinson noted that the transgene deletion in Tg.AC mice had been detected before any significantimpact in the HESI program could have occurred. 3.59 A full summary of this presentation has been published on the COC internet site. Topics Under Consideration 3.60 The following topics, which were discussed by the Committee at meetings held in 1999, are still under review: Alcohol & Breast Cancer Cancer incidence near Municipal IncineratorsT rends in mortality from Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomaUse of Accelerator mass Spectrometry in cancer risk assessment. 75 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment74513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 751999 Membership of the Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment Chairman Professor P G Blain BMedSci MB PhD FRCP(Lond) FRCP(Edin) FFOM CBiol FIBiol Head of Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, University of Newcastle Members Professor Clair E D Chilvers BSc(Econ) DSc Hon MFPHM Regional Director of R&D, NHS Executive Trent, Fulwood House, Sheffield Professor C Cooper BSc PhD DSc Head of Molecular Carcinogenesis Section, Institute of Cancer Research, Haddow Laboratories Professor A D Dayan BSc MD FRCPath FFOM FFPM CBiol FIBiol Retired.

This Code of Practice is intended to act as a guide for members of these three Committees as to the circum- stances in which they should declare an interest in the chemical industry. 2. The advice of these Committees concerns matters which are connected with the chemical industry and it is therefore desirable that members should have a good understanding of the work of the industry. It is also desirablethat some members should have practical experience of the scientific problems of product development. To avoidany public concern that commercial interests might affect the advice of the Committees it has been decided thatthe arrangements which govern relationships between members and the chemical industry and information on sig-nificant and relevant interests should be on public record. Definitions 3. In this code, 'the chemical industry' means a. companies, partnerships or individuals who are involved with the manufacture, sale or supply of products subject to the following legislation: The Food Safety Act 1990 The Medicines Acts 1968 and 1971The Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985The Consumer Protection Act 1987The Cosmetic (Safety) (Amendment) Regulations 1987The Notification of New Substances Regulations 1982 b. trade associations representing companies involved with such products,c. companies, partnerships or individuals who are directly concerned with research, development or marketing of a product which is being considered by the Committees on Toxicity, Mutagenicityor Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment. 4. In this code 'the Secretariat' means the Secretariat of the relevant Committee. Different types of interest 5. There are a number of different types of interests and the following is intended only as a guide. A personal interest involves payment to the member personally. The main examples are: Consultancies: any consultancy, directorship, position in or work for the chemical industry, which attracts regular or occasional payments in cash or kind. Fee-Paid Work: any work commissioned by the chemical industry for which the member is paid in cash or kind. 8374513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 83Shareholdings: any shareholding in or other beneficial interest in shares of the chemical industry. This does not include shareholdings through unit trusts or similar arrangements where themember has no financial management. A non-personal interest involves payment which benefits a department for which a member is responsible, but is not received by the member personally. The main examples are: Fellowships: the holding of a fellowship endowed by the chemical industry. Support by industry: any payment, other support or sponsorship by the chemical industry which does not convey any pecuniary or material benefit to a member personally but which does benefittheir position or department, for example: i. a grant from a company for the running of a unit or department for which a member is respon- sible; ii. a grant or fellowship or other payment to sponsor a post or a member of staff in the unit for which a member is responsible. This does not include financial assistance for students; iii. the commissioning of research or other work by, or advice from, staff who work in a unit for which the member is responsible. Trusteeship: where a member is a trustee of a charity with investments in the chemical industry, the Secretariat can agree with the member a general declaration to cover this interest rather than draw up a detailed portfolio. 6. Members are under no obligation to seek out knowledge of work done for or on behalf of the chemical industry within departments for which they are responsible if they would not normally expect to be informed. 7. Members should inform the Department in writing when they are appointed of their current personal and non-personal interests. Only the name of the company and the nature of the interest is required; the amount of any salary, fee, shareholding, grant etc need not be disclosed to the Department. An interest is current if the memberhas an on-going financial involvement with the chemical industry, eg if he or she holds shares in a chemical industry,has a consultancy contract, or if the member or the department for which he or she is responsible is in the processof carrying out work for the chemical industry. Members are asked to inform the Department at any time of anychange in their personal interests, and will be invited to complete a declaration form once a year. It would be suffi- cient if changes in non-personal interests are reported in the annual declaration form following the change. (Non- personal interests involving less than \u00a31000 from a particular company in the previous year need not be declaredto the Department.) 8. Members are required to declare relevant interests at Committee meetings, and to state whether they are personal or non-personal interests and whether they are specific to the product under consideration ornon-specific. a. A member must declare a personal specific interest if he or she has at any time worked on the product under consideration and has personally received payment for that work, in any form, from thechemical industry. If the interest is no longer current, the member may declare it as a lapsed personal specific interest. The member may then only take part in the proceedings at the Chairman's discretion. b. A member must declare a personal non-specific interest if he or she has a current personal interest in the company concerned which does not relate specifically to the product under discussion.The member may then only take part in the proceedings at the Chairman's discretion. 8474513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 84c. A member must declare a non-personal specific interest if he or she is aware that the department for which he or she is responsible has at any time worked on the product but the member has not per-sonally received payment in any form from the industry for the work done. The member may thentake part in the proceedings unless the Chairman should decide otherwise. d. A member must declare a non-personal non-specific interest if he or she is aware that the depart- ment for which he or she is responsible is currently receiving payment from the company con- cerned which does not relate specifically to the product under discussion. The member may thentake part in the proceedings unless the Chairman should decide otherwise. 9. If a member is aware that a product under consideration is or may become a competitor of a product man- ufactured, sold or supplied by a company in which the member has a current personal interest, he or she should declare the interest in the company marketing the rival product. 10. A member who is in any doubt during a meeting as to whether he or she has an interest which should be declared, or whether to take part in the proceedings, should ask the Chairman for guidance. The Chairman hasthe power to determine whether or not a member with an interest shall take part in the proceedings. 11. If the Chairman should declare an interest of any kind he or she should stand down from the chair for that item and the meeting should be conducted by the Deputy Chairman. Record of interests 12. A record is kept in the Department of names of members who have declared interests to the Department onappointment, as the interest first arises or through the annual declaration, and the nature of the interest. 13. It is the responsibility of individual members to declare all relevant interests. The Secretariat does not check whether members have done so. However, members can seek advice from the Secretariat if they have any doubts asto whether or not an interest should be declared. 8574513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 85Annex 3 Glossary of Terms ACUTE Describes a disease of rapid onset, severe symptoms and brief duration. ACUTE TOXICITY Effects that occur over a short period of time (hours or few days) immediately following exposure. ADDUCT A chemical grouping which is covalently bound (strong bond formed by the sharing of a pair of elec- trons) to a large molecule such as DNA (qv) or protein. ADENOMA (see tumour).Ah RECEPTOR The Ah (Aromatic hydrocarbon) receptor protein regulates gene expression. The identity of the natural endogenous chemical which bind to the Ah receptor are unknown. A range of chemical such as chlorinateddibenzodioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls bind to Ah receptor. The available research suggests that binding tothe Ah receptor is an intrical part of the toxicological mechanism of these compounds. ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE An enzyme that, when elevated activity is detected in serum, may indicate damage to certain organs. ALKYLATING AGENTS Chemicals which leave an alkyl group covalently bound to biologically important mol- ecules such as proteins and DNA (see adduct). Many alkylating agents are mutagenic, carcinogenic and immuno-suppressive. AMES TEST In vitro (qv) assay for bacterial gene mutations (qv) using strains of Salmonella typhimurium devel- oped by Ames and his colleagues. ANEUGENIC Inducing aneuploidy (qv).ANEUPLOIDY The circumstances in which the total number of chromosomes within a cell is not an exact multiple of the normal haploid (see 'polyploidy') number. Chromosomes may be lost or gained during cell division. ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE An enzyme that, when elevated activity is detected in serum, may indicate damage to certain organs. ASSAY A procedure for measurement or identification.B6C3F1 MICE a particular strain of mice.BIAS An inference which at any stage of an epidemiological investigation tends to produce results that depart sys- temically from the true values (to be distinguished from random error). The term does not necessarily carry an impu-tation of prejudice or any other subjective factor such as the experimenter's desire for a particular outcome. \u00df-ISOMER Isomers are two or more chemical compounds with the same molecular formula but having different properties owing to a different arrangement of atoms within the molecule. The \u00df-isomer of alitame is formed whenthe compound degrades and the atoms within the molecule are rearranged. BIOAVAILABILITY A term referring to the proportion of a substance which reaches the systemic circulation unchanged after a particular route of administration. 8674513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 86BIOMARKER A readily measurable biological concentration or similar quantity which acts as a surrogate for a bio- logical effect. BRONCHIAL Relating to the air passages conducting air from the trachea (windpipe) to the lungs.CARCINOGENICITY BIOASSAY Tests carried out in laboratory animals, usually rats and mice, to determine whether a substance is carcinogenic. The test material is given, usually in the diet, throughout life to groups ofanimals, at different dose levels. CARCINOGENESIS The origin, causation and development of tumours. The term applies to all forms of tumours, benign as well as malignant (see 'tumour') and not just to carcinomas (qv). CARCINOGENS The causal agents which induce tumours. They include external factors (chemicals, physical agents, viruses) and internal factors such as hormones. Chemical carcinogens are structurally diverse and includenaturally-occurring substances as well as synthetic compounds. An important distinction can be drawn betweengenotoxic (qv) carcinogens which have been shown to react directly with and mutate DNA, and non-genotoxic car- cinogens which act through other mechanisms. The activity of genotoxic carcinogens can often be predicted fromtheir chemical structure - either of the parent compound or of activated metabolites (qv). Most chemical carcino-gens exert their effects after prolonged exposure, show a dose-response relationship and tend to act on a limitedrange of susceptible target tissues. Carcinogens are sometimes species- or sex-specific and the term should be qual-ified by the appropriate descriptive adjectives to aid clarity. Several different chemical and other carcinogens mayinteract, and constitutional factors (genetic susceptibility, hormonal status) may also contribute, emphasising themultifactorial nature of the carcinogenic process. CARCINOMA Malignant tumour arising from epithelial cells lining, for example, the alimentary, respiratory and urogenital tracts and from epidermis, also from solid viscera such as the liver, pancreas, kidneys and some endocrineglands. (See also 'tumour'). CASE-CONTROL STUDY (Synonyms - case comparison study, case referent study) A study that starts with the identification of persons with the disease of interest and a suitable control group of persons without the disease. Therelationship of some attribute (such as occupational exposure to a carcinogen) to the disease is examined by com-paring the \"disease\" and non-disease groups with regard to how frequently the attribute is implicated in each. CELLS IN CULTURE Cells which have been isolated from animals and grown in the laboratory.CELL TRANSFORMATION ASSAY See T ransformation.CENTRILOBULAR HEPATOCYTE VACUOLISATION Vacuolation of cells surrounding the central vein in a liver lobule. CHROMOSOME ABERRATION Collective term of particular types of chromosome damage induced after exposure to exogenous chemical or physical agents which damage the DNA. (see clastogen). CHRONIC Describing a disease of long duration involving very slow changes. Such disease is often of gradual onset. The term does not imply anything about the severity of the disease. CLASTOGEN An agent that produces chromosome breaks and other structural aberrations such as translocations (qv). Clastogens may be viruses or physical agents as well as chemicals. Clastogenic events play an important partin the development of some tumours. COHORT A defined population. 8774513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 87COHORT STUDY (Synonyms - follow-up, longitudinal, prospective study) The method of epidemiological study in which subsets of a defined population can be identified who may be exposed to a factor or factors hypothesizedto influence the probability of occurrence of a given disease. An essential feature of the method is observation of thepopulation for a sufficient number of person-years to generate reliable incidence or mortality rates in the popula-tion subsets. This generally implies study of a large population and/or study for a prolonged period of time. CONGENER Compounds varying in chemical structure but with similar biological properties.COVALENT The type of binding formed by the sharing of an electron pair between two atoms. Molecules are combinations of atoms bound together by covalent bonds. CYTOCHROME Haem proteins that catalyse electron transfer reactions. Cytochrome P450 is a collective term for an extensive family of haem proteins involved in enzymic oxidation of a wide range of substances and their con-version to forms that are more easily excreted.

They are usually multifocal, involving lymph nodes, spleen, thymus and sometimes bone marrow and other sites outside the anatomically defined lymphoidsystem. (See also 'tumour'). MALIGNANCY See 'tumour'.META-ANALYSIS A statistical procedure to summarise quantitative data from several different epidemiological studies. It is most commonly used in summarising epidemiological evidence with respect to disease incidence. METABOLIC ACTIVATION Conversion by enzymes of a chemical from one state to another, for example by chemical reactions such as hydroxylation, epoxidation or conjugation. The term is used in a more narrow sense todescribe the addition of a mammalian cell free preparation from livers of rats pre-treated with a substance whichstimulates production of metabolising enzymes. These preparations are added to in vitro short-term tests to mimic the metabolic activation typical of mammals. METABOLISM Changes made to a compound by biological systems to modify its properties.METABOLITE Product formed from the original compound by enzymic reactions in the body/cell.METAPHASE Stage of cell division (mitosis and meiosis) during which the chromosomes are arranged on the equator of the nuclear spindle (the collection of microtubule filaments which are responsible for the movement ofchromosomes during cell division). As the chromosomes are most easily examined in metaphase, cells are arrestedat this stage for microscopical examination for chromosome aberrations (qv) - known as metaphase analysis. METASTASIS The process whereby malignant cells become detached from the primary tumour mass, disseminate (mainly in the blood stream or in lymph vessels) and 'seed out' in distant sites where they form secondary or metasta-tic tumours. Such tumours tend to develop at specific sites and their anatomical distribution is often characteristic;it is non-random. The capacity to metastasise is the single most important feature of malignant tumours (seetumour). MICRONUCLEI Isolated or broken chromosome fragments which are not expelled when the nucleus is lost during cell division, but remain in the body of the cell forming micronuclei. Centromere positive micronuclei containDNA and/or protein material derived from the centromere (qv). The presence of centromere positive micronucleifollowing exposure to chemicals can be used to evaluate the aneugenic (qv) potential of chemicals. MICRONUCLEUS TEST See Micronuclei.MITOSIS The type of cell division which occurs in somatic cells when they proliferate. Each daughter cell has the same complement as the parent cell. MOUSE LYMPHOMA ASSAY An in vitro assay for gene mutation in mammalian cells using a mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y, which is heterozygous for the gene (carries only one functional gene rather than a pair) for theenzyme thymidine kinase (TK +/-). Mutation of that single gene is measured by resistance to toxic trifluorothymi- dine. Mutant cells produce two forms of colony - large, which represent mutations within the gene and small, whichrepresent large genetic changes in the chromosome such as chromosome aberrations. Thus this assay can provideadditional information about the type of mutation which has occurred if colony size is scored. 9074513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 90MOUSE SPOT TEST An in vivo test for mutation, in which pregnant mice are dosed with the test compound and mutations are detected by changes (spots) in coat colour of the offspring. Mutations in the melanocytes (skinpigment cells) of the developing foetus are measured. MRC Medical Research Council.MUCOSAL Regarding the mucosa or mucous of epithelium (qv) containing glands secret- ing mucus, with underlying layers of connective tissue and muscle. MUTATION A permanent change in the amount or structure of the genetic material in an organism which can result in a change in the characteristics of the organism. The alternation may involve a single gene, a block of genes, or awhole chromosome. Mutations involving single genes may be a consequence of effects on single DNA bases (pointmutations) or of large changes, including deletions, within the gene. Changes involving whole chromosomes may benumerical or structural. A mutation in the germ cells of sexually reproducing organisms may be transmitted to theoffspring, whereas a mutation that occurs in somatic cells may be transferred only to descendent daughter cells. MYCOTOXIN Toxic compound produced by a fungus.NEOPLASM See 'tumour'.NEOPLASTIC Abnormal cells, the growth of which is more rapid that that of other cells.NEUROBEHAVIOURAL Of behaviour determined by the nervous system.NEUROTOXICITY Toxicity to the nervous system.NOAEL No Observed Adverse Effect Level, the highest administered dose at which no toxic effect has been observed.NO OBSERVED ADVERSE EFFECT LEVEL (NOAEL) The highest administered dose at which no toxic effect has been observed.

PREVALENCE The number of cases of a disease that are present in a population at one point in time.RECEPTOR A small, discrete area on the cell membrane or within the cell with which specific molecules interact to initiate a change in the working of a cell. REFERENCE NUTRIENT INTAKE (RNI) An amount of the nutrient that is enough, or more than enough, for most (usually at least 97%) of people in a group. If the average intake of a group is at the RNI, then the risk of defi-ciency in the group is very small. RELATIVE RISK A measure of the association between exposure and outcome. The rate of disease in the exposed population divided by the rate of disease among the unexposed population in a cohort study. A RR of 2 means thatthe exposed group has twice the disease risk compared to the unexposed group RENAL Relating to the kidney.SCF The European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food.SERUM The fluid remaining after blood has clotted.SISTER CHROMATID EXCHANGE (SCE) Exchange of genetic material between two sub-units of a replicated chromosome.

TERATOGENIC RISK Risk that a compound will cause developmental abnormalities in the foetus.THRESHOLD The lowest dose which will produce a toxic effect and below which no toxicity is observed.TOLERABLE DAILY INTAKE (TDI) An estimate of the amount of contaminant, expressed on a body weight basis, that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risks. TOXIC EQUIVALENCY FACTOR (TEF) A measure of relative toxicological potency of a chemical compared to a well characterised reference compound. TEFs can be used to sum the toxicological potency of a mixture of chem-icals which are all members of the same chemical class, having common structural, toxicological and biochemicalproperties. Systems have been published for chlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans and for polycylicaromatic hydrocarbons. TOXICOKINETICS The description of the fate of chemicals in the body, including a mathematical account of their absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. TRANSFORMATION The process by which a normal cell acquires the capacity for neoplastic growth. Complete transformation occurs in several stages both in vitro and in vivo . One step which has been identified in vitro is 'immortalisation' by which a cell acquires the ability to divide indefinitely in culture. Such cells do not have the 9274513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 92capacity to form tumours in animals, but can be induced to do so by extended passage in vitro , by treatment with chemicals, or by transfection with oncogene DNA. The transformed phenotype so generated is usually, but notalways, associated with the ability of the cells to grow in soft agar and to form tumours when transplanted intoanimals. It should be noted that each of these stages of transformation can involve multiple events which may ormay not be genetic. The order in which these events take place, if they occur at all, in vivo is not known. TRANSGENIC Genetically modified to contain genetic material from another species (see also genetically modified organism). TRANSGENIC ANIMAL MODELS Animals which have extra (exogenous) fragments of DNA incorporated into their genomes. This may include reporter genes to assess in-vivo effects such as mutagenicity in transgenic mice con- taining a recoverable bacterial gene ( lac Z or lac I ). Other transgenic animals may have alterations of specific genes believed to be involved in disease processes (eg cancer). For example strains of mice have been bred which carry aninactivated copy of the p53 tumour suppressor gene or an activated form of the rasoncogene which may enhance their susceptibility of the mice to certain types of carcinogenic chemicals. TUMOUR (Synonym - neoplasm) A mass of abnormal, disorganised cells, arising from pre-existing tissue, which are characterised by excessive and uncoordinated proliferation and by abnormal differentiation (qv). BENIGNtumours show a close morphological resemblance to their tissue of origin; grow in a slow expansile fashion; andform circumscribed and (usually) encapsulated masses. They may stop growing and they may regress. Benigntumours do not infiltrate through local tissues and they do not metastasise (qv). They are rarely fatal. MALIGNANTtumours (synonym - cancer) resemble their parent tissues less closely and are composed of increasingly abnormalcells in terms of their form and function. Well differentiated examples still retain recognizable features of their tissueof origin but these characteristics are progressively lost in moderately and poorly differentiated malignancies: undif-ferentiated or anaplastic tumours are composed of cells which resemble no known normal tissue. Most malignanttumours grow rapidly, spread progressively through adjacent tissues and metastasise to distant sites. T umours areconventionally classified according to the anatomical site of the primary tumour and its microscopical appearance,rather than by cause. Some common examples of nomenclature are as follows: T umours arising from epithelia T umours from connective tissues fat, cartilage or bone: benign lymphoid tissues are malignant and are called lymphomas (qv); they are often multifocal. Malignant prolif-erations of bone marrow cells are called leukaemias. Benign tumours may evolve to the corresponding malig-nant tumours; examples involve the adenoma -> carcinoma sequence in the large bowel in humans, and thepapilloma -> carcinoma sequence in mouse skin. UNSCHEDULED DNA SYNTHESIS (UDS) DNA synthesis that occurs at some stage in the cell cycle other than the S period (the normal or 'scheduled' DNA synthesis period) in response to DNA damage. It is usually associatedwith DNA repair. WHO-IPCS/ECEH The World Health Organization's European Centre for Environment and Health and the WHO's International Programme on Chemical Safety. XENOESTROGENS A 'foreign' compound, i.e. not natural to the body, with oestrogenic activity.XENOBIOTIC A chemical foreign to the biologic system.XENOESTROGENS Oestrogens that are foreign to the body.

The Committee on Toxicity (COT) and its sister committees the Committee on Mutagenicity (COM) and Committee on Carcinogenicity (COC) are non-statutory independent advisory committees who advise theCMO and, through the CMO, the Government on a wide range of matters concerning chemicals in food, con-sumer products and the environment. 2. The Government is committed to make the operation of advisory committees such as the COT/COM/COC more open and to increase accountability. Proposals have been published in \"Quangos-Opening the Doors\" (Cabinet Office, July 1998). The COT/COM/COC have recently considered a numberof options for greater openness of Committee business. There was a high level of agreement between theCOT/COM/COC regarding the adoption of proposals for greater openness. 3. In discussing these proposals the Committees were aware that the disclosure of information which is of a confidential nature and was communicated in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence is subject tothe common law of confidentiality. Guidance is set out in the Code of Practice on Access to GovernmentInformation (second edition, 1997). Thus an important aspect of implementing initiatives for greater openness ofCommittee business concerns setting out clear guidelines for the handling of information submitted on aconfidential basis. General procedures for greater openness 4. The Committees agreed that the publication of agendas, finalised minutes, agreed conclusions andstatements (subject to the adoption of appropriate procedures for handling commercially sensitive information)and appointment of a lay/public interest member to each Committee would help to increase public scrutiny ofCommittee business. The Committees also agreed that additional open meetings on specific topics where interestgroups, consumer organisations etc could attend and participate should be held. 5. A summary of the proposals is tabulated below. A more detailed outline of procedures regarding products where confidential data has been reviewed is given in paragraphs 11-13. 6. The Committees stressed that, in view of the highly technical nature of the discussions, there was a need for all documents released to be finalised and agreed by the Committee, ie any necessary consultation withMembers and Chairman should be completed before disclosure. 7. Statements and conclusions should summarise all the relevant data, such as information regarding potential hazards/risks for human health in respect of the use of products and chemicals, and anyrecommendations for further research. 8. The Committees will be asked for an opinion based on the data available at the time of consideration. It is recognised that, for many chemicals, the toxicological information is incomplete and that recommendations forfurther research to address these gaps will form part of the Committee's advice. 9. The release of documents (papers, minutes, conclusions and statements) where the COT/COM/COC has agreed an opinion on the available data but where further additional information is required in order to finalisethe Committee's conclusions, needs to be considered on a case-by case basis. The relevant considerations includethe likelihood that such additional data would alter the Committee's conclusion, any representations made by a 10574513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 105company about, for example, commercial harm that early disclosure could cause and also the public interest in disclosure. 10. In the event that the Committees need to consider an item over several meetings, it might be necessary to keep relevant documents (eg papers and minutes) confidential until an agreed opinion (eg statement) is available. Summary of proposals for committee openness. * Procedures for handling confidential information outlined in para 11-13 below. Procedures for handling confidential information Background 11. COT/COM/COC quite often consider information which has been supplied in confidence. For the most part this comprises information which is commercially sensitive. For example, this could include productformulations/specifications, methods of manufacture, and reports of toxicological investigations and companyevaluations and safety assessments. 12. The normal procedure in the past has been to publish a summary of the Committee's advice in the Annual Report and to ask companies to release full copies of submitted reports for retention by the British Library at the completion of a review. Given the clear Ministerial commitment to the publication of detailed informationregarding the activities of advisory committees, and in particular following the assessment of products which are already available to the general public, the COT/COM/COC have begun to adopt where possible a moreopen style of business where detailed statements have been published via the Internet soon after they have been finalised.Issue Proposals Comment Open meetings on specified topics Agreed. Suggestions include Meetings would be on generic (eg invited audience, interest groups, meeting at time of release of issues in chemical toxicology,consumer organisations, Annual Report. External carcinogencity, mutagenicity andprofessional societies). consultation on identifying topics risk assessment. There would be for such meetings. no discussions of individual commercial products. Agenda Agreed Made publicly available via Internet site prior to meeting. Papers Agreed Finalised papers in to be made available upon request. Confidentialinformation/annexes to be removed. Minutes* Agreed Anonymised minutes made available upon request and on Internet siteafter appropriate consultation withmembers and agreement by the fullcommittee. Conclusions/statements* Agreed Agreed conclusions/statements published as appropriate including viathe Internet and also made availableon request. Annual Report* Agreed Publish in accordance with procedures for previous years. 10674513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 10613. Except in cases where there is legislation under which information has been submitted and which deals with disclosure and non-disclosure, the general principle of the common law duty of confidentiality will apply.This means that any information which is of a confidential character and has been obtained in circumstancesimporting a duty of confidence may not be disclosed unless consent has been given or there is an overridingpublic interest in disclosure (such as the prevention of harm to others). The following procedure will be adoptedwhich allows confidential information to be identified, assessed and appropriate conclusions/statements to bedrafted and published on the basis of a prior mutual understanding with the companies. There is scope forcompanies to make representations also after submission of the information and prior to publication regardingthe commercial sensitivity of data supplied and to comment on the text of statements which are to be published.However, companies would not have a right of veto in respect of such statements. Procedures prior to committee consideration Initial discussionsUpon referral to COT/COM/COC the Secretariat will liaise with the relevant company supplying the product inthe UK to; i) Clearly state the policy of Committee openness (as summarised above).ii) To identify and request the information needed by the COT/COM/COC (eg test reports, publi- cations etc). Confidential data iii) The company will be asked to clearly identify any confidential data and the reason for confidential- ity. Handling confidential data iv) The procedures by which the COT/COM/COC will handle confidential data and the public avail- ability of papers, minutes, conclusions and statements where reference is made to such data will bediscussed with the company prior to submission of papers to the Committee(s). The general pro-cedures for handling documents are outlined in paragraphs 4-10 above. Companies will beinformed that confidential annexes to Committee papers (eg where detailed information suppliedin confidence such as individual patient information and full study reports of toxicological studies)will not be disclosed but that other information will be disclosed unless agreed otherwise with anindividual company. v) The following is a suggested list of information which might be disclosed in COT/COM/COC doc- uments (papers, minutes, conclusions and statements). The list is not exhaustive and is presented as aguide. a) name of product (or substance/chemical under consideration),b) information on physico-chemical properties,c) methods of rendering harmless,d) a summary of the results and evaluation of the results of tests to establish harmlessness to humans,e) methods of analysis, 10774513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 107f) first aid and medical treatment to be given in the case of injury to persons. g) surveillance data (eg monitoring for levels in food, air, or water). Procedures during and after Committee consideration. vi) The timing of release of Committee documents (papers, minutes, conclusions and statements) where the item of business involved the consideration of confidential data would be subject to thegeneral provisions outlined in paragraphs 4-10 above. Documents would not be released until aCommittee - agreed conclusion or statement was available. vii) The most important outcome of the Committee consideration is likely to be the agreed statement. Companies will be given an opportunity to comment on the statement prior to publication andto make representations (for example, as to commercial sensitivities in the statement). TheChairman would be asked to consider any comments provided, but companies would not be ableto veto the publication of a statement or any part of it. Companies will continue to be asked torelease full copies of submitted reports for retention by the British Library at the completion of a review. Introduction of new arrangements 14. These new arrangements will be announced by press release and publication on the Committees' Internetsites and will be adopted by the COT/COM/COC during 1999. 10874513-DOH-Ann Report 1999 5/4/00 10:11 am Page 8 References 1 Himsworth H, Dornhorst HC, Thompson RHS.
