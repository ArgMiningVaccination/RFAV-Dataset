Plaintiff, vs. SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, TWIN RIDGES ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT, DOES OF THE ANTHROPOSOPHICAL SOCIETY IN AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS 85740_1.DOC - 15 - Amicus Curiae Brief - Case No: CIV S-98-0266 FCD PAN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 I. STATEMENT OF INTEREST The Anthroposophical Society in America, Inc., (the \"Society\") is a sepa rate legal entity from Defendant public school dist ricts and the charter and magnet Wal dorf-method public schools at issue. Moreover, it is a separate and dis tinct entity from the various priv ate Waldorf schools, the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA) and Waldorf teacher training academies, such as Rudolf Steiner College and others in the United States. Hence, the Society has no party interest in these proceedings. However, the Society is the lega l representative of anthroposophy 1 in this country and is charged with a responsibility for the reputa tion of anthroposophy and its public fa ce. The Society believes that a decision by this Court that adopts the plaintiff's position, that the use of Waldorf method educational practices in defendant public schools advance anthroposophy and th at anthroposophy is a religion, would profoundly mischaracterize anthroposophy a nd cast the relationship of anthroposophy with Waldorf education, independent Wa ldorf teacher training academies, and several hundred independent entities which characterize themselves as Anthroposophical in a false light. Therefore, we request the Court's leave to put before it the character of anthroposophy as well as the salient features of the Society for consideration in this matter. II. STATEMENT OF FACTS The Society, which was incorporated in 1933 in the State of New York, offers this amicus curiae brief to the Court in its capacity as the official and legal represen tative of anthroposophy in the United States. In the case at bar the Plaintiff PLANS alleges, inter alia , that the California charter and magnet Waldorf-method schools in question a dvance \"the religious doctrines of anthroposophy\" and that their doing so is offensive to the constitutional prohibitions against the esta blishment of religion. (Complaint 1 Anthroposophy (from the Greek \"anthropos\", meaning human, and \"sophia\", meaning wisdom) is a method of inquiry developed by Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). Steiner demonstrated the results of his research in more than 40 books and 6,000 lectures on wide ranging subjects including the application of his research into practical, ever yday life such as the education of children (Waldorf Education) , agriculture (Biodynamics), medicine, ther apeutics, pharmaceuticals, the fine arts, the performing arts, finance, and others. The anthroposophical movement is a confederacy of independently organized, financed and operated initiatives whose only commonality is the methodology of anthroposophy. 85740_1.DOC - 15 - Amicus Curiae Brief - Case No: CIV S-98-0266 FCD PAN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, Paragraphs 8 a nd 11.) Central to the pl aintiff's argument is the allegation that \"anthroposophy\" rises to the legal de finition of a \"religion\" for Establishment Clause purposes. The Society disputes this char acterization and offers the Court this amicus brief to substantiate the Defendant School Dist ricts' position that the Court should not answer in the affirmative the question \"Is Anthroposophy a religion?\". III. LEGAL ARGUMENT A. Plaintiff Cannot Prove That Anthroposophy Is A Religion. 1. A Determination Of The Definition Of Anthroposophy, Necessary For A Judicial Determination That Anthroposophy Is A Religion, Is Not An Appropriate Undertaking For This Court. Plaintiff is endeavoring to prove, in support of its argument that the use of certain Waldorf methods by public charter and magnet schools in the defendant school districts violates the Establishment Clause of the United States and California Constitutions, that \"anthroposophy\" is a \"religion,\" and that the religion of anthroposophy is promulgated in th e schools in question. In order to prove these propositions, plaintiff must prove what anthroposophy is, and must demonstrate that the methods used in the defendant Public Schools are intended to establish or advance the practice of anthroposophy. The first question to be addressed by th e parties, according to th is Court's directive of April 11, 2001, is \"whether Anthroposophy is a sy stem of belief and worship of a superhuman controlling power under a code of et hics and philosophy requiring obed ience therefore.\" (April 11, 2001 Tr. 4, 5 to 7.) Alvarado v. City of San Jose , 94 F.3d 1223 (9th Cir. 1996) sets forth the standard test for a determination of what constitutes a \"religi on\" for Establishment Clause purposes. Alvarado relies heavily on the concurring opinion of Judge Adams in the Third Circuit decision of Malnak v. Yogi , 592 F.2d 197 (3d Cir. 1979) (\"Malnak II\"), which affirmed Malnak v. Yogi , 440 F. Supp. 1284 (CD N.J. 1977) (\"Malnak I\"). First, a religion addresse s fundamental and ultimate questions having to do with deep and imponderable matters. Second, a religion is comprehensive in nature; it consists of a belief-system as opposed to an isolated teaching. 85740_1.DOC - 15 - Amicus Curiae Brief - Case No: CIV S-98-0266 FCD PAN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Third, a religion often can be recognized by the presence of certain formal and external signs. Alvarado , supra , at 1032 S.Ct. 1756, 72 L.Ed 165 (1982), quoting Malnak II at 207-210. The Malnak cases addressed the question of whet her a public high school course taught with the intent of inculcating a specific practi ce of transcendental meditation constituted the advancement of or establishment of a \"religion\". In Malnak I and Malnak II , the meaning of \"transcendental meditation\" for the purpose of legal analysis was not an issue for the Court. A definitive understanding of transcendental meditation as used in the school in ques tion was unambiguously set forth in a textbook that was taught to the students in the class. Th e fact that the very ideas under scrutiny were laid out in a textbook which was part of a specific educational pr actice intended to teach a specific meditation practice relieved the Court from the burden of fo rmulating its own definition of \"transcendental meditation.\" The textbook further relieved the Malnak Court from making a ruling as to what beliefs, methodologies and pr actices ought to be considered to be a part of \"transcendental meditation\" and what beliefs, me thodologies and practices should be considered extraneous to \"transcendental meditation.\" The Malnak Court, in short, was not f aced with the immense burden of defining \"transcendental meditation.\" Courts, for good reason, have been reluctant to make abstract dete rminations involving the legitimacy of representations made about the beliefs of private organizations. Here, the task plaintiff seeks to thrust upon the Court\u2014to render a judgment as to whethe r \"anthroposophy\" is a religion under the Establishment Clause\u2014is made immeasurably more difficult than the task undertaken by the New Jersey District Court and the Third Circuit because, unlike the concept of \"trans cendental meditation\" in Malnak I and Malnak II , there is here no specific textbook of \"anthroposophy\" a ssigned to students or teachers or any definition of \"anth roposophy\" agreed upon by all parties. 2 But plaintiff here, as a first step in resolving its lawsuit, is demanding that th is Court undertake to define what \"anthroposophy\" is as well as to determine whether this \"anthroposophy\" is a religion under the Establishment Clause. 2 There is no textbook of \"anthroposophy\" here (unlike the situation in Malnak ) because \"anthroposophy\" is not taught in the defendant schools. 85740_1.DOC - 15 - Amicus Curiae Brief - Case No: CIV S-98-0266 FCD PAN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 In order to do what plaintiff demands, this C ourt would have to firs t determine that there is a single, univocal set of belie fs or practices which it can confidently isolate from others and definitively label \"anthroposophy.\" This Court would ha ve to segregate from the thousands of writings, loosely described as \"anthroposophical,\" those whic h it deems to represent \"anthroposophy\" and those which it deems do not. 3 Then the court would have to compar e this anthroposophy with what is being presented by the plaintiff. This is precisely the sort of quixotic enterprise that a steady stream of case law for decades has warned the courts against. Thus, the question of whethe r \"anthroposophy is a religion\" under the Establishment Clause would (1) require an anci llary ruling as to what constitu tes \"anthroposophy\" and what does not, and (2) demand a determination of what is the proper status and interpretation of any documents that are alleged to be \"anthroposophical.\" The procedure w ould constitute a colossal exercise in judicial inefficiency. The determination of whether an entity called \"anthroposophy\" (w hatever that is determined to be) constitutes a \"religion\" under th e Establishment Clause w ould divert this case from what it should be about\u2014a consideration of whet her specific pedagogical me thodologies are in fact exclusively \"Waldorf\", whether \"Waldorf-methods\" are inextricably linke d with \"anthroposophy\", whether teachers in the defendant schools intended to use specific pe dagogical devices for the students in those schools and whether those pedagogical devices violate the Establishment Clause of the Federal or State Constitutions. The determination of an abst ract question about \"anthroposophy\", in isolation, is the functional equivalent of a complaint for a declar atory judgment seeking an advisory opinion as to whether \"anthroposophy\" constitutes a \"religion,\" and is properly analogized to such a case. Courts have consistently dismissed actions filed as declaratory judgment suits on the grounds that the question sought to be determined is not a \"case or controversy\" under Article III of the United States Constitution, which limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts by requiring that such 3 The Court would also have to interpret and paraphrase a vast set of writings which have been characterized by their authors as esoteric and nondogmatic, the contents of which have be en emphatically represented by those authors not to constitute ordinary, exoteric \"information.\" In order to characterize such fundamental writings of \"spiritual research\" as \"beliefs,\" the Court would have to make a determination that those authors were either misrepresenting their ow n work or that they were in error about the belief content of their own work. 85740_1.DOC - 15 - Amicus Curiae Brief - Case No: CIV S-98-0266 FCD PAN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 courts only address matters of actua l cases or controversies. Actual cases or controversies on matters presenting a real, not a hypothetical controversy, involve concrete and current, not uncertain or contingent, events. Nashville, Chattanguan St. Louis Railway v. V. Wallis , 288 U.S. 249, 77 L.Ed. 730, 53 S.Ct. 345 (1933); LaAbva Silv er Min. Co. v. United States , 175 U.S. 423, 44 L.Ed.223, 20 S.Ct. 168 (1899). It is well settled that the Court \"is without power to grant de claratory relief unless [an actual controversy] exists.\" Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific & Oil Co. , 312 U.S. 270, 272, 85 L.Ed. 826, 61 S.Ct. 510 (1941). The plaintiff must prove the current existence of the dispute that justifies an adjudication of the parties' rights based on current pertinent facts in order to establish a case or controversy warranting declaratory judgment. Ashcroft v. Mattis , 431 U.S. 171, 52 L.Ed. 2d 219, 97 S.Ct. 1739 (1977). Absent such proof, any judgmen t rendered by the Court would be an advisory opinion, which federal courts are constitutionally forb idden to issue. United States Bank of Oregon v. Independent Insurance Agents of America , 508 U.S. 439, 446, 124 L.E. 2d 402, 113 S.Ct. 2173 (1993); Sierra (1972); 45, 48, 24 L.Ed. 2d 214, 90 S.Ct. 200 (1969). The enorm ously broad question of what anthroposophy \"is\"\u2014whether it is a method or a system of beliefs and worship\u2014is simply not necessary for a judicial determination of whether there has been a violation of the Establishm ent Clause in the schools here. Whether the character of what was imparted was religion or not may be re levant; but the definition and ontological status of something as di verse, difficult and removed from a ny school setting as is the entire subject of \"anthroposophy,\" is simply beyond the proper scope of inquiry. Anthroposophy is not on trial here. The only question arguably at issu e in this litigation is the constitutional status of what is being taught in the defendant school districts. Any pronouncements by this Court on the definition of anthroposophy, the proper interpretation of anthroposophy, whether particular an throposophical writings constitute methodologies or \"teachings or beliefs of any kind\"\u2014without specific reference to sp ecific practices shown to have been conducted at specific schools \u2014would be hypothetical, advisory and beyond the proper interest of the Court. Civil courts traditionally have been held to lack jurisdiction to determine the issue of compliance by a religious group with the rules, philos ophies and precepts of larg er religious groups with 85740_1.DOC - 15 - Amicus Curiae Brief - Case No: CIV S-98-0266 FCD PAN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 which they are affiliated. Resolution of the \"is anthroposophy a religion\" question would entail precisely this sort of determina tion. It would force the Court to choose among competing definitions and varieties of anthroposophy, i.e., differences between casual readers of anthroposophical publications, longtime students and others. If the Court chooses to treat anthroposophy as a religion, th en anthroposophy is entitled to the protections of the First Amendment, which prohi bits the exercise of jurisdiction by the civil courts to decide which are in fact the true \"rules,\" \"philosophy\" a nd \"precepts\" of the given \"religion.\" Simple judicial efficiency dictates that the question of whether an throposophy is a religion must be determined\u2014if at all\u2014only after th e question of what (if any) pur ported \"anthroposophical\" tenets are allegedly being practiced in the schools in question. Plaintiff's representatives, have stated their intention to introduce more than 100 \"documents\" into evidence to which they hope to de fine or reinvent \"anthroposophy\" for the Court. While the Society has no wish for the Court to engage in the kind of circus of hypotheses, interpretations and innuendoes that plaintiff is appa rently eager to stage, it is profoundl y interested that such \"evidence\" be seen in light of the views of the entity best situated to put it in accurate perspective. It is respectfully submitted that the kind of philosophical farrago that plaintiff seeks to perpetrate on the participants is not the kind of bus iness that the Court should be about. Determination of the essential issue in this case\u2014whether Wal dorf methods intentionally advance religion in the defendant school districts and by what means the plai ntiff measures that adva nce\u2014would lead to the clear, precise and mercifully efficient pro cedure proper for a determination of the case. 2. Assuming, Arguendo, That The Co urt Were To Undertake To Posit A Definition Of \"Anthroposophy\", The Court Should Not Make The Determination That \"Anthroposophy\" Is A Religion For Purposes Of The Establishment Clause. Assuming the Court were to formulate a definition of anthroposophy, plaintiff by summary judgment and/or summary adjudication motion has asked the Court to determine it is a religion under the Establishment Clause. Such a determinati on would have staggering practical implications for 85740_1.DOC - 15 - Amicus Curiae Brief - Case No: CIV S-98-0266 FCD PAN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 the federal courts. If the Court in this case were to make a determination as to whether \"anthroposophy\" constitutes a religion for the Establishment Clause, woul d it not also be necessary for a similarly situated court to undertake to determine th e religious status of Montessori education, given th e existence of a lawsuit alleging that the operati on of Montessori pedagogical met hods in a school violated the Establishment Clause? The mere showing that an e ducator's (such as Maria Montessori, John Dewey or Rudolf Steiner) pedagogical views have been influen tial in the curriculum of a given school and that those educators (Montessori, Dewe y or Steiner) elsewhere expressed spiritual or philosophical views cannot be grounds for examining the \"religious\" status of the educator's views under the Establishment Clause. This issue is already settled concerning John Dewey, one of the most influential pedagogical pioneers of public education and one of the signers of the founding docum ent for the so-called \"religion\" of Secular Humanism, The Humanist Manifesto I in 1933. In Torasco v. Watkins , 367 U.S. 488, 6 L.Ed. 2d 982, 81 S.Ct. 1680 (1961), the U.S. Supreme Court considered the consti tutionality of a required oath unde r the First Amendment. Without focusing upon the Free Exercise or Establishment Cl auses, the Court in footnote included \"secular humanism\" as a non-theistic \"re ligion.\" Id. at 495, n. 11. In Peloza v. Capistrano Unified School Dist. , 37 F.3d 517 (9th Cir. 1994), a high school biology teacher tried to balance the teaching of evolutionism with cr eationism based on the claim that Secular Humanism (and its core belief, evolutionism) is a religi on. The Ninth Circuit emphatically rejected the claim that secular hum anism (and evolutionism) may be cons idered to be a \"religion\" under the Establishment Clause: We reject this claim because neither the Supr eme Court, nor this circuit, has ever held that evolutionism or secular humanism are \"religi ons\" for Establishment Clause purposes. Indeed, both the dictionary definition of religi on and the clear weight of caselaw are to the contrary. The Supreme Court has held unequivocally that while the belief in a divine creator of the universe is a religious belief, the scientific theory that higher forms of life evol ved from lower forms is not. Edwards v. Aguillard , 482 U.S. 578, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 96 L.Ed.2d 510 (1987). 85740_1.DOC - Brief - Case No: CIV S-98-0266 FCD PAN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 In the Supreme Court decision Ab ington School District v. Schempp , 374 US 203, 83 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963); Justice Clark stated: [T]he State may not establish a 'religi on of secularism' in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostil ity to religion, thus \"preferring those who believe in no religi on over those who do believe.\" It may well be that an educational pioneer's personal beliefs, such as John Dewey's in \"Secular Humanism\" is potentially protected for Free Exercise, but not prohibited, under Establishment Clause principles. The Second Circuit has held that while evolutionism or secular humanism may be \"religions\" for purposes of the Fr ee Exercise Clause, \"anything 'ar guably non-religious' should not be considered religious in appl ying the establishment clause .\" United States v. Allen , 760 F.2d 447, 450-51 (2d Cir. 1985), quoting Tribe, American Constitutional Law 827-28 (1978). Thus, the personal spiritual, moral or reli gious belief of a peda gogical innovator does not \"infuse\" that person's pedagogical methodology with re ligion simply because of the fact that that innovator had personal spiritual, moral or religious beli efs. One must look to the specific practices in order to determine the issue. 3. The Anthroposophical Movement And The Anthropo-Sophical Society Are Not \"Religious\" Within The Meaning Of Alvarado. The Society has contended from its inception that anthroposophy is not a univocal system of dogmas or beliefs, but a language of inquiry , a scientific method that embraces the sometimes diverse insights of its participants. A c ourt must be precluded from choosi ng among such diverse insights and defining, categorizing or interpreti ng anthroposophy in any one way. S ee Oklahoma District Council of Assemblies of God v. New Hope Assembly of God Church, Inc. , 548 P. 2d 1029, 1976 Okla. 46 (1979). The Statutes of the Society 4 state emphatically that anthr oposophy is not a religion. It has no dogma. The Statutes of the So ciety state: \"A dogma tic stand in any field whatsoever is to be excluded from the Anthroposophical Society.\" Statutes of the Anthroposophical Society , #9. 4 The statutes are the founding principles and organizational document of the worldwide Society (Swiss equivalent to by- laws) and are specifically incorporated into the By-law s of the Anthroposophical Society in America, Inc. 85740_1.DOC - 15 - Amicus Curiae Brief - Case No: CIV S-98-0266 FCD PAN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 The Society does not propound a system of beliefs. It views anthroposophy as a cognitive methodology, a path to knowledge: The findings made in spiritual scienc e arise from thought processes that have been enlivened and re-formed a nd because of this also have an enlivening effect on human souls when taken in to those souls and tested for their truth... [T]he essential aim of spiritual science ... is to enter with one's mind into the sphere of free thought activity. Rudolf Steiner, Fruits of Anthroposophy 64, 72-73 (Rudolf Steiner Press 1986). The Society does not engage in religion, insist upon religion or interfere with religious practice. It consciously and em phatically stands apart from relig ion. Many members of the Society engage in traditional religions; many do not. So me practice non-theistic spirituality; many other members are connected to no relig ious practice. The Society honor s each member's own religion and the moral injunctions of that relig ion. The Statutes of the Societ y state that \"Anyone can become a member, without regard to nationality , social standing, religion or scien tific or artistic conviction... The Anthroposophical Society rejects any kind of sectarian activity.\" The Statutes of the Anthroposophical Society , #4. Nor is anthroposophy a religion for Establishment Clause purposes. As stated in Section A above, Alvarado v. City of San Jose , 94 F. 3d 123, relies heavily upon th e detailed concurring opinion of Judge Adams Malnak v. Yogi , 592 F. 2d 197 (3rd Cir. 1979) (\"Malnak II\"). There Judge Adams articulated a test incorporating \"i ndicia\" or \"factors,\" to consider in determining whether a group could be considered a religion for Establishm ent Cause purposes. Those indicia are: First, a religion addresse s fundamental and ultimate questions having to do with deep and imponderable matters. Second, a religion is comprehensive in nature; it consists of a belief-system as opposed to an isolated teaching. Third, a religion often can be recognized by the presence of certain formal and external signs. Alvarado v. City of San Jose , at 1229, quoting Africa v. Pennsylvania , 1032 102 S.Ct. 1756, 72 L.Ed 2d 165 (1982). 5 5 See also Friedman v. Southern California Permanente Medical Group , 102 Cal App. 4th 39 (2002), which similarly relies on Africa , and Malnak II . 85740_1.DOC - Case No: CIV S-98-0266 FCD PAN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 The \"formal and external signs\" listed by the court include: \"formal services, ceremonial functions, the existence of clergy, structure and or ganization, efforts at pr opagation, observance of holidays and other similar manifestations asso ciated with a traditional religion.\" Africa , 662 F. 2d at 1035-36. Addressing the first factor outlined in Malnak II , many anthroposophical publications discuss \"fundamental and ultimate questions having to do with deep and imponderable matters.\" However, Anthroposophy discusses findings based on philosophical questioning and research. The Anthroposophical Society in America, Inc., does not propound specific beliefs or dogma about these ultimate questions nor are there \"sacred\" texts. Rather, the Society encourages personal inquiry or research. The scientific methodology\u2014the mode of inquiry\u2014which char acterizes anthroposophy should not be confused with the published results of R udolf Steiner's personal research which, while arguably embracing \"ultimate\" questions , were never intended to be anything but a presentation of his findings for anyone interested in testing them. 6 They are certainly not \"binding\" for members of the Anthroposophical Society. Anthroposophy does not au thoritatively address the fundamental questions comprising the first test of Malnak II . 6 \"It is easy to understand Steiner's extreme reluctance to have his lectures recorded; and it is easier still to realise why, i n his lectures and books, he kept on repeating, almost to exasperation, such phrases as \"what is contained in\", \"what is reflected by\", and so forth -- if we only recollect that, of all men, he spoke from the Consciousness Soul to the Consciousness Soul. 'Think these thoughts without believing them\", he once said; and in nearly all his utterances he employed the mode, not of discursive argument, but of pure assertion -- though he could syllogise as well as anyone if he chose to, as he showed in The Philosophy of Freedom . And this reluctance, and these phrases and habits of his, and the essential nature of anthroposophy, place -- so it seems to me -- rather a heav y responsibility upon its adherents. I ca nnot think it is unduly paradoxical to say that it is really a kind of betrayal of the founder of anthroposophy to believe what he said. He poured out his assertions because he trusted his hearers not to believe. Belief is something which can only be applied to systems of abstract ideas. To become an anthroposophist is not to believe, it is to decide to use the words of Rudolf Steiner (and any others which may become available) for the purpose of raising oneself, if possible, to a kind of thinking which is itself beyond words, which precedes them, in the sense that ideas, words, sentences, propositions, are only subsequently drawn out of it . This is that concrete* thinking which is the source of all such ideas and propositions, the source of all meaning whatsoever. And it can only take the form of logical ideas and propositions and grammatical sentences, at the expense of much of its original truth. For to be logical is to make one little part of your meaning precise by excluding all the other parts. To be an anthroposophis t, then, is to seek to unite oneself, not with any groups of word s, but with this concrete thinking, whose existence can only be finally proved by experience.\" Owen Barfield, Romanticism Comes of Age , 76-77 (Wesleyan Univ ersity Press, 1967) *The word as meaning 'neither ective nor subjective'. 85740_1.DOC Case No: CIV S-98-0266 FCD PAN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Without question, Anthroposophy does not meet the second Malnak test for religion under the Establishment Clause. It is manifestly not a \"belief-system\" of any kind. Rudolf Steiner could not have said so more emphatically. The Stat utes of the Society make it crystal clear. The Society admits members of totally different religions and belief-systems. On January 11, 1916 in Liesal, near Basel in Switzerland, Rudol f Steiner said the following: Now it is often asked how spiritual science or anthroposophy stands in relation to the religious li fe of man. By reason of the whole character of anthroposophy, it will not intervene in a ny religious creed, in the sphere of any sort of religious life. Spiritual Science never can entertain the wish to create a religion... One cannot, therefore, call spiritual science, as such, a religious faith. It neither aims at cr eating a religious faith nor in any way at changing a person in relation to his re ligious beliefs. In spite of this, it seems as if people were worrying th emselves about the religion of the Anthroposophists. In truth, however, it is not possible to speak in this way, because, within the Anthroposophical Society, every kind of religion is represented, and there is nothing to prevent an yone from practicing his religious faith as fully, comprehensivel y, and intensively as he wishes. Rudolf Steiner, \"The Mission of Spiritual Science and of Its Building at Dornach,\" Approaches to Anthroposophy (lecture of 11 January 1916) , Life and Work of Rudolf Steiner , pp. 100-101 (Whittier Books, Inc., 1955). Still later, Steiner was emphatic that anthroposophy was not only not a religion, but that it should have no sectarian tendenc ies whatsoever.

The Statutes of the Anthroposophical Society #4 (emphasis added). For the preceding reasons, anthroposophy, even if it were subject to judicial definition, is not a \"religion\" under the operative Establishment Clause tests. IV. CONCLUSION As early as April 11, 2001, the Court asked \"[w] hether Anthroposophy is a system of belief and worship of a superhuman controlling power under a code of ethics and philosophy requiring obedience thereto.\" (April 11, 2001 Tr. 4, 5 to 7.)
