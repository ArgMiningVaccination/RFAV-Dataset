Clients enjoy the healing benefits of these ancient practices and halotherapy while in the privacy of a serene and secluded room within the salt cave.

Chakra Boutique Our boutique is filled with amazing crystals, beautiful jewelry and a large selection of salt lamps and products. Chakra Guide Learn about the physical, emotional, and spiritual meaning of the chakras with our Chakra Guide. Reiki Energy is flowing through us and within the physical body through pathways called chakras. Life force nourishes the organs and cells of the body, supporting them in their vital functions. When this flow of life force is disrupted, it causes diminished function in one or more of the organs and tissues of the physical body. The life force is responsive to thoughts and feelings. It becomes disrupted when we accept, either consciously or unconsciously, negative thoughts or feelings about ourselves. These negative thoughts and feelings attach themselves to the energy field and cause a disruption in the flow of life force. This diminishes the vital function of the organs and cells of the physical body. Reiki This session begins with a brief meditation and a discussion of your concerns and goals to maximize your experience. The provider gently and slowly moves their hands above the body to access chi or energy flow before releasing blockages and facilitating a healthy flow of chi. Reiki with Mediumship The session includes a consultation and reiki meditation prior to energy healing. Our experienced reiki masters will share loving spiritual messages during sessions if requested. Pricing $135 Energy Healing We all are made up of various energy fields that affect us physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. The goal of energy healing is to bring light force energy into the body to balance the energy systems and also allow the client to release any old beliefs, connections, or patterns that are no longer needed. After an energy healing session, clients report feeling lighter and more relaxed, and many report a continued improvement in how they think and feel weeks or months after a session. Whatever form you prefer, we encourage clients to treat energetic health with a long-term perspective. While energy healing is wonderful, it is not magic. Life, with all it's new experiences and changing relationships is a constant variable causing imbalances, energetic blockages and misalignment. Regular energy healing sessions will help to release the \"emotional junk\" we acquire along the way, keeping your energy open and flowing to receive all the good life has intended for you. Reiki, Chakra Balancing, and Cellular Healing featured on this page are some of the many types of energy healing. As we are grow and evolve, we love to offer new services and introduce new providers! Spirit Channeling is a form of communication between humans and other light beings of higher dimensions to receive guidance. These beings can be angelic, spiritual guides, spirits of nature, or spirits of loved ones who have passed. Through channeling, clients can access insights on specific topics. The messages can be very helpful for a personal spiritual journey. Group events are growing in popularity. Call for details. Past Life Regression More info coming soon on past life regression with Neysha Cellular Healing Cellular expansion and healing is a form of hands-on energy work that is a revolutionary approach to releasing tension. Similar to a reiki session CEH works on a deeper, cellular level. The result of this treatment is a profound sense of peace and relaxation. Achieving this level of such innate peace and reaching the root cause of imbalance allowing for physical, emotional, and mental healing at the root cause of imbalance. This technique is especially beneficial for stress, anxiety/depression, and trauma. It is noninvasive and an excellent compliment to traditional medicine. Like reiki, client remains fully clothed and is lying down while made comfortable with blankets and pillows. Define your intention and let the provider \"download\" divine light and energy providing a boost to your energy and consciousness. Clients have described a sense of swirling energy and tingling within the body as the energy is received and effects lasting up to 30 days. Cellular Expansion and Healing was developed in Pittsburgh by Deb Schnitta and is now available worldwide and only available thru trained therapists.
