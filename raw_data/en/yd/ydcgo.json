Long -term and nonspecific symptoms have previously been reported following other viral infections , and after bacterial and parasitic infections. It is also known that people who are admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe lung failure caused by other diseases than COVID -19, can report long -term functional impairments such as impaired cognitive function , mental health problems and reduced lung function after discharge. Objectives We aimed to summaris e research on the proportion of patients who get long -term symptoms, which long -term symptoms occur after COVID -19, how long the symptoms persist and which patient groups that have the greatest risk of experiencing long -term symptoms. In addition , we summarise differences in the risk of long -term post infectious symptoms and new onset diseases between COVID -19 and other respiratory tract infections (RTI s). Method s This rapid review \" Post COVID -19 condition and new onset diseases after COVID -19\" is the 4th version replacing our previous report published on February 15th, 2022. In this version we use d more stringent inclusion criteria than in previous versions, and we included controlled studies with more than 500 mainly laboratory test positive COVID -19 cases with a follow -up time of six months or longer . We excluded studies mainly reporting on laboratory or radiological finding , uncontrolled studies, and controlled studies that had not been peer- reviewed . The findings are based on systematic searches in MEDLINE and WHO Global research on coronavirus disease ( COVID -19) database on September 19th, 2022, and a network database search in OpenAlex . One researcher screened the search results. Two researchers selected studies for inclusion and summarised study findings. We present the results narratively given considerable heterogeneity , supplemented by tables and graphics. We plotted effect estimates reported in the included studies without any pooled synthesis . 3 Results Characteristics of included studies The included 14 studies were conducted in the USA n=5 , China n=3, Korea n=1 . We included ten retrospective cohort studies and four prospective cohort studies. Seven studies used non- COVID -19 controls , while seven studies used patients with other respiratory tract infections, mainly influenza. The median length of follow -up was around 12 months with some studies following participants for up to two years. Follow -up time was measured from hospital discharge, in itial symptoms or from positive test for SARS -CoV -2. Number of COVID -19 participants ranged from 1127 to 1 284 437. The participants in most studies were middle -aged, seven studies included populations below 18 and two studies only enrolled children. The s ex distribution was mainly balanced, deviating at most by 11%. Patients were mainly sampled during 2020, three studies continued sampling into 2021, and one study into 2022. Follow ups were performed either at clinics, through online/phone/postal surveys, or by assessing register data. Seven studies included a mix of hospitalised and non -hospitalised COVID -19 patients, seven included only hospitalised patient s. Symptoms compared to non -COVID -19 controls Two studies looked at s elf-reported long -term symptoms in COVID -19 cohorts compared to non - COVID 19 cohorts. A Danish cohort study found that e ighteen symptoms were more common in positive COVID -19 cohorts (mainly non- hospitalis ed) than among negative controls after 6 to 12 months, including dysosmia, dysgeusia, fatigue, and dyspnoea . The risk differences tended to decrease over time. A Chinese longitudinal cohort study found hospitalis ed COVID -19 participants had larger risk of experiencing long -term symptoms at 2 -years follow -up relative to their spouses ( non- COVID -19 controls). COVID -19 participants reported poorer health -related quality of life but also larger improvements over time in numerous symptoms , such as depression, anxiety, and dyspnoea. New onset diseases after COVID -19 compared to non -COVID -19 controls Two British retrospective cohort studies and one Chinese prospective cohort study compared long- term symptoms and new onset diseases in hospitalised COVID -19 survivors and non- COVID -19 controls at 12 months or 315 days . These studies found that COVID -19 survivors had higher risk of neurological and cognitive impairments, including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorders. Moreover, o ne study reported that COVID -19 survivors were more than twice as likely to be re -hospitalised or die during the first year after discharge as compared to the general population . New onset diseases after COVID -19 compared to other respiratory tract infections Eight retrospective cohort studies compared long- term symptoms or new onset diseases after COVID -19 with other RTI s. All studies used registered diagnostic codes to extract information on follow -up. A single study used only diagnostic codes registered for re -admission to hospital. Two of the 55 reported diseases were more than t wice as likely than the comparator, and only five diseases were less than half as likely amo ng patients with COVID -19 patients compared with other RTIs . Neurological conditions were more common after COVID -19 patients than after other RTIs . Information on mental health consequences wa s more heterogeneous and without obvious trend s in terms of difference between groups . Respiratory illnesses appear ed to be 4 slightly less common in COVID -19 patients. Reported cardiovascular diagnostic codes did not show a clear pattern of difference, only two of ten cardiovascular conditions differed : heart failure, and intracerebral and subarachnoid bleeding. Musculoskeletal conditions were less common in two studies for COVID -19 patients. Among the infrequently reported diseases there was more variability. It does not appear like length of follow -up up until 2 years changes the outcomes between COVID -19 and other RTI s. Children O verall, adolescent and children appear less affected than older age groups based on studies of participants from during the first pandemic year. Compared with non -COVID -19 controls, children who had COVID -19 had more prevalent long -lasting symptoms, but most symptoms appeared to gradually resolve over time. After 6 -1 2 months changes to smell and taste, and reduced appetite were more common among covid positive children compared to controls. Data on mental health and functioning were less clear, with a weak tendency towards better health - related quality -of-life scores among children and adolescent s in the COVID -19 group . P redicting factors for long -term symptoms Factors predicting the risk of new onset disease and long- term symptoms following COVID -19 and other RTI are similar . Important factors are prior comorbidities, female sex, and severity of disease . Middle age d people appear weakly correlated with higher risk of long -term symptoms and new onset diseases whereas the youngest age groups including children appear least affected. Discussion Current evidence suggest s that patients who have been hospitali sed or undergone non -invasive ventilation due to severe COVID -19 experience similar long -term consequences as patients who have been exposed to similar treatment due to other RTIs . These findings support the current rehabilitation practise of providing similar care to patients post -COVID as after other severe RTIs. Controlled studies also found that most symptoms reported by COVID -19-patients were also reported in the uninfected general population, albeit to a lesser extent . The symptoms that are m ost specific for COVID -19 seems to be altered smell and taste and neurological diagnoses , although with equally common reporting of dyspnoea and fatigue. M ost reported symptoms and new onset diseases are also seen in the follow -up period of other RTIs . Symptom burden appears to decrease over time, but we do not know if or when these symptoms might disappear. The data also reflect that many of the reported symptoms are prevalent in non -infected populations . Although the evidence base is growing and steadily becomes more trustworthy, some aspects remain uncert ain. Our findings continue to reflect long term symptoms in patients who were infected early in the pandemic . New virus variants causing milder disease will likely reduce the overall risk and burden of long -term symptoms. T herapeutic advancements and vaccination impact outcomes and probably lead to milder courses of disease , contributing to a further reduction in the prevalence and burden of long -term symptoms. Studies on consequences of breakthrough infections, and comparative studies on vaccinated versus non vaccinated populations are already pointing in the directions of fewer long -term symptoms . Persons with asymptomatic COVID -19, or those not tested are not well researched. 5 Conclusion Severe COVID- 19, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care treatment, correlates with more symptoms after six to twelve months. Individuals with COVID -19 appear to experience and get diagnosed with similar conditions as those seen in patients with other severe respiratory tract infections at follow -up, although with some variation and with neurological symptoms standing out as more common after COVID -19. Women have a higher risk for experiencing long- term symptoms than men . Patients who have had mild and moderate COVID- 19 (non -hospitalised) report some symptoms beyond six months after infection more often than uninfected persons. The extent of long -term impact of COVID -19 on the quality of life in the general population remains unclear, as most studies included patients with severe COVID -19. 6 Norsk s ammendrag Bakgrunn laboratorie bekreftet Global research on coronavirus disease ( COVID -19) database 19. september 202 deltakere med covid -19 varierte fra 1 127 til tre studier fortsatt e inn \u00e9 Table of content English Summary 2 Norsk sammendrag 6 Table of content 10 Problem statement 11 Methods 12 Literature search 12 Quality assessment 13 Data extraction 13 Data analysis 13 Peer review 13 Acknowledgements 14 Results 15 Description of studies 15 Quality assessment 17 Symptoms and new onset diseases compared to non -COVID -19 controls 19 New onset diseases after COVID -19 compared to other respiratory tract infections 22 Children followed up for longer than 6 months, studies with control groups 24 Predicting factors for long -term symptoms and new onset disease 26 Discussion 27 Conclusion 30 References 31 Appendix 36 Appendix 1; Search strategy 36 Appendix 2; List of excluded studies 38 Appendix 3; Figure data 39 Appendix 4; Characteristics used for matching controls 44 11 Problem statement COVID -19 has been associated with long -term sym ptoms . Aiming t o offer customi sed treatment, policy makers, health care professionals and patients need access to up -to-date evidence about long- term symptoms after COVID -19. In the 4th version of this rapid review , we search ed evidence aiming to explore: 1. Which proportion of patients experience long -term symptoms after COVID -19? 2. Which symptoms are specific to post COVID -19 condition ? 3. Which factors are associated with long -term symptoms of COVID -19? 4. How does p ost COVID -19 condition differ from long -term effects of other respiratory tract infections? Are there difference s in new onset diseases after COVID- 19? The outbreak team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) has commissioned this rapid review update , with the previous version published 15th February 202 2 (2). 12 Methods Literature search We applied an open search strategy to identify all relevant studies on the prevalence of l ong- term COVID -19 symptoms, demographic and medical risk factors associated with symptoms on follow -up, and studies analysing the impact of long -term symptoms of COVID -19. We defined the inclusion criteria prior to the search . We included studies of participants with confirmed COVID - 19, that report ed on symptoms, quality of life, and predicting factors for long -term symptoms. One researcher (JH) conducted the search on September 19th, 202 2, in the MEDLINE database for studies published in the period 29.10.202 1 -19.09.2022. We expanded this search with a search in the WHO Global research on coronavirus disease ( COVID -19) database on September 19th, 202 five datab ases: EMBASE, EuropePMC, language) , and an OpenAlex s earch ( based on the controlled studies from previous report s) (3, 4) . Combined with the previous reports' search period, we covered the timeframe since 01.01.2020. Inclusion criteria : Population: More than 500 COVID -19 positive participants followed up with non-COVID - 19 controls . Outcome: Any long -term symptoms, consequences associated with COVID -19 (excluding studies only /mainly reporting on laboratory or radiological findings ) Follow- up: Includ ed participants followed up for median/mean six months or longer . Studies reporting cumulative/aggregated follow -up data combined for the acute phase (first 3 months) and beyond were exc luded , unless compared with another acute illness. Study types: C ohort studies (prospective and retrospective ), case -peer -review ed studies , abstracts, letters, studies limited to participants with one main underlying disease The inclusion criteria listed above are more specific compared to the previous version of the review, leading to some publications previously included no longer being relevant for this update. The most important change is that we only included controlled studies. We changed the inclusion criteria because more studies had been published since the third version . 13 Review p rocess One researcher (JH) performed title and abstract screening. Two researchers (JH and JFME ) reviewed the studies in full text , selected studies for inclusion, extracted , and summarised data/results from included studies in tables. A senior researcher in the field provided feedback for the study selection process , methodological approach , and results presentation ( KGB). Quality assessment One reviewer (JH) used the RoB SPEO tool developed by the World Health Organisation and the International Labour Organisation to assess the risk of bias of included studies (5). As we expected to identify many eligible studies, we only assessed what we considered the most relevant of the tool's eight domains: (i) bias of selecting participants into the study. We resolved any uncertainty regarding the risk of bias of a study th rough discussion among review authors. We did not assess t he certainty of the available evidence. Data extraction We extracted i nformation on study country, participants, follow -up period , symptom prevalence and statistics (e.g., odds ratio, rate ratio , haza rd ratio) . We described studies with participants mainly below 18 years of age separately . Data analysis We exported d ata tables of extracted endpoints to Micro soft Excel and PowerPoint for data analysis and visualisation . The choice of visualisation was based on discussion of available datapoints, a graphs ability to convey information, subjective intuit ion, and the expected ease of understanding. We reported the prevalence of long -term symptoms in COVID -19- and non- COVID -19 cohorts at different time points (e.g., 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years) and expressed the risks among cohorts as Risk Ratios (RRs) or Risk Differences (RDs) alongside accompanying confidence intervals (CIs) . Effect sizes were taken directly from the included studies if available , else we calculated th ese based on symptoms prevalence data per cohort . We used Hazard Ratios (HRs) to express the probability of reporting symptoms or diagnostic codes during follow -up (time -to-event data) in the COVID -19 cohorts relative to either non- COVID cohorts or cohorts with other respiratory tract infections at different timepoints . The heterogeneity of included studies prevented us from compiling data quantitively. The included plots are graphical presentation s of extracted endpoints across included studies to convey trends , not equally well reflected in text .

Three authors publis hed more than a single publication (8-14). Included studies Table 1 provides an overview of the 14 included studies , categorised by hospitalisation status. We excluded a ll uncontrolled studies from our previous report , and a list of 40 relevant studies that did not fully match our inclusion criteria (Appendix 2). Table 1. Overview of included studies The included studies were conducted in the USA n=5, China n=3, Denmark n=3, UK/England n=2, and South Korea n=1 . Ten studies were retrospective , and four studies were prospective cohort studies. Seven studies used non- COVID -19 controls with very limited match ing, mainly for age and sex , seven studies used patients with other respiratory tract infections as controls , mainly influenza patients with more limited matching of participants characteristics. The median length of follow -up was around 12 months in most studies with some studies following participants for up to two year s. Follow -up time was measured from hospital discharge, initial symptoms, or from positive test for SARS -CoV -2. The n umber of COVID -19 participants ranged from 1127 to 1 284 437 . The participants in most studies were middle -aged, seven studies included populations below 18 and two stud ies only enrolled children. The sex distribution was balanced in most studies, deviating at most by 11%. All studies used laboratory testing to diagnose COVID -19 (mainly PCR). Patients were mainly sampled during 2020, three studies continued sampling into 202 1, and on e study into 2022 (Figure 2).

Patients diagnosed with pneumonia during a hospitalization lasting >24 hours designed as index hospitali sation . Pneumonia was defined based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD -10-CM) primary diagnosis cod es J12 -J18. The hospital admission with pneumonia diagnosis was used as the index encounter. All events were recorded relative to this hospitali sation . 2. Patients had at least 4 encounters within 2 years prior to their index encounter . 3. Patients had at least 2 encounters >30 days after the index encounter. Narrow selection of patients, probably contributing to the severity of outcomes followed up- 19 Symptoms and new onset diseases compared to non -COVID -19 controls Symptoms compared to non -COVID -19 controls Two studies reported symptom prevalence more than six months after the test date: The Danish retrospective cohort study published by S\u00f8rensen et al. 2022 (152,880 participants ) based on self-reported symptoms six to 12 months after COVID- 19 diagnosis, and one Chinese prospective cohort study (2,254 participants ) published by Huang et al. 2022, which reported data at 6 -, 12- months, and 2 -years follow -up. The Danish study by S\u00f8rensen et al. reported risk differences (RD) for 31 different symptoms six to 12 months after the SARS -CoV -2 test date . The difference was calculated based on a comparison of participants with a positive test confirmed between September 2020 to April 2021 and test -negative controls , who were randomly selected using incidence density sampling on the test date with a ratio of 2:3 between test positives and - negatives (19) . The study used self- reported symptoms collected via web -based questionnaires. The COVID -19 cases were mostly non- hospitalis ed males, younger, and more physically active than those in the non- COVID -19 group. Eighteen of the 31 investigated symptoms were more common in positive COVID -19 cases than among negative controls after 6-12 months , with the largest difference s noted in dysosmia (smell disorders) , dysgeusia (taste disorders), f atigue , and reduced strength in legs /arms ( Figure 3). R isk differences decrease d gradually from six to 12 months for all symptoms, except for dysosmia and dysgeusia for which estimates peaked after nine months. This study also presented participants ' self- reported diagnos es and self -reported health problems, but these were not further reviewed as the symptoms are mor e descriptive . Figure 3. Risk Difference based on self -reported symptoms in COVID -19 cases compared to non- COVID -19 cohort at 6-12 months follow -up (61,002 test -positive and 91,878 test -negative individuals) . Detailed values are listed in Appendix 3. 20 The Chinese study by Huang et al. presented a longitudinal follow -up of health outcome s in hospitalis ed COVID -19 survivors throughout two years after acute infection (6). The patients represent the earliest cases worldwide , discharged between Jan uary and May 2020. COVID -19 survivors were compared to a matched cohort of participants without COVID -19. Health outcomes were measured via either questionnaire s, laboratory tests or imaging. Although the study report ed symptoms prevalence in the COVID- 19 survivors at 6 -, 12-months, and 2 -years follow -up, the authors did not report prevalence data of the matched non -COVID -19 controls for the first two timepoints. Therefore, we only present data from the 2 -years follow -up. Hospital survivors of COVID -19 showed improvements through out the follow -up period. The prevalence of reporting at least one long -term symptom decreased from 68% at 6 months to 55% at 2 years in COVID- 19 survivors, with fatigue (30%) and sleep difficulties (25%) being the most prevalent symptom s. The prevalence of self-reported anxiety or depression in COVID -19 survivors was reduced by 11% ( from 23% at 6 months to 12% at 2 years) at 2 years, regardless of initial disease severity. Fewer patients reported dyspnoea symptoms at 2 years versus at 12 months (14% vs 30%). Despite these i mprovements , COVID -19 survivors reported poorer Health Related Quality of Life than matched controls at 2 years follow -up. All in all, the COVID -19 survivors had larger risks of experiencing long -term symptoms than matched contr ols; the risk ratios varied between >1 and 5 for most of the symptoms (Figure 4). Figure 4.

Detailed values are listed in Appendix 3. 21 New onset diseases after COVID -19 compared to non -COVID -19 controls Two British retrospective cohort studies by Bhas karan et al. a nd Clift et al. (15, 16) and one Chinese prospective cohort stud y by Liu et al. (7) compared new onset diseases after COVID -19 and non- COVID controls . All studies compared diagnostic codes of hospitalised COVID -19 patients to matched cohorts in the general population from pre -pandemic years (15, 16) or uninfected spouses (7). The studies focused on neuropsychiatric illnesses (32 525 COVID -19 cases ) (16) , cognitive changes (1438 COVID- 19 cases )(7), and hospitalisation, death, and diseases by symptom group (24 673 COVID- 19 cases) (15) . Follow -up periods were 315 days (15) and 12 months (7, 16) . Overall, these three studies consistent ly found a higher risk of neurological and cognitive impairments in COVID -19 survivors compared to non -COVID -19 controls. Clift 2022 reported that COVID -19 survivors were between two to three times more likely to report anxiety, dementia, depression, and bipolar d isorder. Similar or even higher risks in COVID -19 survivors for other neurological conditions, such as cognitive impairment, progressive - and early/late onset cognitive declines were reported by Liu 2022 (7) . The study of Bhaskaran et al. found that COVID -19 survivors were more than twice as likely to be re- hospitalised or die more than a week after discharge (15) . The study also reported higher risks of mental health and cognitive impairments, other respiratory infections, circulatory and musculoskeleta l problems, and other symptoms in COVID -19 survivors compared to non -COVID controls. We listed diagnosis by overarching symptom groups in a forest plot presenting Hazard Ratios, Risk Ratios and Odds Ratio s for getting relevant diagnosis (Figure 5). Figure 5.

Detailed values are listed in Appendix 3. 22 New onset diseases after COVID -19 compared to other respiratory tract infections Eight retrospective cohort studies compared the impact of long -term symptoms or new onset diseases after COVID -19 with other respiratory tract infections (RTI) (8, 11 -16, 18) . Other RTI s were influenza in four studies , pneumonia in two studies, and severe acute respiratory infection, or any other RTI by each one study . Four studies looked only at hospitalised patients (13-16), whereas four studies by two authors looked at mixed populations. COVID -19 patients and RTI cohorts were matched to a limited degree, mainly by demographics. The n umber of participants with COVID -19 were 10403 in the smallest study, and 1284437 in the largest. Follow- up was from 182 days to more than 2 years. Study populations were mainly from the USA, England , and South Korea. All studies used registered diagnostic codes to extract information on possible sequ alae, one study used only diagnostic codes registered for re -admission to hospital (15) . We group ed all reported diagnostic codes by overarching symptom groups and listed these in a forest plot presenting Hazard Ratios and Relati ve Risks (Figure 6). Across all 55 reported diagnostic codes, two diagnoses were more than twice as likely among COVID -19 patients as among patients with other RTIs , and five diagnostic codes were less than half as likely. For twenty- one diagnostic codes there was no difference in risks , whereas for 34 diagnostic code s there were differences of mostly a smaller degree , with varying clinical si gnificance . The difference was largest for diagnostic codes for neurological conditions , being more prevalent in COVID -19 patients compared to patients with other RTI s. The data on mental health consequences was more variable without a clear trend of difference. Respiratory sequalae appeared to be slightly less common in COVID -19 patients compared with patients with other RTIs . There was no clear pattern regarding differences in reported cardiovascular diagnostic codes . Among ten cardiovascular diagnostic codes only two differed between the groups; heart failure was more likely , and intracerebral or subar achnoid bleeding was less likely among COVID -19 patients compared with patients with other RTIs . Musculoskeletal diagnostic codes were less common among COVID -19 patients in two studies . Among the diagnostic codes which were infrequently reported, or reported by only one author , there was more variability . Nonetheless seven studies showed differ ences in diagnostic codes , among these , cancer stood out to be slightly less likely among patients with COVID -19. The included studies cannot prove causality, and some illness es have long prodromal periods without clear symptoms which may have been caught earlier or due to more thorough follow -up. Four studies looked at the time from COVID -19 diagnosis to a ny new diagnosis , or risk horizon finding that incidence of new diagnosis decreased over time (8, 13, 15, 18) . Longer follow -up time in COVID -19 patients did not appear to greatly increase or reduce the relative risk of outcomes compared with other RTI s. E ight controlled studies compared the impact of long -term symptoms or new onset disease after COVID -19 with other RTIs . Overall, it appears that risks are quite similar , except for neurological symptoms that seem to be possibl y more associated with COVID -19. The largest spread and uncertainty are seen across new onset of mental health disorders. 23 Figure 6 - Overview of disease groups based on registered diagnostic codes after COVID -19 compared to other RTI on a logarithmic scale . RR/HR>1 indicates COVID -19 worse than Bhaskaran, Qureshi reflect patients . non- hospitalised patients. Follow -up time: Qureshi and Lee present ca. 6 months, Clift and Bhaskaran ca 12 months , Taquet ca. 2 years. All studies had more than 10 000 participants. Sex distribution was mainly balanced. Detailed values are listed in Appendix 3. 24 Children followed up for longer than 6 months , studies with control groups Seven studies, by four authors , included a population younger than 18 years , two studies exclusively studi ed children. Two authors report ed on data from Danish children, one author used an international database, and one study used Korean registry data. Participants were mainly infected during 2020 and early 2021, representing earlier variants of the virus. Kikkenborg Berg et al. conducted a Danish nationwide cross -sectional study and published in two papers (9, 10) , including children with COVID -19 (cases) and matched cont rols from national registers. A survey was sent to participants or mothers, and a control group matched by age and sex (1:4) . The survey included the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and the Children's Somatic Symptoms Inventory -24 (CSSI -24) to capture current overall health and wellbeing, and ancillary questions about a selection of 23 common post COVID -19 symptoms. One publication analysed data on children 0 -14 year s old with 10 997 cases and 33 016 controls (10) . Compared with controls, children who had COVID -19 had more prevalent long -lasting symptoms. There was a tendency towards better quality -of-life scores related to emotional and social functioning in cases than in controls in older children. The second publication analysed 24 315 adolescents, 15 -18 years old, with COVID -19 and 97 257 controls (9). Participants in the case group had greater odds of having at least one long COVID- 19 symptom lasting at least 2 months as well as lower symptom scores (i.e. , less somatic distress) on the CSSI -24 and better quality of life scores on the PedsQL compared to controls. Participants with COVID -19 had more long- lasting symptoms and sick leave, whereas participants in the control group had more short - lasting symptoms and marginally lower quality of life. The study size, including all SARS -CoV -2 PCR test results for the total Danish population is a strength, yet low response rates , non - response bias, and recall bias and not sufficient matching with controls limit the generalisability of findings. Lee et al. conducted a retrospective cohort study in South Korea (18). The authors used claims data to determine the number and types of complications from COVID -19 that patients experienced , and which participants that we re more vulnerable to those complications compared with peers with influenza. Looking at factors associated with incidence of comp lications for both illnesses the study found that younger pa rticipants (0-19) had lower odds compared to older patients (20-44); younger age was more strongly associated with less complications for covid patients than for influenza patients. S\u00f8r ensen et al. conducted a nationwide survey of post -acute symptoms (19) . The authors stratified their findings by sex and age group s (15-19-year -olds) . In their supplementary files they published the RD of symptoms after 6 -1 2 months , and self-r eported health problems between the test date and until 6 -1 2 months , in COVID -19 compared with test- negative participants . Risk differences of 21 different reported symptoms after 6 - 12 months showed a greater risk for dysosmia, dysgeusia , reduced appetite and strength in arms/legs among COVID - 19 positive children compared to controls. COVID -19 adole scent girls experienced more dyspnoea , chest pain, dizziness, fatigue, headache and sleeping legs/arms than negative controls and boys with COVID -19. COVID -19 adolescent boys experienced less cough, runny eyes and nose, and sore throats than girls with COVID -19 and non- COVID -19 controls . There was no risk difference between participant groups for seven other symptoms (abdominal pain, chi lls, 25 diarrhoea, fever, hot flushes, muscle/joint pain, and nausea) . Self-reported health problems and self-reported received diagnoses are not included here as the symptom spectrum is more descriptive . Taquet et al. analysed post -COVID -19 neurological and psychiatric new onset disease trajectories registered in TriNetX electronic health records network (8). New onset disease trajectories differed for the included 185 748 COVID -19 children compared with COVID -19 adults: in the 6 months after COVID -19, children were not at an increased risk of mood or anxiety disorders but for psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or seizures. Children with COVID_19 compared with children with other RTI s had an increased risk for encephalitis , cognitive deficit, insomnia, intracranial haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders . Cognitive deficit in children had a finite risk horizon (75 days) and a finite time to equal incidence (491 days) unlike in adults . Overall, adolescent and children appear less affected than older age groups based on studies of participants from during the first pandemic year . Compared with non -COVID -19 controls, children who had COVID -19 infection had more prevalent long -lasting symptoms. Most symptoms appear ed to gradually resolve over time. After 6-12 months changes to smell and taste , and reduced appetite we re more common among covid pos itive children compared with controls. Data on mental health and functioning were less clear . 26 Predicting factors for long -term symptoms and new onset disease Whereas most studies predominantly compared diagnos es and symptoms, five authors analysed factors correlating initially registered information and outcomes. For most studies this was not the primary objective, nonetheless some authors collected and analysed data to provide insights into factors correlated with possible sequalae or long- term sy mptoms, using variable statistics: adjusted o dds ratio, o dds ratio, hazard ratio, relative risk/risk ratio and risk difference (7, 8, 18, 19). Comparing potential relevance of predicting factors between COVID -19 and other RTI s there is visible congruence (18) . Prior comorbidities, female sex , severity of COVID -19 seem to be correlated with risk of long -term symptoms or a new onset disease (7, 18, 19) . Severity of COVID -19 was strongly correlated with l ong-term symptoms in most studies. Regarding age and risk, middle a ge appears weakly correlated with symptoms , youngest age groups including children a ppear ed least affected (8, 18, 19). One study looked at virus variant as determi nant for neurological and psychiatric outcomes, the data suggest ed that the Alpha variant was the least conseq uential, Delta the most and Omicron in the middle (8). 27 Discussion We included 14 studies following up participants with COVID -19 and non -COVID -19 controls for six months or longer in th is fourth version of our rapid revie w. The previous report published February 2022 included 20 studies: 11 studies without control groups, and nine studies with controls (2). Four studies, of which three were updated since our previous report matched the updated inclusion criteria, and ten new studies were added. We excluded unc ontrolled studies in this update . Other recently published systematic reviews have conducted their searches earlier in the first part of 2022, with mainly few or no controlled stu dies (20-24). The anticipated increase in number of controlled studies led us to applying more stringent inclusion criteria, requiring 500 or more participants, compared to 100 or more in the previous report. There remains a dis balance between non-hospitalised and hospitalised patients with mainly hospitalised patients capture d in studies . Some studies with mixed populations also provide insight into l ong-term symptoms and new onset diseases among n on-hospitalise d patients . This update provides new insights and strengthens our earlier findings. The focus on controlled studies reveals that most reported symptoms we re also seen in the follow -up period of other RTIs. The comparison of COVID -19 with other RTI s revealed that many symptoms or new onset diseases after COVID -19 were also commonly reported in non- COVID respiratory tract infected populations. The comparison with non- COVID -19 controls revealed a greater difference in reported symptoms , especially for altered sense of smell and taste , dyspnoea, and fatigue. The risk of a new diagnosis appeared not to be higher among COVID -19 patients compared with patients with other RTI s, with higher or lower risks only among a few of the reported diagnostic codes . This suggests that the severity of the acute disease may be more relevant than the pathogen. Altered smell and taste and increased risk of a neurological diagnosis seem to be most specific ally related to COVID -19. Studies reporting symptoms both at six months , twelve months and two years follow -up indicated a decrease in prevalence of symptoms over time . Th e previous version included only one study of the paediatric population, while this report included seven studies, by four authors. T his provides a clearer picture of how a COVID -19 infection may affect children and adolescents. Compared with adults, children appear overall less affected. Compared with controls, children who had a SARS -CoV -2 infection had more prevalent long- lasting symptoms. Most symptoms tend ed to gradually resolve over time. After 6 - 1 2 months altered smell and taste, and reduced appetite we re more common symp toms among COVID -19 positive children compared with COVID negative controls. Data on mental health and functioning were less clear. These findings are generally c onsistent with other systematic reviews in the field, but the research on children is still limited, heterogeneous, and based on low- quality studies (23, 24) . With more relevant studies being published continuously , as with a 28 study consistent with our findings was just prior to publication of this report (25) , we can expect more robust findings with time. Basi c statistical analysis within the studies elucidate d risk factors for long -term symptoms and new onset diseases . Hospitalisation, severity of COVID- 19, co -morbidities and female sex are factors correlated with increased risk of long -term symptoms. The youngest populations including children appear to be less affected, while middle aged populations seem to be most affected. As to be expected, the estimates on rarer symptoms and diagnos es are less precise given small sample sizes. Even though the evidence base has improved with the publication of larger controlled studies, our findings still reflect persons with COVID -19 from the beginning of the pandemic, mainly 2020 and early 2021. As follow -up time was often reported in aggregate form, we only included studies with a mean or median follow -up time of at least six months for 500 participants , with many studies reporting on up to 12 months and until two years. Our updated and narrowed inclusion criteria led to including only controlled studies, which are more complex to set up and may discriminate against settings in which these types of studies are less common. Many studies have narrow selection criteria and mainly included hospitalise d patients with registry data available. Our quality assessment revealed a continued common presence of selection bias of participants, although limiting us to controlled study designs strengthens our findings. By not exclud ing studies base d on our quality assessment, it may be that studies with serious limitations or with publicly expressed concerns remained included , as the case for one included study (26). Our criteria may reflect patients who were more seriously affected and those more often in contact with the healthcare system. Studies mainly used diagnostic codes which may be more objective, but do not capture prevalence nor severity of symptoms (27) . The included registry studies aggregated symptoms to time periods, blurring the distinction between symptoms at a specific time point or over a period. The aggregated data presentation for studies with non- COVID non-RTI controls led us to exclude studies reporting cumulative/ aggregated data combining acute and chronic phase ( before and after 3 months) in case of non -COVID controls. For controls with other RTIs we decided to include aggregated data from discharge , as differentiation of the acute and chronic phase s was more comp arable among patients ill with any respiratory tract infection than non- COVID controls without an acute illness at the start of follow -up. Matching between controls and comparators was in many cases limited to demographic characteristics or not performed. O ur methodological choices might have an impact on the type of patients investigated. By excluding pre -prints and limiting us to peer - reviewed publications we also limit ed the number of identified studies, but this might contribute to greater reliability of our findings. No Norwegian studies met the selection criteria of this update, which might limit the generalizability of our findings to the local context . Similarly, we still need more information regarding asymptomatic and mildly affected patients, which would be most applicable to most of those who have been infected with COVID- 19 in Norway. Our findings represent an overview of the largest controlled studies, as part o f a growing body of evidence, yet the heterogeneity in the available studies continues to prevent quantitative synthesis of findings , any pooled meta -analysis might lead to misleading inferences/conclusions. It is well -known that many patients who are adm itted to intensive care units after invasive medical treatment experience post -intensive care syndrome (PICS). PICS shares many similarities with long -term COVID -19 symptoms. In line with some studies on long -term effects 29 of COVID -19, typical risk factor for PICS are older age, female sex and disease severity (28) . The findings of this review indicate that the health consequences are quite similar for critically ill COVID -19 patients treated with invasive m echanical ventilation and other patients who have undergone similarly severe non- COVID illnesses with intensive care . These findings support the current rehabilitation practise of providing similar care to patients with PICS after COVID as after other severe RTIs. The increased risk for women to suffer from long -term symptoms is an interesting finding . Men have a higher risk than women of becoming more severely ill in the acute phase of COVID -19 (29) . The controlled studies included in this rapid review confirmed finding s from previous rapid reviews that p atients who have been admitted to the hospital or intensive care unit with COVID -19 seem ed to be at greatest risk for developing long -term symptoms. Controlled studies also found that most symptoms reported by COVID -19-patients were also reported in the uninfected general population, albeit to a lesser extent. P andemic related infringements on personal liberty, lockdowns , social isolation, and changes to pre - pandemic lifestyle might therefor e explain the reporting of some symptoms. T hese measures were not limit ed to COVID -19 patient s only but appl ied to the whole population. Although the evidence base is growing and steadily becom es more trustworthy, s ome aspects remain uncertain . Symptom burden appear s to decrease over time, but we do not know if or when these symptoms might disappear. Our findings continue to reflect experiences for patients from the early phase of the pandemic . Newer virus variants (omicron), vaccination and therapeutic advancements , seem to lead to milder disease and potentially a lower prevalence of long -term symptoms (30) . Studies on c onsequences of breakthrough infections, and comparative studies on vaccinated versus non vaccinated populations is beginning to appear . These will with time provide valuable insights into populations not addressed in this report (31- 33). New virus variants causing milder disease are also expected to reduce the risk of long -term symptoms. Only one included study analysed patients with the Omicron variant indicating slightly milder consequences, further research into this is required. Persons with a symptomatic COVID -19, or those not t ested are not well researched . Although the research landscape is rapid ly develop ing, the marginal scientific value of new updates is decreasing. We need resear ch on post -COVID -19 condition by vaccination status, virus variant , and low COVID -19 clinical sever ity to provide up to date knowledge to clinician s and policymakers. 30 Conclusion Severe COVID- 19, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care treatment, correlates with more symptoms after six to twelve month s. Individuals with COVID -19 appear to experience and get diagnosed with similar conditions as those seen in patients with other severe respiratory tract infections at follow -up, although with some variatio n and with neurological symptoms standing out as more common after COVID -19. Women have a higher risk for experiencing long- term symptoms than men . Patient s who have had mild and moderate COVID -19 (non- hospitalised) report some symptoms beyond six months after infection more often than uninfected persons . The extent of long -term impact of COVID -19 on the quality of life in the general population remains unclear, as most studies included patients with severe COVID -19. 31 References 1.
