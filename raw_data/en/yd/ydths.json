Design and methods: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted from May to July 2021 with parents of children with autism spectrum disorder ( N= 322) who were members of an integrated healthcare system in Southern California. Results: Approximately 35% of parents intended to vaccinate their child against COVID-19.

Conclusions: Though parents usually trust recommendations from pediatric healthcare providers to make decisions about their child's health, these ndings suggest that relying on trusted relationships alone may not be suf cient when discussing COVID-19 vaccines and that ad ditional education to bolster vaccine con dence may be needed. Practice implications: Pediatric healthcare providers should reinforce the bene ts of vaccines for parents who are un- decided about COVID-19 vaccines for their children and provide education and evidence-based recommendations to parents who hold erroneous va ccine beliefs about risks, bene ts, and current evidence, especially those related to autism. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.

There are no vaccines currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children under 12 years of age (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021 ). However, there are ongoing clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccines with younger children that are expected to be approved in the future, and in anticipation of such approval, it is important for pediatric clinicians to consider parent COVID-19 vaccine con dence and hesitancy. Approximately 29% of parents in the United States (US) have indicated that they intend to have their child under age 12 years vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vac- cine is approved and recommended for this age group, a relatively low percentage of parents that may indicate a need for vaccine promotion interventions by pediatric healthcare providers ( Hamel et al., 2021 ).This need is especially critical for vaccine-hesitant parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (autism). There is a persistent, erroneous belief in the US that vaccines cause autism, a belief associated with higherlevels of vaccine hesitancy ( Goin-Kochel et al., 2020 ;Zerbo et al., 2018 ). Par- ents who have a child with autism are less likely to vaccinate subsequent children ( Zerbo et al., 2018 ). Evidence suggests that children with intellec- tual and developmental disabilities are at higher risk for COVID-19 mortal- ity than their neurotypical counterparts ( Turk et al., 2020 ), and as such, it is important to monitor parent COVID-19 vaccine intentions among children with autism spectrum disorder and anticipate a need for interventions. The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between parent vac- cine con dence and intention to have their child with autism vaccinated against COVID-19, if authorized and recommended for this group. Method Design A web-based survey was administered to parents of children with autism from May to July 2021.

Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Journal of Pediatric Nursing journal homepage: www.pediatricnursing.orgwe randomly selected 2000 parents who had a child with a diagnosis of autism from an integrated health system in Southern California. Parents were eligible to participate in the survey if they had at least one child with a current diagnosis of autism and at least one autism-related ser- vice referral in 2020. A total of 1624 parents were eligible and initially contacted with a letter and email; then followed up with phone, text, or email reminders twice following the baseline contact attempt. Allparents provided informed consent to participate in the study, and par- ents who had more than one child with autism had the option to com- plete the survey for each child. Parents were offered a $30 check as an incentive for the time required to complete the survey. Variables The primary outcome variable was parent intention to vaccinate their child with autism with a COVID-19 vaccine if authorized in the fu- ture (Yes versus maybe/no). The primary exposure variables were (1) three continuous items from the Vaccination Con dence Scale (0-strongly disagree to 10-strongly agree subscales): (1a) belief vaccine bene ts, (1b) belief in vaccine harms, (1c) trust in healthcare providers) ( Gilkey et al., 2014 ); and (2) whether the parent had re- ceived a COVID-19 vaccine. Analysis Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample on demo- graphic characteristics We used chi-square tests to compare survey responders versus non-responders on demographic characteristics (child age, gender, race/ethnicity, insurance type). Multiple logistic re- gression models were used to examine associations between exposures and the outcome, adjusted for the demographic and COVID-19-related covariates that might affect the relationship between the exposures and outcome. These covariates were child age (2 -4 years, 5 -7 years, 8-12 years, 13 -17 years), gender (boy, girl, other), race/ethnicity (White, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian, Other), whether the child had siblings with autism (yes/no), parent marital sta- tus (married/partnered, unpartnered), parent employment (employed full/part-time, other), and parent and child history of testing positive for COVID-19 (yes/no). Results The sample was 322 parent-child dyads (20% response rate, Table 1 ). Parents who responded to the survey versus those who did not were comparable on demographic characteristics, except in regards to child gender. There were no signi cant differences between responders and non-responders on child age, child race/ethnicity, or insurance type. The only signi cant difference was child gender, where boys were slightly over-represented among survey responders (84.5% boys among responders versus 75.8% boys among non-responders, P= 0.01). Fifteen percent of parents ( N= 49) and 6% of children ( N= 20) children with autism had tested positive for COVID-19 in the past. Forty-nine percent of parents ( N= 159) reported having received a COVID-19 vaccine, and 35% ( N= 114) indicated that they intended to have their child with autism vaccinated if a vaccine were approved and recommended for children under age 12 years. Overall vaccine con- dence scores were comparable to national averages, except that par- ents in the study sample reported higher levels of belief in vaccine harm than national averages. In the sample, vaccine con dence scores were as follows: belief in vaccine bene ts M = 8.8/SD 1.7; in vac- cine harm M = 5.6/SD = 2.8; and trust in healthcare providers M = 8.6/ SD = 1.8. For comparison, national average scores on the same vaccine condence items were as follows: belief in vaccine bene ts M = 8.5; be- lief in vaccine harm M = 3.3; and trust in healthcare providers M = 9.0 (Gilkey et al., 2014 )[Table 1 ].In adjusted models, stronger belief in vaccine bene ts was associ- ated with higher odds of COVID-19 vaccine intention for a child with au- tism (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.21 -2.15). Trust in healthcare providers, belief in vaccine harm, and parent vaccination status were not associ- ated with vaccine intentions [ Table 2 ]. Discussion This survey conducted in summer 2021 found that approximately one-third of parents of children with autism intend to vaccinate their child against COVID-19 if a vaccine is approved and recommended for children under age 12. Parent positive vaccine beliefs were associated with parent intention to vaccinate their child with autism against COVID-19, while trust in healthcare providers, belief in vaccine harm, and parent vaccination status were not. Though parents usually trust recommendations from pediatric healthcare providers to make deci- sions about their child's health, these ndings suggest that relying on trusted relationships alone may not be suf cient when discussing COVID-19 vaccines and that additional education to bolster vaccine con- dence may be needed ( Glanz et al., 2013 ). In pediatric practice, providers should reinforce the bene ts of vac- cines for parents who are undecided and provide education and evidence-based recommendations to parents who hold erroneous vac- cine beliefs about risks, bene ts, and current evidence, especially those related to autism. Such strategies targeting vaccine beliefs may improve the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination among children withTable 1 Sample description.

In research, future studies should explore vaccine- promoting interventions speci c to parents of children with autism, where mistrust in vaccines and belief in vaccine harm may be elevated. Our study identi ed positive vaccine beliefs as the most important vac- cine con dence factor associated with intention to vaccinate a child with autism against COVID-19, and as such, this domain of vaccine con-dence may be a fruitful target for intervention research. There are strengths and limitations to this study. We surveyed a di- verse, representative sample of parents of children with autism in Southern California. Vaccination rates reported by parents in our sample are comparable to national averages, and our response rate was adequate for statistical tests. Our exploration of multiple domains of vaccine con dence provides potential targets for educational interven- tions. Limitations of the study were the self-report nature of parent vaccination and vaccine intentions, which may be subject to social desirability bias. There was limited representation of certain racial/ ethnic groups (e.g., Native American Indian/Alaskan families) and under-representation of girls with autism, although this response pat- tern was expected given that autism is more prevalent among boys than girls ( Maenner et al., 2020 ). Pediatric healthcare providers have a responsibility to provide evidence-based COVID-19 vaccine education to parents; this includes educating parents on the elevated risk of COVID-19-related harm to children with developmental disabilities and the potential for approved vaccines to prevent such outcomes. By taking an active role in assessing parent vaccine beliefs, addressing their concerns, and making a recom- mendation for vaccination in light of available evidence, pediatric pro- viders can promote child population health and reduce the harm of COVID-19 for children with autism spectrum disorder.
