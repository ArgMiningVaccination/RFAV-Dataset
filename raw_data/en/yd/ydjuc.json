Community members may share a common ethnic heritage, cultural mores, language, religion, occupation, or geographic region. These vital and constantly reinvigorated artistic traditions are shaped by values and standards of excellence that are passed from generation to generation, most often within family and community, through demonstration, conversation, and practice. Genres of artistic activity include, but are not limited to, music, dance, crafts, and oral expression. Applications for Grants for Arts Projects in the Folk & Traditional Arts will be accepted at two deadlines. All project types (described below) are accepted at both deadlines. Generally, an organization is limited to one application per year in the Grants for Arts Projects category. Applicants may request cost share/matching grants ranging from $10,000 to $100,000. Applicants are encouraged to contact Folk & Traditional Arts Division Specialist, Jennie Terman, with questions: [termanj@arts.gov](mailto:termanj@arts.gov). The NEA is committed to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, and fostering mutual respect for the diverse beliefs and values of all individuals and groups.
