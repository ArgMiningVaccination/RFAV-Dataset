All the lessons are examples only. There is norequirement to use them. If you decide to use the lessons, you will need to prepareoverhead projector transparencies (OHTs) and occasional resource sheets for pupilsto use. The lessons consolidate work at level 3 and extend into level 4. They are suitable for a group of pupils or a whole class. Whatever the size of the group, the pupils arereferred to as 'the class'. Each lesson will support about 30 to 40 minutes of direct teaching. To help match the time to your timetable, each plan refers to 'other tasks' for pupils, based onSpringboard 7 resources. Select from these, textbook exercises or your own materials to provide practice and consolidation in the main part of a lesson and toset homework. Aim to choose tasks that vary in their level of demand, to suit pupils'knowledge, confidence and rate of progress. Although the 'other tasks' are listed for convenience at the end of the main part of the lesson, they can be offered at any point, especially between the 'episodes' thatform the main activity. The lesson starters are of two kinds: practice starters and teaching starters. The former are opportunities to rehearse skills that will be needed later in the lesson.Teaching starters introduce an idea that is then developed in the main activity. You will need to tell pupils what they will learn in the lesson, either in the starter or at the beginning of the main activity. Use the plenary to check pupils' learning againstthe lesson's objectives and to draw attention to the key points that pupils shouldremember. Level 3 to level 4 lessons Algebra 42 \u00a9 Crown copyright 2003Rules and formulae Add several small numbers. Use letter symbols to represent unknown numbers or variables. Substitute positive integers into simple linear expressions and formulae. Use simple formulae. Ask a few questions such as: Q Subtract 8 from 12. Q What is the difference between 16 and 9?Q Add 6 to 8. If necessary, remind pupils how they can bridge through 10. Demonstrate how knowing that 8 + 6 = 14 leads to: 18 + 6 = 24 28 + 6 = 3438 + 6 = 44, and so on. Ask pupils to work in small groups. Give three dice to each group. They will alsoneed pencil and paper to keep their scores. Tell pupils the rules of the game. In turn,each player rolls all three dice. Only fours, fives and sixes count. If you throw onlyones, twos or threes, you miss that turn. The player finds the sum of the eligiblenumbers and adds this to their total score. The first player to reach a target numbersuch as 50 or 100 wins the game. Encourage pupils to add the numbers mentally. After the game, ask the whole class a few more questions, such as: Q Why is it impossible to score 11? (the minimum score is 12) Q How could you score 16? (4, 6, 6 or 5, 5, 6) Q What scores are possible after one throw? (any number from 12 to 18) Show OHT A4.1a . Explain that several families are going on a picnic together. The OHT shows some of the rules or formulae that they use when they are preparing for the picnic. Ask the class: Q How many bottles of water are needed for a picnic for 30 people? (30) Q 20 bottles of water were packed for the picnic. How many people were going? (20) Q How many pizzas are needed for 12 people going on a picnic? (3) For 20 people? (5) Q How many paper plates are needed for 9 people? (13)For 30 people? (34) Q How many cheese rolls are needed for 7 people?

How many people were expected to go? (15) Continue asking similar questions based on the information on the OHT. Encourage pupils to suggest and apply one or two more rules for the picnic, for example, for thenumber of drinking straws and the number of cans of cola. Explain that some rules can be written in a shorthand way. Demonstrate by writing on the board: Ask: Q How many forks are needed for 7 people? (14) Q If 18 forks were taken to the picnic, how many people went along? (9) Show OHT A4.1b . Ask: Q How many bananas are needed for 30 people going on a picnic? (26) Q All 16 bananas were eaten at a picnic. How many people went? (20) Q How many rugs are needed for 12 people on a picnic? (3) Q 5 rugs were taken to a picnic. How many people went? (20) Q How many biscuits are needed for 8 people for a picnic? (48) Q 60 biscuits were packed for a picnic. How many people went? (10) Q 12 hard-boiled eggs were packed for a picnic. How many people went? (14) Explain that rules can be written in an even shorter way. Write a rule on the board: Say that we can make this even shorter. We can write pto stand for the number of people and ato stand for the number of apples . So the formula for working out the number of apples becomes: a=p+ 4 Give another example. We can write pto stand for the number of people and sto stand for the number of spoons . So the formula for working out the number of spoons becomes: s= p 2 or even shorter s= 2p Show OHT A4.1c , and work through the questions. Level 3 to level 4 lessons Algebra 44 \u00a9 Crown copyright 2003Take two forks for every person.number of forks = number of people x 2 number of apples = number of people + 4 number of spoons = number of people x 2Write on the board a formula such as n= m+ 10. Tell pupils that the value of mis 5, and show them how to work out the value of m + 10. Q What is the value of nif mequals 50? What if mequals 0? Repeat with a formula such as a= 2b+ 1. Tell pupils that the value of bis 8, and show them how to work out the value of 2b+ 1. Remind them that 2 b= 2 b. Q What is the value of aif bequals 10? What if bequals 0? Using a computer with a data projector, show a simple prepared spreadsheet with hidden formulae in cells B4 and B5, such as the one below. Set the size of the fontto 28 pt or larger so that the whole class can see the text. Ask pupils to suggest the number of people going on the picnic, and enter this into cell B2. Tell them to watch what happens to the numbers in cells B4 and B5. Eachtime that you enter a new number for the number of people, ask pupils: Q What do you think the formula is for the number of samosas? Why do you think so? Q And the formula for the numbers of tomatoes? There are no relevant exercises on using formulae and substitution in the Springboard 7 folder. Choose suitable tasks or activities from textbooks or other resources, or devise your own. For practice in adding several small numbers use: Unit 10 section 1: Mental calculations 1 Adding numbers in your head page 3272 Adding multiples of 10 or 100 page 327 Show OHTs A4.1d, A4.1e and A4.1f and work through the questions with the class. Explain how pupils should 'show their working'. \u00a9 Crown copyright 2003 Level 3 to level 4 lessons Algebra 45 other tasks Springboard 7 Unit 10 plenary ResourcesOHTs A4.1d, A4.1e, A4.1f Algebra uses letters and numbers to replace words and numbers. A rule written out in algebra is called a formula.5ymeans 5 times y. The number is always written first, so we never write y5. Numbers can be substituted in a formula to work out the value of something that you want to know. RememberSolving simple equations Use letter symbols to represent unknown numbers or variables. Solve simple linear equations with integer coefficients (unknown on one side only) using an appropriate method. Solve problems and investigate in number and algebra. Show OHT A4.2a , a set of menu problems. Explain to the class that they are to work out the cost of the menu options with no price shown. Q How can we work out the cost of milk? (find the difference between the costs of pasta, salad and milk and pasta and salad) Q How can we find the cost of a salad? (subtract the cost of pasta from the cost of pasta and salad) Ask pupils to work in pairs to find the costs of the last two options on the first menu.Q How shall we start to solve the second problem?Discuss pupils' suggestions, then ask them to work in pairs to solve the problem. Invite one or two pairs to explain their solutions to the rest of the class. Repeat with the third problem. Write on the board 8 and 3 + 5. Tell the class that the two numbers that you have written are the same. Now write 4 + and 9. Explain that this time a number is missing, and that there is a box symbol in its place. To make the pair of numbers 4 + and 9 the same, youneed to put 5 in place of the box, like this: 4 + 5 and 9. Write a few more examples on the board, one by one. For example: 6 + and 11 15 and 10 + 4 and 12 10 and \u00f7 2 - 3 and 1 11 - and 9 Ask pupils to use their whiteboards. Ask:Q What number should replace the box to make this pair of numbers the same? Say that a letter is often used instead of a box. To show that a pair of numbers is the same, the equals sign is used. So to show that 4 + and 9 are the same, we write: 4 + n= 9 Say that this is called an equation . In this equation, putting 5 instead of nmakes the equation true. So the solution to the equation is n= 5. Check by substituting 5 back into the original equation.

For example: n+ 7 = 12 a- 3 = 20 100 - x= 80 Ask pupils to use their whiteboards and to write the solution to each equation in the form n= 5. Remind the class that, when a letter is used for a number, the multiplication sign isoften left out, so that 2 bmeans the same as 2 b. Ask pupils to use their whiteboards to write the solutions to these equations: 3p= 12 2 a= 8 4 x= 4 Say that equations can be solved using function machines. Write on the board: Give pupils a few examples of equations to solve using inverse function machines. Tell the class that another way to solve equations is by trial and improvement. Using a computer with a data projector, show a simple prepared spreadsheet, such as theone below. Set the size of the font to 28 pt or larger so that the whole class can seethe text. For example, to solve the equation 3 n+ 5 = 17, enter the formula 3*B2 + 5 in cell B4. Ask pupils to suggest values for n, and enter these into cell B2. Tell the class to observe what happens in cell B4, and whether the result is too big or too small. Use the feedback to refine suggestions and home in on the correct solution n= 4.

Show OHT A4.2b and discuss the first problem: 400 + 300 = 600 + Q What must we do to 400 to make 600? (add 200) Explain that the left-hand side of the equation, 400 + 300, can be written as: (400 + 200) + (300 - 200) = 600 + 100 Establish that 200 has been added in one place and then subtracted in anotherplace. The overall value of the left-hand side of the equation remains unchanged. Bycomparing the result with the right-hand side of the original equation we can see thatthe number that the box represents is 100. Work through the second problem: 14 + 6 = 4 + . Q What must we do to 14 to make 4? (subtract 10) Show that the left-hand side of the equation can be written as: (14 - 10) + (6 + 10) = 4 + 16 In this case, the box represents the number 16.Ask pupils to work in pairs to solve the remaining equations. After a few minutes, draw the class together and give the answers. Choose two or three of the equationsand select a pair of pupils to explain their solutions to the class.
