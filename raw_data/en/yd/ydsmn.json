Goals of the Pediatric COVID Vaccine Playbook 1. Promote partnerships with parents so they have access to the information they need to guide and feel confident in their decision to vaccinate. 2. Identify ways to ensure all eligible Alaskans have access to COVID -19 vaccines. 3. Provide community planning teams and providers with the information, resources, and data needed to support these efforts. Background Since January of 2020, partners from local, state, tribal, and federal organizations have come together to address the challenges presented by the COVID -19 pandemic. As of November 2021, community transmission is high, hospitals are stretched past capacity , and the state has instituted crisis standards of care. As of November 2, 2021 , there have been 708 Alaskan resident deaths due to COVID reported on the State's dashboard, and an unknown number of individuals sufferin g from long COVID. While the percenta ge of children needing hospitalization is much l ower than adults, the risks are not n egligible . As of October 27, 2021, the State of Alaska Section of Epidemiology has reported 43 hospitalized children (31 of the hospitalizations were in children < 12 year s of age, three were newborns < 1 month of age, and five children needed ICU care) and 16 cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). An e xcerpt from State of Alaska Section of Epidemiology COVID -19 Update (August 2021) outlines these MIS -C cases : \"Thirteen children hospitalized with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS -C) have been reported to the Alaska Section of Epidemiology since the beginning of the pandemic. MIS -C is defined by fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization with multisystem organ involvement. The definition requir es that the patie nt is <21 years of age with current or recent SARS -CoV-2 infection or exposure to a suspected or confirmed COVID -19 case within the 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms and no alternative plausible diagnoses... Seven of the 13 children were female. Eight w ere aged 0 -4 years at the time of admission, three were aged 5 -10 years, and two were aged 11 -20 years. Three children had a pre -existing condition. All children were admitted to the hospital, and eight were admitted to an intensive care unit. None of the children have died.\" Nationally, more than 140,000 children have lost a caregiver due to COVID -19 and as of October 17th, 2021, there have been 146 deaths in children aged 5 -11 years , with children of some groups being d isproportionately affected . An article in Pediatrics (Hillis, et al., 2021), looked at caregiver death from April 2020 through June of 2021 , of children less than 18 years of age , and found racial and ethnic disparities. American Indian/ Alaska Native children were 4.5 times more likely to lose a parent or grandparent caregiver, Black children were 2.4 times more likely, and Hispanic children were 1.8 times than White children . Of children 5-11 in the United States that have died, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, Black Non -Hispanic, Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander and of those who identify with multiple racial groups dispropor tionately have died . Data subsets can be found here . Alaska Department of Health and Social Services | Division of Public Health Pediatric COVID Vaccine Playbook 2 | P a g e November 5, 2021 MIS-C continues to be a concerning and dangerous adverse event associated with COVID -19 infection. The FDA states that as of October 4, 2021: 5,217 MIS -C cases have been reported . 39% of MIS -C cases occurred in children aged 6 -11. 61% of MIS -C cases occurred in children who identify as Hispanic/Latino or Black, Non -Hispanic. COVID -19 has affected Alaskans of all ages both through illness and disruptions to their daily lives. However, vaccination ag ainst COVID -19 is a strong mitigation tool that provides protection against severe illness, helps Alaskans engage in the activities they enjoy, and keeps children in school. The Alaska Sleeves up for School Data D ashboard reports vaccination information by borough census areas and will be updated to reflect the 5+ age group soon. Logistical Considerations Vaccine Codes Product Description: Tris-sucrose formula, 10 mcg/0.2 mL for ages 5 y ears to < 12 y ears CVX Code: 218 CVX Long Description: information can be found on the CDC's COVID -19 Vaccine Related Codes webpage . COVID -19 Order Threshold CDC enacted a state -wide order threshold for COVID -19 vaccines to ensure that inventory that is currently in the field is utilized first . The threshold amounts consider administration data and current inventories throughout Alaska . Until VacTrAK inventories are more up to date and administered doses are reported to VacTrAK, the threshold is limiting the Pfizer orders we can process . Ensure your VacTrAK inventory and administration data are as accurate as possible . o Reconcile out wasted doses . o Reconcile out expired doses . o Verify that you have submitted all administered doses data to VacTrAK . o Verify that your administered doses connected to inventory . VacTrAK reports will show as COVID 10 mcg/0.2 mL dose, tris -sucrose Ancillary kit Pfizer Pediatric Alaska Department of Health and Social Services | Division of Public Health Pediatric COVID Vaccine Playbook 3 | P a g e November 5, 2021 [COVID -19 Vaccine -codes.html Contact vaccinedepot@alaska.gov if you have excess P fizer vaccine doses that you cannot use and want to transfer to another provider . Shipment Considerations Pediatric COVID -19 vaccine shipments will arrive during the first week of November. There will be a mix of direct shipments and depot shipments dur ing the initial roll out of the pediatric COVID -19 vaccine distribution. All direct shipment orders will be in increments of 300 doses. o After the first week, the direct shipment minimum amount will decrease to 100 doses. All depot orders will be in increments of 100 doses. o After the first week, the depot order minimum amount will decrease to 10 doses. Alaska will continue to receive weekly pediatric COVID -19 vaccine allocations. Providers can place orders for additional pediatric COVID -19 vaccine as needed. This initial pediatric COVID -19 vaccine allocation can be used for both 1st and 2nd doses. Providers must track their pediatric COVID -19 vaccine stock/administration timing and order 2nd doses as needed. Shipping may be impacted duri ng the Holiday Season: o Vaccine shipments in November and December could experience delays due to: Heavier workload for FedEx, UPS, and USPS , Vaccine shipping may be limited , Weather delays o Monitor your inventory closely, plan your vaccine orders carefull y, and order early . Pfizer Formulations The Pfizer pediatric 5 -11 vaccine was determined to be 90.7% effective against symptomatic COVID disease . There were no reports of significant adverse events related to the vaccine including myocarditis or anaphylaxis, although due to the size of the study we would not expect to see rare adverse events. Common mild reactions were less common in the 5 -11 cohor t compared to the 16 -25 cohort. The color orange is associated with pediatric COVID -19 formulations . These vacci ne vials will need to be diluted with 1.3 mL sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP prior to use. Only access the diluent vial once. There will be diluent remaining in the vial but discard it after one use and do not use it to dilute multiple vaccine vials. The pediatric injection volume is 0.2mL. See Fact Sheet for Healthcare Provid ers for Preparations instructions. More information on the Comirnaty and Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine can be found here .

Label each syringe with the name and the dosage (amount) of the vaccine, lot number, the initials of the preparer, and the exact beyond -use time, if applicable. Separate injection sites by 1 inch or more, if possible. Administer the COVID -19 vaccines and vaccines that may be more likely to cause a local reaction in different limbs, if possible. Staff may need refresher training or Just in Time Training for childhood vaccinations techniques o Consider a skills check -off Be familiar with locating injection sites on children o The deltoid muscle is preferred for children aged 5+ Find the acromion proces s, which is the bony point at the end of the shoulder The injection site will be below the bone and above the axillary fold/ armpit, the thickest part of the muscle o The vastus lateralis can be used when there is insufficient tissue on the deltoid The muscle is located between the greater trochanter of the femur and the lateral femoral condyle . The injection site is in the middle third of the muscle.
