EURACTIV is part of the Trust Project >>> Languages: DeutschPrint Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram The EU is reviewing its regulatory instruments on tobacco, as planned in the EU beating cancer plan. Experts and stakeholders are hoping that the revisions will target the loopholes that exist in directives. ukasz Balwicki, a professor at the Medical University of Gdansk, Poland, and a doctor at a smoking cessation clinic, has been involved in the tobacco control field for about 20 years. \"I wish there were bigger changes in Poland,\" he said, reflecting on the evolution in tobacco control in his country during those years. \"After those 20 years, I see that we could probably do more in this field,\" Balwicki told EURACTIV at the World Cancer Congress in Geneva, highlighting the lack of governmental investment and political will. \"In the Ministry of Health, there's only one person who is devoted to tobacco control issues,\" he said, adding that \"government tries not to touch the subject unless there is a need coming from, for example, the European Commission.\" Tobacco consumption is the single largest avoidable health risk, and the most significant cause of premature death in the EU. It is covered by a patchwork of EU directives: the EU Tobacco Products Directive, the Tobacco Taxation Directive, and several advertising directives targeting tobacco. With the EU's beating cancer plan goal to create a tobacco-free generation by 2040 - no more than 5% of the population using tobacco - there is a need to step up. In 2020, the figure was around 18%, according to Eurostat. To achieve a tobacco-free generation, the EU's beating cancer plan highlights the need for a review of the Tobacco Products Directive, the Tobacco Taxation Directive, and the legal framework on cross-border purchases of tobacco by private individuals. The Tobacco Products Directive is currently under a formal evaluation process with public consultation to be completed by the end of the year, a Commission official told EURACTIV. In the meantime, the Commission's proposal on the revision of the tobacco taxation directive is scheduled for 7 December 2022. The official added that in 2023, the Commission will put forward an update of the 2009 Council's smoke-free environments recommendation, tentatively scheduled for the third quarter of 2023. However, experts have highlighted that in order to make true progress, the EU must address loopholes in the regulations. \"You have the minimum standards that you have to implement coming from the institutions and then some countries go beyond and have very strong tobacco control legislation, while some implemented directive as it is,\" said Irina Kubinschi, policy and senior legal and policy officer at Smoke-free partnership. This seems to be the case in Poland. Balwicki said that existing loopholes \"serve as an excuse\" for some governments not to address tobacco control seriously enough. \"We are so much concentrated on the economy [...] that we sometimes leave behind that other maybe less important things like health,\" he said. \"Regulations on the EU level help us to not forget about that and keep up with such issues.\" On 19 October 2020, the Commission highlighted several areas for tightening of regulations. One argument was that minimum tax rates on rules for tobacco have lost their effect, as a large number of member states tax most tobacco products above the minimum. Taxation plays a pivotal role in reducing tobacco consumption, in particular in deterring youth from smoking. Additionally, the current directive does not fully cover several new types of tobacco products, leading the Commission to highlight the risk of cross-border purchases. With the revision, the EU executive is considering a number of policy options based on minimum excise duty rates and harmonisation of the taxation of new products such as e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products, and modern oral products. Regarding the Commission's upcoming proposal on the revision of the tobacco taxation directive, Kubinschi said that \"we hope for an ambitious proposal that will look at all the new products that are on the market.\" \"We want the new products to be defined as tax categories in the new directive because what happens otherwise is that you have some definitions, and then the industry is just creating new products that don't fit those definitions,\" she said. Kubinschi expressed hopes new products with not much data will be included even at 0% taxation which will put them under the monitoring system of excisable goods and help to collect additional data and introduce changes if needed, while also stressing the importance of convergence of excise duties, and progressive increase of taxes.

In establishing the EU's new Health Union, the European Commission extended the mandate of its medical agencies. However, staff are calling for more resources to implement the expansion. Women's rights/Poland. A delegation from the women's rights and gender equality committee (FEMM) will visit Poland to gather information and discuss women's rights as well as sexual and reproductive health and rights. MEPs will meet members of the Polish lower house Sejm, particularly the chair of the Intergroup on Women's Rights and the Chair of the Social Policy and Family Committee as well as representatives of the Health Ministry and the Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy. They will also meet representatives of NGOs, including FEDERA - the Foundation for Women and Family Planning. MEPs will hold a press point on Friday. Purchase of vaccines. The purchase of COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic has been a success story and \"a small European miracle\", European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas told the European Parliament's special committee on COVID during a hearing on Wednesday (26 October). Fast virus. The virus is faster than we can ever be in adapting vaccines, Marco Cavaleri, head of health threats and vaccines strategy at the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said Wednesday (October 26). Long COVID. ECDC's systematic review and meta-analysis, published on 27 October, found that the risk of post-COVID-19 condition may be higher among individuals who experience more severe COVID-19 disease. Overall, the prevalence of any post-COVID-19 condition symptom was estimated at ~51% among cohorts recruited in the community setting; ~67% among cohorts recruited in the hospital setting; and ~74% among cohorts recruited in the ICU setting. Omicron variants. WHO's Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) on 27 October announced that Omicron variants XBB and its sublineages (indicated as XBB*), as well as BQ.1 and its sublineages (indicated as BQ.1*) do not diverge sufficiently from each other, or from other Omicron lineages with additional immune escape mutations, in terms of the necessary public health response, to warrant the designation of new variants of concern and assignment of a new label. The two sublineages remain part of Omicron, which continues to be a variant of concern. ACT-A update. The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator on 28 October launched its plan for the next six months, during which it will focus on research and development (R&D) and market shaping activities, securing institutional arrangements for sustained access and will concentrate in-country work on new product introduction as the world transitions to long-term COVID-19 control. \"As this plan lays out, we still have a lot of work to do to achieve equitable access to these life-saving tools, with health workers and at-risk populations as our top priority,\" WHO said. Pfizer's Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccine candidate. Pfizer announced on Tuesday (2 October) the 82% efficacy against severe medically attended lower respiratory tract illness due to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in infants from birth through the first 90 days of life with high efficacy of 70% demonstrated through the first six months of life of its bivalent RSV vaccine candidate based on data from the phase 3 global maternal immunization trial. RSV is a contagious virus and a common cause of respiratory illness. The virus can affect the lungs and breathing passages of an infected individual and can be potentially life-threatening for young infants, persons with certain chronic medical conditions, and older adults. Hepatitis of unknown origin in children. As of 27 October 2022, 563 cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin in children aged 16 years and below have been reported to ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe by 22 countries, reaching 563 cases. Since the last surveillance bulletin, which used data as of 29 September 2022, eight new cases have been reported from five countries. The most cases, 280, were reported in the United Kingdom, followed by 54 cases in Spain. The majority (75.7%) of cases are five years old or younger. Of the 563 probable cases, 398 have information available on clinical outcomes. There have been seven deaths associated with the disease in the European Region. Of 364 cases with available information, 98 (26.9%) required admission to an intensive care unit. Of the 313 cases for which this information is available, 24 (7.7%) have received a liver transplant. Flu Awareness. On 28 October Andrea Ammon, Director of ECDC, released a statement calling to increase the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination for people with underlying risk factors by raising awareness of the importance of vaccination for people's health and well-being, as part of the Flu Awareness Campaign marked across the WHO European Region every year in October. \"With the arrival of autumn and winter, we are expecting to see more influenza cases and potentially COVID-19 and seasonal influenza circulating at the same time which will put vulnerable people at increased risk of severe illness and death,\" she said, adding that \"We need to avoid the burden of this co-circulation on our healthcare systems\". Ammon also stressed the importance of surveillance and preparedness in the European Region to protect people's health. Youth on health. Europe's youth called for five actions to improve youth health and well-being going forward in the first WHO/Europe forum Youth4Health, which took place in 25-27 October in Tirana. Raising awareness of health and well-being issues, working together to promote and create healthy and sustainable environments and innovative solutions to complex problems, as well as putting COVID-19 lessons learned into practice and collaborating are the five actions listed in Youth4Health statement. \"It's high time young people have a real say in health decision-making at all levels, moving beyond tokenism to genuine participation alongside governments and other authority figures,\" said Hans Kluge, WHO Europe Director. Climate and health knowledge. On Monday (31 October) WHO and World Meteorological Organization (WMO), in response to growing calls for actionable information to protect people from the health risks of climate change and other environmental hazards, launched the first global knowledge platform dedicated to climate and health - climahealth.info. EMA news Withdraw the marketing authorisations for amfepramone obesity medicines. On 28 October EMA's safety committee (PRAC) confirmed its recommendation to withdraw the marketing authorisations for amfepramone obesity medicines. This follows a re-examination of its previous recommendation of June 2022, which the companies that market these medicines requested. The recommendation follows a review which found that measures to restrict the use of these medicines for safety reasons have not been sufficiently effective. Measures to minimise the risk of serious side effects associated with Janus kinase (JAK). EMA's safety committee (PRAC) has recommended measures to minimise the risk of serious side effects, such as cardiovascular conditions, blood clots, cancer and serious infections, associated with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used to treat several chronic inflammatory disorders. The Committee recommended that these medicines should be used in the following patients only if no suitable treatment alternatives are available: those aged 65 years or above, those at increased risk of major cardiovascular problems (such as heart attack or stroke), those who smoke or have done so for a long time in the past and those at increased risk of cancer. Heavy menstrual bleeding was added as a side effect of mRNA vaccines. The PRAC has recommended that heavy menstrual bleeding should be added to the product information as a side effect of the unknown frequency of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines Comirnaty and Spikevax. Cases of heavy menstrual bleeding have been reported after the first, second and booster doses of Comirnaty and Spikevax. Committee concluded that there is at least a reasonable possibility that the occurrence of heavy menstrual bleeding is causally associated with these vaccines and therefore recommended the update of the product information. There is no evidence to suggest the menstrual disorders experienced by some people have any impact on reproduction and fertility. Ustekinumab (Stelara) live vaccines in infants warning. The PRAC has recommended adding a warning to the product information for ustekinumab (Stelara), used to treat severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, on the use of live vaccines in infants whose mothers received ustekinumab during their pregnancy. The product information already advises that it is preferable to avoid the use of ustekinumab during pregnancy. People of childbearing potential are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using Stelara and for at least 15 weeks after the last Stelara treatment.
