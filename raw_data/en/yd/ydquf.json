Pfizer -BioNTech 6M+ (Fact Sheet ) Moderna 6M+ and 6M -5Y (Fact Sheet and Provider Letter)Whenever new vaccine products are introduced into your practice's supply, ensure staff are properly trained on what's new and reinforce the storage and handling basics staff already know. This guide addresses training issues and setup required to support new pediatric vaccine products. #2. Complete the COVID -19 Product Training To ensure everyone is proficient with any new products in your inventory, CDC requires that everyone storing, handling, administering, or managing COVID -19 vaccines complete the COVID - 19 Vaccine Product Training . CDC training is broken down into separate Preparation & Administration and Storage & Handling summaries so staff and clinicians can review the training appropriate to their roles and print them for reference. Bookmark the COVID -19 Vaccine Product Guide as a quick reference. #3. Review Timing for Doses by Age Ensure staff know how to identify which vaccine is for which age group. This chart (also in Spanish ) includes two schedules (routine and for moderately and severely immunocompromised) for age 6 months and older.

Review Clinical, Safety, and Efficacy Talking Points Review clinical talking points for parents and start talking to families about COVID -19 vaccines. California COVID -19 Vaccination Program IMM -1432 (4/2023) Preparing for Under 5 Vaccination | 2 Did You Know? The PREP Act and PREP Act Declaration issued by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services authorize and provide liability protections to licensed providers and others identified in the declaration to administer COVID -19 vaccines authorized by FDA, including COVID -19 vaccines authorized for administration to children. The PREP Act Declaration authorizes certain providers listed in the Declaration to administer vaccines regardless of state requirements. For example, the Declaration authorizes pharmacists, pharmacy interns and pharmacy technicians nationwide to order and/or administer COVID -19 vaccines, influenza vaccines, and other vaccines authorized by FDA and recommended by CDC for children 3 years old. See FDA's PREP Act and ( HHS's Fact Sheet related to the May 11 end to the Public Health Emergency declaration) for more details.#4. Determine If Your Process Flows Change Will you offer COVID -19 vaccine when kids come in for other vaccines, or set up a separate COVID clinic? Review current workflows to ensure no opportunities to vaccinate are missed and expand capacity to reach younger children. Would separate staffing or stations for 5 -11 years and under 5 work well in your clinic? Staff could then specialize in one age group until proficient then rotate to expand proficiency to other ages. Consider offering authorized vaccine for children ages 6M -5Y who are not your patients and turning on your public display so that your location may be displayed on www.vaccines.gov . Consider offering COVID -19 and other routine vaccines, as feasible, to additional eligible persons (e.g., siblings, family members, community members). If co -administering with routine vaccines, ensure staff know your practice's vial -checking and syringe -labeling protocols to prevent mix-ups. (See Giving All the Doses for Under 12 Mos. and 12 Mos. and Older .) #5. Organize Your Storage Unit to Reduce Administration Errors Set up storage units so staff can locate the correct vaccine quickly to reduce errors caused by inadvertent administration of products similar in packaging or close in age indicators. Do not rely on cap colors. Read vial label carefully. Group vaccines by age (pediatric, adolescent, adult). Clearly label cartons, baskets, or shelf space in large lettering. Store vaccine and diluent together if storage requirements are the same; never freeze diluent. California COVID -19 Vaccination Program IMM -1432 (4/2023)Preparing for Under 5 Vaccination | 3 Needle Length & Injection Sites Ancillary kits currently contain only 1-inch needles. Appropriate needle length depends on age and body mass. See ACIP's Vaccine Administration . Infants (Aged <12 Months) For most infants, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh is the recommended injection site ( Figure 2 ). In certain circumstances (e.g., physical obstruction to other sites and no reasonable indication to defer doses), the gluteal muscle can be used but care should be taken to define anatomic landmarks. For most infants, a 1 -inch needle is sufficient to penetrate the thigh muscle. (See CDC's IM Injections for Infants 11 months of age and younger .) Toddlers (Aged 12 Months -2 Years) For toddlers, the anterolateral thigh muscle is preferred, and the needle should be at least 1 inch long. The deltoid muscle can be used if the muscle mass is adequate. (See CDC's IM Injections for Children 1 through 2 years of age .) Children (Aged 3 -10 Years) The deltoid muscle is preferred for children aged 3 -10 years and needle length can range from to 1 inch depending on technique. The anterolateral thigh can also be used. In this case the needle length should be 1 inch to 1.25 inches. Knowledge of body mass can be useful for estimating the appropriate needle length. (See CDC's IM Injections for Children 3 through 6 years of age .)#6. Ensure Staff Are Ready to Prepare & Administer New Pediatric Products Review the COVID -19 Vaccine Product Guide as a quick reference for injection and diluent volumes. Encourage s taff to read vial labels carefully to ensure the correct COVID -19 product is removed from your unit. See Technical Training for New Vaccinators for job aids on IM injection for Infants & Young Children including needle length and preferred anatomical injection sites by age. Reinforce these fundamentals they already know from the Vaccine Administration Checklist : Check vial label against the prescribed vaccine in My Turn or your EHR: Double check patient age Confirm if dose is a primary or booster dose Carefully read the vial label before preparation for Age indicators Injection volume (primary vs. booster) Dilution volume (maroon & orange caps only) Injection site for patient age #7. See If Your Location Is Ready ! Review product fact sheets in the COVID -19 Provider Operations Manual for storage and handling details. Add new vaccines and NDCs to VaccineFinder. Update your EHR as needed to allow for new products. Prepare scheduling & reminder -recall systems for new products. See COVID -19 Vaccine Reimbursement for vaccine administration CPT codes by manufacturer and dose. Ensure providers are prepared to recommend and co - administer COVID -19 and other childhood vaccines.
