What vaccines are available and where can you get them? Keep reading for answers! Although NC State has lessened restrictions and guidelines on campus this fall, COVID-19 and other viruses are still a threat to the campus community. Fortunately, [Campus Health](https://healthypack.dasa.ncsu.edu/) (formerly Student Health Services) continues to offer free COVID-19 testing as well as vaccinations and boosters for COVID-19, the flu and even Monkeypox to protect you and help reduce the spread to those around you. COVID-19 Campus Health advises NC State students, faculty and staff to remain vigilant as the world continues adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular testing is no longer required for students, faculty and staff, but those who wish to get a PCR test on campus may do so for free Monday through Thursday at [select locations](https://www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/health-services/) across campus. In addition to primary series COVID-19 vaccines, Campus Health is now offering Pfizer Bivalent boosters to eligible students, faculty and staff. Check your eligibility on the [Centers for Disease Control website.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvaccines%2Fbooster-shot.html) NC State students and employees can make appointments for COVID-19 vaccines and boosters with Campus Health through the [HealthyPack Portal](https://healthypack.dasa.ncsu.edu/healthweb/). In addition to testing and vaccines, Campus Health urges the campus community to continue taking [personal precautions and following the Community Standards](https://www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/personal-precautions/) implemented in 2020.

Campus Health has a limited number of JYNNEOS vaccine doses. If you believe you are eligible for the vaccine, call Campus Health at 919-515-2563 and ask for \"JYNNEOS vaccine consultation.\" If you think you have been exposed and are ill, make an appointment at Campus Health [online](https://healthypack.dasa.ncsu.edu/healthweb/) or call 919-515-2563.
