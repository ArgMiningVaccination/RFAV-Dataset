Health Benefits Possible Side Effects Dosage and Preparation What to Look For Frequently Asked Questions For centuries, extracts from the banaba tree's leaves has been used for medicinal purposes. It is thought that banaba extracts can help with endocrine health, weight management, and even blood pressure. What Is Banaba? As a medicinal product extracted from tree leaves native to Southeast Asia (named Lagerstroemia speciosa), banaba has long been used for a range of health issues. Proponents claim that banabasupplements can promote weight loss and offer anti-inflammatory properties. Banaba contains ellagitannins, which are compounds with antioxidant effects, and corosolicacid, which is reported to lower blood sugar levels within 60 minutes and stimulate glucose transport into cells. Banaba is often marketed as a natural weight-loss aid, but it may not be the best choice. Here is an overview of what you need to know about banaba. Health Benefits There is limited scientific research demonstrating the potential health benefits of banaba. Here's a look at several key study findings. May Help With Weight Management Banaba is mainly marketed as a weight-loss remedy. Researchers investigated its effectiveness in a study on consuming herbs to lose weight. Results showed that after a 12-week treatment period, participants taking an herbal blend with banaba lost significantly more weight and body fat mass compared to those taking a placebo. Participants also experienced a greater reduction in waist and hip circumference than the control group. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of using banaba as a weight-loss tool. May Reduce the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Banaba supplements could help with glycemic control and reduce the need for insulin therapy when used as a complement to standard diabetes treatments. According to review on banaba and natural supplements, researchers found that they have the potential to reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes in the at-risk population. Banaba may also help achieve optimal glycemic control. But more research is needed to determine its safety and effectiveness. May Lower Blood Pressure Banaba could help lower blood pressure, according to research on the supplement's effects. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, blood pressure, body weight, and waist circumference were evaluated with participants taking 500 milligrams of banaba twice a day beforebreakfast and dinner for 12 weeks. Researchers found that after consuming banaba, participants had significant decreases in systolic blood pressure compared to the control group. If you have an interest in using banaba to lower your blood pressure, it is paramount that you speak to a healthcare provider first. They can let you know if it is safe and if there is a possibility it could interact with your existing blood pressure medications. May Contain Preventative Compounds In an investigation on banaba flowers, researchers found this plant can neutralize free radicals, which cause aging. These results were due to the high antioxidant content (antioxidants are compounds that counteract the damaging, aging effects of free radicals), phenols, flavonoids, andcorosolic acid. The banaba extract also could help protect against certain viruses and bacteria, such as a common cold and the viruses Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus megaterium. Possible Side Effects Consuming banaba could cause certain side effects, including sleep disturbances and headaches. If you are taking banaba, try taking a smaller dosage, supplementing with food, or discontinuing use. Keep in mind, research is not available on what occurs when consuming banaba supplements for a long period of time. You should speak with a healthcare provider before you add banaba to your dietary regimen. Pregnant and nursing women, children, immunocompromised people, and those taking medications should avoid taking banaba supplements. Additionally, self-treating diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other condition with banaba and avoiding or delaying standard care might have serious consequences. Likewise, you should avoid banaba if you take medication to lower your blood pressure. Banaba supplements could cause your blood pressure to reach below what is medically acceptable. Dosage and Preparation Limited clinical data shows exact dosing recommendations of banaba. In one study, doses of 32 milligrams or 48 milligrams of extract of the banaba leaves were given daily for 10 days to patients with type 2 diabetes. Speak with a healthcare provider to learn what is best for you based on your health history. The appropriate dose depends on your health, age, and tolerance. Additionally, supplements have not been tested for safety and are largely unregulated, so the content of some products may differ from what is specified on the product label. What to Look For If you consume banaba supplements, look for products that contain the USP (United StatesPharmacopeia) seal, as this ensures high quality. The label also should not list any treatment, cure, or relief of symptoms for a disease, as this is illegal per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Due to the lack of supporting research, banaba is not recommended for weight loss or any other health-related purpose. If you consider using banaba, you should consult with a healthcare provider first. Frequently Asked Questions How do you make banaba tea?
