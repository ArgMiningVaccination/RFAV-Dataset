Positioned at the intersection of research and policy, the team strengthens the evidence base through an expansive research portfolio and subsequently, translates that evidence into action for prevention. Generating Evidence for Action Our Applied Epidemiology Program generates evidence for vaccine policy makers, including conducting clinical surveillance to measure burden of disease and studying vaccine safety and immunogenicity, effectiveness, and impact. We are committed to generating actionable results, and use our global advocacy experience to translate data into tools for the prevention of infectious diseases. \"The COVID-19 pandemic created pressure for an effective vaccine, which led to large doses being tested to ensure efficacy; however, if Sabin finds that lower doses can be as effective as full doses, more vaccines may be available for more people if they are needed.\" Denise Garrett Vice President, Applied Epidemiology [Dose-Optimizing COVID-19 Vaccine Clinical Trial](https://www.sabin.org/resources/sabin-vaccine-institute-receives-up-to-6-3-million-from-cepi-for-dose-optimizing-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trial/) Sabin was awarded up to $6.3 million from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) for a clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of lower, fractional doses of registered COVID-19 vaccines used as a booster dose.

Also, read about our study to validate accessible tests for typhoid so that communities can better assess disease spread \u2014 and the need for vaccines.
