It is not a technique, it is a knack. Either you get it or you don't.\" - Osho \"A mind that has become no mind, and has come back to its source is meditation\"- Sri Sri Ravishankar \"To concentrate is not to meditate, even though that is what most of you do, calling it meditation. And if concentration is not meditation, then what is? Surely, meditation is to understand every thought that comes into being, and not to dwell upon one particular thought; it is to invite all thoughts so that you understand the whole process of thinking.\"-J. Krishnamurti The above quotes from masters are probably the best way to explain what Meditation really is. In recent decades, modern science has dramatically confirmed that meditation offers deep and lasting benefits for mental functioning and emotional health, as well as for physical health and well-being. Benefits of Meditation: Meditation is usually associated with a \"serious\" thing, or something that one should do post retirement. At healing harmony we believe, it is anything but serious. We facilitate meditations and therapies that are mostly inspired by Osho's revolutionary science of inner transformation. We feature expert teachers from a variety of traditions offering simple techniques in an accessible manner. Even if you think you can't meditate, we have teachers who will prove you delightfully wrong. Meditation allows you to live in harmony \u2014to embrace life's ever-changing impermanence, to come close to your real \"you\", to live in equanimity with the inevitable ups and downs of being human, and to feel deeply connected to the whole of life. Meditation in turn helps in majority of your physical and mental health issues. Meditation at H2: Read through the different types of meditation taught at Healing Harmony and various meditation programs offered by us. You can choose to drop-in for a class that interests you or come for a taster session to learn more. Our facilitators will help guide you through this maze effortlessly and be your partner in this journey of self-discovery and peace. Sound Therapy: Sound is one of our oldest forms of healing. Used during yoga, meditation and even to enhance learning, sound as therapy is as old as the earth itself. Song and music are restorative to the nervous system, resonate deep within our cells, and are powerfully effective at changing our thought patterns. The Healing Power of Music and Meditation Clinical studies demonstrate that sound and guided imagery meditation can boost the immune system, decrease stress hormones, lower heart rate and blood pressure, and induce alpha and theta brain wave patterns, which are associated with the production of endorphins, the body's natural painkillers. Chakra Balancing: The word 'chakra' is derived from a Sanskrit word meaning 'wheel'; but perhaps even a better translation would be spinning wheel. They are centres of activity that receives, assimilates and expresses life force energy. They are responsible for the person's physical, mental, and spiritual functions. When one (or more) of the chakra is blocked and the energy does not flow harmoniously through them, or if it is wide open, it will result in imbalance that is manifested in all areas of life in form of mental or physical diseases. At H2 we have various methodologies to test your blocks and cleanse them for your overall wellbeing. Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) EFT is a form of psychological acupressure, based on the same energy meridians used in traditional acupuncture to treat physical and emotional ailments, but without the invasiveness of needles instead, simple tapping with the fingertips is used to input kinetic energy onto specific meridians to treat physical, emotional and performance problems. The process facilitates a release of painful, stressful emotions from the energy system, this sets you free from chronic patterns, such as fear and resentment. It allows healthy energy to flow harmoniously without harmful emotion. \"What does not happen outside us is the thing we are holding back inside of us. When we let go of the insecurities within, the outside changes easily.SO WITHIN, SO WITHOUT ! Soul Temple Therapy (ST) Soul Temple Society is a global network of like-minded people who think constructively, collectively and synergistically to generate massive web of spiritual, educational & socio-economic-cultural energy indeed used to heal others. Soul Temple therapy is used to understand the connection of thoughts & emotions with the physical body. Your body is an epitome of supreme intelligence. Never ignore the signals that body is sending. Each body part has a message to give you. When you ignore them, you and your body both suffers. Soul temple therapy helps in emotional and physical body cleansing i.e. relationship healing, depression healing and inner child healing. \"It's a way of life, divinity in everything\" Awakened Parenting (AP) A radically transformative technique that enrich parent child relationship. We all have the capacity to raise children who are highly resilient and emotionally connected. However, many of us are unable to because we are blinded by modern misconceptions of parenting and our own inner limitations. Awakened parenting helps you to cultivate a strong relationship with your children so they can flourish; moreover, you can be transformed to a state of greater calm, compassion and wisdom as well. It transcend your fears and illusions around parent-child relation and help you become you always wanted to be: fully present and conscious. Past Life Regression Technique (PLR) PLR works at the sub-conscious level, with this therapy memories of past lives can be accessed in order to understand certain physical or psychological ailments, It helps you examine your individual circumstance, see the larger patterns that keep playing out over and over again in your life, and using guided intervention, equip you to reshape your life as you desire This technique is also used to understand some relationships in our life, which affect you deeply, but for no logical reason. PLR has its roots in the belief of reincarnation -the Law of Karma.
