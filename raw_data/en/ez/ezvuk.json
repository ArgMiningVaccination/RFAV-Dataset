The absence of melatonin can lead to sleep disturbances and disorders (Wetterberg et al., 1999). For this reason, increasing melatonin within the body may be beneficial to those suffering from sleep-related issues. In this article we explore the effects of using melatonin as a supplement and how meditation affects melatonin levels. Melatonin is a commonly used supplement for treating sleep-related disorders. Other pharmacological solutions exist, such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antihistamines, and anxiolytics (Xie et al., 2017). The trouble with many of the mentioned drugs is that they are addictive and are far from satisfactory solutions to sleep-related issues (Xie et al., 2017). On the other hand, melatonin is not addictive. The beneficial nature of melatonin comes from the fact that it is a naturally occurring chemical in the body produced by the pineal gland (Xie et al., 2017). It plays a vital role in our daily circadian rhythm, and much research supports the efficacy and safety of its use in most cases (Ferlazzo et al., 2020; Foley & Steel, 2019; Ghaderi et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2017). Dr Matt Walker, an expert on sleep research explains: In fact, beyond the benefits of sleep, melatonin supplementation also seems to provide other benefits. For starters, melatonin helps reduce bone loss and may be a helpful treatment for people such as the elderly who suffer from deteriorating bone mass (Ferlazzo et al., 2020). Melatonin may also prevent ageing. Traditionally, reactive oxidative species (ROS), a natural byproduct of processes within the body, such as cellular respiration, are thought to be a leading cause of the natural ageing and degradation process of the body due to their ability to cause damage to DNA. Melatonin is highly abundant in mitochondria where cellular respiration occurs and can reduce the presence of ROS (Ferlazzo et al., 2020; Ghaderi et al., 2019). This antioxidant property of melatonin suggests that it can significantly reduce the ageing process. Similarly, melatonin interacts with the immune system and can reduce the inflammatory response, which would benefit health in many ways (Ferlazzo et al., 2020; Ghaderi et al., 2019). The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nature of melatonin leads some researchers to believe melatonin can help prevent obesity (Ferlazzo et al., 2020). With all this said, research has shown that melatonin supplementation improves mental health and quality of life (Ghaderi et al., 2019). Nonetheless, it is not without its cautionary criticisms. The main criticism towards melatonin is its use in children since melatonin seems to play a role in the stages of puberty. It has been previously argued that melatonin levels drop before puberty (Waldhauser et al., 1984). Therefore, there is a worry that supplementing melatonin during this life stage would delay puberty onset (Waldhauser et al., 1991). Even studies in rats show melatonin supplementation slows puberty (Meredith et al., 2000). More recent research suggests that the decrease in melatonin occurs after puberty begins after all (Boafo et al., 2019a). If this is true, then the dangers of melatonin use in children may be less than previously theorised. On that same note, studies on the adverse effects of melatonin in humans have been less conclusive. There have been three major studies that observed puberty rates in children who were using melatonin (Boafo et al., 2019a). A review of these studies states that only one of these studies showed results suggesting that melatonin does indeed delay puberty (Boafo et al., 2019a). In this study, 31.3% of children experienced delayed puberty (17% of children's puberty was postponed in the control group) (Zwart et al., 2018). However, the results were determined through a questionnaire on perceived puberty timing, and this has been subject to much criticism (Boafo et al., 2019b; Hydzik, 2020). Melatonin's effect on delaying puberty is relatively inconclusive and understudied (Boafo et al., 2019a). Given that, the consensus seems to be more directed to the claim that melatonin poses minimal risks, given its tremendous benefits for health and well-being. However, drugs and supplements will often always carry side effects or potentially understudied side effects. When non-pharmacological interventions exist to remedy the same more holistic issue, we will do well to make them our primary consideration. Additionally, there are some in research that question whether melatonin is truly efficacious towards benefiting sleep onset times and overall sleep efficiency. Melatonin is released during times of darkness and is correlated with the onset of sleepiness (Brzezinski et al., 2005). It is not, however, directly involved in sleep quality. Rather, it is more of a gatekeeper that begins to process the onset of sleep. With that in mind, a meta-analysis review conducted in 2005 showed that melatonin supplementation only changes sleep onset times by 3.9 minutes (Brzezinski et al., 2005). Additionally, the same study showed that, on average, melatonin only increases sleep efficiency by 2.2% (Brzezinski et al., 2005). These results, which are an aggregation of many studies, suggest that melatonin may not provide the desired benefits towards sleep. As we age, melatonin secretion tends to naturally decrease with ageing, explaining why many seniors have poorer sleep quality, however, as it stimulates the immune system and antioxidative defence system acting as an antioxidant and immunomodulatory, it can delay ageing (Brzezinski, 1997; Massion et al., 1995). Melatonin prescribed and administered in the over 60-65 years population may receive some benefit. Melatonin is typically prescribed due to calcification of the pineal gland and to affect the flatter overall curve of melatonin release observed during the night in these cases. Melatonin used in this population 60-65 years and above may do well to consider these factors outlined by Dr Matt Walker: - Whilst it doesn't help in the generation of sleep, it seems to possibly drop core body temperature by up to a degree celcius which does help us to stay asleep throughout the night, but this temperature drop is maybe not due to melatonin alone! - Melatonin is an effective antioxidant that can help protect cells from damage. - To increase melatonin throughout the night for the older population who may have calcification of the pineal gland. When the pineal gland calcifies, melatonin release through the night is affected. Therefore it is sometimes recommended in older adults with insomnia. - Optimal doses for where you do get sleep benefits in older populations are 0.1-0.3mg of melatonin, not what is usually sold, bought and consumed daily. Typical supplements of 5mg, 10mg, even 20mg(!) are up to 10 to 20 times more than what is naturally required. This makes our self-medicating a supraphysiological dose, meaning this is far above what is physiologically normal! Matt Walker questions, would you eat 20 times more per day then what is required? Then, why medicate in a similar way? - Matt Walker's research is best followed if you are considering taking melatonin to ensure that the product is of high purity. Walker also recommends consulting with a healthcare professional before starting any Melatonin supplementation regimen. Breathing and meditation practices seem to influence the release of melatonin. Multiple studies have shown that meditation increases melatonin levels in practitioners during the night hours (Ghaderi et al., 2019; Liou et al., 2010b; Tooley et al., 2000). Melatonin levels are also higher in expert meditators compared to non-meditators (Solberg et al., 2004a). Vipassana meditators have significantly higher diurnal (24 hour period) melatonin levels (approximately 300 pg ml) compared to non-meditating controls (65 pg ml)(Nagendra et al., 2012). Additionally, expert meditators who meditate before bed have higher melatonin levels than expert mediators who skip their daily practice (Liou et al., 2010b). Here is strong evidence that the immediate act of meditation can increase melatonin levels, thereby helping foster a good night's sleep. Melatonin secretion during ACEM meditation has been studied. ACEM is a meditation organisation that originated in Norway and this form of meditation is prevalent in Scandinavia. It involves repeating a mantra for 30 minutes twice a day (Solberg et al., 2004b). Solberg found that advanced meditators have up to 150 per cent higher melatonin levels than non-meditators, and more interestingly, that longer term practice leads to elevations in levels overall. The study by Liou 2010 also involved using mantras and mental imagery of receiving spiritual energy (Liou et al., 2010a). Therefore mantra-based meditations may be instrumental in producing melatonin. Though the exact mechanisms to why meditation increases melatonin are still unclear, it may be related to the breathing techniques exhibited through meditation practice. A study involving elite athletes who practised diaphragmatic breathing after exercise also showed increased melatonin levels once the night came (Martarelli et al., 2011). Though the athletes didn't perform a meditation practice, they showed similar trends in melatonin activity. Meditation and healthy breathing techniques seem to improve the release of melatonin when it is naturally required as part of our circadian rhythm. Similar results are found when participants perform yoga (Harinath et al., 2004). Some researchers even hypothesise that the cardiac health observed from prolonged meditation practices is also due to the increased release of melatonin, due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and DNA repair properties as they relate to the cardiovascular system (Mohan et al., 2022). Meditations for Melatonin - AM: Rise with Sun and face East increasing light to pineal gland - practice meditation or yoga asana facing East within 30 minutes of waking. Make sure you view sunlight for 2-10 minutes for best melatonin production. - PM: Practice mindful evening walk or practice asana facing West. Catch the last vestiges of light for the day and make sure you see the sun setting, to send another message to your brain that it's evening and will soon be time to rest. - Pineal Gland Meditation - Joe Dispensa - Mantra Based Meditation - Meditate before bed and there are so many ways to meditate at this hour: [Lucid dreaming, Dream Yoga](https://biyome.com.au/yoga/dream-yoga-and-the-science-of-lucid-dreaming-by-celia-roberts/), Yoga Nidra, Breathing meditation. Recall that expert meditators who meditate before bed have higher melatonin levels than expert meditators who skip their daily practice (Liou et al., 2010a). - Specific types of meditation practices like [mindfulness](https://biyome.com.au/meditation-classes-brisbane/), [TM](https://biyome.com.au/meditation/scientific-benefits-of-vedic-meditation/), [Om meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sYK7lm3UKg)have been shown to increase nocturnal melatonin levels (both saliva and plasma) immediately after a meditation session and high salivary levels are maintained for long hours after meditation (Liou et al., 2010a). A Mindfulness-based guided meditation by Celia Roberts on balancing Serotonin and Melatonin levels naturally throughout the day is here below. The precursor to melatonin is serotonin, a neurotransmitter derived from the amino acid tryptophan. Within the pineal gland, serotonin converts to yield melatonin. Serotonin plays an essential role in both reducing depression and mood stabilisation, reducing stress and preventing age-related decline (Pacchierotti et al., 2001). We can consider serotonin and melatonin to be like day and night in terms of their jobs, and whilst they perform opposing jobs, they must work together to keep the body and brain balanced.
