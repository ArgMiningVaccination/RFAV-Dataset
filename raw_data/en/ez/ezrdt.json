In an effort to foster inclusivity and to minimize bias, we will be offering in-person interviews and virtual interviews. Our interviews will take place on Mondays and Fridays with a break over the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Interview in person: For those available to travel to spend time with us, we will provide overnight accommodations and meals during the time you spend with us to minimize your direct cost. Interview virtually: For applicants who prefer a virtual format, we will offer virtual interview days that will be clearly marked in ERAS as \"Virtual Interview Day.\" These will be conducted via a Microsoft Teams platform with a time for meeting residents the night before the interview.
