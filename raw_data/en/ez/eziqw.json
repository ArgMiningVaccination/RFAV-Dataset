As such, the Functional Nutrition Training includes a deep dive into key body systems to build understanding of how each appears when in and out of balance, and how to help restore optimal functioning - from heart health, brain health, gut health, thyroid health, hormone health and more. This has included amplifying everything from culinary to fitness, healthcare - and even coaching - pursuits! The diversity of our expert faculty, and our supporting program curriculum, is also strategically designed to equip graduates to work across a diversity of contexts & conditions. This well-rounded perspective, versus a single approach or philosophy, is a differentiator for mindbodygreen. In addition, a live guest speaker event is hosted every quarter, featuring our top faculty and other best-in-class wellness experts. The best part? You'll have access to all of the above - and more - for life!If you'd like to learn more about what makes our Functional Nutrition Training stand apart, we invite you to [chat with a Program Advisor.](mailto:mbgcoaching@mindbodygreen.com) You can select an Affirm plan upon enrollment, or you can learn more about the options available by speaking with a Program Advisor. Our Health Coach Certification provides students with the foundation of effective health coaching, including various methods of listening, inquiry, reflection, goal setting, mindset shifts and habit creation. While basic nutrition is covered within our Health Coach Certification, students seeking a more in-depth nutrition training would benefit from the Functional Nutrition Training program. "}
