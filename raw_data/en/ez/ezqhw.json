METHODOLOGY 293 A cknowledgements 306CONTENTS1The end of the first century of drug control (it all started in Shanghai in 1909) coincided with the closing of the UNGASS decade (launched in 1998 by a General Assembly Special Session on Drugs). These anniversaries stimulated reflection on the effectiveness, and the limi-tations, of drug policy. The review resulted in the reaf-firmation that illicit drugs continue to pose a health danger to humanity. That's why drugs are, and should remain, controlled. With this sanction in mind, Member States confirmed unequivocal support for the UN Con- ventions that have established the world drug control system. At the same time, UNODC has highlighted some nega- tive, obviously unintended effects of drug control, fore-shadowing a needed debate about the ways and means to deal with them. Of late, there has been a limited but growing chorus among politicians, the press, and even in public opinion saying: drug control is not working. The broadcasting volume is still rising and the message spreading. Much of this public debate is characterized by sweeping generalizations and simplistic solutions. Yet, the very heart of the discussion underlines the need to evaluate the effectiveness of the current approach. Having stud-ied the issue on the basis of our data, UNODC has concluded that, while changes are needed, they should be in favour of different means to protect society against drugs, rather than by pursuing the different goal of abandoning such protection. A. What's the repeal debate about? Several arguments have been put forward in favour of repealing drug controls, based on (i) economic, (ii) health, and (iii) security grounds, and a combination thereof. I. The economic argument for drug legalization says: legalize drugs, and generate tax income. This argument is gaining favour, as national administrations seek new sources of revenue during the current economic crisis. This legalize and tax argument is un-ethical and un- economical. It proposes a perverse tax, generation upon generation, on marginalized cohorts (lost to addiction) to stimulate economic recovery. Are the partisans of this cause also in favour of legalizing and taxing other seem- ingly intractable crimes like human trafficking? Mod-ern-day slaves (and there are millions of them) would surely generate good tax revenue to rescue failed banks. The economic argument is also based on poor fiscal logic: any reduction in the cost of drug control (due to lower law enforcement expenditure) will be offset by much higher expenditure on public health (due to the surge of drug consumption). The moral of the story: don't make wicked transactions legal just because they are hard to control. II. Others have argued that, following legalization, a health threat (in the form of a drug epidemic) could be avoided by state regulation of the drug market. Again, this is naive and myopic. First, the tighter the controls (on anything), the bigger and the faster a parallel (crim-inal) market will emerge - thus invalidating the concept. Second, only a few (rich) countries could afford such elaborate controls. What about the rest (the majority) of humanity? Why unleash a drug epidemic in the develop-ing world for the sake of libertarian arguments made by a pro-drug lobby that has the luxury of access to drug treatment? Drugs are not harmful because they are con- trolled - they are controlled because they are harmful; and they do harm whether the addict is rich and beauti- ful, or poor and marginalized. Drug statistics keep speaking loud and clear. Past run- away growth has flattened out and the drug crisis of the 1990s seems under control. This 2009 Report provides further evidence that drug cultivation (opium and coca) are flat or down. Most importantly, major markets for opiates (Europe and South East Asia), cocaine (North America), and cannabis (North America, Oceania and Europe) are in decline. The increase in consumption of synthetic stimulants, particularly in East Asia and the Middle East, is cause for concern, although use is declin-ing in developed countries. III. The most serious issue concerns organized crime. All market activity controlled by the authority generates parallel, illegal transactions, as stated above. Inevitably, drug controls have generated a criminal market of mac-ro-economic dimensions that uses violence and corrup-tion to mediate between demand and supply. Legalize drugs, and organized crime will lose its most profitable line of activity, critics therefore say. Not so fast. UNODC is well aware of the threats posed by international drug mafias. Our estimates of the value PREFACE2of the drug market (in 2005) were ground-breaking. The Office was also first to ring the alarm bell on the threat of drug trafficking to countries in West and East Africa, the Caribbean, Central America and the Balkans. In doing so we have highlighted the security menace posed by organized crime, a matter now periodically addressed by the UN Security Council. Having started this drugs/crime debate, and having pondered it extensively, we have concluded that these drug-related, organized crime arguments are valid. They must be addressed. I urge governments to recalibrate the policy mix, without delay, in the direction of more con-trols on crime, without fewer controls on drugs. In other words, while the crime argument is right, the conclu-sions reached by its proponents are flawed. Why? Because we are not counting beans here: we are counting lives. Economic policy is the art of counting beans (money) and handling trade-offs: inflation vs. employment, consumption vs. savings, internal vs. exter-nal balances. Lives are different. If we start trading them off, we end up violating somebody's human rights. There cannot be exchanges, no quid-pro-quos, when health and security are at stake: modern society must, and can, protect both these assets with unmitigated determina-tion. I appeal to the heroic partisans of the human rights cause worldwide, to help UNODC promote the right to health of drug addicts: they must be assisted and reinte- grated into society. Addiction is a health condition and those affected by it should not be imprisoned, shot-at or, as suggested by the proponent of this argument, traded-off in order to reduce the security threat posed by inter-national mafias. Of course, the latter must be addressed, and below is our advice. B. A better policy mixThe crime/drugs nexus was the subject of a Report enti- tled Organized Crime and its Threat to Security: tackling a disturbing consequence of drug control 1 that I presented to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the Crime Commission in 2009. Because of the importance of this subject, we have devoted the thematic chapter of this 1 E/CN.15/2009/CRP .4 - E/CN.7/2009/CRP .4; http://www.unodc. org/unodc/en/commissions/CCPCJ/session/18.htmlyear's Report to examining further the issue and its policy implications. Here are some of the main points. First, law enforcement should shift its focus from drug users to drug traffickers. Drug addiction is a health con-dition: people who take drugs need medical help, not criminal retribution. Attention must be devoted to heavy drug users. They consume the most drugs, cause the greatest harm to themselves and society - and generate the most income to drug mafias. Drug courts and med-ical assistance are more likely to build healthier and safer societies than incarceration. I appeal to Member States to pursue the goal of universal access to drug treatment as a commitment to save lives and reduce drug demand: the fall of supply, and associated crime revenues, will follow. Let's progress towards this goal in the years ahead, and then assess its beneficial impact on the next occasion Member States will meet to review the effectiveness of drug policy (2015). Second, we must put an end to the tragedy of cities out of control. Drug deals, like other crimes, take place mostly in urban settings controlled by criminal groups. This problem will worsen in the mega-cities of the future, if governance does not keep pace with urbaniza-tion. Yet, arresting individuals and seizing drugs for their personal use is like pulling weeds - it needs to be done again the next day. The problem can only be solved by addressing the problem of slums and dereliction in our cities, through renewal of infrastructures and investment in people - especially by assisting the youth, who are vulnerable to drugs and crime, with education, jobs and sport. Ghettos do not create junkies and the jobless: it is often the other way around. And in the process mafias thrive. Third, and this is the most important point, govern- ments must make use, individually and collectively, of the international agreements against uncivil society. This means to ratify and apply the UN Conventions against Organized Crime (TOC) and against Corruption (CAC), and related protocols against the trafficking of people, arms and migrants. So far, the international community has not taken these international obligations seriously. While slum dwellers suffer, Africa is under attack, drug cartels threaten Latin America, and mafias penetrate bankrupt financial institutions, junior nego-tiators at these Conventions' Conferences of the Parties have been arguing about bureaucratic processes and PREFACE3arcane notions of inclusiveness, ownership, comprehen- siveness, and non-ranking. There are large gaps in the implementation of the Palermo and the Merida Con-ventions, years after their entry into force, to the point that a number of countries now face a crime situation largely caused by their own choice. This is bad enough. Worse is the fact that, quite often vulnerable neighbors pay an even greater price. There is much more our countries can do to face the brutal force of organized crime: the context within which mafias operate must also be addressed. Money-laundering s is rampant and practically unop- posed, at a time when interbank-lending has dried up . The recommendations devised to prevent the use of - nancial institutions to launder criminal money, today are honored mostly in the breach. At a time of major bank failures, money doesn't smell, bankers seem to be- lieve. Honest citizens, struggling in a time of economic hardship, wonder why the proceeds of crime - turned into ostentatious real estate, cars, boats and planes - are not seized. Another context deserving attention concerns one of s humanity's biggest assets, the internet. I t has changed our life, especially the way we conduct business, com- munication, research and entertainment. But the web has also been turned into a weapon of mass destruction by criminals (and terrorists). Surprisingly, and despite the current crime wave, calls for new international arrangements against money-laun-dering and cyber-crime remain un-answered. In the process, drug policy gets the blame and is subverted. C. A double \"NO\" To conclude, transnational organized crime will never be stopped by drug legalization. Mafias coffers are equally nourished by the trafficking of arms, people and their organs, by counterfeiting and smuggling, racketeering and loan-sharking, kidnapping and piracy, and by vio-lence against the environment (illegal logging, dumping of toxic waste, etc). The drug/crime trade-off argument, debated above, is no other than the pursuit of the old drug legalization agenda, persistently advocated by the pro-drug-lobby (Note that the partisans of this argu-ment would not extend it to guns whose control - they say - should actually be enforced and extended: namely, no to guns, yes to drugs). So far the drug legalization agenda has been opposed fiercely, and successfully, by the majority of our society. Yet, anti-crime policy must change. It is no longer suf-ficient to say: no to drugs. We have to state an equally vehement: no to crime. There is no alternative to improving both security and health. The termination of drug control would be an epic mistake. Equally catastrophic is the current disre-gard of the security threat posed by organized crime. Antonio Maria Costa Executive Director United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime INTRODUCTION 5Drug control has been on the global agenda for more than a century. As documented in the 2008 World Drug Report, the Chinese opium epidemic in the early twenti-eth century spurred concerted international action, chiefly in the form of a series of treaties passed over several decades. These treaties, in particular the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 Con-vention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 Con-vention against the Illicit T raffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, continue to define the interna-tional drug control system. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is the guardian of these treaties and the United Nations lead agency on drug control. At the twentieth special session of the General Assembly in 1998, Member States agreed to make significant progress towards the control of supply and demand for illicit drugs by the year 2008. They noted that this objective could only be achieved by means of the 'bal-anced approach' (giving demand as much attention as supply), and on the basis of regular assessments of global drug trends. UNODC has published such assessments annually since 1999. Moreover, the General Assembly, in its resolution 61/183 of 13 March 2007, requested UNODC to continue to \"publish the World Drug Report with comprehensive and balanced information about the world drug problem.\" This year, UNODC will continue to fulfil this mandate with the publication of the 2009 World Drug Report.The World Drug Report aims to enhance Member States' understanding of global illicit drug trends, and to sensi-tize all Governments about the need for more systematic collection and reporting of data related to illicit drugs. UNODC relies on Member States to provide data, pri-marily through the annual reports questionnaire (ARQ). This year, out of some 200 distributed questionnaires, UNODC received 118 replies to the drug abuse section and 116 replies to the illicit supply of drugs section. In general, the ability of Member States to provide infor-mation on illicit drug supply is significantly better than their ability to provide demand-related data. Despite commendable progress, for example in the area of prev-alence estimates, far more remains to be done to provide a solid, reliable basis for trend and policy analysis. 6Types of drugs: ATS - Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) are a group of substances comprised of synthetic stimulants includ- ing amphetamine, methamphetamine, methcathinone and ecstasy-group substances (MDMA and its ana-logues). In cases where countries report to UNODC without indicating the specific ATS they are referring to, the term non-specified amphetamines is used. Coca paste (or cocaine base) - An extract of the leaves of the coca bush. Purification of coca paste yields cocaine (hydrochloride). Crack (cocaine) - Cocaine base obtained from cocaine hydrochloride through conversion processes to make it suitable for smoking. Heroin HCl (heroin hydrochloride) - Injectable form of heroin, sometimes referred to as \"Heroin no. 4\" Heroin no. 3 - A less refined form of heroin suitable for smoking. Poppy straw - All parts (except the seeds) of the opium poppy, after mowing. T erms: Since there is some scientific and legal ambiguity about the distinctions between drug 'use', 'misuse' and 'abuse', this report uses the neutral terms, drug 'use' or 'consumption'. Annual prevalence means the number of people who have used a given drug at least once in the past year. Annual prevalence rate refers to the percentage of a pop- ulation (for example, in one country, or globally) that has used a given drug at least once in the past year.

In cooperation with the affected states, UNODC conducts annual crop sur-veys in the countries that produce the vast bulk of these drugs. These surveys show a reduction in opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan of 19% and a reduction in coca cultivation in Colombia of 18%. T rends in other production countries are mixed, but are not large enough to offset the declines in these two major producers. Although data are not complete enough to give a precise estimate of the global reduction in opium and coca pro-duction, there can be little doubt that it did, in fact, decrease. Production of the other illicit drugs is more difficult to track, and data on drug use are also limited. But surveys of users in the world's biggest markets for cannabis, cocaine and opiates suggest these markets are shrinking. According to recent surveys of young people in Western Europe, North America and Oceania, cannabis use appears to be declining in these regions. Data from the world's biggest cocaine consuming region, North Amer-ica, show a decrease, and the European market appears to be stabilizing. Reports from traditional opium-using countries in South-East Asia also suggest the use of this drug may be declining there. Heroin use in Western Europe appears to be stable. In contrast, there are several indications that the global problem with amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) is worsening. Global seizures are increasing, and ATS are being made in a growing number of countries, with diversifying locations and manufacture techniques. Close to 30% of global seizures in 2007 were made in the Near and Middle East, where amphetamine use may also be significant. Methamphetamine precursors are increasingly being trafficked to Central and South America to manufacture ATS for the North American market, and local use also appears to be going up. The size of the ATS market is large, and likely still growing in East Asia. Data on ATS are particularly problematic, however, and UNODC is making a concerted effort to improve monitoring of trends in this area. Of course, all these markets are clandestine, and tracking changes requires the use of a variety of estimation tech-niques. Data are sparse, particularly in the developing world, and the level of uncertainty in many matters is high. For the first time, this year's World Drug Report is explicit about the level of uncertainty, presenting ranges rather than point estimates. This shift complicates com-parison of this year's estimates with estimates from pre-vious editions of the World Drug Report, but it is an essential step forward in presenting accurate estimates. 1 The level of uncertainty is smallest concerning the cul-tivation of coca and opium poppy, where scientific crop surveys have been made in the handful of countries that host the bulk of production. Scientific crop yield studies have also been done, but there is less certainty around the production of these drugs than the cultivation of drug crops. Since synthetic drugs and cannabis can be produced almost anywhere in the world, less is known about their production. T rafficking patterns are reflected by seizure data, a mixed indicator that reflects both the underlying flow and enforcement action against it. Data on drug use comes from surveys and treatment informa-tion, but a limited number of countries collect this information. The level of uncertainty about drug use is not uniform, either across drug types or across regions. For example, there is less certainty concerning estimates of past-year ATS and cannabis users than there is around users of opiates and cocaine; more is known about drug use in Europe and the Americas than in Africa and parts of Asia. Global trends in drug production Opiates The total ar ea under opium poppy cultivation in the major cultivating countries decreased to 189,000 hec- tares (ha) in 2008. This 16% decrease over the past year 1 At the fifty-second session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, a High-Level Segment issued a Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strat- egy to Counter the World Drug Problem, asserting that policy must be evidence-based, and that sound data are crucial. Altough drug data quality has improved over the last decade, there remain large gaps in the data. Member States adopted a resolution on improving data collection, reporting and analysis and asked UNODC to review data collection tools and reporting systems. This will include holding inter-governmental expert consultations and proposing a revised set of survey instruments for consideration by the Commission in March 2010. For more detail on this resolution, and on the importance of high quality data, please see the Special Features section.10World Drug Report 2009 was mainly due to a large decrease in Afghanistan. The level of cultivation in Myanmar and Lao People's Demo-cratic Republic was approximately the same as in 2007. Total potential opium production in the major illicit opium poppy cultivating countries has thus decreased from the previous year. In Afghanistan, opium poppy cultivation continued to be concentrated mainly in the southern provinces, while more provinces in the centre and north of the country became poppy-free. T wo thirds of the area under opium poppy cultivation in 2008 - more than 100,000 ha - were located in the southern province of Hilmand alone. The decline in cultivation occurred despite a sharp decline in opium poppy eradication, from 19,047 ha in 2007 to 5,480 ha in 2008. Myanmar reported opium poppy cultivation of 28,500 ha. As in the past, cultivation of opium poppy was heavily concentrated in the Shan State in the east of the country. In Lao People's Democratic Republic, a low level of opium poppy cultivation was found in the northern provinces. In Pakistan, about 2,000 ha of opium poppy were cultivated in the border area with Afghanistan, about the same level of cultivation reported over the past five years. Opium yields in Afghanistan remained high in 2008.

Some 60% of this is believed to be converted into morphine and heroin within the country. The amount of morphine and heroin produced in Afghanistan available for export was esti-mated at 630 mt (range 519 to 774 mt). Almost 40% of the total production was exported as opium. Cocaine Despite small increases in the Plurinational State of Bolivia (6%) and Peru (4%), the total area under coca cultivation decreased by 8% in 2008, due to a signifi-cant decrease in Colombia (18%). The total area under coca cultivation fell to 167,600 ha, close to the average level of coca cultivation between 2002 and 2008, and well below the levels reached in the 1990s. In spite of this year's decrease, Colombia remained the world's largest cultiv ator of coca bush, with 81,000 ha, followed by Peru (56,100 ha) and Bolivia (30,500 ha). Estimated global cocaine production decreased by 15% from 994 metric tons (mt) in 2007 to 845 mt in 2008. This decrease is due to a strong reduction in cocaine produc-tion in Colombia (28%), which was not offset by increases in Bolivia and Peru.Global coca bush cultivation (ha), 1994-2008 Global cocaine production (mt), 1994-2008025,00050,00075,000100,000125,000150,000175,000200,000225,000 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08Hectares Colombia Peru Bolivia 02004006008001,0001,200 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08Metric tons Colombia Peru Bolivia 12World Drug Report 2009 Cannabis Estimating the global area under cannabis is considera- bly more complicated, given that it is grown in most countries in the world and can be produced indoors or outdoors. The total estimated area for outdoor produc-tion of cannabis in 2008 ranges from 200,000 ha to 642,000 ha. The total cannabis herb production is esti-mated to range from 13,300 mt to 66,100 mt, and for cannabis resin, the estimated production range is 2,200 mt to 9,900 mt. Due to high levels of uncertainty in estimating cultivation, it is not possible to produce more precise data, as is done for opiates and cocaine. ATS Like cannabis, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) can be produced virtually anywhere at relatively low cost. Since 1990, ATS manufacture has been reported in more than 60 countries worldwide, with more being added each year. In 2007, UNODC estimated between 230 and 640 mt of amphetamines-group 2 were manufac- tured; ecstasy-group3 manufacture was estimated to be between 72 and 137 mt. Shifts in the location of production-often from developed to developing countries-illustrate the way criminal organ- izations are able to make use of more vulnerable countries. Additionally, as interest from transnational organized crime groups grows, operations of previously unimagina-ble size and sophistication continue to emerge. 2 The amphetamines-group substances includes predominately methamphetamine and amphetamine, but also includes non- specified amphetamines-group (for example, tablets sold as Captagon, methcathinone, fenetylline, methylphenidate and others), however it excludes substances purportedly of the ecstasy-group of substances 3 The ecstasy-group substances include predominately MDMA, with MDA and MDEA/MDE. However, limited forensic capacity by Member States often leads to confusion about the actual content of tablets believed to be \"ecstasy\" (MDMA).Global trends in drug trafficking Opiates I n 2007, seizures of opium and heroin grew 33% and 14%, respectively. This increase reflects the sustained high levels of opium production in Afghanistan, and may also include some of the accumulated stocks from 2005, when global opium production exceeded global con-sumption. Morphine seizures, however, declined by 41%. Overall opiate seizures remained stable in 2007 though at a higher level, having almost doubled since 1998.

This is consistent with a leveling off of production. In 2008, a significant decline in trafficking towards North America, the world's largest cocaine consumer market, was seen. This was reflected in rapidly rising prices and falling purity levels. The United Kingdom also reported falling cocaine purity levels in 2008. Cannabis Total cannabis herb seizures amounted to 5,557 mt in 2007, an increase of about 7% from the previous year. Cannabis resin seizures increased by some 29% to 1,300 mt. In addition, small quantities of cannabis oil were seized (equivalent to 418 kg) in 2007. As in 2006, the majority of cannabis herb seizures in 2007 were reported from Mexico (39% of the world total) and the USA (26%). Most of the increase in cannabis resin seizures was due to a strong increase in West and Central Europe, where seizures increased by 33% compared to 2006.

The year 2007 also saw a dramatic jump in ecstasy-group seizures (16% of all ATS seized); significant increases were noted in several large markets. T rafficking in ATS substances is most commonly intraregional, thus crossing fewer international borders, but precursor chemicals from which ATS materials are made continue to be trafficked throughout the world. They are often diverted from licit manufacture in South, East and South-East Asia. 4 To standardize, seizures reported in kilograms, litres and dose/units/ pills/tablets are transformed into kg equivalents: a dose of \"ecstasy\" was assumed to contain on average 100 mg of psychoactive ingredient (MDMA); a dose of amphetamine/methamphetamine was assumed to contain 30 mg of active ingredient; a litre was assumed to equal a kilogram.Global trends in drug consumption UNODC estimates that between 172 and 250 million persons used illicit dr ugs at least once in the past year in 2007.5 But these large figures include many casual con- sumers who may have tried drugs only once in the whole year. It is important, therefore, to also have estimates of the number of people who are heavy or \"problematic\" drug users. This group consumes most of the drugs used each year; they are very likely to be dependent upon drugs, would benefit from treatment, and many of the impacts upon public health and public order are likely to be affected by their levels of use. Estimates made by UNODC suggest that there were between 18 and 38 million problem drug users aged 15-64 years in 2007. Different drugs pose different problems for different regions. For example, in Africa and Oceania, more people presented for treatment due to problems with cannabis than any other drug (63% in Africa; 47% in Australia and New Zealand). In contrast, opiates were the primary drug treated in Asia and Europe (65% and 60%, respectively). Cocaine was more prominent in North America (34%) and South America (52%) than in other regions; and ATS were more prominent in Asia (18%), North America (18%) and Oceania (20%). Can-nabis is playing an increasingly large role in drug treat-ment in Europe, South America and Oceania since the late 1990s; and ATS use now comprises a greater share of drug treatment in North and South America than in the past. Many Member States are working to expand their responses to dependent drug use among their citi-zens; UNODC and WHO have recently begun joint programmatic work to increase drug treatment quality and capacity around the globe. 5 For further details on the methods used to make these estimates please see the Special Features and Methodology sections below.Global seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), 1990 - 2007 Source: UNODC, Annual Report Questionnaire Data/DELTA; UNODC Drug Information Network for Asia and the Pacific (DAINAP); Government reports; World Customs Organization (WCO), Customs and Drugs Report 2007 (Brussels, 2008) and previous years. 0102030405060 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007ATS seized (in metric tons equivalents) Amphetamines Group Ecstasy Group15Executive Summary Opiates The number of people who used opiates at least once in 2007 is estimated at between 15 and 21 million people at the global level. 6 More than half of the world's opiate- using population is thought to live in Asia. The highest levels of use (in terms of the proportion of the popula-tion aged 15-64 years) are found along the main drug trafficking routes close to Afghanistan. Opiates remain the world's main problem drug in terms of treatment. Europe has the largest opiates market in economic terms, and altough use appears to be stable in many Western European countries, increases have been reported in Eastern Europe. Cocaine The total number of people who used cocaine at least once in 2007 is estimated to range between 16 and 21 million. The largest market remains North America, fol-lowed by West and Central Europe and South America. Significant declines in cocaine use were reported in North America, notably from the USA, which in abso-lute numbers is still the world's largest cocaine market. Cocaine was used at least once in the past year by some 5.7 million people in the USA in 2007. Following strong increases in recent years, a number of surveys in West 6 The lack of robust data on the levels of drug use, particularly in large countries such as China, is a huge impediment to an accurate under- standing of the size of the population of drug users. When direct estimates are only available for a comparatively small proportion of a region's population, the ranges of estimated drug users in that region are obviously large. Subregional and regional estimates were only made where direct estimates were published for at least two countries covering at least 20% of the region's or subregion's population aged 15-64 years. In estimating ranges for countries with no published estimate, estimates from other countries in the subregion/region were applied. Please see the Methodology and Special Features sections below for more detail.European countries showed the first signs of a stabiliza- tion, whereas cocaine use still appears to be increasing in South America. Some African countries, notably in Western and Southern Africa, appear to show rising levels of cocaine use, although data are sparse. Cannabis The global number of people who used cannabis at least once in 2007 is estimated to be between 143 and 190 million persons. The highest levels of use remain in the established markets of North America and Western Europe, although there are signs from recent studies that the levels of use are declining in developed countries, particularly among young people. ATS UNODC estimates that between 16 and 51 million people aged 15-64 used amphetamines-group substances at least once in 2007; the number who used ecstasy- group drugs at least once is estimated at between 12 and 24 million worldwide. The width of these ranges is far greater than for cocaine and heroin, given the high level of uncertainty in relation to this drug group in terms of both use and production. Amphetamines-group users in East and South-East Asia primarily consume metham-phetamine. Tablets sold as Captagon often contain amphetamine, and are used throughout the Near and Middle East. In Europe, users primarily consume amphetamine, whereas about half of stimulant users in North America use methamphetamine.Illicit drug use at the global level Number of people who inject drugs aged 15-64 years : 11-21 million persons Number of \"problem drug users\" aged 15-64 years : 18-38 million persons Number of people who have used drugsat least once in the past year aged 15-64 years : 172-250 m illion persons Total number of people aged 15-64 years in 2007: 4,343 million persons17Executive SummaryEstimated number of illicit drug users in the past year aged 15-64 years, by region and subregion: 2007 Cannabis users in the past yearOpiate users in the past yearCocaine users in the past yearAmphetamines-group users in the past yearEcstasy users in Africa West and Central Africa Eastern Africa Southern Africa28,850,000 to 56,390,000 120,000 to 490,000 550,000 to 650,000 100,000 to 1,330,000 230,000 to 310,0001,150,000 to 3,640,000 30,000 to 50,000 750,000 to 1,320,000 estimate cannot be calculated 300,000 to 820,0001,390,000 to 4,090,000 240,000 to 510,000 estimate cannot be calculated estimate cannot be calculated 210,000 to 650,000340,000 to 1,870,000 estimate cannot be calculated estimate cannot be calculated estimate cannot be calculated 210,000 to 400,000 Americas North America Central America The Caribbean South America41,450,000 to 42,080,000 1,310,000 to 1,360,000 20,000 to 30,000 60,000 to 90,000 800,000 to 840,0009,410,000 to 9,570,000 6,870,000 to 6,870,000 120,000 to 140,000170,000 to 3,760,000 to 3,220,000 2,560,000 to 2,560,000 20,000 to 30,000 30,000 to 130,000 510,000 to 510,000 Asia East/ South- East Asia South Asia Central Asia Near and Middle East40,930,000 to 59,570,000 to 2,910,000400,000 to 2,560,000 310,000 to 990,000 estimate cannot be calculated estimate cannot be calculated estimate cannot be calculated5,780,000 to 37,040,000 4,600,000 to 20,560,000 estimate cannot be calculated estimate cannot be calculated estimate cannot be calculated3,550,000 to 13,580,000 2,250,000 to 5,950,000 estimate cannot be calculated estimate cannot be calculated estimate cannot be calculated Europe West/ Central Europe East/South- East Europe28,890,000 Oceania 2,460,000 to 2,570,000 90,000 to 90,000 340,000 to 390,000 570,000 to 590,000 810,000 to 880,000 GLOBAL to 23,510,000Special 211. Improving the quality of drug data In the last decade, there have been substantial improve- ments in the quality and availability of illicit drug data, but a number of challenges remain. The use and produc-tion of illicit drugs affect a population which is difficult to reach. In many countries, a full account of the extent of use and production of illicit drugs has not yet been made. Accurately measuring the level of drug use in a country, and monitoring trends across time, requires technical and financial resources, as well as political will. In many countries, at least one of these three compo-nents is still missing. The result is that for some regions, and for some types of drugs, particularly ATS, data are very scarce. The cultivation of opium and cocaine is concentrated in few countries. Because of remote sensing techniques, this cultivation can be monitored with considerable accuracy. Estimates of the production of opium and cocaine, however, require information on the yield of the cultivated crop, which is measured with less cer-tainty. UNODC is continuing its work to improve estimates of these yields, but the lack of access to some cultivation areas and continuous meteorological and agronomical changes, all pose considerable challenges. There is a high degree of uncertainty in estimating cul- tivation and production of cannabis, and manufacture of ATS. These two drugs can be produced virtually any-where; this makes systematic and comprehensive moni-toring difficult. Considering the data currently available, global estimates of cannabis cultivation and ATS manu-facture have been made on the basis of information on the number of users (and their estimated annual con-sumption), and seizures. Considering the level of confidence in data on the pro- duction and use of illicit drugs, it is not always possible to provide precise information on levels and trends. In order to produce reliable and comparable national, regional and global estimates, a number of assumptions and adjustments often need to be made. This year the Report explicitly addresses the question of uncertainty, and an attempt has been made to make the statistics more transparent. Country-level estimates of drug use are, for the first time in this Report, presented in ranges where the level of confidence is not sufficient to support point estimates. Additional information is also provided on the source of the data and on the adjustments made to the original data to produce the estimate. Regional and global estimates of drug use, as well as the production of ATS and cannabis, are also presented as ranges. The level of confidence in the different ranges, in terms of their 'width', obviously reflects the level of uncertainty that surrounds the figures. 1.1 Decisions at the fifty-second session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs The fifty-second session of the Commission on Narcotic D rugs, held in Vienna in March 2009, included a High- Level Segment which reviewed international drug control in the decade since UNGASS in 1998. The High-Level Segment adopted a Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem. Throughout the session, there was much discussion about the importance of evidence as a basis for drug policy. The Political Declaration stated specifically that policy must be evidence-based, and that sound data are crucial for planning and evaluating interventions. States Members of the United Nations also debated the challenges of drug data collection. Over the past decade, there have been considerable improvements in many countries in the collection and analysis of drug data on both supply and demand. In regions where concerted efforts have been made to collect, synthesize and reflect upon drug data (for example, North America, Oceania, Central and Western Europe, Latin America and to some extent East and South-East Asia), the capacity to evaluate trends has improved. In many countries, how- ever, progress in developing drug information systems has been limited. There are also comparatively few coun-tries that conduct studies to estimate the prevalence of illicit drug use. For example, only 65 countries have an estimate in the past ten years of the prevalence of ATS use in the general population or among school/universi-ty-aged young people. UNODC has made tentative estimates from other data in 31 countries. The remain-ing Member States, including some very populous coun-tries such as China and India, have no direct estimates of ATS use. This obviously reduces the capacity to make evidence-based decisions about international drug policy.Special features22World Drug Report 2009 Acknowledging such gaps, Member States adopted a resolution that focused on improving data collection, reporting and analysis. UNODC was asked to review and improve data collection tools and reporting systems in order to get a more accurate picture of the world drug situation. This will include holding intergovernmental expert consultations to review current data collection tools, and proposing a revised set of survey instruments for consideration by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in March 2010. The aim is to develop simpler, more integrated data col- lection processes, and to increase the capacity of coun-tries to collect and report information on their drug situation. UNODC invites Member States to join in this effort to improve data collection at the national level, and reporting at the global level. 1.2 Making national estimates of the number of drug users It is challenging to measure accurately how many people use dr ugs in a given country. T wo broad approaches are \"direct\" survey approaches and \"indirect\" estimation approaches. No one method is perfect for all drugs or across all countries. \"Direct\" methods of estimating drug use prevalence. General population or \"household\" surveys. A common way to assess drug use is to conduct surveys of the general population, where people are asked if they have used drugs at least once in the past month, the past year or in their lifetime (generally referred to as 'monthly', 'annual' and 'lifetime' prevalence). The benefits of this approach include the relatively straightforward calculation of prevalence estimates. The approach would generate accurate estimates if (1) a representative population sample was obtained, (2) people honestly disclosed their drug use, and (3) drug users were spread equitably around the country. The limitations of this approach include the typical exclusion of marginalised groups, and the fact that drug use is often geographically concentrated. People may also feel uncomfortable disclosing drug use. These limi-tations will lead to underestimates of the actual levels of drug use. School surveys. These take the same approach as general population surveys, whereby school-attending children/ young people (typically in high school) are asked about their drug use. The benefits and limitations of this approach are simi- lar to those of the general population surveys, with the additional limitation that young people who have left school are not included. This may be a large proportion in some countries, and it is significant because young people who leave school early are more likely to use drugs than those who remain in school. \"Indirect\" methods of estimating drug use prevalence. These estimates do not rely on \"direct\" measurements, but use different sources of data to estimate the total population of drug users. One common approach is termed multiplier methods. This involves two pieces of data: one source (for example, the number of people who receive drug treatment in a year) is considered with another (for example, the proportion of a sample of drug users who received treatment) and these two are multiplied to estimate the drug-using population. One benefit of this approach is that no expensive and technically challenging field survey is required and it does not require people to admit to drug use. It is prefer-able, however, to make multiple indirect estimates of drug use to overcome statistical limitations in any one approach of this kind. 1.3 Making regional and global estimates of the number of drug users Making estimates of the population who uses illicit dr ugs presents many challenges. The first challenge is that many countries have not done any studies to esti-mate how many people use drugs. In addition to this, although a variety of methods of estimating the preva-lence of illicit drug use may be used, no one method is free of methodological or other biases, which means that country level estimates can never be 100% accurate. To better reflect the resulting uncertainty, a conscious decision was made to present ranges rather than point estimates in this year's Report. Global and regional esti- mates of the number of people who have used illicit drugs at least once in the past year, as well as estimates of \"problem\" drug users, are therefore shown as ranges. This shift is an essential step forward in getting more accurate estimates. It does mean, however, that the esti-mates for this year should not be compared to those from previous editions of the World Drug Report. As documented in the following sections of the Report, there is less certainty for ATS and cannabis use estimates than there is for opiate and cocaine use. The uncertainty for ATS is particularly marked in Asia, which contains a significant proportion of the world's population. In contrast, in regions such as North America and Western Europe, more is known about drug use levels, and there are smaller ranges in the estimated number of users. Summary of new methods The lack of robust data on the levels of drug use, par- ticularly in large countries such as China, are huge impediments to an accurate understanding of the size of the population of drug users. Because of these gaps, 23Special Features absolute numbers are not provided for regions where estimates of drug use prevalence are not available for every country. Rather, ranges have been presented, which reflect the uncertainty that exists when data are being either extrapolated or imputed. Larger ranges exist for those regions where there is less certainty about the likely level of drug use - in other words, those regions for which direct estimates are avail-able for a comparatively smaller proportion of the region's population. In contrast, those regions with esti-mates from most countries have much more precise estimates. Subregional and regional estimates were only made where direct estimates were published for at least two countries covering at least 20% of the region's or subre-gion's population aged 15-64 years. In estimating ranges for countries with no published estimate, estimates from other countries in the subre-gion/region were applied. This means that wider ranges appear in subregions/regions where there is variance in the levels of drug use across the published country-level estimates. Regions with fewer data - and therefore less certainty - also typically have greater ranges. 2. Trends in drug use among young people: what do we know? Analysing drug use among young people matters for several key reasons. First, most people start to use drugs during their youth and it is among young people that drug prevention activities are best targeted. Secondly, trends in the use of illicit drugs among young people may indicate shifts in drug markets, since young people usually react to changes in drug availability or social perceptions about drug use more quickly than older people; such use is likely to be occasional drug use. Thirdly, starting drug use at an early age has been linked to negative health and social outcomes in later years. A review of the most recent data reported to UNODC on drug use among young people across the world found quite marked variation across regions. Among the high-est levels across all drug types were reported in North America, Oceania and Western Europe, although there are signs of a decreasing trend in some of the major drugs. Recent data suggest decreases in the level of can-nabis use in developed countries. Decreases have also been recorded in cocaine use among young people in North America and some European countries although increases are still visible in many other European coun-tries. There are large data gaps in regions across Asia and Africa, so less is known about drug use among young people there. Where data is available it suggests that levels of use among young people in developing coun-tries remain lower than the ones in developed countries. However the trend for cannabis and cocaine is upwards in the few countries where statistics are available for more than one year. A similar trend can be observed for ecstasy which is still gaining popularity among students in some developing countries, while showing decreasing or stabilizing trends in the most developed countries. The data presented suggests that drug use patterns are changing among young people. In the United States, cannabis and cocaine, long associated with alternatives to the mainstream, now appear to be less attractive. The same behaviour is gradually spreading in Europe, but has not yet reached Eastern Europe and developing countries where there are still signs of increasing can-nabis and cocaine use. The overall decline in illicit drug use among young people in the United States and in some European coun-tries is an encouraging sign. However, there are a number of published reports, particularly in the US indicating that the abuse of prescription drugs is on the rise among young people 10. This needs more research, but these reports suggest that young people may be shifting from illicit drugs to pharmaceutical drugs, which may be more easily accessible and socially acceptable. Data on young people can help to better understand the different use of illicit drugs among male and female populations. In general girls are less likely to use drugs than boys, although the gender disparities are less pro-nounced than among the adult population. Data for European countries in 2007 show that the proportion of students (aged 15-16 years) who used cannabis in the previous month has large variations between male and female. Gender disparities measured in terms of male to female drug use ratios range from 1.1 in Spain (almost parity) to 3 in Poland. Despite the existence of large dif-ferences between boys and girls, there are indications that the gender gap may be narrowing in a few countries and for some types of drugs. 11 Most of the data on the use of illicit drugs among young people has been collected through school surveys. These surveys are important tools and can be implemented in a relatively cost-effective environment since large num-bers of young people are easily accessible and usually ready to participate in the survey. They have also been found to be accurate, if properly implemented. How-ever, they do not capture the situation among out-of-school youth, which may be a significant proportion of youth in less developed countries. 10 Arria AM, Caldeira KM, O'Grady KE, Vincent KB, Johnson EP , Wish Nonmedical use of National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), NIDA Community Drug Alert Bulletin - Prescription Drugs, NIDA website: http://www.nida.nih.gov/PrescripAlert/. 11 EMCDDA, Annual Report 2006, selected issues: Gender differences in prevalence and patterns of drug use by type of substance, 2006. 25Special Features cannabis among students in 2007 saw an increase or a stabilization when compared with 2003.16 Although the decline in cannabis use among US students was stronger than in Europe, cannabis use continues to be more widespread among US students. 16 Similar trends have been observed in the \"Health Behavior in School Aged Children\"(HBSC) studies conducted in Europe and in North America in 2001/02 and in 2005/06 under the auspices of the WHO. Cannabis use declined among both male and female students (on average by around 3 percentage points) over the 2003-2007 period. In 2007 male pupils still have, on average, higher prevalence rates of cannabis use (22% in 2007) than female students (16%). In all coun-tries, except Monaco and Slovenia, male cannabis use was higher than female cannabis use among 15-16 year old students.

In 2008, United States students (8-12th grades) had an annual prevalence rate of ecstasy use of 3% while Canadian students in Ontario (7-12th grades) had a rate of 3.5%. In South America, there was a general increase in the use of ecstasy among high-school students. In Argentina the annual prevalence rate increased from 0.2% to 2.2% and in Chile from 1.1% to 1.5%. An increase was also seen in Colombia between 2001 and 2004/5 where the annual prevalence among urban secondary students doubled from 1.6% to 3%. Between 1995 and 2007, European students (age 15-16) reported overall increased lifetime use of ecstasy-group substances. However, there are diverging trends by sub- region. Students in countries of West and Central Europe 20 reported relatively stable rates since 2003 while students from Eastern Europe21 reported increasing 20 Students of West and Central Europe include: Austria, Belgium (Flanders), Cyprus, Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Germany (6 states), Greece, Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. 21 Students of Eastern Europe include: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech lifetime prevalence during the same period. 22 No recent data is available in Oceania for ATS use from school surveys. However, the latest data showed a down-ward trend among students 12-17 years old, from life Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia (Moscow), Slovak Republic, Slovenia, and the Ukraine. 22 Council of Europe, The 2007 ESPAD Report, Substance Use Among Students in 35 European countries, Stockholm.

Police-recorded drug offences Crime recorded by law enforcement agencies may be directly or indirectly related to drugs. On the one hand, a proportion of crimes such as robbery, theft, assault or burglary are driven by underlying factors such as drug use. From a statistical point of view, the extent to which drug use is responsible for such crimes is not easily cap - tured by and rarely forms part of official reports. On the other hand, law enforcement agencies in most countries produce and retain information on drug offences, which can be broken into two broad categories: drug-related crime/possession/abuse which corresponds more closely to personal use offences and drug trafficking (sale). Many countries report this data at the international and regional level, including through UNODC data collection mech - anisms. 23 These data are not usually presented in their raw form because they can be confusing. The number of drug offences recorded is a product of both the extent of drug activity and the extent of drug enforcement activi - ties. As a result, it is possible that countries with rela - tively minor drug problems can have drug offence rates higher than those with very severe ones, making com - parison between countries a particular challenge. This problem can be partly overcome by limiting the analysis to trends within countries. For those countries reporting this information to UNODC, a majority show an increase in the number of drug crimes in recent years. Some 62% of countries showed an increase in possession offences 24 and 56% of countries showed an increase in drug trafficking offences.25 23 The primary instrument used by UNODC for collection of crime and criminal justice data is the United Nations Survey of Crime T rends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (the \"UN-CTS\"). Data from the UN-CTS may be accessed at: http://www.unodc. org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/United-Nations-Surveys-on-Crime-T rends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.htm l. Part III of the ARQ requests data on the number of persons arrested/total recorded offences for possession/abuse of drugs and for trafficking of drugs. 24 See 1988 Convention against Illicit T raffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, Article 3(2). Cross-national analysis of trends must be carried out with a very high degree of caution. This is due not least to differences in national definitions of crime involving drugs. 'Personal use' of drugs may be defined in national law on the basis of the amount of drug substance involved, and/or with respect to the nature of the act, such as cultivation, production, manufacture, preparation, offering for sale, distribution, or sale. Drug amount thresholds in criminal law can also vary between countries, as can the nature and type of narcotic drug or psychotropic substance or pre - cursor. Legal regimes sometimes create administrative drug offences, which may or may not be recorded and reported together with criminal offences. Finally, in addition to varying legal definitions, differences in capacity, criteria and approaches to case recording, as well as the effect of law enforcement resources and priorities, can have a significant impact on numbers recorded and reported. 25 The UN-CTS defines 'drug trafficking' as meaning drug offences, which are not in connection with personal use.Still, it is difficult to say whether this trend is the result of a growing problem or increased enforcement activity. Of those countries that showed an increase in drug traf - ficking offences, almost 70% showed an increase in possession offences. This strong association suggests these increases may be driven by increased drug law enforcement, rather than changes in the drug situation itself. In some regions, increases in recorded drug-traf - ficking offences are in line with increases in total drug seizures, including East Asia, South America, Central America and the Caribbean and East Europe. In West and Central Europe, however, the increase in drug pos - session/use does correspond to an increase in the per-ceived severity of the drug problem, as reflected in public surveys. 27 26 Where possible, data for the years 2005 and 2007 is compared. Where data for either of these years was not available, the closest available year is used instead. 27 Criminal Victimisation in International Perspective: Key findings from the 2004-2005 International Crime Victims Survey and European Crime and Safety Survey .

The ratio of drug possession offences to drug trafficking offences gives a good indication of the enforcement approach taken in any given country. For countries in East Asia, Central America and the Caribbean, North America, and West and Central Europe, law enforcement agencies record above four times as many possession offences as they do trafficking offences. 28 Countries in these subregions, in particular, show a significant number of offences that fall within the broad 'less serious' category, relative to the number of more serious offences. Dutch Ministry of Justice (WODC) 2007. p. 97 28 See Fig. 15 In contrast, subregional ratios for South-East Europe, East Europe and Central Asia and T ranscaucasia show only small differences in the number of offences recorded in each category. Central Asia and Transcaucasia, in particular, shows more recorded offences in the more serious category of drug trafficking than in the less seri - ous category of drug-related crime/possession/abuse. The underlying reasons for this may include a relatively lower estimated prevalence of drug use, particularly can - nabis, cocaine, and amphetamines than for other subre - gions, combined with the existence of key drug transit routes.29 In addition, the effect of different national drug policies, including the national legal definition of 'drug trafficking' may have a very significant effect on the relative distribution of serious and less-serious recorded offences. 29 Crime and its impact on the Balkans and affected countries .

TRENDS IN THE WORLD DRUG MARKETS1.1 Opium / heroin market 33 1.1.1 Summary trend overview Opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, the source country for most of the world's opium, decreased by 19% in 2008. As a result, the total area under cultiva-tion in the three major cultivating countries thus decreased to 189,000 hectares, in spite of small increases in Myanmar and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. Total potential opium production also decreased to a total of some 8,000 metric tons; a high level, in spite of the decrease. Overall opiate seizures remained stable - at a high level - in 2007, due to a large decrease in morphine seizures. Opium and heroin seizures increased by 33% and 14%, respectively. Although opiate trafficking is global, more than two thirds of seizures were reported by South-West Asian countries in 2007. Europe accounted for the second largest share of seizures, mainly from south-eastern countries. Opiates remain the world's main problem drug in terms of treatment, and a majority of the world's opiate users live in Asia. The highest levels of use (in terms of the proportion of the population aged 15-64 years) are found along the main drug trafficking routes close to Afghanistan. UNODC estimates that the number of people who used opiates at least once in 2007 was between 15 and 21 million people worldwide. 1 1 The lack of robust data on the levels of drug use, particularly in large countries such as China and India, is a huge impediment to an accurate understanding of the size of the population of drug users. Please see the Methodology and Special Features sections below for more detail.1.1.2 Production Cultivation The area under opium poppy cultivation in major culti- vating countries decreased by 16% over the past year, mainly due to a large decrease in Afghanistan. Opium poppy cultivation did not change much in Myanmar and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. Overall, the level of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, Myan-mar and Lao PDR was about the same as in 2006. In Afghanistan, opium poppy cultivation continued to be concentrated mainly in the southern provinces, while more provinces in the centre and north of the country became poppy-free. T wo thirds of the area under opium poppy cultivation in 2008 - more than 100,000 ha - were located in the southern province of Hilmand alone. The decline in cultivation happened in spite of less opium poppy eradication in 2008 (5,480 ha) than in 2007 (19,047 ha). In 2008, opium poppy cultivation continued to be associated with insecurity. Almost the entire opium poppy-cultivating area was located in regions characterized by high levels of insecurity. In Pakistan, opium poppy continued to be cultivated in the border area with Afghanistan at about the same rela- tively low level of about 2,000 ha reported over the past 5 years. In Myanmar, opium poppy cultivation remained below levels reached in 2004 and before. As in the past, cultiva-tion of opium poppy was heavily concentrated in the Shan State in eastern Myanmar. In Lao PDR, a low level of opium poppy cultivation was found in the northern provinces. 34World Drug Report 2009 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 SOUTH-WEST 168 702 890 820 Mexico (h)5,795 5,050 5,100 4,000 5,500 3,600 1,900 4,400 2,700 4,800 (c)128 112 24 24 26 9 8 5 5 52 40 36 39 43 48 128 140 147 124 124 167 134 112 120 43 14 20 9 10 Myanmar (e)1,583 1,664 1,760 1,676 1,303 895 1,087 312 315 460 410 Thailand (f)3 2 5 4 8 8 6 6 9 Viet Nam (f)15 9 9 2 335 469 420 LATIN AMERICA Colombia (g)205 71 67 90 100 88 88 80 52 50 49 24 13 14 10 Mexico (h)60 53 54 46 60 43 21 91 58 101 73 71 108 149 n.a.

In 2006, the Government of Mexico reported a gross opium poppy cultivation of 19,147 hectares and estimated potential gross opium production at 211 mt. These gross figures are not directly comparable to the net figures presented in this table. (i) Reports from different sources indicate that illicit opium poppy cultivation also exists in other countries and regions, including the Baltic countries, Balkan countries, Egypt, India, Guatemala, Iraq, Lebanon, Nepal, Peru, Russian Federation and other C.I.S. countries, Thailand, Ukraine, Viet Nam, as well as in Central Asia and Caucasus region. The cultivation level in these countries and regions is thought to be low.

Trends in the world drug markets Opium / heroin market Reports on eradication of opium poppy from Bangla- desh, India, Nepal, Thailand and Viet Nam indicated the existence of cultivation in these countries. However, the extent of illicit opium poppy cultivation in these countries is not known, with the exception of Thailand, which reported the detection of 288 ha of opium poppy, most of which was subsequently eradicated. In the Americas, opium poppy cultivation was reported from Colombia and Mexico, and reports on eradication in Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru and the Bolivarian Repub-lic of Venezuela over the past years point to the existence of opium poppy cultivation in these countries as well. Reports from different sources indicate that opium poppy cultivation also exists in other countries and regions, includ-ing the Baltic countries, Balkan countries, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Russian Federation, Ukraine, and countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus region. The cultivation levels in these countries and regions are thought to be low. Production The potential opium production in the major opium poppy cultivating countries decreased slightly but is still high compared to previous years. Opium yields in Afghanistan remained high in 2008. The potential opium production was estimated at 7,700 mt (range 6,330-9,308 mt). Some 60% is believed to be converted into morphine and heroin within the country. The amount of morphine and heroin produced in Afghanistan available for export was estimated at 630 mt (range 519-774 mt). Almost 40% of the total produc-tion was exported as opium.Opium poppy cultivation in major cultivating countries (ha), 1994-2008 Fig. 1: 050,000100,000150,000200,000250,000300,000 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08Hectares Afghanistan Myanmar Lao PDR Opium production in major cultivating countries (mt), 1994-2008 Fig. 2: 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,000 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08Metric tons Afghanistan Myanmar Lao PDR36World Drug Report 2009 Opium production in Myanmar was estimated at 410 mt, which is much lower than in the years before 2004. Afghanistan remained the world's largest opium pro - ducer, followed by Myanmar. Prices Farm-gate prices in Afghanistan and Myanmar differ considerably both in trend and level. In 2004, farmers in both countries received about US$ 150/kg for one kilogram of dry opium. Since then, farm-gate prices in Afghanistan have roughly halved, whereas they doubled in Myanmar. A similar diverging trend can be observed in trader prices in opium production areas, which have been available since 1999. A comparison of average opium production levels in Afghanistan and Myanmar supports the assumption that local opium production levels had a strong influence on these prices. In Afghanistan, annual opium production before the Taliban opium ban in 2001 was at about 3,000 mt on average (1994-2000). Since 2002, opium production has been much higher in every single year, and amounted to an average of some 5,300 mt. Reflect - ing these high supply levels, Afghan opium prices have been on the decrease since 2003. In Myanmar, on the other hand, average annual opium production fell from about 1,400 mt (1994-2001) to an annual average of just 500 mt (2002-2008). As a consequence, opium prices in Myanmar increased considerably.

Trends in the world drug markets Opium / heroin market explanatory power for prices in production areas. How - ever, it should be noted that illicit markets do not neces - sarily show the same behaviour as licit markets. Relatively high opium prices of over US$ 1,000/kg in neighbouring Lao PDR and Thailand, where very little opium is produced, also indicate that the demand for opium is high compared to the amount available on the market in the region. Compared to Asia, farm-gate prices for opium latex in Colombia were high, at US$ 318/kg in 2008. This would correspond to more than US$ 600/kg in dry opium equivalents. It should be noted that in the countries discussed, opium is traded in the respective local curren - cies, and that prices were not adjusted for inflation. Laboratories In 2007, the detection of 638 opiates-producing clan - destine laboratories was reported to UNODC. In 2006, originally, a similar number of laboratories were reported by Governments (619), which was later updated to 873 based on additional reports received. Ukraine and Moldova, which reported high numbers of laboratories destroyed in 2006, did not report the detection of labo - ratories in 2007. The Russian Federation reported the highest total number of opiate-processing laboratories (547) and, included in this number, also the highest number of heroin laboratories (187) of all countries reporting. 2 However, the amount of heroin seized at the laboratory sites does not indicate that these were large-scale process - ing facilities. Opiate processing laboratories were also detected in Afghanistan (57 heroin-processing), where most of the world's illicit opium is produced, Australia (9 heroin-processing), China (9 heroin-processing), Myanmar (8 heroin-processing), Mexico (4 heroin- processing), Colombia (2 heroin-processing), Germany (1 fentanyl-processing) and India (1 heroin-processing laboratory). Laboratories in Moldova, the Russian Federation and Ukraine tend to produce acetylated opium from locally cultivated poppy straw. Indeed, most of the laboratories detected in the Russian Federation (347) were produc - ing acetylated opium. The 2007 figures and the infor - mation received in connection to these figures indicate that most morphine and heroin processing takes place close the source, that is, in or close to the countries were opium poppy is cultivated, or, in the case of Germany and Australia, where opiates may be diverted from legal channels. 2 The number of detected heroin laboratories in the Russian Federa - tion indicated in the text (187) relates to locations where different types of drugs were processed on a small scale and of low quality (so-called ''kitchen production\"). Russia did not report the detection of significant heroin-processing laboratories in 2007.Precursors Illicit morphine and heroin production in Afghanistan requires large quantities of precursor chemicals such as acetic anhydride, a substance which is essential in the refinement of morphine to heroin. All acetic anhydride has to be imported as there are no known production facilities and no reported legitimate use of the chemical in the country. Following increased cooperation between countries in the region within the framework of the Paris Pact Initiative, more precursor seizures were reported from Afghanistan and neighbouring countries as well as from the countries of origin. During operation TARCET (Targeted Anti-trafficking Regional Commu - nication, Expertise and T raining) and subsequent back-tracking investigations, almost 20 mt of acetic anhydride and more than 27 mt of other precursor chemicals were seized in Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kyr - gyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in 2008. 3 In Afghanistan, an additional 14,000 l of acetic anhy - dride plus several other substances typically used for heroin production were seized on other occasions. Sev - eral cases of attempted diversion of precursor shipments for illicit purposes were detected and prevented and significant precursor seizures were made in countries of origin in Europe and Asia as well as in countries along the heroin trafficking routes. The seizures and related investigations confirmed the assumption that large-scale trafficking of morphine and heroin precursor to Afghan - istan and neighbouring countries occurs. It is not known to what extent uncontrolled chemicals are brought into the region to produce controlled substances such as acetic anhydride locally to avoid increased international control of precursor shipments. There are indications that precursors have become a major cost factor for clandestine laboratories producing heroin in Afghanistan. 3 International Narcotics Control Board, E/INCB/2008/438World Drug Report 2009 Annual opium poppy cultivation and opium production in main producing countries, Fig. 5: 1994-2008 AFGHANISTAN - OPIUM POPPY CULTIVATION (ha), 1994-2008 AFGHANISTAN - OPIUM PRODUCTION (mt), 1994-2008 MYANMAR - OPIUM POPPY CULTIVATION (ha), 1994-2008 MYANMAR - OPIUM PRODUCTION (mt), 1994-2008 LAO PDR - OPIUM POPPY CULTIVATION (ha), 1994-2008 LAO PDR - OPIUM PRODUCTION (mt), 1994-2008025,00050,00075,000100,000125,000150,000175,000200,000 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 025,00050,00075,000100,000125,000150,000175,000200,000 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 025,00050,00075,000100,000125,000150,000175,000200,000 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 0801,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,000 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,000 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 9 20 14 43 10 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,000 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08Signicant opium poppy eradication reported (ha), 1995-2008 Table 2: * Although eradication took place in 2004, it was not officially reported to UNODC. 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Afghanistan 400 121 21,430 Egypt 15 34 65 45 50 98 Guatemala 489 720 449 536 India 29 96 248 153 18 219 494 167 12 247 7,753 595 Lao PDR 4,134 3,556 2,575 1,518 779 575 5,200 391 354 614 0 Peru 4 18 26 155 14 57 98 92 88 88 16 Thailand 580 886 1,053 716 808 757 832 507 767 122 110 153 220 285 Venezuela 148 51 266 148 137 215 39 0 0 87 154 0 0 0 Viet Nam 477 1,142 340 439 426 125 100 32 38 9940World Drug Report 2009 Estimating opium cultivation and production Illicit crop cultivation is often associated with insecurity, insurgency and lack of alternative livelihood options. Knowing where poppy is cultivated and how much opium and heroin can be produced is important for Governments and the international community to understand and tackle the issue. In Afghanistan, Myanmar and the Lao People's Demo- cratic Republic, UNODC supports the efforts of the respective Governments to estimate the annual area under opium poppy cultivation. In Afghanistan and Myanmar, this is mainly done by using high-resolution satellite images. Opium poppy plants, like other crops, reflect sunlight in a specific way. This is not because of its colourful flower, but rather, a certain shade of green, which is different from other crops. This enables an image analyst to identify poppy. Other characteristics, such as the texture, shape or size of the field, are also used. Important information comes from surveyors on the ground who map small portions of the area covered by the image and identify which crop is grown where. The growth stages of all crops and their exact locations are documented with photos and GPS devices. This infor- mation serves as an interpretation template for the image. If there is still uncertainty, a second image taken after the opium harvest can help. Farmers in Afghani-stan, for example, plough poppy fields after the harvest, whereas they leave wheat fields for the cattle to graze on the stubble. The freshly ploughed poppy fields show clearly on the images with a darker tone. Hundreds of satellite images are taken every year over different parts of the countries. This sample of images can be compared to a poll. If well designed, a poll ena-bles analysts to understand the preferences of the popu-lation as a whole, although only a sample of the population is interviewed. Similarly, a sample of satellite images representing the total agricultural area in the country can be used to calculate the area under opium poppy cultivation, based on the results of the image analysis. To be able to estimate opium production, surveyors visit fields in several hundred villages and measure the number of poppy capsules as well as their size in sample plots. Using a scientific formula, the measured poppy capsule volume indicate how much opium gum each plant can potentially yield. Thus, the opium yield per hectare can be estimated. Because of irrigation and climate, the yield can differ considerably from year to year and from region to region. Opium yield and the total poppy cultivation area form the basis for estimating annual opium production. The bulk of the opium undergoes a transformation process to morphine and finally heroin. This is done by so-called \"chemists\" or \"cooks\" who know which precursor chem-icals are necessary and in which quantities. Information on the efficiency of this transformation process comes mainly from law enforcement agencies which obtain detailed information from apprehended traffickers. With this information it is possible to estimate potential heroin production in a country. 1.1.3 Trafficking1. Trends in the world drug markets Opium / heroin market 41Opiate trafficking is global, but seizures are stabilizing In 2007, global seizures of opiates amounted to 143 mt (expressed in heroin equivalents1), about the same as in 2006 (142 mt). Compared to 1998, global opiate sei-zures almost doubled (93% increase). Out of 143 countries that reported seizures to UNODC for 2007, 109 reported seizures of opiates. T rafficking in heroin is in geographical terms more widespread than trafficking in opium or morphine, as 107 countries reported seizures of heroin (75% of reporting countries), whereas 57 reported opium seizures and 36 morphine. Opium seizures continue to rise in and around Afghanistan while morphine seizures decline Although global opiate seizures remained stable between 2006 and 2007, there were significant market shifts among opium, heroin and morphine. Global opium sei-zures increased by 33% in 2007, in line with the rise in opium production reported in 2007 (34%). Some of the largest increases in opium seizures in 2007 were reported in and around Afghanistan (opium seizures in Tajikistan increased by 83%; Pakistan 71%; the Islamic Republic of Iran 37%; Afghanistan 28%). Most of the opium was seized in Iran (427 mt or 84% of the global total), fol-lowed by Afghanistan (52 mt) and Pakistan (6 mt). In contrast, morphine seizures fell by 41% in 2007, mainly due to lower seizures reported by Pakistan (66% decrease) and the Islamic Republic of Iran (9% decrease). The world's largest morphine seizures continued to be reported by Pakistan (11 mt or 40% of the global total), Iran (10 mt) and Afghanistan (5 mt). Heroin seizures increase, but at a lower rate than opium production Heroin seizures rose by 14% between 2006 and 2007, which is a smaller increase than the one observed in opium production in 2007 (34%). Some of the largest increases in heroin seizures were reported by countries along the main trafficking routes from Afghanistan to Europe. 2 1 For the purposes of this calculation it is assumed that 10 kg of opium are equivalent to 1 kg of morphine or 1 kg of heroin. 2 Afghanistan (+24%), Islamic Republic of Iran (+49%), T urkey The largest heroin seizures in 2007 were reported by the Islamic Republic of Iran (16 mt or 25% of the world total), T urkey (13 mt) and Afghanistan (5 mt). Processing of opium into heroin appears to be less frequent Between 2003 and 2007, combined heroin and mor- phine seizures remained basically stable. Combined with the data on sharp increases in opium seizures, this sug-gests that transformation of opium into morphine and heroin is becoming more difficult and less frequent 3 in Afghanistan. It also suggests that the large increases in opium production in 2006/07 did not result in large increases in morphine and heroin flows out of Afghani-stan. (+28%), Bulgaria (+66%), Italy (+43%), Germany (+22%), Belgium (+212%) as well as, along the Northern Route, Kyrgyzstan (65%), T urkmenistan (+62%) and the Russian Federation (+20%) 3 Increases in the price of precursors in Afghanistan is an indication of the lack of supply of precursors which could make the production of heroin and morphine more difficult.

The rate started to decline after 2005, reaching 19% in 2007. Following the 2006 and 2007 increases in opium production which exceeded global demand, there are indications that a portion of opiates has been stockpiled. Prices continue to fall and trafficking out of Afghanistan did not grow as fast as opium production. The falling levels of global opium production in 2008 may not translate into reduced trafficking flows in the near future as production shortfalls could be compen - sated by reducing the size of existing stocks. The bulk of seizures take place close to opium pro - duction centers Despite of the large number of countries affected by trafficking in opiates, there are clear concentrations of trafficking flows and seizures. The most important subregion for opiate seizures in 2007 continued to be South-West Asia, accounting for 70% of global opiate seizures. The large seizures in this region clearly reflect the dominant position of Afghani - stan as the world's largest opium producer. Europe accounted for almost 19% of global opiate sei - zures. Most opiate seizures there were made in South- East Europe (11% of the total), notably by T urkey. Most of the opiates that reach Western Europe are trafficked from Afghanistan through Turkey and the Islamic Republic of Iran. 4 Interception rate is defined as the total seizures of opiates of a given year over the global illicit opiate production in the same year. Opiate seizures made in East and South-East Asia, and Oceania, accounted for 5% of the global total in 2007. Seizures in Africa account for only 0.2% of the world total. T raditionally, Africa has been supplied from South- West Asia (typically via Pakistan or India) and South-East Asia (typically via Thailand), though lately the opiates supply is almost exclusively from South-West Asia. The Americas - which seem to be largely 'self-sufficient' in terms of opiate production and consumption - accounted for 3% of global opiate seizures. Most of the seizures in this region were made in the USA, the region's main opiate-consuming country. Seizures rising in regions affected by Afghan opiates The proportion of seizures related to Afghan opium production 5 increased from 77% of the world total in 2002 to 92% in 2007, reflecting the strong increases in Afghan opium production between 2002 and 2007. Opiate seizures in the countries of South-West Asia rose by 177% over the same period, and in Europe by 19%. In contrast, opiate seizures in the countries of Central Asia declined by 19%. Seizures declined in regions typically supplied by South-East Asian opiates The proportion of opiate seizures in the countries mainly supplied by opiates produced in Myanmar and the Lao People's Democratic Republic 6 fell from 16% of the world total in 2002 to 5% in 2007. Reported seizures from countries in East and South-East Asia declined by 43% over the 2002-07 period. Opiate seizures reported by countries in Oceania fell by 86% over this period. 5 Seizures made by countries in South-West Asia, Central Asia, South Asia and Europe. 6 Countries in South-East Asia and Oceania.Calculated global interception rate of Fig. 7: opiates* * seizures of opiates in a given year (in heroin equivalents) shown as a proportion of global illicit opiate production (in heroin equivalents) Source: UNODC, 2008 World Drug Report and UNODC, ARQ data. 9%15%17%22%26% 23% 19% 0%10%20%30% total seizures Afghanistan/SWA/CA/Europe Myanmar/SEA/Oceania North America AfricaDistribution of opiate seizures Fig. 8: (expressed in heroin equivalents*), 2002-2007 * applying a conversion ratio of 10 kg of opium equivalent to 1 kg of morphine and 1 kg of heroin Source: UNODC, ARQ data / DELTA.431. Trends in the world drug markets Opium / heroin market Seizures declined in North America, but they are increasing again The proportion of opiate seizures made in the Americas fell from 6% of the world total in 2002 to 3% in 2007. This mainly reflected falling opiate seizures in South America (-52% over the 2002-07 period), which is in line with reports of falling levels of opium production in Colombia. Opiate seizures reported from North Amer-ica started rising again in 2007, after a downward trend in 2006 in Mexico and the USA. The vast majority of opiates found in the USA (96%) originate in Mexico and Colombia. Trafficking in opiates continues to be concentrated along three major routes ... Three distinct production centres for opiates still supply three distinct markets. The main trafficking flows con- tinue to be: from Afghanistan to neighbouring countries, s the Middle East, Africa and Europe; fr om Myanmar/Laos to neighbouring s countries of South-East Asia, (notably China) and to the O ceania region (mainly Australia); from Latin America (Mexico, Colombia, s Guatemala and Peru) to North America (notably USA) ...although alternative routes are emerging from South-West Asia to South-East Asia and the Oceania region A number of reports show that trafficking activities have started to diversify from established market connections. Though the bulk of opiates found on the Chinese market is still from Myanmar, there have been reports of ship- ments of heroin from Afghanistan via Pakistan to Chi-na. 7 The heroin is being shipped either directly (mainly by air) from Pakistan to various Chinese destinations as well as indirectly, via Dubai (United Arab Emirates). 8 The amounts involved are still modest, but may repre-sent emerging trafficking patterns. 9 In 2007, Pakistan reported an additional new route to Malaysia, both direct and via Dubai. Until recently, heroin in Malaysia originated exclusively in Myanmar. This new route shows that Afghan opiates may now reach other destinations since Malaysia has been mentioned among the key embarkation points for heroin shipments into Australia. 10 ... and from South-West Asia to North America New trafficking routes from South-West Asia to North America are emerging. Canada reported that 98% of the heroin found on their market in 2007 originated in South-West Asia. The heroin was mainly trafficked by air via India and Pakistan into Canada. 11 Organized crime groups in Ontario and British Columbia are involved in heroin imports. 12 7 UNODC, ARQ data for 2007 8 UNODC, ARQ data for 2007. 9 Data collected on individual drug seizures show from 2004 to 2006 a marked upward trend of heroin seizures made in Pakistan with final destinations in China. This upward trend did not continue in 2007 and in 2008. 10 Australian Crime Commission, Illicit Drug Data Report 2006-07, revised edition, Canberra, March 2009. 11 UNODC, ARQ data for 2007. 12 Criminal Intelligence Service Canada (CISC), Report on Organized Crime, Ottawa, Ontario 2008.Global opiate seizures, expressed in heroin equivalents*, regional breakdown, 1998-2007 Fig. 9: * For this calculation it is assumed that 10 kg of opium are equivalent to 1 kg of morphine and1 kg of heroin.

These markets are, in fact, larger (about 5 million users) than the opiate market in West and Central Europe (about 1.4 million). The opiate markets in Western Europe are, however, financially more lucrative. Therefore, opiates also leave Afghanistan via Iran and Pakistan along the Balkan route towards Western Europe. UNODC estimates for 2008 suggest that most of the opium exports from Afghanistan cross the border in the Islamic Republic of Iran (83%; range: 71%-96%). Mor-phine and heroin exports and Iran (39%; range: 32% - 44%) a lesser extent, to Central Asia (19%; range: 8%-25%) 13. Opiate seizures continued to increase along the extended Balkan route in 2007, accounting for 94% of all seizures of Afghan opiates. Seizures along the other route, the Silk route (or North route) have continued to decline, reaching 9% in 2007. Afghan opiates enter the Islamic Republic of Iran either directly from Afghanistan or via Pakistan. The frequency of T urkey being mentioned by other European countries as a 'country of origin' for the heroin found on their markets has declined in recent years, 13 UNODC, Afghanistan Opium Survey 2008, October 2008. reflecting decreasing heroin manufacturing levels in T urkey. Nonetheless, T urkey remains the key transit country for heroin produced in South-West Asia and consumed in Europe, in spite of alternative trafficking routes emerging in recent years. According to T urkish authorities, 80% of the heroin illegally imported into T urkey was from Afghanistan; the remaining 20% is believed to have originated in Iran. Once in T urkey, heroin is smuggled from eastern T urkey to Istanbul towards Bulgaria for subsequent transport to Serbia and Romania for shipments to various countries in Western Europe. Heroin and morphine seizures made by the Bulgarian authorities rose by 66% in 2007. According to Bulgarian authorities, most of the heroin seized in 2007 was destined for Croatia and Germany. According to information from the Romanian authori-ties major destination countries were the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. 14 Another transit country for heroin leaving Bulgaria is the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. From there, heroin is either sent to Serbia for subsequent deliveries along the Balkan route (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia) and Western Europe, or to Albania for subsequent shipment to Italy. In Italy, heroin coming from Albania and T urkey is destined for the domestic market (45%) and for re-export, mainly to Germany (35%). 15 Most of the heroin shipments to Germany still arrive via the Balkan countries and Austria. The main destination of heroin seized in Germany is the Netherlands (78% in 2007). Once in the Netherlands the heroin is typically re-exported to the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other EU countries. Most of the heroin seized in France in 2007 had transited T urkey and the Netherlands and was on the way to the UK (50%) or to Spain (15%); about a quarter was for domestic consumption. 16 There have been reports that heroin intended for West-ern Europe was also trafficked through Ukraine via T urkey and the Islamic Republic of Iran, with main destinations being the UK, Poland and Germany. 17 A number of more direct routes from South-West Asia to Europe also exist, mainly via Pakistan as well as via the Middle East, Eastern and Western Africa. 14 UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire Data for 2007. 15 UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire Data for 2007.16 UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire Data for 2007.17 The Ukraine reported that 45% of heroin seized came via T urkey and 32% via the Islamic Republic of Iran and that 46% were intended for the UK, 31% for Poland and 23% for Germany.

Trends in the world drug markets Opium / heroin market Interpretation of seizure data The quantity of illicit drugs seized in a given year may be influenced by two main factors, namely the available supply of the drug in the illicit market and the effective-ness of interdiction efforts by law enforcement agencies. To measure supply, it is useful to have other indicators than seizure quantities. If these are obtained independ-ently, they can help to interpret the market of illicit drugs and the relationship between supply and seizures. Price and purity are among the key factors that can help to better interpret trends in seizures. T rends in prices measure the changes in the market and can be a sign of changes in supply. For example, an increasing trend of seizures together with a decreasing trend in prices sug-gest a real increase in supply. An increasing trend in seizures with increasing price levels suggests an improve-ment in law enforcement activities. Information on purity is also important to interpret data on seizures. Very often the market reacts to a decrease of supply by diminishing the pure con-tent of the drug. Increases or decreases of seizures in terms of weight or unit may not be sufficient to measure actual changes occurring in the market. In many countries, only seizure data are available to estimate a trend in the availability of illicit drugs. How much seizure trends can help to understand the availability of drugs is illustrated in the following example, where trends in opium seizures and pro-duction (as a proxy of supply) are compared at the global level. Interpret-ing seizure data on short-term changes or in one single country could be meaningless. Looking at long-term changes on a global scale provides a more accurate pic-ture. In the figure, the growth of opium production is pre- sented together with growth of global seizures of opium, heroin and morphine. If it is assumed that both seizures and opium production are indicators of the supply of opiates, it is expected that seizures and production follow the same pattern. Indeed it can be noted that seizures of opium and morphine follow the same trend as produc-tion, but this is not true for heroin. Heroin seizures do not show the same drastic decline that affected produc-tion in 2001. The sustained high levels of heroin seizures in 2001, despite the decrease of production, may partly be attributed to intensified law enforcement efforts (notably in China and Tajikistan 1). Stock-piling could also be a factor that can explain this trend. Opium pro-duction may also not be a good indicator of supply. In fact, heroin seizures may arguably be a better indicator of heroin supply than opium production, especially for a consumer market that is removed from the production basin around Afghanistan, such as West and Central Europe. Supply and law enforcement activities can not be sepa- rated, and assuming trends in supply solely on the basis of data on seizures can sometimes be misleading. This can also be seen by looking at the growth of opium sei-zures between 2005-2007. Although the trend is similar to opium production, the more rapid increase of seizures compared to production measures not only an increase in supply but most probably also an increased level of law enforcement activities. It is easy to compare levels and changes of seizures and production to understand how much information sei-zures can give on the increase or decrease of supply. However, this kind of analysis is not always possible, and in many situations, seizure totals are the best available indicators of supply. When information on seizures is supplemented with information on price, purity and consumption, more accurate conclusions can be made about the supply of illicit drugs. When only seizure data are used, there is a risk of overestimating or underesti-mating real changes in supply. 1 UNODC, Global Illicit Drug T rends 2003.Growth of opium production and opiate seizures, relative to 1997 Note: All quantities are expressed relative to 1997.

More than half of the world's opiates-using population are thought to live in Asia. The highest levels of use (in terms of the proportion of the popula-tion aged 15-64 years) are found along the main drug trafficking routes out of Afghanistan. This year, significant revisions were made to the approach taken in making global and regional estimates of the number of people who use drugs. The new estimates reflect the uncertainties surrounding these data (which exist due to data gaps and quality) and are presented in ranges rather than absolute numbers. Because of this revision, previous point estimates are not comparable to the current ones.

Trends in the world drug markets Opium / heroin market Opiate consumption may be falling in East and South-East Asia In East and South-East Asia, it was estimated that 2.8- 5.0 million persons aged 15-64 years used opiates in the past year. Use in China has been estimated at around 0.19-0.31% (1.8 to 2.9 million persons). 1 Higher levels have been reported in opium cultivation areas, including 1.1% in the Shan State and Kachin (Myanmar). 2 Most countries of East and South-East Asia reported recent declines in opiate use, reflecting declining opium production in Myanmar and the Lao People's Demo-cratic Republic. Heroin was still reported as the main problem drug in China (Hong Kong and Macao only), Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar, although reports suggested that heroin use may also be declining there. Opium use in northern Lao PDR is estimated to have declined from 0.6% (2006) to 0.4% (2008) 3. In both Lao PDR and Myanmar, opium producing villages have much higher consumption than non-opium producing villages. 1 Estimate derived from Lu F , Wang N, Wu Z, Sun X, Rehnstrom J, Poundstone K, et al. \"Estimating the number of people at risk for and living with HIV in China in 2005: methods and results; Sex T ransmitted Infections, June 2006, Vol. 82 Suppl 3, pp. iii 87-91, reported in: Mathers Phillips B, Wiessing L, Hick-man M, Strathdee S, et al.

Population surveys suggested that 1.4% used opiates in the past year in Afghanistan (in 2005), and 2.8% in the Islamic Republic of Iran (has an estimated 0.7 to 1.6 million so-called \"drug addicts\"). 4 In Pakistan, injecting drug use is reportedly increasing;5 one study estimated 630,000 opiate users in Pakistan, equivalent to 0.7% of those aged 15-64, around 77% of whom were heroin users. 6 In the Central Asia7 and the Caucasus subregion, opiate use is also thought to be above estimated global average levels, particularly in Kazakhstan (1%),8 Kyrgyzstan (0.8%)9 and Uzbekistan (0.8%).10 Estimates for Tajiki- stan are slightly lower (0.5%).

South AsiaIndia holds the largest opiate-using population in the subregion, estimated at around 3.2 million persons (esti- mated from a study conducted in the year 2000). There are few data on the size of opiate-using populations in this region; the most recent population survey - of Indian men - was conducted in 2000. Some information on drug use has been obtained from samples of illicit drug users in countries across this region. These studies have suggested that heroin use is common among illicit drug users in Bangladesh 14 and India,15 and buprenorphine injection16 has been identified as a sig- nificant issue among Indian and Bangladeshi drug users. In Sri Lanka, in contrast, heroin smoking is more common - injection appears to rarely occur. 11 UNODC, HIV/AIDS and Injecting Drug Use in Central Asia: from Evidence to Action, Uzbekistan Country Report 2007. 12 UNODC, HIV/AIDS and Injecting Drug Use in Central Asia: from Evidence to Action, Tajikistan Country Report 2007 13 UNODC, HIV/AIDS and Injecting Drug Use in Central Asia: from Evidence to Action, Kyrgyzstan Country Report 2007 14 UNODC Regional Office for South Asia.

Many coun-tries, however, still lack essential capacity to collect and analyse data on drug use and drug treatment demand. There is a need to improve data in this region. Europe holds the second largest population of opiate users; trends differ between western and east- ern countries Europe has an estimated 3.4-4.0 million opiate users (around 0.6-0.7% of the population aged 15-64): between 1.23-1.52 million estimated consumers in West and Central Europe, and between 2.21-2.53 million consumers (0.8-0.9%) in Eastern and South Eastern Europe. This region is the world's second largest opiate market in terms of quantities consumed, and the largest in economic terms. The major populations of users in Western Europe are estimated to be in the United Kingdom (between 404-434,000 persons), Italy (305,000), France (171-205,000), Germany (76-161,000) and Spain (61-121,000). 17 According to expert perceptions, use of opiates remained stable or declined in this subregion. Data from the past decade similarly suggest stable levels of use, although some countries have reported increases in fatal overdoses and in first treatment entrants with heroin as the pri-mary drug problem in recent years. 17 All of these estimates have been derived from estimates of the number of problem drug users because household surveys are not considered to provide good estimates on the number of heroin and other opiate users.

Trends in the world drug markets Opium / heroin market The Russian Federation has the largest opiate-using pop- ulation in Eastern Europe. Although estimates of the number vary substantially18, some estimate there are 1.68 million opiate users in the country (1.6% of the population aged 15-64). 19 The second largest opiate using population in Eastern Europe is the Ukraine with between 323-423,000 opiate users (1-1.3%). In 2008, perceived increases in opiate use were noted in Albania, Belarus, Croatia, and the Republic of Moldova. Specialised studies have estimated that injecting drug use is prevalent in many eastern European countries, and HIV is common among people who inject drugs. 20 This is particularly the case in the Russian Federation, the Ukraine, and Belarus, and there are reasons to be concerned about increasing problems in many other countries in the region where injecting is also occur-ring. 21 18 This also reflects major differences on the estimates of total drug use in the Russian Federation. A review of estimates of the total number of drug users in the Russian Federation showed a range from 1.5 mil-lion to 6 million people (UNODC, Illicit Drug Trends in the Russian Federation, 2005. UNODC and the Paris Pact Initiative, Illicit Drug Trends in the Russian Federation, April 2008.) 19 The new estimate is based on registered drug users and a new treat- ment multiplier. 350,267 drug dependent patients were registered in 2006. Of these, 89% were opiate users (UNODC and the Paris Pact Initiative, Illicit Drug Trends in the Russian Federation, April 2008). The new national-level treatment multiplier is 5.3 (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, National Addiction Centre of the Rus-sian Federation, Dynamics of Drug-Related Disorders in the Russian Federation, 2007). 20 UNODC, Global Assessment Programme on Drug Use (GAP), National Addiction Centre of the Russian Federation.

The largest opioid using population in this region is also, by far, in the USA, with an estimated 5.2 million persons in 2007 reporting using prescription pain relievers non-medically (a level that has remained stable since 2002). 23 This reflects a very well-docu- mented problem across the USA of inappropriate pre-scribing and use of pharmaceutical opiates (particularly 22 ONDCP , 2000. 23 SAMHSA, Results from the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, National Findings, (Rockville, Maryland, 2008). 0%2%4%6%8%10%12%14%16%18% 1992 19941996 1998 2000 20022004 2006Percentage of all treatment admissions Heroin All other opioids 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40% 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005Percentage of poisoningsDistribution of opiate users in the past Fig. 18: year among Western European countries Source: UNODCPercentage of all US drug treatment Fig. 19: admissions accounted for by heroin and other opiates Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Office of Applied Studies.

The largest population of opioid users in South America is found in Brazil, with some 635,000 opioid users (0.5% of those aged 12-65). Most use synthetic opioids rather than heroin (less than 0.05%). Experts reported a stable trend of opioid use in multiple countries in the Americas, but rising levels of opioid use were reported in Mexico, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and Argentina. Heroin use in Oceania appears stable Data from the Oceania region reflect only Australia and New Zealand, with no reports from the numerous island nations. Data from drug monitoring systems in Aus-tralia and New Zealand suggest stable levels of use, with some 90,000 opiates users in the Oceania region. In Australia, these remain much lower than those seen in the late 1990s prior to the so-called Australian \"heroin shortage\", though there are indications that injecting drug users are increasingly injecting other opioids such as morphine. 24 Heroin use may be rising in Africa There may be between 1.00-2.78 million people using opiates in Africa - the wide range of this estimate reflects the uncertainty in the numbers. Comparatively high levels have been reported in Mauritius and Egypt 25. 24 E. Black, A. Roxburgh, L. Degenhardt, R. Bruno, G. Campbell, B. de Graaff, et al.

National Study of Addiction, Prevalence of the use of Drugs Almost all opiate consumption is heroin, which is the primary drug among problematic drug users in coun- tries such as Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia.26,27,28 Reported heroin use trends suggest that heroin con- sumption continues to rise in eastern and southern Africa and some western African countries. This reflects the increasing role of African countries as heroin transits from Afghanistan to Europe. Opiates are the second most common drug for treatment; greater opiate treat-ment demand exists in the eastern and southern parts of the continent. Unfortunately, few countries of west and central Africa report drug use trends, and there are no accurate preva-lence data. Data in Africa therefore primarily reflect countries in northern and southern Africa. South Africa is the only country with a drug use surveillance system (the South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (SACENDU).

Trends in the world drug markets Opium / heroin market Injecting drug use and HIV What is the extent of injecting drug use around the world? Injecting drug use is well established in every region of the world and appears to be an emerging phenomenon in many countries where it has not been previously reported1. By 2008, injecting drug use had been reported in 148 countries and territories which together account for 95% of the world's population. Estimates of the prevalence of injecting drug use were available for only 61 countries around the world; these coun- tries make up 77% of the world's population. The prevalence of injecting drug use varies consider ably, both between and within countries. Observed country-level prevalence of injecting drug use ranges from 0.02% in India and Cambodia to Georgia with 4.19% and Azerbaijan with 5.21%. It is estimated that between 11-21 million people worldwide inject drugs. China, the USA, the Russian Federation and Brazil are estimated to have the largest populations of injecting drug users (IDUs) and together account for 45% of the total estimated worldwide population of IDUs. What is the extent of HIV among people who inject drugs? Injecting drug use is responsible for an increasing proportion of HIV infections in many parts of the world, including countries in Eastern Europe, South America and East and South-East Asia. Investment in compre-hensive public-health interventions is required to address this. HIV infection among people who inject drugs has been reported in 120 countries, and the prevalence of HIV among IDUs varies dramatically. Midpoint HIV prevalence is reported to be between 20 and 40% in five countries: Spain (39.7%); Russian Federation (37.2%); Viet Nam (33.9%); Cambodia (22.8%) and Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (22.0%); and is greater than 40% in a further nine: Estonia (72.1%); Argentina (49.7%); Indonesia (42.5%); Ukraine (41.8%) and Nepal (41.4%). HIV prevalence rates among IDUs also vary significantly within countries. For example, in China, reported HIV infections are concen trated within seven of the country's 22 provinces. Moreover, in Russia, the reported prevalence rates varied from 0.3% in Pskov, 12.4% in Moscow, 32% in St. Petersburg to 74% in Biysk. It is estimated that between 0.8 and 6.6 million people who inject drugs worldwide are infected with HIV. Regions with the largest numbers and highest concentration of HIV-posi tive IDUs include Eastern Europe, East and South-East Asia, and Latin America. The prevalence of HIV is higher than 40% in many national and subnational injecting drug user populations in these regions. Outside of sub-Saharan Africa injecting drug users make up a sizeable proportion of the total number of people living with HIV. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, more than half of those living with HIV are IDUs. The dynamics of the spread of HIV infection are notable. A decade ago, HIV was not identified among people who inject drugs in Estonia; by contrast, a more recent estimate now suggests that the prevalence of HIV infec-tion has reached 72% in one sample of injecting drug users. In contrast, Australia and New Zealand have maintained very low levels of HIV infection (1.09% and 0.73% respectively) despite a higher prevalence of injecting drug use than some other countries. This difference has been attributed to geographic isolation, as well as the swift introduction of needle and syringe programmes and the expansion of opiate substitution treat-ment programmes after HIV infection was first documented in 1984. 1 This information was compiled, reviewed and published by the Reference Group to the United Nations on HIV and injecting drug use and published in The Lancet in September 2008. The Reference Group was established for the purpose of providing independent technical advice on HIV and injecting drug use to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), World Health Organizati on (WHO), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Secretariat and relevant co-sponsors. The Reference Group cur- rently comprises 24 experts from 20 countries, and includes clinicians, researchers in epidemiology and policy, and injecting d rug user representatives. Further information is available at: www.iduRefGroup.com 58World Drug Report 2009 *These numbers are extremely tenuous as they are based on very few countries in the region Data on injecting drug use: challenges and limitations Currently only limited data exist on the prevalence of injecting drug use around the world and the quality of the available data is generally poor. The inadequacy of the available data makes it impossible to determine with any certainty how the extent of injecting drug use globally has changed over time A lack of consistency in the definition of injecting drug use in the literature and different datasets makes reliable comparison between countries, and in some cases even within countries, impossible. Injecting drug use is an illegal, stigmatised behaviour and con sequently injecting drug users are often referred to as a \"hidden population.\" It is difficult to measure the extent of this behaviour. Population surveys tend to underesti-mate its prevalence and indirect methods can also be uncertain. Collecting the data is technically challenging, particularly for developing countries. However, data from many higher income countries is also inadequate. For example, the most recent na tional estimates of injecting drug use for eight Western European countries were from the year 2000 or earlier. In order to plan and implement successful interventions to address injecting drug use and HIV, it is critical that consistent, timely data on the extent of inject-ing drug use and HIV among IDUs is collected.

Trends in the world drug markets Opium / heroin market Cutting agents for heroin in Afghanistan Through improved forensic capacities and facilities, the forensic laboratory of the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA) was able to identify several cutting agents typically used for mixing with heroin.1 The samples were seized during law enforcement activities in 2008. The chemicals identified include caffeine, chloroquine, phe-nolphthalein and paracetamol. Users who smoke or inhale heroin draw some practical benefits if it is mixed with a certain amount of caffeine, as this causes the heroin to vaporize at a lower temperature. Chloroquine, a well-known anti-malarial drug, has been used as a cutting agent in heroin for many years, though it was not previously known to be used in Afghanistan. Chloroquine does not alter the effects of heroin or influence the way it can be consumed. Its widespread availability, low price, colour and crystalline structure are thought to be some of the reasons for its use. Given the close resemblance in appearance and consistency of chloroquine with some seizures of what is known in South-West Asia as \"crystal heroin\", one could also speculate that the chloroquine was marketed on its own, as fake heroin. Phenolphthalein is used as an acid or base indicator. It has also been used as a laxative for more than a century, but has now been removed from the market because of concerns over carcinogenicity. It has been reported as a cutting agent for heroin in the past 2 but the reasons for its use are not well understood. Paracetamol is a popular over-the-counter painkiller. It is easy to purchase and relatively cheap. Its mild analgesic properties and bitter taste may disguise a poorer quality heroin. The use of paracetamol as a cutting agent for heroin is well documented from many regions and countries. The reason for adding specific, pharmacologically active substances (so-called adulterants) to heroin remains an area of speculation that can only be partly explained by the pharmacological properties of the substances concerned. However, the findings of the CNPA laboratory suggest that cutting of heroin takes place at source and that heroin produced in Afghanistan may be customized for different markets and consumer groups. The findings are also a reminder that there is a frequently neglected market associated with the illicit drug industry: the market in cutting agents. This market is lucrative because cutting agents are legal and their trade carries low risk. The increased awareness of the potential value for drug enforcement of understanding the trade in these substances is very recent. 3 1 http://www.unodc.org/pdf/scientific/LIB%20IV-2008_Kabul-.pdf 2 Chaudron-Thozet, H., Girard, J., and David, J.J.

Total cultivation is close to the average level since 2002, and well below the levels reached in the 1990s. Similarly, the estimated global cocaine production also decreased in 2008, due to a strong reduction in Colom-bia. The Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru both registered small increases in cultivation and produc-tion. Compared to the record high in 2005, cocaine seizures decreased in 2007. The Americas account for the vast majority of the world's cocaine seizures, although a sig-nificant decline in trafficking towards North America, the world's largest cocaine consumer market, was reported in 2008. This decline was reflected in rapidly rising prices and falling purity levels. North America also reported significant declines in cocaine use, notably from the USA. Following strong increases in recent years, a number of surveys in West European countries - including Spain - showed the first signs of a stabilization in 2008, whereas cocaine use still appears to be increasing in South America. The total number of people who used cocaine at least once in 2007 worldwide is estimated to range between 16 and 21 million. 1.2.2 Production Cultivation In 2008, the total area under coca cultivation decreased by 8% due to a significant reduction in Colombia (-18%), which was not offset by small increases in the Plurinational State of Bolivia (6%) and Peru (4%). The total area under coca cultivation decreased to 167,600 ha, which is well below the level reached in the 1990s. In spite of this decrease, Colombia remained the world's largest coca bush-cultivating country with 81,000 ha, followed by Peru (56,100 ha) and Bolivia (30,500 ha). Most of the decrease of 18,000 ha in Colombia hap- pened in the regions of Meta-Guaviare and Putumayo-Caquet\u00e1. However, a significant increase was observed in the Pacific region as well as in some smaller cultivation regions. In 2008, the area under coca cultivation in Peru increased by 4% to 56,100 ha, the third, albeit relatively small, consecutive yearly increase. Peru remains the world's second largest coca bush-cultivating country. The area under coca cultivation in the Plurinational State of Bolivia in 2008 increased by 6% to 30,500. Like in Peru, this was the third consecutive yearly increase. An expansion of the area under coca cultivation was observed in both large cultivation regions, the Yungas of La Paz and Chapare. Although sizeable coca cultivation does not exist outside Bolivia, Peru and Colombia, eradication reports from Governments and media reports indicate that small-scale coca cultivation took place in other countries in the region in 2008.64World Drug Report 2009 Global illicit cultivation of coca bush and production of coca leaf and cocaine, 1994-2008 Table 6: (a) Potentially harvestable, after eradication.

For the calculation of the 2008 cocaine produc-tion, new information on coca leaf yield available for some regions was used. (l) Figures from 2003 to 2005 were revised in 2007 based on updated information available on the amount of coca leaf necessary to produce one kilogram of cocaine HCl. 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 CULTIVATION OF COCA BUSH IN HECTARES (a) Bolivia (b)48,100 48,600 DRY COCA LEAF IN METRIC TONS (e) Bolivia OF COCAINE IN METRIC TONS (j) Bolivia (b)255 240 215 200 150 70 43 60 60 79 98 80 94 104 113 Colombia (k)201 230 300 350 435 680 695 617 580 550 640 640 610 600 430 Peru (l)435 460 435 325 240 175 141 150 160 230 270 260 280 290 302 Total 891 930 950 875 825 925 879 827 800 859 1,008 980 984 994 845651. Trends in the world drug markets Coca / cocaine market Production In 2008, the global potential cocaine production decreased by 15%, from 994 mt in 2007 to 845 mt in 2008. This is the lowest amount in the period 2004-2008, for which directly comparable figures are availa-ble. The decrease is due to a strong reduction in cocaine production in Colombia (28%), which was not leveled out by production increases in Bolivia and Peru. Colom-bia remained the world's largest producer of cocaine (51%) followed by Peru (36%) and Bolivia (13%). Farm-gate prices Sun-dried coca leaf Farm-gate prices for sun-dried coca leaf increased in both the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru. As in the past years, in Bolivia, coca leaf prices were consider- ably higher than in neighbouring Peru. The prices reached levels of over US$ 6.0/kg in the Chapare region, a level last reached in 2002. In Peru, the simple average farm-gate price of sun-dried coca leaf traded outside the Government-controlled market was US$ 3.4/kg, over one third more than in 2007, compared to just US$ 1.7/kg for coca leaf traded under Government control.

Due to the change of methodology, these figures are not directly comparable with data from previous years. Colombian cocaine production estimates for 2004 and later are based on new research cannot be directly compared with previous years. For detailed source information, see Table: Global illicit cultivation of coca bush and production of coca leaf and cocaine. 671. Trends in the world drug markets Coca / cocaine market Fresh leaf In Colombia, coca leaf is traded as fresh leaf, and the average per kilo price of fresh coca leaf decreased from COP 2,400,000/kg or US$ 1.2/kg in 2007 to COP 2,200,000/kg or US$ 1.1/kg in 2008. Converted into sun-dried coca leaf equivalents this would correspond to US$ 2.6/kg. Coca paste and cocainePrices for coca paste and cocaine in different countries may not be directly comparable as little is known about their quality and composition. In Peru, the average farm-gate price of coca paste increased by 21% from US$ 600/kg in 2007 to US$ 723/kg in 2008. In Colom- bia, however, coca paste prices decreased in Colombian peso terms by 4% but increased slightly (by 2%) in US$ terms, from US$ 943/kg to US$ 963/kg as the Colom-bian peso gained strength against the US dollar. Whole-sale prices for cocaine HCl increased in both Colombia (7%, in main cities) and Peru (10%, in producing regions) in US dollar terms. As the availability of farm-gate prices differs from region to region and over the course of a year, small changes should be interpreted with caution. Clandestine laboratories and precursors In 2007, Governments reported the detection of 7,225 clandestine coca processing laboratories, compared to 7,060 laboratories reported for 2006. 1 Over 99% of the coca processing laboratories were located in the three coca cultivating countries. Bolivia and Peru also destroyed large numbers of coca maceration pits, which are typi- 1 The 2006 figure was updated from originally 6,390 laboratories based on additional reports received from Governments.cally found in coca cultivation regions to produce coca paste.2 In 2007, a small number of cocaine laboratories was reported from other Latin American countries such as Chile (5), Ecuador (1) and Mexico (1). In previous years, similarly small numbers of laboratories were reported from countries such as Argentina, Brazil and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Outside Latin America, the highest number of laboratories detected was reported by Spain (18), followed by the USA (3). Potassium permanganate is believed to be essential for cocaine manufacturing and large amounts are required each year in coca producing countries. In 2007, 15 countries reported seizures of potassium permanganate totaling 153.3 mt, of which Colombia seized 144 mt. The Colombian authorities also dismantled 4 clandes-tine potassium permanganate laboratories, from which they seized almost 45 mt of substance, which may sug-gest that it is becoming more difficult to import or divert potassium permanganate from the licit to the illicit market. Peru reported the seizure of 1,5 mt of potassium permanganate in 2007. The large amount of seizures and the detection of potassium permanganate laboratories in coca producing countries may indicate that traffickers have found ways to circumvent interna-tional control mechanisms, for example, by diverting potassium permanganate from domestic trade, by smug-gling or by clandestine manufacturing. 3 2 An extract of the leaves of the coca bush.

This was similar to the level in 2006 (693 mt), thus halting the strong upward trend reported in recent years. Nonetheless, cocaine seizures in 2007 were twice as high as in 2000 (344 mt). The strong increases in cocaine seizures were not triggered by an increase in production. It can, however, be explained by a strengthened commitment to fight the trafficking of cocaine, particularly in the region where it is produced. The share of South America, Central America and the Caribbean in total cocaine seizures rose from 32% in 1989 to 60% in 2007. The global cocaine interception rate remains high In 2007, the global cocaine interception rate 1 was above the 40% benchmark for the third year in a row. It was calculated at 41.5% for the year 2007,2 that is, practi- cally the same as in 2006 and 2005 (around 42%). The interception rate was 23% in 1990 and 29% in 1998. 1 Calculated as the rate of total seizures over the total production. 2 The global interception rate of 41.5% was calculated on the basis of a global cocaine production of 994 mt in 2007 and global seizures of 711 mt at street purity. Given a global average cocaine purity of 58% in 2007 (as reported in the ARQ) this is equivalent to pure cocaine seizures of some 412 mt (or 41.5% of global cocaine production). There is a potential problem of double counting sei- zures, particularly when more than one law enforcement agency is involved3 (for example, customs and police in the same country, or police/customs from different countries). Considering this potential double counting, the 'actual' interception rate could be lower than the one reported above. Cocaine seizures remain concentrated in the Americas and, to a lesser extent, in Europe In 2007, most of the cocaine was again intercepted in the Americas (88%), followed by Europe (11%). South America accounted for 323 mt (45%) of global cocaine seizures in 2007. More than 60% of seizures in South America were reported by Colombia. Large sei-zures in this region were also reported by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (32 mt) and Ecuador (25 mt). Substantive cocaine seizures in South America were also made by the Plurinational State of Bolivia (18 mt), Brazil (17 mt), Peru (14 mt), Chile (11 mt) and Argen-tina (8 mt). Seizures increased in Bolivia but declined in Peru. Overall cocaine seizures in the Southern Cone countries (Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Paraguay and Uru-guay) rose from 10 mt in 2000 to 38 mt in 2007. This reflects the growing importance of these countries for cocaine trafficking to satisfy domestic demand and to re-export cocaine to various overseas destinations in Europe, Africa and the Pacific region. Central America and the Caribbean, two major cocaine transit regions, accounted for 15% of global seizures. The vast majority of seizures in 2007 was reported by Central American countries (97 mt) while seizures in the Caribbean subregion (7 mt) continued to decline. North America reported 28% of global cocaine seizures (199 mt). The largest seizures were reported from the USA (148 mt), followed by Mexico (48 mt). Europe reported 11% of global cocaine seizures; 99% by countries in West and Central Europe. Spain reported the largest seizures in Europe (38 mt). The rest of the world reported only 1 % of global cocaine seizures in 2007. 3 The risk of double counting seizures has increased in recent years due to the increased cooperation in fighting cocaine trafficking across countries and law enforcement agencies.Global cocaine seizures, 1987-2007 Fig. 28: * including Caribbean and Central America Source: UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire Data / DELTA. 152750 711 344396 291 0100200300400500600700800 1987 1989 1991 19931995199719992001200320052007seizures in metric tons West and Central Europe North America South America* Other711. Trends in the world drug markets Coca / cocaine market Declining trafficking of cocaine towards North America, the world's largest cocaine market Cocaine trafficked to North America typically originates in Colombia and reaches the USA through Mexico, either directly by speed boats or via countries such as the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama. Most of the cocaine (close to 70%) is estimated to be transported via the Eastern-Pacific route towards Mexico and some 20% via the Western Caribbean route. 4 North America, notably the USA, reported some of the most striking declines of cocaine trafficking in 2007. This trend became even more pronounced in 2008. On average, federal US seizures fell from more than 13 mt per quarter in 2006 to less than 10 mt per quarter over the first six months of 2008. A strong decline of 40% was observed at the US-Mexican border. 5 In parallel, Mexico saw a major decline of cocaine sei-zures from 48 mt in 2007 to 19 mt in 2008; a reduction of some 60%. Both Mexico and the US reported that this decline was linked to a strong decrease in cocaine trafficking. 6 There are no indications that the reductions are related to less enforcement efforts.7 A number of indicators showed that cocaine availability decreased in the USA in 2007 and 2008. 8 For one, law enforcement agencies and interagency analysis coordi-nated by the National Drug Intelligence Center indi-cated that the large US cocaine markets experienced a substantial cocaine shortage in 2007 9 and during the the first quarter of 2008. Secondly, the number of emer-gency department visits related to cocaine abuse declined in the great majority of the cities in the first quarter of 2008, compared to 2006. 10 Thirdly, the workplace test- ing results revealed a strong decline in the use of cocaine in 2008. 11 Finally, the 'Monitoring the Future' high 4 National Drug Intelligence Center, National Drug Threat Assessment 2009, December 2008. 5 Ibid. 6 UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire Data. 7 The Mexican Government substantially increased supports for its security forces and the justice sector in 2008. This resulted, inter alia, in the arrest of a number of drug kingpins of the various Mexi-can drug cartels (Source: US State Department, 2009 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, March 2009). Increased efforts were also reported by the United States which continuously increased its federal drug control budget for domestic law enforcement over the 2000-2008 period from $2 bn to $3.8 from $1.9 bn to $3.2 bn; the overall federal drug from $9.6 to $13.7 bn. (Source: ONDCP , National Drug Control Strategy FY 2009 Budget Summary). 8 Cocaine shortages were most evident in the Great Lakes, New Eng- land and the Mid-Atlantic regions, as well as in the cities of Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco. 9 ONDCP , National Drug Control Strategy, 2008 Annual Report , Febru- ary 2008. 10 National Drug Intelligence Centre, National Drug Threat Assessment 2009, December 2008. 11 Ibid. school surveys found an ongoing decline of perceived cocaine availability after 2006; the decline became more pronounced in 2008.12 The most striking data indicating a shortage of cocaine in the US market relate to the changes in cocaine prices and purity in 2008. While street prices increased, purity decreased. The purity of cocaine declined from an aver-age of 69.7% in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 43.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result, the average purity-adjusted prices (retail and wholesale) more than doubled, from an average of US$89 per gram in the fourth quarter of 2006 to US$200 in the fourth quarter of 2008. This is the sharpest increase seen in the USA in recent years. The flow of cocaine towards Europe may have started to decline In 2007, European cocaine seizures declined by some 35%, from 121 to 79 mt, the lowest total since 2004. Individual drug seizures reported by European countries suggest that the downward trend may have continued in 2008. The decline in 2007 was primarily due to lower seizure totals reported by Portugal, Spain and France and, to a lesser extent, by lower totals in Belgium, Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands, Iceland and Finland. Overall, 15 Euro-pean countries recorded declining levels of cocaine sei-zures in 2007. At the same time, 27 countries reported higher levels of cocaine seizures compared to the year before, mostly smaller countries and/or countries of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. This suggests that cocaine 12 NIDA, Monitoring the Future - 2008 Data from In-School Surveys of 8th- 10th- and 12th-Grade Students.

The most frequently mentioned country of origin of the cocaine trafficked to Europe is Colombia (48% of coun-tries reported Colombia as the source country for their seizures), followed by Peru (30% of countries) and the Plurinational State of Bolivia (18% of countries). The most frequently reported transit countries were the Boli-varian Republic of Venezuela and Ecuador. In addition, the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Argentina and Chile were mentioned, as well as some Western African countries. According to UNODC's individual drug seizures data- base the most important cocaine transit country in 2007 in volume terms was the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (40%). If the origin of the individual cocaine seizure cases is analyzed - as opposed to seizures in volume terms - the most important cocaine transit countries for Europe in 2007 were the Dominican Republic (11%), Argentina (9%) and Brazil (8%). African countries accounted for 32% of the total, but this share declined in 2008. Cocaine prices increased in Western Europe in 2007, both in euro and in dollar terms, suggesting that falling cocaine seizures in 2007 were a consequence of lower trafficking flows. Retail prices rose from on average US$82 per gram in 2006 to US$92 per gram in 2007. Retail prices in dollar terms were at their highest level since 1998 (in euro terms since 2002). However, the increase was less pronounced once inflation - as meas-ured by the consumer price index - was taken into account. Average wholesale prices rose from some US$47 per gram in 2006 to US$56 per gram in 2007. Once infla-tion is considered, the wholesale prices of 2007 (in euro) were at their highest level since 1997. Drug price changes can be misleading unless additional information on changes in purity is taken into account. Unfortunately, such information is not systematically collected, analyzed and reported by most European countries. One exception is the UK - Europe's largest cocaine market - where information of changes in purity is made available on a quarterly basis. The results of forensic analyses show that the mean cocaine purity declined in the UK from 2006 to the first quarter of 2009, at both wholesale retail levels. 13 The average cocaine purity in 13 Customs seizures reflect mainly the import-wholesale level; seizures USA, cocaine prices and purity, 2005-2008 Fig. 30: Source: DEA, System To Retrieve Information on Drug Evidence (STRIDE), April 2009, quoted in ONDCP , \"What can Europe learn from the US experience of policy-related drugs monitoring?\", presentation to the EMCDDA Conference, \"Identifying Europe's Information Needs for Effective Drug Policy\", Lisbon, May 6-8, 2009. $0$50$100$150$200 2005 2006 2007 2008Price of cocaine in US$ per gram 0%20%40%60%80% Purity in % Mean purity adjusted price Mean unadjused price Mean purity Cocaine seizures in Europe, 1998-2007 Fig. 31: Source: UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire. 3444 2959107121 477988 73 020406080100120140 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007metric tons Spain Netherlands Portugal France Italy United Kingdom Ireland Belgium Germany Other731. Trends in the world drug markets Coca / cocaine market police seizures fell from 32% in 2007 to 23% in the first quarter of 2009 while the purity of cocaine seized by the customs declined from 67% in 2007 to 56% in the first quarter of 2009. 14 Almost a third of police seizures now have purity levels of less than 9%, and in some small- scale seizures at the retail level, purity levels were as low as 4%-5% in the first quarter of 2009. This indicates that purity-adjusted cocaine prices in the UK rose, despite the stable retail prices. 15 The increased dilution of cocaine within the UK also suggests the establishment of large international traffick-ing activities in cutting agents which are usually legal substances when they are not used to adulterate cocaine. The Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) seized some 15 mt of such cutting agents over the last year, which is more than the amount of cocaine seizures reported by the UK to UNODC. 16 The cocaine wholesale prices rose over the same period from some \u00a330,000 per kg in 2007 to \u00a345,000 per kg in the first quarter of 2009 according to data collected by SOCA in the UK. made by the police reflect the domestic wholesale as well as the domestic retail level. 14 Forensic Science Service Data. 15 The purity-adjusted wholesale prices (based on Customs purities) increased from around \u00a344,000 per kg of 100% pure cocaine in 2007 to around \u00a380,000 in the first quarter of 2009, equivalent to an increase of some 80%. 16 Frequently found cutting agents for cocaine in the UK are benzocaine and lignocaine - normally used to relive pain in the dentistry and veterinary fields - which mimic some of the anaesthetic effects of cocaine. These are not easily identified by retail customers. (Source: Representative of the Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) at the conference: \"Identifying Europe's information needs for effective drug policy\", 6-8 May 2009.)Trafficking of cocaine via Africa, notably Western Africa, showed an upward trend until 2007... In 2007 total cocaine seizures amounted to 5.5 mt in Africa, a more than seven-fold increase since 1998. But the cocaine seized in Africa (0.8% of global seizures in 2007) is still a very modest percentage as compared to the likely cocaine trafficking flows affecting the continent. Out of 26 African countries reporting their 2007 drug seizures to UNODC, 25 reported seizures of cocaine. Only two countries reported falling levels of seizures in 2007, while the remaining 23 reported a rising trend. Over the 1998-2002 period, annual cocaine seizures in Africa were very limited and concentrated in Southern Africa.

In 2007, 83% of total seizures of cocaine in Africa were reported in West and Central Africa, 12% in Southern Africa, 5% in Northern Africa and 0.3% in Eastern Africa. The largest seizures in 2007 were reported by Senegal (2.5 mt). The cocaine found in Africa originated mainly in Colombia and Peru and frequently transited through Brazil. There is, however, significant trafficking of cocaine across the continent. The main African transit countries in 2007 (in terms of cocaine seized in other African countries) were Cape Verde, Guinea, Mali, Guin-ea-Bissau, Ghana, Benin, Togo, Gambia and Nigeria, all in West Africa. ....but the importance of Africa as a cocaine transit region appears to have declined in 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009 According to UNODC's individual drug seizure data- base, in 2008, there has been a substantive decline in the percentage of seizures transiting Africa, from 28% in 2007 to 7% in 2008. The decline can also be seen in the number of seizures. No large seizures which can be traced back to Africa have been reported to UNODC in the first quarter of 2009. In 2008 there was a strong decline in European seizures with Africa as the source, as well as a general decline of European seizures. Other sources seem to confirm the downward trend after 2007. From 1990 to 2007, there was a large increase in the share of cocaine couriers from Africa detected in 17 Cocaine seizures reported in 2006 and 2007 are not comparable. 2006 data included one major seizure of more than 14 mt which - after follow-up analysis it appeared that no psychoactive ingredients could be identified. Excluding the 14 ton seizure, total African sei-zures appear to have markedly increased in 2007.European airports. While in 2007, 28% of cocaine cou- riers were African, in 2008, this share decreased to 17%. 18 Signs of stabilization in Oceania in 2008 Though cocaine seizures in the Oceania region are still very small (0.6 mt or 0.1% of global seizures in 2007), they showed a clear upward trend after 2005. Australia accounted for more than 99% of the cocaine seizures made in the Oceania region in 2007. 19 The expansion of cocaine supply and the resulting downward trend in cocaine prices noted in 2006/07, however, does not seem to have continued in 2008. The Australian Customs Services reported seizures of 0.6 mt in both 2006/07 and 2007/08. Moreover, cocaine avail-ability as well as cocaine prices remained basically stable in 2008 according to information collected from a panel of injecting drug users and other key informants in Aus-tralia. 20 Cocaine seizures are still limited in Asia, in spite of some subregional increases Cocaine seizures reported to UNODC from Asia amounted to 400 kg in 2007, equivalent to 0.06% of global seizures. The largest cocaine seizures in Asia were reported from Hong Kong, China (200 kg in 2007, up from 15 kg in 2006), followed by the Syrian Arab Republic (77 kg in 2007, up from 2 kg in 2006).

The new estimates - like those reported for previous years - suggest that the largest market is still North America, followed by West and Central Europe and South America. This year, significant revisions were made to the approach taken in making global and regional estimates of the number of people who use drugs. The new estimates reflect the uncertainties surrounding these data (which exist due to data gaps and quality) and are being pre-sented in ranges rather than absolute numbers. Because of this revision, previous point estimates are not compa-rable to the current ones. Cocaine use is falling strongly in North America Significant declines in cocaine use were reported in North America, notably from the USA, which in abso-lute numbers is still the world's largest cocaine market. Cocaine was used at least once in the last year by some 5.8 million people in the USA in 2007, equivalent to an annual prevalence rate of 2.8% of the population aged 15-64. The monthly prevalence rate (use at least once in * The estimates for Africa and its subregions are the most problematic because of the lack of data for most countries. This is reflected in the wide ranges calculated.

This decline in the use of cocaine is confirmed by the results of drug tests among the general US workforce. The proportion of the workforce testing positive dropped from 0.91% in 1998 to 0.72% in 2006 and 0.41% in 2008, equivalent to a decline by more than 50% over the last decade. 1 The annual declines accelerated, from -3% in 2006 to -19% in 2007 and -29% in 2008. Posi-tive tests for cocaine typically result from cocaine con-sumption a few days prior to drug testing. 2 Data show that most of the decline took place during the last two years. Declines in cocaine use were also noticed in school sur- veys conducted in Ontario, Canada. The school surveys showed a decline in the annual prevalence of cocaine use of around 35% between 2003 and 2007. The perceived availability of cocaine dropped strongly between 2003 and 2007 and is now lower than in the late 1980s. Following several years of increase, the Mexican author- ities also reported cocaine use to have declined among the general population in 2007 as compared to the prev ious year. Overall cocaine use is, nonetheless, still higher than a decade ago. Preliminary results of a national 1 The data have been generated by Quest Diagnotics, based on more than 8.5 million drug tests every year, and are regularly reported by the US Office on National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). 2 Cocaine positive result in urine tests are normally obtained for 'infre- quent users' 12-48 hours after having consumed cocaine and for 'frequent users' the period extends to 1-4 days . For 'chronic users', in contrast, the substance can be detected up to several weeks after they had last used it.

Such levels are, however, still significantly lower than lifetime prevalence of cocaine use in the USA (17.8% of the population aged 15-65 in 2007) or in Canada (10.6% among the population aged 15 and above in 2004). In several West and Central European countries, use is stabilizing Following strong increases in recent years, a number of surveys in West European countries showed first signs of a stabilization. The largest cocaine markets in Europe - Spain, England and Wales, Italy, and Germany - have begun to stabilize. Spain, which has had the highest cocaine prevalence rates in Europe for the last decade and even higher rates than the USA in recent years, stabilized at an annual prevalence rate of 3% of the population aged 15-65 between 2005 and 2008. This is equivalent to some 910,000 cocaine users. Annual prevalence of cocaine use among secondary school students fell from a peak of 7.2% in 2004 to 4.1% in 2006, the lowest such rate since the late 1990s. 5 Cocaine use in England and Wales showed strong increases from the mid-1990s to 2007.

This corresponds to a total of 860,000 persons estimated to have used cocaine in England and Wales in 2007/08. Including Scotland and Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom is estimated to have about 1 million cocaine users. The UK thus continues to be - in absolute numbers - Europe's largest cocaine market, with its second highest cocaine use prevalence rate. Europe's third largest cocaine market is Italy with around 850,000 cocaine users. Similar to Spain, and England and Wales, data for Italy showed a stabilization of cocaine use over the 2005-08 period, following massive increases in previous years. The annual prevalence rate of cocaine use remained at 2.2% of the population aged 15-64 in 2008, the same level as in 2005. The cocaine market in Germany, Europe's fourth largest (in absolute numbers), also stopped growing. Cocaine use among the general population aged 18-59 declined from 1.0% in 2003 to 0.6% in 2006. Including crack cocaine, the prevalence rate amounted to 0.7% in 2006, 6 equivalent to some 380,000 persons. The decline in prevalence rates in Germany is also reflected in falling numbers of new cocaine users identified by law enforce - ment each year. This number declined some 30% over the last decade. Household surveys also showed a stabi - lization of cocaine use in Austria over the 2004 to 2008 period. A stabilization in cocaine use in 2007 was reported in Switzerland and the Netherlands. The Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) as well as some countries 6 DBDD , 2007 National Report to the EMCDDA by the REITOX National Focal Point Germany. in Central Europe (Poland and Hungary) similarly reported a stabilization in 2007. Household surveys sug - gest that cocaine use may have even declined in recent years in both Poland (from 0.5% in 2002 to 0.2% in 2006) and Hungary (from 0.7% in 2001 to 0.2% in 2007). Use still rising in some European countries In contrast, a number of countries continued to show increases in cocaine use. France, Europe's fifth largest cocaine market, reported an increase of cocaine use in 2007, in addition to the Czech Republic, Ireland, Slova - kia and Ukraine.

Trends in the world drug markets Coca / cocaine market over the 2001-2007 period, from 0.3% to 0.6%, reflect- ing the growing importance of Portugal as a cocaine transit country between South America, Western Africa and continental Europe in the last few years. Cocaine use in Ireland increased from 1.1% in 2003 to 1.7% in 2007 among the population aged 15-64. This increasing trend reverses the previously seen decrease (see figure). Expert perceptions in the Nordic countries indicated that cocaine use continued to increase among the gen-eral population. The annual prevalence of cocaine use in Finland increased from 0.2% (of the population aged 15-64) in 2000 7 to 0.5% in 20068. Cocaine use also appears to be increasing in a number of countries in South-East Europe, as reflected in school survey data from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD), conducted under the aus-pices of the Council of Europe. 9 7 European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), Statistical Bulletin 2007: Last year prevalence of drug use among all adults (aged 15 to 64 years old) in nationwide surveys among the general population. http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/stats07/gpstab03 8 EMCDDA, Country overview: Finland - Key statistics on the drug situation in Finland. http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/ country-overviews/fi/data-sheet#fn_one 9 In total, 35 European countries and territories participated in the 2007 ESPAD survey. In addition, the reports also provided data from Spain even though Spain had not formally participated in the ESPAD processSeveral South American countries continue to show increases In contrast to the decline in North America and the stabilization in Europe, cocaine use in South America still appears to be increasing. Increases in cocaine use in 2007 were reported by Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay as well as countries in Central America (Guatemala and Hondu-ras) and the Caribbean (Jamaica and Haiti). A stable or slightly decreasing level of cocaine use was seen in Chile, Peru, Paraguay and Costa Rica. A study by UNODC and the Comisi\u00f3n Interamericana para el Control del Abuso de Drogas (CICAD) 10 shows that the highest prevalence rate in South America was reported by Argentina. The annual prevalence of cocaine use for 2006/07 was 2.6% of the population aged 12-65, up from 1.9% in 1999. Argentina also constitutes the second largest cocaine market in South America in abso-lute numbers (some 660,000 persons) after Brazil (some 890,000 persons or 0.7% of the population aged 12-65; up from 0.4% in 2001). For some countries, results from the UNODC/CICAD study differed from other household surveys conducted in these countries. This variance can usually be explained by differences in the sampled populations (age group, urban/rural, etc.). Poly drug use further complicates the comparison of annual prevalence data. Annual prevalence of all cocaine use (as reported to UNODC in the ARQ) does not take into account poly drug use and cannot be calculated simply by adding prevalence rates for cocaine HCL and cocaine base found in the UNODC/CICAD study. In contrast to the upward trend found in most South American countries, cocaine use in Chile has been grad-ually declining over the last few years. Annual prevalence of all cocaine use fell slightly, from 1.8% in 2000 to 1.5% of the population aged 12-64 in 2006. This is equivalent to 1.7% of the population aged 15-64 (as reported to UNODC in the ARQ for the year 2007), or 190,000 persons. Results from school surveys in Chile also confirm a slight downward trend of cocaine HCl use in recent years, as the annual prevalence among high school students fell slightly between 2001 and 2007. Drug use levels in Uruguay have clearly shown an upward trend in recent years. Annual prevalence of cocaine use rose from 0.2% in 2001 to 1.4% among the population aged 12-65 in 2007. 10 Naciones Unidas Oficina 2008.

In addition to the use of cocaine HCL, the study showed that 'pasta base' (cocaine base), is frequently being consumed in South America. The high-est annual prevalence rates of cocaine base were reported by Chile (0.6%) followed by Argentina (0.5%) and Peru (0.4%). Use rising around emerging cocaine transit countries in Africa... Data on cocaine use in Africa is mostly based on the perceptions of country experts rather than surveys. These data show that some African countries, notably in West- ern and Southern Africa, are experiencing rising levels of cocaine use. Unfortunately, most countries in these regions still do not have proper monitoring systems that could validate the expert perceptions. South Africa is one of the few countries which has some data to substantiate expert perceptions. T reatment data for South Africa show a strong increase of cocaine related treatment (incl. alcohol) over the 1998-2008 period, from a proportion of around 5% of treatment demand in 1998 to 9% of total treatment demand over the first two quarters of 2008.

Annual prevalence of cocaine use among the population age 14 and above grew in Australia from 1.0% in 2004 to 1.6% in 2007 (1.9% among those aged 15-64 years). Annual prevalence is thus now slightly above the West and Central European average (1.4%). The upward trend over the 2004-2007 period reversed the previous downward trend observed over the 1998-2004 period. The upward trend over the 2003-2007 period is also reflected in the data collected by the Australian Institute for Criminology for the ongoing Drug Use Monitoring in Australia (DUMA) project where arrested people at selected police stations across Australia are regularly tested for drug abuse. The unweighted average of the results showed an increase in the number of people test-ing positive for cocaine from 0.5% in 2003 to 2.1% in 2007.

The initiative sends a strong message to policymakers regarding the need to develop services that address drug use disorders in a pragmatic, science-based and humanitarian way, replacing stigma and discrimination with knowledge, care, recovery opportunities and reintegration. The programme is based on a global collaborative effort, under the leadership of UNODC and WHO. The col-laboration will include governments, health profession-als, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and funding agencies committed to increasing the coverage of essential services for drug dependence treatment and care. Why UNODC and WHO together? UNODC and WHO both have constitutional mandates to address issues presented by drug use and dependence. Moreover, taking into account the health, socioeconomic and security implications of drug use and related disor-ders, the two agencies are uniquely positioned to lead this initiative. In particular, it will open a dialogue with Member States and involve a varied group of government ministries such as those for health and welfare, as well as the criminal justice system and other relevant sectors. Objectives: Promoting and supporting worldwide (with a par- s ticular focus on low- and middle-income countries) evidence-based policies, strategies and inter ventions that are based on a public health and human rights approach, in order to reduce drug use and the health and social burden it causes. Recognizing drug dependence as a preventable and s treatable multi-factorial health disorder; and of investing in treatment: lowering health-related costs, improving security and contributing to social cohesion. Bringing drug dependence treatment into the main- s stream health care and social welfare system, without discrimination. P romoting investment in comprehensive and re- s sults-oriented programmes for drug dependence tr eatment and care, particularly community-based interventions. The Joint Programme: Leads a global collaborative eort for improving 1. co verage and quality of treatment and care services for drug use disorders in low- and middle-income countries. Promotes the development of comprehensive and 2. integrated treatment systems that are able to deliver a continuum of care for drug users and link services at municipal and national levels. Maps population needs, legislative frameworks and 3. available services and programmes for drug depend-ence treatment and care.

There are high levels of uncertainty in cultivation esti-mates as cannabis can be grown - indoors or outdoors - in most countries in the world. Therefore, it is not possible to produce more precise data, as is done for opiates and cocaine. The total cannabis herb production is estimated to range from 13,300-66,100 mt, and for cannabis resin, the estimated production range is 2,200-9,900 mt. Total cannabis herb seizures increased somewhat in 2007 to reach a total of 5,600 mt. As in 2006, the majority of cannabis herb seizures in 2007 were reported from Mexico and the USA. Cannabis resin seizures also increased to some 1,300 mt, with most seizures reported by countries in West and Central Europe. Resin seizures increased by more than one third in this subregion, compared to 2006. UNODC estimates that between 143 and 190 million persons globally used cannabis at least once in 2007. Cannabis use seems to be increasing in several countries in Latin America and Africa, whereas in the established markets of North America and Western Europe, there are signs from recent studies that the levels of use are declining, particularly among young people.1.3.2 Production The total estimated area for outdoor production of can-nabis in 2008 ranges from 200,000-641,800 ha. The total cannabis herb production is estimated to range from 13,300-66,100 mt and the production of cannabis resin from 2,200-9,900 mt. Due to high levels of uncer-tainty in estimating cultivation, it is not possible to produce more precise data, as is done for opiates and coca/cocaine. This chapter shows the information that is available and gives an indication of the extent of global cannabis cul-tivation and production. Minimum and maximum levels of production and cultivation are explored by applying four methods. One method is based on reported cultivation and production, the second is based on sei-zures of cannabis, and the third and fourth method are based on user prevalence rates. Availability of data The cannabis market is the largest illicit drug market in terms of global spread of cultivation, volume of produc-tion and number of consumers. Unfortunately, the dom-inance of cannabis in the drug market is not reflected in the availability of reliable data. The information available on cannabis cultivation and production is fragmented, non-standardized and not always based on scientific research. This complicates the estimation of total global production. A major source of information for cultivation and pro- duction are the responses to the Annual Report Ques-tionnaires (ARQ). The ARQ asks for figures on the extent of cultivation, production and yield. Data on 911. Trends in the world drug markets Cannabis market Global cannabis herb and resin production estimates Cannabis herb and resin production can be estimated from the supply and from the demand side. An estimate from the supply side can be based on reported seizures or by estimating the total area of cultivation and produc-tion per hectare, based on the figures provided by a limited number of countries. For the latter, most coun-tries do not have a national figure for cultivation and do not have the capacity to generate an estimate. The table summarizes the most recent data available for some of the main producing countries as reported in the ARQs and other sources. The figures given in the table are in herbal equivalents, and the total shows a range of herbal production of some 88,000-110,000 mt. This does not include important producing countries like Afghanistan, 3 Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Jamaica, Nigeria and Pakistan, and should therefore be considered as an absolute minimum figure of global production. These figures are given in herbal equivalent volumes, and are therefore not comparable with the figures calculated in the 2008 WDR. They cannot be used to describe trends. Another way to estimate cannabis production is to use data on seizures reported in the ARQs and multiply 3 UNODC was not able to provide relieable estimates for cannabis cultivation in Afghanistan during the Opium Poppy Survey 2008. 4 Annual Reports Questionnaires, 2007. 5 Official Government communication 26/02/2009, in Lutte antid- rogue - Synthese 2008, Min of Interior. Herbal production, which was calculated from the reported resin production of 877 mt, refers to gross cannabis production and is not necessarily directly comparable to herbal production of other countries. 6 Secretaria Nacional Antidrogas (SENAD), 2008. 7 US Department of State, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), 2009.them by an estimated rate of interdiction. Cannabis sei- zures are reported as herb, plants or resin. The interception rate for herbal cannabis and cannabis plants is estimated to range between 10-20%, whereas the interception rate for resin is likely to be a bit higher, at least 17% (Bulletin on Narcotics, 2006). These interception rates were com- bined with conversion rates for resin and plants to calcu-late the total production range of each drug. The third way to estimate production is based on the demand for cannabis from the calculated number of cannabis users and the average use per year. This pro- vides the amount of herbal and resin cannabis produc-tion required to satisfy global demand. The estimates for average use per year has a high variability depending on the users' habits, the method of consumption and the quality of cannabis products. The literature mentions average use estimates between 60-200 g per year, with-out making a distinction between cannabis resin and herbal cannabis. These levels of use give a demand volume of 9,000-51,000 mt. About 10-17% of the use is estimated to be consumed as cannabis resin. Applying these factors and adding the amount of cannabis herb, cannabis plants (in herbal equivalents) and resin, respec-tively, gives a required production volume of some 13,300-52,400 mt of cannabis herb and 2,200-9,900 mt of cannabis resin. 8 Annual Survey reports Cannabis, Opium Poppy and Ephedra, 1998 and 1999.

Casual users (45%) are people who share cannabis cigarettes an aver-age of four times per year (0.6 grams/year). Regular users (41%) use more advanced inhaling techniques with higher frequency, on average 100 times per year (15 g/year). Daily users (9%) use one to four cannabis ciga-rettes per day (320 g/year) and chronic users (4%) who reach ten cigarettes per day (1,825 g/year). Applying these user rates and the same conversion factors as in the former estimation method (proportion of can- nabis resin use and conversion rate) give a total of can- nabis used for consumption which ranges between 20,000-33,200 mt of cannabis herb and 3,000-6,300 mt of cannabis resin. The calculated estimates, using the four different meth- ods, indicate the large range of uncertainties in estimat- ing the worldwide cannabis herb and resin production. A final range can be constructed by considering the dif-ferent estimates.

Trends in the world drug markets Cannabis market vary from 13,300-66,100 mt of cannabis herb and 2,200-9,900 mt of cannabis resin. To convert these figures into cultivation area, a distinc- tion should be made between indoor and outdoor culti- vation, since acreage for indoor cultivation is not a very meaningful unit. Indoor cultivation is not area restricted due to the potential use of several floors in one building and the large number of harvests per year. 14 Outdoor cannabis yields can also vary largely, for example, due to climate variances and the use of irrigation, but these yields probably have a smaller range. 15 Assuming aver- 14 Indoor crops can have up to 6 harvests per year, with a yield of 5,000 kg/ha confirmed by several sources. This makes indoor cropping 15-30 times more productive than outdoor crops (Bulletin on Narcot-ics, 2006). 15 Yields vary from 5 kg/ha to 40,000 kg/ha, reflecting ranges between wild cannabis and hydroponically grown cannabis. The median can-nabis yield was 770 kg/ha. Typical yield for outdoor cannabis varies age outdoor yields for herb from 470-1,200 kg/ha (2008 WDR) and assuming that 80-95% of the total produc-tion takes place outside, gives a range of cultivated area varying broadly between 25,800-641,800 ha. For can-nabis resin, yield per hectare could be derived from surveys in Morocco and Afghanistan. The average yield in Morocco, where most cannabis is grown on rain-fed land, was used for the lower estimate, and the yield from Afghanistan, where most cannabis is grown on irrigated land, for the higher estimate. 16 between 470 kg/ha without irrigation to 5,000 kg/ha in well-tended gardens, with figures around 2,000 kg/ha typical for the situation in the USA (as identified through the analysis of data from court cases), and levels around 1,000 kg/ha typical for developing countries. In contrast, hydroponically grown cannabis were found to reach typical yield levels from 15,000-30,000 kg/ha.

Trends in the world drug markets Cannabis market Trends by country Since few countries report the extent of their own can- nabis production, it is difficult to analyze any global trends from these data. However, there are more reports on the origin of cannabis in the market of each country. UNODC collects data on countries of origin of annual and individual seizures through the ARQ and a ques-tionnaire on individual seizures. This information pro-vides some indication of the trends in the main producing countries. The table below shows the main source countries of cannabis herb. The Netherlands, South Africa, Albania, Jamaica and Paraguay have been seen as principal producers of cannabis herb for about 25% of the cannabis herb market, because seized can-nabis originated there. In 2005-2007, Colombia and Nigeria were added to the list. However, almost 76% of the entries refer to source countries which are mentioned less than 10 times in a 3-year period. There are only insignificant changes between the two time periods. Cannabis resin production The picture for cannabis resin is clearer because the production of resin is concentrated in relatively few countries and it is trafficked across borders more often. Morocco is known to be the world's main source of can-nabis resin. The Government of Morocco reported fur-ther reduction of the cannabis production in 2008, reporting 60,000 hectares in production after eradica-tion, following a decrease observed in the 2005 survey by the Government of Morocco and UNODC. This decline is, however, not reflected in the data reported by countries on the origin of their seized cannabis resin. Both in the ARQs and in the Individual Seizure Data-base, Morocco continues to be the principal supplier of resin in the world. In the ARQs, the proportion report-edly of Moroccan origin has increased in the period 2005-2007, compared to 2001-2004. Afghanistan is the second most prominent cannabis resin producer, with a small increase in the figures from the annual seizures. Nine per cent of source countries in 2005-2007 pointed to Afghanistan, compared to 6% in 2001-2004. Another indication of the importance of Afghanistan as a cannabis producer is the report of a very large seizure in 2008, amounting to some 237 mt in one stockpile. 18 Although there is no reliable figure available for cannabis cultivation in Afghanistan in 2008, experts believe that the extent of cannabis produc-tion is approaching the cultivation area of Morocco with steadily increasing production due to the relatively higher prices for cannabis products, compared to opium. At the end of 2008, UNODC performed a baseline study on cannabis cultivation in Afghanistan and identi-fied 20 out of 34 provinces with substantial cannabis cultivation. A first cannabis survey is being planned by the Afghanistan Ministry of Counter Narcotics and UNODC in 2009. India and Nepal are also identified as source countries (4%). Some CIS countries are increasingly (6%) men-tioned as a source for cannabis resin, mainly due to new reports from Azerbaijan, in addition to reports from Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federa-tion and Armenia. Pakistan continues to be an impor-tant source according to both annual and individual seizure information. The Central Asian countries, mainly Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, are only mentioned as sources in the annual seizures. The main production area in Central Asia is the Chu Valley in Kazakhstan where cannabis - for both herb and resin production - grows on extensive wild and cultivated areas, estimated to total more than 300,000 ha. 18 ISAF , 2008, http://www.nato.int/isaf/docu/pressreleases/2008/06- june/pr080611-246.html.Main source countries of cannabis herb according to reported seizures in the ARQs, Table 17: 2005-2007 and 2002-2004 Source: data.

Iran is also mentioned as a source by 3% of the annual seizures as reported in the ARQ. It might be an indication of Iran being increasingly used as a transit country. The Netherlands is mentioned as a country of origin for resin, but it is not clear to what extent the cannabis resin actually originates there. Although the Netherlands is an important producer of cannabis herb, available informa-tion suggests that resin production is limited. The same might be true for other Western European countries such as France, Germany and Belgium that are men-tioned in the annual seizures, but it is not clear to what extent they are transit countries. Albania's importance as an exporter of cannabis in gen- eral and specifically of resin seems to have diminished. Only 3% of the countries mention Albania as an exporter and it seems to be cultivating mostly for local/regional use. 19 Seizures of herbal cannabis from Albania have become very rare in the last five years.20 Lebanon continues to be a source country in the Middle East. Production in Lebanon has declined drastically compared to the early 1990s, but farmers appear to be resuming cannabis cultivation. Overall production and consumption of cannabis resin in the Americas are limited. The most important resin producer in the region is Jamaica (3% of annual sei-zures). Paraguay is also mentioned in 2% of the cases but is more important as a cannabis herb producer. The cultivation area in Paraguay is estimated at 6,000 ha. 21 19 INCSR 2009. 20 World Customs Organization, Customs and Drugs Report 2007. 21 Secretaria Nacional Antidrogas (SENAD), 2008UNODC has had consultations with relevant Govern- ment institutions to conduct a survey in Paraguay to collect more precise information. 22 22 The Government of Brazil has also been involved in the consultations as Brazil is likely to fund the survey.Main source countries of cannabis resin seizures according to the Individual Seizure Table 18: Database in the period 2005-2007 and 2002-2004 Source: UNODC, Individual Seizure Database.

Source: UNODC, Annual Cannabis market Why does cannabis potency matter? Cannabis products dominate the world's illicit drug market. The term cannabis, however, refers to different types of preparations derived from the plant Cannabis sativa, which all contain chemical substances called cannabinoids. The most psychoactive of these substances is -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The amount of THC in a cannabis sample is generally used as a measure of \"cannabis potency\". In recent years, several claims of increased can-nabis potency have been made. One driving force behind the interest in cannabis potency is the possible link to mental health problems. 1 It is thought that high potency cannabis may have the poten-tial to be more harmful. 2 Also significant may be the ratio between THC and cannabidiol (CBD), another cannabi-noid believed to moderate the effect of THC. Consider-ing the large population of cannabis users worldwide, it is important that the link between mental health problems and cannabis potency is understood. What do we know about trends in cannabis potency? A number of studies have been carried out to assess poten- tial changes in potency over time. One of the most compre- hensive was conducted in 2004 by the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and concluded that that a modest increase in aggregate cannabis potency had occurred, possibly related to the use of intensive indoor cultivation methods. The authors noted that THC content nonetheless varied wide-ly. 3 While the United Kingdom Home Office study in 20084 found little change: from a median potency of among samples in 2004/5 com-pared to 15% in 2008, long-term increases have been reported in the United States 5 with an average potency of 10% in 2008. Multiple methodological issues have been raised, which impact on our capacity to generate comparable data and infer trends. 6 Important variables to be considered include the phytochemistry;7 type of cannabis product; cultivation method; sampling; and stability. As detailed below, each of these can affect the potency estimates. Only through examining these factors can we have a more systematic, 1 Ashton CA, Pharmacology and effects of cannabis, a brief review.

Addiction 2008; 103: 1100-09. 7 Phytochemistry refers to the chemical composition of plants. scientific and comparable assessment of cannabis potency between places and over time.8 Plant part used: The secretion of THC is most abundant in the flowering heads and surrounding leaves. The amount of resin secreted is influenced by environmental conditions during growth (light, temperature and humid-ity), sex of the plant, and time of harvest. The THC content varies between parts of the plant: from 10-12 % in flowers, 1-2 % in leaves, 0.1-0.3 % in stalks, to less than 0.03 % in the roots. Product type: There are three main types of cannabis products: herb (marijuana), resin (hashish) and oil (hash oil). Cannabis herb comprises the dried and crushed flow- er-heads and surrounding leaves. It often contains up to 5% THC. Sinsemilla, derived from the unfertilized female plant, can be much more potent, however. Cannabis resin can contain up to 20% THC. The most potent form of cannabis, however, is cannabis oil, derived from the con- centrated resin extract. It may contain more than 60% THC. The increase in market share of a particular prod-uct type can influence the reported average potency values. For example, the reported rise in the average THC content to 10% in seized samples in 2008 by the United States Office of National Drug Control Policy is associ-ated with a market share of 40% for high potency can-nabis (presumably indoor-grown). 9 Cultivation methods: The cannabis plant grows in a variety of climates. The amount and quality of resin produced depends on the temperature, humidity, light and soil acid-ity/alkalinity. Outdoor-produced herbal cannabis, therefore, shows considerable variation in potency. Intensive indoor cultivation of female plants and clones, under artificial light, often without soil (hydroponic cultivation), and optimised cultivation conditions, produces cannabis of a consistently higher potency. Sampling: Most data on cannabis potency are derived from the analysis of seized samples. This means that these samples need to be representative of the entire seizure so that infer-ences and extrapolations can be made. Stability: THC is converted to cannabinol on exposure to air and light. This process reduces the THC concentra- tion, especially in old samples which have not been stored under suitable conditions (such as a dark, cool place). It is believed that claims of increases in potency of cannabis preparations confiscated over a period of 18 years in the United States 10 may have been affected by the stability of THC in old samples. 8 Hunt N, Lenton S, and Witton J, Cannabis and mental health: Responses to the Emerging Evidence.

Journal of Forensic Science 2000; 45:24-301.3.3 Trafficking 98World Drug Report 2009 Seizures of cannabis herb and resin Global seizures of both cannabis herb and resin increased in 2007. Seizures of cannabis herb amounted to 5,600 mt, whereas for resin, the total was some 1,300 mt. An overwhelming proportion of all cannabis herb seizures was made in the Americas (82%), mainly in Mexico and the USA, which together accounted for almost two thirds of global herb seizures. Most of the global increase in cannabis resin seizures was due to a strong increase in West and Central Europe, where seizures were up 33% compared to 2006. The two main cannabis products, cannabis herb (also known as marijuana), and cannabis resin (commonly marketed under the name hashish), are considerably dif-ferent in several aspects. The production areas for can-nabis resin are much more limited in geographic terms than those of cannabis herb. Moreover, consumption of cannabis resin is concentrated in, although not limited to, West and Central Europe, while the use of cannabis herb is widespread. Thus, quite different regional and international trafficking and seizure patterns become apparent when comparing cannabis herb and resin. A specific feature of cannabis herb is that sizable amounts are thought to be produced in the countries of con-sumption. This is likely to lower the probability of can-nabis being seized by customs and border authorities, which in many countries contribute heavily to the over- all amount of drugs seized. In spite of this, a much higher number of countries and territories reported sei-zures of cannabis herb (165) to UNODC in the period 2005-2007 than cannabis resin (120), which can be taken as an indication of its wider use and its broader geographical spread. Cannabis herb seizures amounted to 5,605 mt in 2007, whereas resin seizures amounted to 1,300 mt. Both herb and resin seizures were higher in 2007 than in 2006 and 2005. However, comparing total seizures during this period, the total is still lower than in 2002-2004, when global seizures of cannabis reached record highs. Small quantities of cannabis oil were also seized in 2007 (equivalent to 418 kg). The majority of cannabis herb seizures in 2007 were reported from Mexico (39% of the world total), fol-lowed by the USA (26%), Bolivia (Plurinational State of) (8%), Nigeria (4%), Morocco (4%), Colombia (3%) and Paraguay (3%). South Africa and Malawi, which had ranked third and fourth in 2006 after the USA and Mexico, reported much lower seizures in 2007. Most seizures of cannabis resin, on the other hand, were made by Spain (50%), followed by Morocco (9%), Iran (Islamic Republic of) (7%), Pakistan (8%), Afghanistan (6%), Belgium (5%), Portugal (3%) and France (3%). 176 countries and territories reported cannabis seizures (both herb and resin) to UNODC in the period 2005-2007. Most cannabis herb seizures are reported by North America In contrast to other drugs, trafficking in cannabis herb continues to be mostly intraregional. In 2007, an over-whelming proportion of all cannabis herb seizures was made in the Americas (82%), mainly in Mexico (2,177 mt) and the USA (1,447 mt), which together accounted for almost two thirds of global herb seizures. Cannabis herb seizures increased both in the USA and Mexico in 2007 compared to the previous year. South America including Central America and the Caribbean accounted for 17% of global cannabis herb seizures. The largest seizures were made in Bolivia (Plurinational State of) (424 mt), which reported over Cannabis herb and resin seizures (mt), Fig. 55: 1985-2007 Source: UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire / 19952000 2005Metric tons Cannabis herb Cannabis resin991. Trends in the world drug markets Cannabis market three times more cannabis herb seizures than in 2006, followed by Colombia (183 mt), Paraguay (172 mt), Argentina (75 mt) and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) (25 mt). In the period 2005-2007, Paraguay was mentioned as the source of cannabis herb seized in South America more often than other countries in the region. However, many other countries were mentioned as well, including Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. Paraguay was also reported several times as the source of cannabis resin. Large seizures were also made in Africa, accounting for 11% of global cannabis herb seizures. In 2007, more seizures were made in Morocco, several West African countries and Kenya. Less seizures were reported from Egypt, Malawi and South Africa, which resulted in an overall decline in herb seizures for Africa as a region compared to one year earlier. The largest cannabis herb seizures made in Asia - which accounted for 4 % of all seizures in 2007 - were reported by India (108 mt), followed by Indonesia (32 mt), Kaza-khstan (22 mt), Thailand (15 mt) and Nepal (8 mt). Cannabis herb seizures in Europe - representing 3% of the world total in 2007 - increased slightly but remained well below the seizure levels reached between 1997 and 2004. As in 2006, the largest seizures were reported by the Russian Federation (27 mt), T urkey (26 mt) and the United Kingdom (20 mt). 1 Europe is the only region which also \"imports\" significant amounts of cannabis herb from other regions. Oceania reported only a small fraction of global seizures in 2007 (2.7 mt), most of which was reported by Aus-tralia (2.4 mt). Main cannabis resin trafficking routes run from Morocco and South-West Asia to West and Central Europe In 2007, global cannabis resin seizures increased by 29% and accounted for 1,296 mt, which was higher than in most years since 1985 with the exception of 2003 and 2004. A large number of countries reported resin sei-zures in the period 2003-2007 though this was smaller than the number of countries reporting seizures of can-nabis herb. T rafficking patterns seem to follow the estab-lished routes from the two main resin production areas in Morocco and South-West Asia to the main consump-tion areas in West and Central Europe. As the consump-tion of cannabis resin is mainly concentrated in West and Central Europe, trafficking to other regions, as reflected in seizures, took place at a far lower level. 1 Data refer to England and Wales only. Most seizures of cannabis resin reported by countries of West and Central Europe Most of the global increase in cannabis resin seizures was due to a 33% increase in West and Central Europe, compared to 2006. In 2007, 849 mt - two thirds of global cannabis resin seizures - were made in West and Central Europe. Cannabis resin seized in Europe continued to originate mainly from Morocco. Spain accounted for 50% of global resin seizures, and for 77% of seizures in the West and Central Europe subregion. In 2007, resin seizures in Spain increased by 42% compared to the previous year, and in Morocco, the increase was 33%. Despite an increase in cannabis resin seizures in Europe, the amounts seized in 2006 and 2007 were still lower than those reported in 2003 and 2004. Morocco accounted for most cannabis seizures made in Africa (118 mt), followed by Algeria (17 mt) and Egypt (6 mt), both of which also reported higher seizures than in 2006. While most cannabis resin produced in Morocco is destined for Europe, trafficking also takes place to or via North African and sub-Saharan coun-tries. In 2007, as in the year before, South West Asia reported the second highest cannabis seizures worldwide, repre- senting 22% of the global total. Most seizures in the region were made by Pakistan (8% of global seizures or 110 mt), followed by Iran (Islamic Republic of) (7% or 90 mt) and Afghanistan (6% or 84 mt). Cannabis resin seizures more than doubled in Iran and Afghanistan, while they remained at about the same level in Pakistan. The strong increase in cannabis resin seizures in this subregion confirms its role as an important cannabis resin producer. A rapid assessment of cannabis con-ducted by UNODC in 2008 confirmed the existence of cannabis cultivation for resin production in most prov-inces in Afghanistan. Most of the cannabis resin produced in the region is trafficked towards Europe. However, reports confirm that some cannabis resin originating in South-West Asia also reached other Asian as well as North American countries. South Asia reported about 6 mt or 0.5% of global sei- zures in 2007. India (3.8 mt) and Nepal (2.1 mt) con-tinued to report the majority of cannabis resin seizures made in the region. Both countries are considered to be cannabis resin producers. 100World Drug Report 2009 Global seizures of cannabis herb, 1997-2007 Fig. 56: Year 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Metric 0000, 0000, 0000, 0000, 000 North America (66%) South America (16%) North Africa (5%) West and Central Africa (4%) South Asia (2%) Southern Africa (2%) East and South-East Asia (1%) West & Central Europe (1%) Caribbean (1%) East Africa (0.8%) East Europe (0.7%) Southeast Europe (0.7%) Central Asia and Transcaucasian countries (0.5%) Central America (0.2%) Oceania (0%) Near and Middle East /South-West Asia (0%)SEIZURES OF CANNABIS HERB in % of world total and kg- HIGHEST RANKING COUNTRIES - 2007 SEIZURES OF CANNABIS HERB in kg and % - BY REGION - 200701,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,000 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007Metric tons1011.

This year, significant revisions were made to the approach taken in making global and regional estimates of the number of people who use drugs. The new estimates reflect the uncertainties surrounding these data (which exist due to data gaps and quality) and are presented in ranges rather than absolute numbers. Because of this revision, previous point estimates are not comparable to the current ones.

Trends in the world drug markets Cannabis market Use stabilizing or declining in North America Cannabis use declined in North America over the last decade. In 2007/08 it seems to have stabilized at the lower levels. Drug tests, which are regularly conducted among the US workforce, found a decline in the proportion of positive cannabis tests among the general US workforce from 3.4% in 1997 to 2.3% in 2007, equivalent to a decline of 31% over the last decade. The figures suggest that the USA may be heading towards a stabilization of cannabis use at around 2%. In 2008 2.1% of the work-force tested positiv for cannabis. The decrease can also be observed in the total popula- tion using household data. Over the 2002-2007 period the annual prevalence of cannabis use declined gradually, from 11% of the population aged 12 and above in 2002 to 10.1% in 2007. The last national Canadian Addiction Survey (CAS), conducted in 2004, found a prevalence rate of 14.1% among the population aged 15 and above 1 - thus exceed- ing the prevalence of cannabis use in the USA. The highest levels of cannabis use were reported in the 1 Health Canada, Canadian Addiction Survey (CAS), Detailed Report, March 2005. province of British Columbia, located at the Pacific coast (16.8%). Though data show that the differences across provinces in Canada or across states in the USA are not negligible, it should be pointed out that the Estimates of cannabis use for the People's Republic of China A number of indirect indicators, including seizures, arrest data and treatment data, suggest that cannabis use in the People's Republic of China is significantly lower than in other East and South-East Asian countries. China has so far, however, not undertaken any national household survey of illicit drug use. No national estimate of cannabis use exists. One World Health Organization (WHO) school survey, conducted in 2003 in four cities, assessed drug use. It found lifetime prevalence rates of drug use among 13-15 year old pupils ranging from 0.9% in Beijing to 2.5% in Hangzhou (eastern China). The unweighted average of the four cities was 1.75%. In comparison, the lifetime prevalence of drug use among 13-15 year old pupils in Thailand in 2008 was 6.1%. A 2007 Thai household survey found an annual prevalence of cannabis use of 1.2% among the general population (aged 12-65). In the Philippines, data from a 2003 WHO school survey among 13-15 year old students (life-time prevalence of 6.7%) was similarly far higher than a recent household survey estimate (annual prevalence of around 0.8% in 2008). In the regional estimate calculated for cannabis use, all countries with no national data available, including China, were assigned the range from other countries in the region. This means that there was a wide range applied from existing national prevalence estimates, namely from 0.23% to 1.34% UNODC has not applied the school data estimate for China to make an estimate for 15-64 year olds across the country, because it was based on only four cities that do not necessarily reflect the national picture of cannabis use. This means that the regional and global range of estimated cannabis users is very large, because of the sheer size of China's population. However, using such an estimate would reduce the range of uncertainty in the estimates for Asia by 25%. This highlights the great importance that estimates of the level of drug use in the world's populous countries (and in this case, their absence) has upon our confidence in global figures.

A significant decline in cannabis use over the last few years was found among high school students in North America. Cannabis use among 8th-12th graders in the USA fell by 21% between 1998 and 2008. A decline in cannabis use over the last decade was also reported among high-school students in the province of Ontario, Canada. Increases reported in Latin America In contrast to the declining trend in North America, increases in cannabis use have been reported in coun-tries in Latin America and the Caribbean in recent years, notably in 2007. Eleven countries reported rising levels of cannabis use in 2007, up from seven in 2005. Seven countries saw a stable trend, but not a single country reported a decline in 2007. The increase across the region was also identified by the Latin American Epide-miological Network (REDLA). 2 Despite the increasing trend, cannabis use levels are still significantly lower in South America than in North America, as reflected in data collected in school surveys and household surveys. Comparative household surveys among the general pop- ulation were conducted in six South American states in 2006/07 by UNODC and the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD). These identified the highest levels of cannabis use in Chile, followed by Argentina and Uruguay. Far lower levels were reported in Peru and Ecuador. In Argentina, the 2006 household survey showed an 2 CICAD Observer, \"REDLA Network Identified Worrisome T rends in Drug Use across Latin America\", June 2008, http://www.cicad. oas.org/oid/NEW/Information/Observer/08_01/REDLA.aspincrease in the annual prevalence rate from 3.7% in 1999 to 6.9% in 2006, among the population aged 12-65. Moreover, studies among high school students in Argentina (aged 13-17) showed an increase in the annual prevalence rate of cannabis use from 3.5% in 2001 to 8.1% in 2007. A clear upward trend is also reflected in data from neigh- bouring Uruguay. Following moderate use rates in the 1990s, the annual prevalence of cannabis use rose quad-rupled, from 1.3% among the population aged 15-65 in 2001 to 5.3% in 2007. An increase in cannabis use was also reported in Brazil, the largest country in South America. The annual prev-alence of cannabis use more than doubled, from 1% in 2001 to 2.6% in 2005 3 and - according to the Brazilian authorities it appears to have continued rising in subse-quent years. Strong increases in cannabis use were also reported in Chile. The annual prevalence of cannabis use rose from 3.7% in 1994 to 7.5% in 2006. 3 CEBRID, 2006 and Sao Paolo 2002.Cannabis use in selected South Fig. 61: countries in 2008.

Trends in the world drug markets Cannabis market Cannabis use is increasing in Africa From a total of 21 African countries reporting cannabis use trends for 2007, 7 countries saw use levels rising and 4 countries reported a decline. The rest were stable. These data suggest that overall cannabis use continued to rise in Africa in 2007. The increase, however, may be losing momentum. While 7 African countries saw an increase in cannabis use in 2007, the comparable num-bers were 12 in 2006 and 18 in 2004. The only systematic monitoring of drug use in Africa is taking place in South Africa, based on treatment demand. Data for South Africa suggest that treatment demand for cannabis use increased over the first two quarters of 2008. Including alcohol, cannabis accounted for 23.5% of substance abuse-related treatment demand in South Africa during this period. In many European countries, use is stabilizing or declining In contrast, cannabis use in Europe has stabilized or shown a downward trend in a number of countries. Increased prevention efforts and the spread of knowledge on the health risks, partly related to the emergence of high-potency cannabis, seems to have contributed to the stabilization or downward trend. Some of the stabiliza-tion/decline may be linked to decreases of cannabis resin production in Morocco, Europe's main source country of hashish, though such supply reductions seem to have been partly offset by rising levels of cannabis herb pro-duction within Europe. In the UK, which used to be Europe's largest cannabis market, a clear downward trend has been observed in recent years. In England and Wales cannabis use fell from a prevalence rate of 10.9% among the population aged 16-59 in 2002/03 to 7.4% in 2007/08. The decline among youth started several years before the decline among the general population. In fact, annual preva-lence of cannabis use among people aged 16-24 fell from 28.2% in 1998 to 17.9% in 2007/08, a decline of 37% over the last decade. The overall prevalence estimate for the United Kingdom as a whole would be around 8.1%, equivalent to some 3.2 million persons. In Spain, an important cannabis market due to its stra- tegic location close to the main cannabis resin produc-tion centers of Morocco, household survey data showed a moderate decline, from a peak of 11.3% of the popula-tion aged 15-64 in 2003 to 10.1% in 2007. Data sug-gest that the strong upward trend over the 1993-2003 period has thus started being reversed. The total number of cannabis users in Spain is now estimated at around 3 million persons.

Cannabis use seems to have remained stable in the Neth- erlands, one of the key cannabis production and redis-tribution centres in Europe. Available household survey data, however, only reflect the situation over the first few years of the new millennium (5.5% in 2001 and 5.4% in 2005). Despite this stabilization, treatment demand related to cannabis abuse increased strongly between 2000 and 2005, possibly reflecting the emergence and spread of higher-potency cannabis on the market. The number of (outpatient) addiction care clients with pri-mary cannabis problems rose by more than 75% between 2000 and 2005. 4 The average THC content of domesti- cally grown Dutch marijuana almost doubled, from 8.6% in 2000 to 16% in 2007. Following increases in the 1990s, cannabis use levels also remained quite stable in some of the new Central Euro- pean EU member states, including Poland (2.8% in 2002; 2.7% in 2006), the Czech Republic (10.9% in 2002; 9.3% in 2004) and Slovakia (7.2% in 2000; 6.9% in 2006). 4 T rimbos Instituut, The Netherlands National Drug Monitor, Annual Report 2007, Utrecht 2008. ... although use is increasing in some European countries In contrast, cannabis use appears to have increased in some of the countries at the geographical fringes of Europe such as Ireland, Portugal, Bulgaria, Latvia and Finland. However, some of these increases were small and not statistically significant. The situation is different for Italy, where the cannabis prevalence rates more than doubled in recent years (7.1% in 2003; 14.6% in 2007). Italy has evolved as Europe's single largest cannabis market, with some 5.7 million users in 2007, out of a total of about 30 million users in Europe. This reflected, inter alia, widespread availability of cannabis herb from Albania and the Neth- erlands, and rising domestic production in southern Italy. In contrast to many other European countries, the average cannabis potency has remained stable in Italy, fluctuating at around 6%, which is a low level by Euro- pean standards. This may explain that the negative con- sequences of cannabis consumption, found in many other European countries, may have been less obvious in Italy. Despite of the increases in cannabis use in Italy, overall cannabis use in Europe remained basically stable.England & Wales, France, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Sweden: Fig. 65: annual prevalence of cannabis use in % of the young and adult populationa a England and Wales in % of population aged 16-59; France: in % of population aged 15-64; Germany: in % of population aged 18-59 , 1995-2003; in % of population aged 18-64 in 2006; Denmark: in % of population aged 16+ in 1990 and in % of population aged 16-64 in 2005; Austria: in % of population 15-65. * UNODC estimate for Austria for 1984 extrapolated from results of a national study in 1984 among 15-40 ye ar olds; UNODC estimate for 2002 based on several local studies conducted around 2002, reported in UNODC's 2004 World Drug Report.

Trends in the world drug markets Cannabis market Cannabis use declined in the Oceania region The downward trend of cannabis use in the Oceania region continued. The annual prevalence rate of canna-bis use in Australia fell by almost one fifth to 9.1% of the population aged 14 and above between 2004 and 2007. The decline was strongest among the 14-19-year-olds, falling by 28%, indicating that prevention activi-ties in schools may have played a key role in lowering cannabis use. Household survey data for New Zealand also showed a decline of cannabis use in recent years, though this was less pronounced than in Australia. The annual preva-lence of cannabis use fell from 20.4% among the popu-lation aged 15-45 in 2003 to 17.9% in 2007, a decline of 12%. Cannabis use appears to be rising in Asia According to expert opinion, expressed by the national drug authorities reporting to UNODC, cannabis use appears to be rising in Asia. However, most countries in this region do not have effective drug abuse monitoring systems which means that no recent cannabis prevalence data exist. T rends from Asia - largely based on expert perceptions - must thus be treated with caution. The number of Asian countries reporting an increase in cannabis consumption rose from 9 in 2005 to 13 in 2007. Increases in 2007 were reported by Azerbaijan, the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, the Islamic Repub-lic of Iran, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Mongolia, Myanmar, Oman, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan and Uzbeki-stan. Six countries/territories reported a decline, whereas 11 reported stable levels of cannabis use in 2007.Australia: annual prevalence of Fig. 67: cannabis use among the population aged 14 and above, 1998-2007 Source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2007 National Drug Strategy Household Survey, April 2008.

Ecstasy-group2 production was between 72 and 137 mt. As amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) can be produced virtually anywhere at relatively low cost, the locations of production are changing rapidly. Moreover, organized criminal groups are increasing the size and sophistication of manufacturing operations. A record level of nearly 52 mt of ATS was seized world- wide in 2007. The amphetamines-group dominates ATS seizures, but there was also a marked increase in ecstasy-group seizures in 2007. T rafficking in ATS substances is most commonly intraregional, but precursor chemicals from which ATS materials are made are trafficked throughout the world. Clear regional distinctions can be seen in ATS use pat- terns. In East and South-East Asia, users primarily con-sume methamphetamine. In the Near and Middle East, tablets sold as Captagon often contain amphetamine, and are used throughout the region. In Europe, users primarily consume amphetamine. Worldwide, between 16 and 51 million people aged 15-64 used ampheta- mines-group substances at least once in 2007, whereas the number who used ecstasy-group drugs is estimated at between 12 and 24 million worldwide. 1 The amphetamines-group substances include predominately metham- phetamine and amphetamine, but also non-specified amphetamines (for example, tablets sold as Captagon, methcathinone, fenetylline, methylphenidate and others). 2 The ecstasy-group substances include predominately MDMA, MDA and MDEA/MDE. However, limited forensic capacity often leads to confusion about the actual content of tablets believed to be \"ecstasy\" (MDMA).1.4.2 Production Global amphetamine-group manufacture estimated between 230 and 640 mt; ecstasy 72 and 137 mt Clandestine ATS manufacture can, and does, occur nearly everywhere. The output, however, can only be indirectly estimated, using information on use of ATS around the world and/or information about seizures. In the 2009 World Drug Report the estimates are based on the number of users and their yearly average consumption. 3 UNODC estimates that in 2007, amphetamines-group manufacture amounted to between 230 and 640 metric tons. Ecstasy-group manufacture was estimated at between 72 and 137 mt. Due to the revised methodol-ogy, estimates are not comparable with previous reports. Based on these estimates and reported seizures, the global interception range is estimated to range between 7% to 19% for amphetamines-group and from 6% to 12% for ecstasy. 4 Interception rates for regions, subre- gions, and individual Member States vary considerably more than the global rates. 3 Previously, UNODC utilized a multiple component model to trian- gulate ATS manufacture based on three sub-components: (i) global seizures of ATS end-products (drug seizures), (ii) seizures of ATS-re-lated chemical precursor seizures, and (iii) ATS consumption (preva-lence rates). See Ecstasy and Amphetamines - A Global Survey 2003. 4 Similar orders of magnitude were identified in a study of interception rates in New Zealand (2%-7% for amphetamines-group substances and 5%-17% for ecstasy-group substances).

Centre for Social and Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation (Auckland).1171. Trends in the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market availability of inexpensive precursor chemicals. These were concentrated in North America (particularly the USA), and to a lesser extent Oceania, and Central and Eastern Europe. Methamphetamine laboratories are also increasingly found in large industrial-sized operations run by large criminal organizations, particularly in East and South-East Asia and North America, although sig- nificant operations recently emerged in South Asia. Amphetamine and ecstasy (MDMA) operations tend to be fewer in numbers, but have more sophisticated oper-ations. They require more specialized equipment, pre-cursor chemicals and more sophisticated skills. Amphetamine operations are reported from all of Europe, with the notable exception of the Czech Repub-lic and neighbouring countries. 8 Ecstasy-group manu- facture appears relatively stable, with a significant albeit declining proportion of the world's manufacture con- tinuing to occur in Europe (West and Central subre-gions). Outside Europe, significant manufacture of ecstasy now occurs in North America, Oceania, and East and South-East Asia, as operations have shifted closer to those consumer markets. USA laboratory count drops; driving global decline The majority of global ATS laboratories are metham- phetamine laboratories reported from North America. 8 One notable exception to this is methamphetamine (Pervitin) manu- facture located in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and to a lesser degree in neighbouring countries.ATS laboratories (all sizes) reported to UNODC, by type, 1998-2007 Fig. 68: Source: UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire Data / DELTA. 1,86818,643 6,990 04,0008,00012,00016,00020,000Laboratory-related incidents (#) Other synthetics 34 66 19 5 24 69 53 64 30 26 Ecstasy Group 34 62 64 70 58 50 87 62 56 72 Amphetamine (& combinations) 142 257 336 357 376 475 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Number of reported ATS laboratory incidents (all sizes), by notable region, 1998-2007 Fig. 69: Source: UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire Data / DELTA. 18,643 6,990 -2004006008001,0001,2001,400 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007ATS laboratories in selected regions (#) 05,00010,00015,00020,000Total (and USA) ATS laboratories (#) Oceania West & Central Europe East and South-East Asia East and Southeast Europe Southern Africa USA (right-scale) Global (right scale) 118World Drug Report 2009 Despite the declining incidents, US laboratories still amount to 82% of the total reported in 2007. The count of laboratories alone does not provide accurate informa-tion on the size of manufacturing given that the scale of operation may differ between laboratories. 9 The most commonly used ATS chemical precursors fall under international control, and their seizures-reported to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)can provide some limited indications about manu-facturing trends. Seizures of ATS-related precursor chemicals under international control were 45 mt in 2007, 10 which is an increase from 2006, but still a low level in a 10-year perspective.11 Global seizures of ATS precursors in 2007 included: Amphetamines-group s Methamphetamine - 25.3 mt of pseudoephedrine and 22.1 mt of ephedrine, sucient to manufacture some 31.7mt of methamphetamine. Amphetamine - 1.2 mt norephedrine, sucient to manufacture 770 kg of amphetamine; - 834 litres (l) of P-2-P , 12 sucient 9 As yet, there are no internationally accepted forensic reporting stand- ards for clandestine laboratory operations, their chemical precursors, synthesis routes, drugs produced, and manufacture capacity (such as frequency of cycle, amount of output, and purity levels), thus limiting the overall analytical value of simple counts of laboratory incidents. 10 Expressed in ATS drug weight equivalents. 11 International Narcotics Control Board (2009), Precursors and chemi- cals frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, 2008.

ATS producers adapt to evade law enforcement There are signs that criminal organizations are adapting their manufacturing operations to avoid control by: 1) utilizing precursor chemicals not under international control; 2) moving manufacturing operations to more vulnerable locations; and 3) shifting precursor chemicals and drug trafficking routes to new locations to avoid detection. 15 Evidence points to increased frequency of manufactur-ing ATS using uncontrolled precursors, most notably tableted pharmaceutical preparations 16 containing amphetamine, a process more commonly seen in North America and to a lesser degree in Oceania. 13 Phenylacetic acid is used in illicit manufacture to synthesize the amphetamines-group precursor P-2-P and is therefore a 'pre-precur-sor.' 14 Also known as PMK (piperonyl methyl ketone). 15 Amphetamines and Ecstasy: 2008 Global ATS Assessment (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.08.XI.12). 16 Pharmaceutical preparations are drugs intended for human or veteri-Reported seizures of ATS precursors, expressed in metric ton ATS equivalents, 1998-2007 Fig. 70: Source: UNODC calculations based on INCB data and conversion factors.

Over-the-counter cold medicines in pill form or bulk precursors tableted into pill form would be classified as pharmaceuti-cal preparations and are increasingly used in clandestine manufac-ture. 17 The term pseudo/ephedrine refers to both or either ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. 18 International Narcotics Control Board, Trafficking in Pharmaceutical Preparations for the Illicit Manufacture of ATS, presented at the 52nd Commission on Narcotic Drugs (March 17, 2009, Vienna). 19 In January 2009, Mexican authorities reportedly seized more than 8 million pseudoephedrine tablets (equivalent to 3 mt) aboard a ship which embarked from South Korea. (Guadalajara Reporter, Police seize eight million illegal pills in Manzanillo, 31 January, 2009.) 20 Amphetamines-group substances synthesized via P-2-P can result in either amphetamine or methamphetamine, but outside of Europe they more commonly result in methamphetamine.ATS manufacture is rapidly spreading to vulnerable locations As awareness, restrictions and enforcement against ATS manufacture increase in known problem areas, manufac-ture has expanded into vulnerable nearby countries. For example, from the USA manufacture shifted south to Mexico. As Mexico responded with strong counter-methamphetamine initiatives manufacturing activities moved south to Latin America, including Argentina, Guatemala, Honduras, and Peru. Similar shifts may also be occurring in South Asia where India and Sri Lanka reported their first operational methamphetamine labo-ratories in 2008, and reported seized manufacturing equipment and chemicals in 2007. 21 T rafficking routes are increasingly shifting into places that lack the stability, enforcement and forensics infra-structure to detect movement of both precursor chemi-cals and finished products. 22 Methamphetamine manufacture shifts rapidly North America, which accounts for most of the reported methamphetamine operations globally, saw a decline in 2007 (17%). The USA accounts for 82% of the total number of methamphetamine laboratories seized in 2007, a figure which has been in decline since nation-wide pharmaceutical precursor controls were enacted in 2005. 23 However, preliminary reports for 200824 sug- gest that manufacture may be rebounding in the USA, as illustrated by increases in US clandestine laboratory incidents and increased \"smurfing\" activity. 25 The number of laboratories reported by Mexico and Canada remains comparatively small, although the size of the laboratories may on average be larger. 26 There is 21 UNODC, Global SMART Update 2009, Volume 1 (March). Since 2003 India has reported several attempts at methamphetamine- related manufacture, none of which came to fruition. 22 Amphetamines and Ecstasy: 2008 Global ATS Assessment (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.08.XI.12). 23 Incidents are defined to include all counts of various types of labs (for example, extraction, manufacturing, cutting and packaging), chemi-cal dumpsites, and drug processing chemical and glassware seizures. 24 US Department of Justice (2008).

Johnstown, PA. 25 Smurfing-unique to methamphetamine manufacture-is a term used to describe the emergence of groups who shop multiple pharmacies making many small purchases of pharmaceutical precursor chemi-cals, thereby avoiding sales restrictions and law enforcement atten-tion. This phenomenon, also known as pill or pharmacy shopping, or pseudo-running, and has occurred in other places where over-the-counter pharmaceuticals used in the manufacture in metham-phetamine have become restricted (for example, Australia and New Zealand). 26 The USA reported 11 large to industrial-sized laboratories in 2007, while Mexico and Canada reported 22 and 17 laboratories, respec-tively.

Seventy-five predominately methamphetamine laboratories were reported in 2007, an annual increase of nearly 50% since 2005. The sophistication and size of these operations are significant, as seen when authorities in Guangdong seized one of the largest methampheta-mine laboratories ever discovered, along with 1.7 mt of liquefied methamphetamine. 33 The increase in Keta- mine34 manufacture can be seen clearly in the number of clandestine laboratories reported (from 17 in 2006 to 44 in 2007) as demand for the drug increases through-out the region, particularly in Hong Kong, China. The source for much of the tableted form of metham- phetamine ('yaba') found in East and South-East Asia occurs within Myanmar 35, as precursors enter from porous borders from India, China and Thailand. 31 Amphetamines and Ecstasy: 2008 Global ATS Assessment (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.08.XI.12). 32 Information based on 92 mentions of the origin of seized metham- phetamines.

While it is not an ATS it is increasingly encountered in ATS markets, either in connection with the \"club-drug\" scene, or found knowingly or unknowingly as an active ingredient in what is sold on illicit markets as 'ecstasy'. Ketamine is not currently under international control. 35 There are indications that high potency crystalline methampheta- mine is also being manufactured there.North America methamphetamine laboratories reported (all sizes), 1998-2007 Fig. 72: Source: UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire Data / DELTA 17 222 61,6045,700 -204060 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007Laboratories (#) 06,00012,00018,000USA laboratories (#) Canada Mexico USA (right-scale)1211. Trends in the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market Manufacture is allegedly controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), the Shan State Army-South (SSA- S)36 and groups in the Kokang Autonomous Region, and are increasingly trafficked throughout the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). 37 In 2007, only five tablet- ing facilities were reported. However, reports from neighbouring countries suggest that the number of clandestine manufacturing operations is significantly higher 38 than seizures would suggest. The Philippines remains a significant source of high potency crystalline methamphetamine ('shabu') used both domestically and exported to locations in East and South East Asia and Oceania. Manufacture often occurs in industrial-sized laboratories operated by tran-snational organized crime with most chemists being foreign nationals. 39 In 2007, a notable increase in the seizure of methamphetamine-related manufacturing facilities was reported with nine significant laboratories (and an additional 13 chemical warehouses) seized, increasing in 2008 to 10 laboratories, marking the 36 UNODC Regional Crime Centre for Asia and the Pacific.

For example, significant methamphetamine-related manufacture was first reported in Cambodia in 2007 and Viet Nam in 2005. 41 Indonesia and Malaysia have reported increasing inci- dents, size and sophistication of ATS manufacture. Operations discovered there are some of the world's larg-est and most sophisticated industrial-sized operations to date, both requiring an unprecedented level of logistical support to fully operate. 42 In 2007/08 Indonesian authorities reported ketamine findings at several clan- destine methamphetamine laboratories, raising the pos-sibility that local manufacture of ketamine may also occur as its use increases. 43 40 Country report by the Philippines (UNODC/HONLAP/2009/32/ CRP .6).

The authorities estimate that it could be used to synthe-size 630 kg of methamphetamine. 48 However, most clandestine operations detected appear to be using domestically diverted pharmaceutical precursors. There is still a risk that manufacturing could become established in other countries in Oceania, as seven of the countries are not yet parties to the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. 49 Methamphetamine manufacture in Europe is lim-ited to Central and Eastern Europe In Europe, methamphetamine manufacture is largely limited to a number of countries in Central Europe and East Europe (405 cases in 2007). Compared to 2006, a 15% decline was noted in total laboratories reported to UNODC. However, inconsistencies in reporting makes it difficult to compare the figures. 50 The majority of operations are small scale and the main producing coun-try is the Czech Republic (96%).

Trends in the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market The number of Czech Republic methamphetamine (Pervitin) laboratories reported in 2007 (388) suggests that a possible stabilization-at a high level-may be occurring. In this country, the majority of metham-phetamine synthesis utilizes tableted pharmaceutical preparations. This shows in the estimated 82% of domestic pharmaceutical sales which were used for illicit manufacture. 52 New 2009 restrictions limiting the sale of pharmaceutical preparations containing pseudoephe-drine may impact the methamphetamine production in the Czech Republic. There are emerging reports of increased methampheta- mine manufacture throughout the Baltic countries. Poland, known as a source of amphetamine, reported its first methamphetamine laboratory in 2007. There are also reports of manufacturing of considerable scale in Lithuania. In South Africa, methamphetamine laboratories outpace methcathinone South Africa dismantled 12 clandestine methampheta- mine ('tik') laboratories in 2007, a decline from 2006 (17). However, for the first time the number of meth-amphetamine laboratories seized outpaced those of methcathinone ( , 10 reported in 2007).53 While declining, South Africa legally imports significant amounts of licit ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, how- Europol contribution to the Expert Consultations for the UNGASS assessment.

Operations that manufacture only amphetamine declined by 23% to 118 in 2007. Most of these operations are located in Europe (81%) followed by the Americas (17%). Over the last decade (1998-2007) Europe has reported the dismantling of 971 clandestine amphetamine labo-ratories (72% of the global total). The largest numbers of dismantled operations were reported by the Russian Federation (61% of the European total), Poland (13%), the Netherlands (10%), Germany (4%), the UK (3%), Belgium and Bulgaria (2% each). For 2007, the largest number of European operations were in the Russian Federation (62), 56 followed by Poland (13), Belgium (7) and Germany and the Netherlands (5 each). The low figures reported by Belgium, Netherlands and Poland may not be indicative of manufacture capacity. Member States in the ARQ often mention these coun-tries as the source of seized amphetamine. 57 P-2-P is the most common precursor chemical used in the illicit manufacture of amphetamine throughout Europe, where it accounted for 93% of the global sei-zures reported to the INCB in 2007. 58 However, total P-2-P seized in Europe in 2007 amounted to only 773 litres (l), the lowest levels in the new millennium. Only four countries, Germany (243 l), Poland (241 l), the Russian Federation (191 l) and Estonia (51 l), reported seizures. Small amounts of phenylacetic acid (used to make P-2-P) were seized in 2007 by Bulgaria (50 kg) and Lithuania (106 kg). Organized crime operating in the Netherlands and to a lesser extent Belgium still dominate the major manufac-ture of synthetic drugs. Greater sophistication of opera-tions has been noted by Europol, as increased laboratory sizes, higher capacity tableting machinery and segrega-tion of the production cycle to safeguard operations become more commonplace. 59 55 Many countries do not have the forensic capabilities to differenti- ate between various types of ATS operations. These counts include amphetamine, non-specified amphetamine and those laboratories that manufactured multiple products, but exclude clearly identified laboratories of methamphetamine, ecstasy (MDMA), and other syn-thetic (fir example methcathinone) laboratories. 56 Note figures may also include methamphetamine operations. 57 Information based on 321 mentions on the origin of amphetamine seizures between 2002 and 2007. 58 International Narcotics Control Board (2009).

There are several indications that undetected ampheta-mine manufacture may already be occurring in the Near and Middle East. 60 Significant ecstasy manufacture in Europe, North America, Oceania, and East and South-East Asia Ecstasy-group laboratories totalled 72 in 2007, which is higher than 2006, but similar to levels seen in recent years. Manufacture in 2007 was reported in just eight countries: Australia (19), Indonesia (16), Canada (14), USA (12), Netherlands (8), France (1), Mexico (1) and Spain (1). Operationally, ecstasy manufacture (predomi-nately MDMA) is more demanding than the manufac-ture of new ATS. It requires increased skills, specialized equipment, and precursor chemicals. Nearly all MDMA operations are large enough to be economically profita-ble, thus the low number of laboratories may not be a sign of low production. The most significant development in ecstasy-group manufacture has been the shift of operations from West and Central Europe to locations closer to consumers around the world. 2002/03 marked the period when greater numbers of laboratories were seized in regions 2007 .

Trends in the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market outside Europe, most notably North America, Oceania, and East and South-East Asia. Several instances of Euro-pean-based criminal expertise (for example, chemists) were also observed in these regions. 61 The Netherlands was mentioned most frequently as the source country for seized ecstasy (178 mentions or 38.5%), followed by Belgium (9.5%), Germany (5.2%), and the UK (3.2%). Europe overall accounted for 86% of all mentions, in spite of significant shifts in manufac-ture to regions outside Europe. Precursors for ecstasy-group substances include safrole (and safrole-rich oils), isosafrole, piperonal and 3,4-MDP-2-P , which are all under international control. In 2007, only one country, Thailand, reported significant safrole seizures. Australia (1,907 l), Canada (370 l), and the Netherlands (20 l) were the only countries reporting 3,4-MDP-2-P seizures in 2007. The total of 2,297 l is the lowest level in the new millennium. Mexico reported a single seizure of 2 mt of piperonal, accounting for nearly all seized in 2007. 62 While many of these seizures point to locations where MDMA manufacture is likely significant, their amounts clearly do not reflect the req-uisite chemicals needed to produce the amount of ecstasy consumed annually. In Australia, there is continued evidence of notable domestic manufacture. 63 Canada has grown to be the most important producer of MDMA for North Amer-ica, and since 2006, all ecstasy laboratories reported have 61 Europol (2008).

On the other hand operations in West and Central Europe tend to be larger and more sophisticated, and produce higher quality products trafficked around the world. For example, the Netherlands seized two of the largest MDMA laboratories ever in 2007. In 2008, Bra-zil's Federal Police dismantled the country's first clandes-tine MDMA laboratory in the southern state of Paran\u00e1, again illustrating how ATS manufacture is able to shift closer to its consumers. 65 64 US Department of Justice.

The countries also reported an increase in average weight seized, from 492 kg in 2000 to 555 kg in 2007.3 T rafficking in ATS substances is most commonly intra-regional - thus crossing fewer international borders - because manufacture typically occurs near the consumer market. This partially explains the relatively low levels of ATS seized compared to cocaine and heroin seizures. However, data suggests that interregional trafficking is 1 Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) are a group of substances com- prised of synthetic stimulants including amphetamine, metham- phetamine, methcathinone and ecstasy-group substances (MDMA and its analogues). 2 To standardize, seizures reported in kilograms, litres and dose/units/ pills/tablets are transformed into kg equivalents: a dose of \"ecstasy\" was assumed to contain on average 100 mg of psychoactive ingredient (MDMA); a dose of amphetamine/methamphetamine was assumed to contain 30 mg of active ingredient; a litre was assumed to equal a kilogram. Until 1999 'other hallucinogens' were included in data for the ecstasy-group substances, but the proportion of ecstasy-group in the total exceeded 90% for most years. 3 It is important to note that drug and precursor seizure data are sub- ject to change for a variety of reasons, such as new or late data being added or revisions in data already provided by Member States. All data reported in trafficking reflect the most up-to-date and accurate information available at the time of printing. increasing.4 Moreover, the precursor chemicals from which ATS materials are manufactured continue to be trafficked throughout the world. They are often diverted from licit manufacture in South, East and South-East Asia. Amphetamine continues to dominate global ATS seizures The amphetamines-group5 dominates ATS seizures, accounting for 85% of all seizures by volume. However, 2007 saw a dramatic jump in ecstasy-group6 seizures (15% of all ATS seized), as significant increases were noted in several large markets. In 2006, amphetamine seizures were higher than methamphetamine. This trend continued in 2007, when amphetamine accounted for 46% of all ATS seized. 4 Amphetamines and Ecstasy: 2008 Global ATS Assessment (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.08.XI.12). 5 The amphetamines-group substances includes predominately meth- amphetamine and amphetamine, but also includes non-specified amphetamines-group (for example, tablets sold as Captagon, meth-cathinone, fenetylline, methylphenidate and others), however it excludes substances purportedly of the ecstasy-group of substances. 6 The ecstasy-group substances include predominately MDMA, with MDA and MDEA/MDE. However, limited forensic capacity by Member States often leads to confusion about the actual content of tablets believed to be \"ecstasy\" (MDMA).Global seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), 1990 - 81: Source: UNODC, Annual Report Questionnaire Data/DELTA; UNODC Drug Information Network for Asia and the Pacific (DAINAP); Government reports; World Customs Organization (WCO), Customs and Drugs Report 2007 (Brussels, 2008) and previous years. 51.6 0102030405060 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006ATS seized (in metric tons equivalents)Amphetamines Group Ecstasy Group1271. Trends in the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market While drug seizures vary dramatically from year to year, clear increases in the amount of amphetamine seized began around 2000, with large increases reported in 2005. These increases are due, in large part, to intercep-tions of a fake pharmaceutical marketed as Captagon (amphetamine) in the Near and Middle East. 7 Seizures of methamphetamine, until recently the main ATS seized in East and South-East Asia and North America, have declined somewhat since 2005, and remain at some 18 mt. 7 See special Captagon feature in this chapter. 8 Also know as benzyl methyl ketone (BMK).The majority of ATS seizures worldwide occur primarily in the four subregions with distinct patterns: Near and Middle East (29%)-primarily fake Captagon s tablets likely containing amphetamine; East and S outh-East Asia (23%) s -primarily methamphetamine; W est and and ecstasy; andN orth America (18%)-primarily methamphetamine s and ecstasy. Each of these subregions is also a significant manufac- turing area. The one exception is the Near and Middle East, where no clandestine manufacture has been reported. However, undetected amphetamine manufac-ture may be occurring in the subregion. This is because ATS are typically manufactured in the subregion in which they are consumed, and because of several indica-tors of manufacture in the subregion. For example, Lebanese authorities in 2007 intercepted laboratory equipment and precursor chemicals for Captagon man-ufacture; 75% of licit global trade in the Captagon precursor 1-phenyl-2-propanone (P-2-P) 8 in 2007 was destined for two countries in the Near and Middle East; and intelligence reports support the assertion that ongo-ing manufacturing has been occurring in the Syrian Arab Republic since at least 2006 (although no labora-tories have been detected to date). 9 9 Lebanon Drug Enforcement Central Bureau, presentation at the Working Group Meeting on Captagon Smuggling to the Middle East Region, (December 2008, Beirut); T urkish National Police, Depart- ment Of Anti-Smuggling And Organized Crime (KOM), Annual Report 2008.

Trafficking in amphetamines-group substances Decline in seized amphetamines-group substances; the N ear and Middle East leads in amphetamines- group seizures Seizures of amphetamines-group substances (that is, amphetamine, methamphetamine and non-specified amphetamines) have increased considerably since the mid-1990s, and again beginning in 2002. 10 Figures for the UK include England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland However 2007 saw a decline of about 2.5 mt over the prior year from decreases in the non-specified ampheta-mines group. The more recent increases have been driven primarily by amphetamine in the Near and Middle East, Europe and North America, while seizures reported from East and South-East Asia-while substantial-have been on the decline. In 2007, the Near and Middle East accounted for about a third of global seizures (43.2 mt total), followed by East/ South East Asia, West and Cen-tral Europe, and North America.

Trends in the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market represents the highest level of seizures ever for this class of drug. The Near and Middle East accounted for nearly two thirds of all amphetamine seized, followed by Europe with just over a third. Saudi Arabia accounted for the vast majority. Notable seizures were also reported from the Syrian Arab Republic, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). West and Central Europe accounted for 94% of all of Europe's seizures, led by the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Germany. Given the significant increases in the Near and Middle East, Europe's share of global seizures has declined, despite an increase in the absolute amounts seized in Europe between 2000 and 2007. European seizures accounted for 93% of all amphetamine seizures in 2000, compared to 36% in 2007. The shifts in the Near and Middle East are concentrated in several key countries and are largely due to fake Capta- gon - an ATS product unique to the subregion. In 2007, Saudi Arabia seized a record 13.9 mt of fake Captagon, a weight near equivalent to all of the UK's amphetamines-group seizures since 2000. 11 It is likely that the reported weight of this significant seizure in Saudi Arabia repre-sents bulk tablet weight, which includes adulterants and binders. Many of the seizures depart from the Syrian Arab Republic, travel by road via Jordan and arrive in Saudi Arabia. Several other countries in the subregion have reported dramatic increases in seizures of these tab- lets since 2004, including Jordan, Syria, UAE, and Yemen, typically via overland routes and often destined for Saudi Arabia's large domestic market. In addition to 11 In March 2009, Saudi Arabia arrested 35 drug traffickers believed part of four different drug networks operating across the country, along with 3.4 million fake Captagon tablets.

Today, Captagon accounts for a significant amount of seized amphetamine-type stimulants in several countries, particularly in the Near and Middle East region. However, the drug has experienced a number of transitions since it was first developed for paediatric and geriatric use and given its trade name in the 1960s The original Captagon product contained fenetylline, which is metabolized in the human body to amphetamine. Fenetylline essentially exerts the same effects as ampheta-mine and misuse of fenetylline started as early as the 1970s. Diversion from legitimate trade constituted the main source of fenetylline, and as a result of reports of increasing misuse, the substance was placed under international con-trol in 1986. No licit manufacture has been reported since 1987. Similar to what has happened with other ATS that have been placed under control, counterfeit or fake products started to appear. In the case of Captagon, pharmaceutical companies are reported to have been approached to pro-duce counterfeit Captagon tablets. Subsequently, clandes- tine operators moved to the production of entirely fake products that did not contain any fenetylline but combi-nations of substances that mimic the effects of the original product. Such fake products are today predominant on illicit markets. Throughout this transition, the original brand name Captagon and the original physical appearance of tablets has continued to be used in an attempt by illicit manufac- turers to build on the reputation of the original product. The primary market for Captagon has traditionally been countries in the Near and Middle East, where it is popular among the younger, affluent population and where it has also enjoyed a reputation as sexual stimulant since the beginning of the 1980s. Today, despite increasing seizures of Captagon, there is still a lack of information on its chemical composition. What seems to be clear is that while until the early 1990s seized Captagon was found to contain fenetylline, there have not been any such reports since. The few forensic studies avail-able from that time suggest that fake Captagon then con- sisted mainly of combinations of caffeine, ephedrine and quinine, usually mixed with sugars such as lactose. Amphetamine was also occasionally encountered. 1 2 3 1 Dimova, D. and Dinkov, N.

Tablets that did not contain amphetamine, con- tained caffeine, ephedrine and/or a quinine. Fenetylline was not identified. The most recent laboratory data (2008/09) come from an analysis of tablets from countries in the Near and Middle East mainly as part of a feasibility study initiated by Inter-pol aimed at assisting countries in that region in the iden-tification of Captagon manufacturing and trafficking trends. The results from a very limited number of tablets from Jordan and Yemen confirm published data in that the main active ingredient is amphetamine. 8 From the above it is clear that the Captagon market has experienced a number of transitions, characteristic for many transitions of a legitimate pharmaceutical to an entirely clandestine product. The limited forensic data available show that Captagon today does not contain any fenetylline, but mainly caffeine and a range of other con-trolled and non-controlled substances. Amphetamine is the ATS most typically associated with today's Captagon. The amount of amphetamine found in Captagon, how- ever, is generally low (below the standard transformation ratio of 30mg per dose, used in most calculations to con- vert tablet seizures into units of weight). The presence of many of the other ingredients cannot be explained easily based on their pharmacology and that of the original drug fenetylline, and remains open to specula-tion. Synergistic effects, reputation (for example as sexual stimulant), or contamination from the production process are all possible explanations. Regardless of why Captagon tablets nowadays contain such a variety of ingredients, their systematic forensic examina- tion and the collective results, that is, from analysis of the physical appearance (tablet design), the chemical composi-tion (both active ingredients and tableting aids), and the impurity profile of the amphetamine, provide a wealth of valuable information for drug intelligence. So far, this tool remains heavily underutilized. 4 Alabdalla, M.A. (2005), Chemical characterization of counterfeit Captagon tablets seized in Jordan, Forensic Science International, 152, 185-188. 5 T urkish Drug Report, 2001 6 Neveanin, M., et al.

The amount of methamphetamine seized in 2007 (18.2 mt) represents about half of the amount seized at its peak in 2000. In 2007, several countries reported methamphetamine seizures to UNODC for the first time, including Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herze-govina and Kyrgyzstan. 14 While the amounts reported were relatively small, they illustrate the geographical spread of methamphetamine. 14 Kyrgyzstan's seizure was reported in 2008.

Trends in the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market The subregions of East and South-East Asia (56%) and North America (40%) continue to account for most of the world's seized methamphetamine, with relatively low seizures reported elsewhere. Over the last decade, 10 Member States (or their territories) accounted for more than 95% of all reported seizures. Over the last decade, several changes have occurred. In 1998, 10 Member States (or territories) accounted for all global seizures of methamphetamine. In 2007, the same 10 Member States accounted for 95%, suggesting that other countries have emerged in the market. Canada increased its prominence in 2007, linked to increased manufacture and export by organized crime groups. The USA saw significant declines in methamphetamine seized in 2007. Methamphetamine trafficking shifts quickly, with devastating effects The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), 15 where some of the largest single methamphetamine seizures in the world have occurred, is central to methamphetamine manufacture, trafficking and use. Thailand, the largest market in the GMS, significantly increased law enforce-ment efforts in 2003/04 in response to widespread methamphetamine use. As a result, illicit trafficking in the GMS has relocated from the Golden T riangle 16 into neighbouring countries, including Cambodia, Lao Peo-ple's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam. Emerging trends can be more clearly seen when measur- ing the number of tablets seized, instead of the total 15 A region encompassing Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Repub- lic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and bordering provinces of south China. 16 The Golden T riangle is an area overlapping the borders of Lao PDR, Myanmar and Thailand.weight. In 2004, tableted methamphetamine (yaba) seizures began increasing in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, suggesting that trafficking routes shifted to the Mekong River. These shifts have accompanied increased use in the general population T rafficking outside the subregion has also increased. Historically, trafficking of methamphetamine was intra- regional, with laboratories manufacturing for the nearby domestic market. However, over the last few years, organized crime groups have increased their involve-ment, bringing improved logistics, sophistication and production capacity, a more varied product line, and the ability to quickly move manufacture to geographic areas with weak control regimes. 17 Interregional trafficking routes have been identified from Myanmar to Bangla- desh and India; from Hong Kong, China, to Australia, Indonesia, Japan and New Zealand; from the Philip-pines to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the USA; and from East and South-East Asia into the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Methamphetamine trafficked from Mexico drops in 2007, but may be temporary Most methamphetamine trafficking in North America supplies demand in the USA. Methamphetamine manu- facture in Mexico, and increasingly Canada, represent the bulk of methamphetamine trafficked into the USA. Following consistent increases for several years, 2007 marked the first decline in methamphetamine seized by the US authorities along the border with Mexico. This trend was reversed however in 2008, with a return to an increase in border seizures, 18 probably due to increasing 17 Amphetamines and Ecstasy: 2008 Global ATS Assessment (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.08.XI.12). 18 USA National Drug Intelligence Center, National Methamphetamine Top countries (rank ordered) in methamphetamine seizures (mt), 1998-2007 Table 22: Source: UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire Data/DELTA Top Member State/Territory1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Total China 1.61 16.06 20.90 4.84 3.19 5.83 2.75 6.76 6.07 6.09 3.01 4.52 10.08 8.34 8.63 1.29 China0.89 1.73 0.20 0.12 14.59 Philippines 0.00 0.94 1.02 1.71 0.91 3.12 3.73 Indonesia 0.01 0.22 0.01 0.00 0.05 0.02 0.03 0.26 1.24 1.23 3.07 Canada 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.05 0.03 0.02 capacity and sophis- tication in Mexico. Another reason for increases in the USA is related to growing 'smurfing' activity, where criminal groups obtain precursor chemicals used in manufacture through small purchases from multiple pharmacies, avoiding sales restrictions and law enforce-ment attention. 19 In Mexico, drug cartels also utilize non-pseudo/ephedrine based precursor processes and have the capacity to shift operations further south to other Latin American countries in order to acquire tra-ditional chemical precursors. Canada-based organized crime groups' participation in the methamphetamine trade has grown significantly since 2003. By 2006, law enforcement intelligence noted that Asian organized crime and traditional outlaw motorcycle gangs operating in Canada had increased the amount of methamphetamine they manufactured and exported, primarily into the USA, but also to Oceania and East and South-East Asia. 20 For example, Australia identified that methamphetamine from Canada accounted for 83% of total seized imports by weight, for Japan the figure was 62%. 21 Although only 5% of domestically manufactured methamphetamine was exported in 2006, by 2007 that figure was 20%.

In 2007, only 10% of reporting countries outside East and South-East Asia reported seizures of methamphetamine. This figure increased to 25% in 2007.

Trends in the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market new countries, spillover drug use in the general popula- tion and subsequent uptake can quickly occur. Although the Near and Middle East subregion has a well-established amphetamine market (fake Captagon), there is increasing evidence that methamphetamine (including the crystalline form) is also trafficked there. In 2008, the Islamic Republic of Iran reported its largest seizure of crystalline methamphetamine (150 kg), whereas in 2004, there were no reports of metham-phetamine. This is consistent with reports of increased use. 22 Significant seizures have also been reported in Saudi Arabia,23 including a 23 kg methamphetamine shipment originating in the Syrian Arab Republic.24 22 Drug Control in 2008: Annual report and rapid situation assessment.

Notable increases were reported in sub- regions with significant trafficking activity: West and Central Europe, Oceania, East and South-East Asia, and North America. Six countries accounted for more than 80% of reported seizures, with the largest amounts reported by the Netherlands (25% of total), followed by Australia, USA, Canada, the UK 25 and China. Seizures reported from Europe account for the majority (39%) of global seizures, as significant manufacturing continues in the West and Central subregion, most notably in the Netherlands and Belgium. However, around 2002/03 subregions outside of Europe began reporting increased domestic manufacture. In 2007, 52% of Member States reported seizures of ecstasy-group substances in 2007, almost double that of 1998 (27%). The average amount reported seized per country increased five-fold, from about 21 kg in 1998 to 115 kg in 2007. West and Central Europe remains a dominant source for ecstasy Although more ecstasy-group manufacture is taking 25 Data for the UK (England and Wales) reported in the 2007 ARQ are placeholders from 2006, as reporting is delayed.

Customs interceptions in 2007 were most commonly reported in the Netherlands (88 cases) and Belgium (22 cases). 27 Increased European seizures in 2007 are likely related to increases in MDMA avail-ability as seen in forensic profiling. Large numbers of tablets containing very high levels of MDMA were also reported. Following temporary shortages of MDMA after the dismantling of one of the largest MDMA labo-ratories ever discovered in the Netherlands in 2005, 28 markets appeared to rebound by 2007, with MDMA content of 'ecstasy' tablets returning to previous, or higher, levels. Additionally, there were reports of high content (100-125 mg) MDMA mixed with alcohol called \"Original 69\" and \"Dance Love Sex\" appearing on the market. 29 Although notable domestic manufacture of MDMA occurs in countries in other regions, such as Australia, it is clear that exports from West and Central Europe and East and South-East Asia continue to play a significant role in domestic market supply. West and Central Europe, for example, was the source of a record intercep-tion of ecstasy in Australia in June 2007. 30 27 World Customs Organization (WCO), Annual Customs and Drugs Report 2007 (Brussels, 2008). 28 In May 2007, police in Veldhoven, Netherlands, seized a warehouse with one of the largest drug caches ever discovered, reportedly con- taining 780 kg of MDMA and 3.5 million ecstasy tablets. 29 The Netherlands Drug Situation 2008: Report to the EMCDDA by the Reitox National Focal Point, T rimbos Institute, Utrecht, Netherlands, 2009. 30 Australian authorities completed a year-long controlled delivery of nearly 15 million tablets, with a total weight of 4.42 mt, which departed from Italy.

Trends in the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market Since 2003/04 Canada has emerged as the primary source of ecstasy-group substances for North American markets, and increasingly for other regions. As of 2007, identified ecstasy laboratories were large-capacity facili-ties primarily controlled by Asian organized crime groups, utilizing precursor chemicals trafficked from China in sea containers. In 2007, it was estimated that 50% of domestically produced ecstasy was trafficked outside of Canada. Most of this was thought to be des-tined for the USA, Australia and Japan. Japan, Indonesia and other countries in East and South- East Asia have reported significant trafficking of ecstasy. Unlike Indonesia, Japan has no domestic ATS manufac-ture, so increases in ecstasy are all from imports, often via organized crime groups. In 2007, Japan identified Canada as the single biggest source for seized ecstasy tablets, followed by the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium. 31 31 Recent illicit Synthetic Drug Smuggling Situation in Japan. Presented by the Customs and Tariff Bureau, Ministry of Finance, Japan at the 18th Anti-Drug Liaison Officials' Meeting for International Coop-eration (ADLOMICO), (Pusan, Republic of Korea, 2008).In Latin America, there remains concern that ecstasy- groups drugs, sourced from West and Central Europe are increasingly being used, particularly among young, affluent urban dwellers. There are few ATS-related traf-ficking data available in the region, partly due to the fact that law enforcement focusses on coca-based substances. However, data from Brazil clearly indicate that increas-ing numbers of tablets are being intercepted, with more than 210,000 seized in 2007. 32 The increase may also be related to domestic manufacture of ecstasy as the first clandestine laboratory was discovered in 2008. 32 In February 2009, Brazil Federal Police arrested 55 people nation- wide that were part of an international drug trafficking ring. The members-mostly young and middle-class-would traffic cocaine from South America to Europe in return for ecstasy to sell in Brazil. \"Ecstasy Ensnares Upper-Class Teenagers in Brazil,\" New York Times, 15 February 2009, www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/world/americas/15ecstasy.html.Ecstasy-group tablets seized in Japan Fig. 98: and Indonesia, 1998-2007 Source: UNODC, Annual Reports 99: 1998-2007 Source: UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire data -5001,0001,500 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007Tablets (in thousands) Indonesia Ecstasy (MDA, (MDA, MDEA, MDMA) tablets211,145 050,000100,000150,000200,000250,000 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007Tablets seized (#) No report142World Drug Report 2009 Year 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 refer to 2003.

Ecstasy-group users numbered between 12 and 24 million worldwide (annual prevalence 0.3%-0.5%). The width of these ranges is far greater than for cocaine and heroin. Illicit drug use is difficult to assess accurately, but ATS use even more so, for a variety of reasons. These include the speed with which ATS markets can appear and expand, the fact that ATS can be manufactured any-where in the world, the general confusion about what users actually consume, and the high reliance upon lim-ited or non-existent country reporting 1. This year, sig- nificant revisions were made to the approach taken in making global and regional estimates of the number of people who use drugs. The new estimates reflect the uncertainties surrounding these data (which exist due to 1 Amphetamines and Ecstasy: 2008 Global ATS Assessment (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.08.XI.12).data gaps and quality) and are presented in ranges rather than absolute numbers. Because of this revision, previ- ous point estimates are not comparable to the current ones. Amphetamines-group drug consumption Many countries do not differentiate the type of ATS consumed (methamphetamine, amphetamine or other synthetic stimulants) so only broad estimates of use of specific types can be made, based upon reports and sei-zure data reported by Member States. UNODC estimates that methamphetamine users account for 54%-59% of global amphetamines-group substances consumers; amphetamine users account for 32%-35%; and an additional 8%-11% use other non- specified illegal synthetic stimulants (such as methcathi- none, pharmaceutical stimulants, et cetera). Amphetamines-group users in East and South-East Asia consume primarily methamphetamine. Tablets sold as Captagon often contain amphetamine and are used throughout the Near and Middle East.

Trends in the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market primarily consume amphetamine, with a few exceptions, notably the Czech Republic and some neighbouring countries where methamphetamine use is predomi-nant. About half of stimulant users in North America use meth- amphetamine. In Latin America, amphetamines-group use was historically thought to be diverted pharmaceuti-cals, but increasing incidents of ATS manufacture suggest that this is changing. Use of amphetamines-group sub-stances in South Africa 2 is believed to be predominately methamphetamine; while in Western, Central and East- ern Africa and some parts of Southern Africa the amphet-amines-group markets are thought to consist of various pharmaceuticals. Finally, users in Oceania are thought to primarily use methamphetamine. Uncertain number of ATS users in Asia; South-East Asia probably has the most users in the region At least half of the world's amphetamines-group users - between 5.8-37.0 million - live in Asia. Most of these are methamphetamine users in East and South-East Asia, which account for between 52-79% of estimated users in the region. 3 The substantial uncertainty in this region is related to the unknown number of users in China and India. Due to a lack of country-level prevalence estimates, subre-gional estimates cannot be calculated for South Asia, Central Asia, or the Near and Middle East. 5 2 Methcathinone-another ATS-is also commonly used in South Africa. 3 The criteria to calculate subregional estimates include recent (since 1998) representative prevalence estimates from at least two countries in a subregion that, combined, account for at least 20% of the sub-region's total population aged 15-64 years.There is more certainty in estimates for the Americas, Europe and Oceania. Oceania had the highest estimated annual prevalence in the general population aged 15-64 (2.6%). The total number of amphetamines-group users in North America is estimated at around 3.8 million people, or some 1.3% of the population aged 15-64. Latin America (including Central America, the Caribbean and South America subregions) had an estimated two million users. In Europe, the number of users is estimated between 2.4 and 3.1 million (0.4-0.6% of the population). Africa is estimated to have between 1.4 and 4.1 million users. However, subregional estimates could only be calculated for two of the four subregions (North and Southern Africa). For much of Africa, little information related to ATS consumption is available, which explains the greater levels of uncertainty reflected in the preva-lence estimates for the region. The highest annual prevalence ranges in the Oceania region are reported by Australia; in North America, by the USA; and in Europe, by Scotland (UK) and Estonia. In Asia, the highest prevalence ranges are found in the Philippines; in the Caribbean, in the Dominican Repub-lic; in Central America, in El Salvador; 4 in South Amer- ica, in Brazil; and in Africa, in Nigeria and South Africa. 4 The prevalence estimates for El Salvador may also include non-ATS stimulants (for example, diet/slimming pills or caffeine pills) used without a prescription.Estimated Fig. 102: amphetamines-group users in the past year by r egion, 2007 Sources: UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire; Government reports; reports of regional bodies; and UNODC estimates.

Beginning around 2000, the rate of increases perceived by experts between developed and developing countries diverged, as developing coun-tries, particularly those in Asia and the Americas, more often perceived significant increases in ATS use. 6 Nearly half of experts from 86 countries perceived that the ATS situation had worsened in their country over the past year, whereas 14% identified some improve-ment. 7 The proportion of countries reporting a perceived 5 Expert perception data is derived from the ARQ, and is unweighted.

Trends in the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market increase in ATS use-predominately methamphetamine- was highest in Asia (56%). Subregionally, experts per-ceived a worsening ATS problem in three distinct areas: central Asia (for example Azerbaijan and Georgia); countries and territories on the east coastal area of Asia (for example, China, Republic of Korea and Viet Nam); and the Near and Middle East and its close neighbours (for example, Cyprus, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan and Qatar). Methamphetamine was identified as the \"most used\" illicit drug in Cambodia, Japan, Lao People's Demo-cratic Republic, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and Thailand. 8 Thailand has the largest market for methamphetamine in South-East Asia's Greater Mekong Subregion. 9 After some apparent reductions in metham- 8 The most recent data reported for Cambodia and Lao PDR is for 2006 (UNODC, Patterns and Trends of Amphetamine-Type Stimulants and Other Drugs of Abuse in East Asia and the Pacific 2006 (June 2007)).

This is reflected in treatment and enforcement data. Between 2004 and 2007, the number of people seeking treatment has more than doubled, while arrests for methampheta-mine-related offenses increased to their highest level ever in 2007. Methamphetamine use is spreading throughout the South and South-East Asia The routes supplying Thailand with methamphetamine changed markedly after 2003/04, with increased use of the Mekong River. This led to drugs transiting through 10 Among other things, the 'Thai war on drugs' had the effect of reduc- ing self-reporting of illicit drug use in surveys; results between 2003 and 2006 indicate low lifetime prevalence rates .

Office of China National Narcotics Control Commission, Annual report on drug control in China 2009 (and previous years) (Beijing, 2009). Asia: ATS use appears to be increasing, but by how much? There are no national prevalence estimates of ATS consumption in China and India. These gaps are major given the size of these countries' populations (0.95 billion persons aged 15-64 years in China, and 0.73 billion persons aged 15-64 years in India). Such gaps have an enormous impact upon the level of certainty of both regional and global ATS use estimates. Furthermore, with increases in both population and disposable income, their position next to several significant manufacturing countries, and expanding domestic manufacture, both countries face substantial risks related to growing ATS use. India: India last performed a household survey in 2000/01, but questions specific to various types of ATS consumed were not included. Due to a lack of data for India, estimates cannot be calculated for the South Asia subregion. How-ever, given India's population, its contribution to annual prevalence estimates for Asia (using other regional estimates) may be 29%, which represents millions of potential users. The last assessment of India's treatment facilities was conducted in 2001. It found that 0.2% of treatment was for ATS. The South Asia subregion is highly vulnerable to an increase in problems related to ATS, however, and it is likely that the extent of use and problems related to use of ATS have increased since that time. First, key ATS precursor chemicals are readily available and significant ATS manufacture is already taking place. Second, the region is home to a large youth population of potential consumers with increasing disposable income. Third, the region's prevention and treat-ment regimes are largely focused on other drug types. Finally, the geographic location between the significant ATS markets in the Near and Middle East and East and South-East Asia, make the countries particularly vulnerable. In India and Bangladesh, methamphetamine trafficking via the border with Myanmar, the source of much of Asia's methamphetamine, is increasing. The threat to South Asia was highlighted in May 2008 when a large sophisticated methamphetamine laboratory was seized in Kosgama, Sri Lanka , and in November 2008 when the first operational methamphetamine laboratory was seized in Vadodara, India, along with significant amounts of methamphetamine. In December 2008, an industrial-scale pseudoephedrine extraction operation with nearly 5 metric tons of methampheta-mine precursor chemicals was reportedly discovered in Mumbai. China: China's experts report strong increases in the use of methamphetamine, which coincide with increased domes- tic manufacture and trafficking, and a year-on-year declines in heroin seizures. In just three years (2004-07), the proportion of registered drug users for ATS increased more than fivefold, from less than 2% to 11% of registered drug users by 2007. 13 In 2008, China reported that 19.1% of its registered drug users nationwide used \"new types\" of drugs-predominately ATS-related14-higher than in previous years. However, no general population estimates of the extent of use of ATS have ever been reported. In China, methamphetamine in both crystal and tablet forms is trafficked from Myanmar directly or by transiting Lao PDR or Viet Nam. Significant methamphetamine manufacture takes place within China using precursor chemicals diverted from industry or by extracting precursor chemicals from pharmaceutical products. The risk to China was highlighted by very recent large- scale methamphetamine manufacture found using sophisticated methods that do not require controlled precursors. Of note are increasing seizures of ketamine, which although not an ATS is marketed as an ATS-type drug, either by itself, or mixed with other drugs like methamphetamine and sold as ecstasy.1491. Trends in the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market Data from East Asia suggest some reductions in use The Japanese population has experienced several cycles of stimulant use since the end of the Second World War. However, accurately and reliably assessing use in the country's general population presents particular chal-lenges, since typical household-type surveys tend to have extremely low response rates and there may be sensitivity around disclosure of use. T rends in administrative data since 1998/99 suggest that problematic methampheta-mine use may be declining: the number of stimulant abuse/dependence cases reported by psychiatric facilities declined 11% from 1999 to 2005, but still account for over half of reported cases. 16 Methamphetamine-related arrests continue to decline, yet account for more than three-quarters of all drug-related arrests. 17 The Philippines' recent (2007) household survey con-cluded that annual prevalence of methamphetamine use in the general population declined from 6% (in 2004) to between 1.9-2.4%. T reatment admissions for meth-amphetamine have also declined from 6,195 in 2003 to 2,562 in 2007, but still account for 60% of new admis- sions. 18 Significant manufacturing and trafficking of ATS continue to be problematic for the country. Some Near and Middle East countries emerge as significant amphetamine consumers The Near and Middle East has been reporting dramatic increases in ATS-predominately fake pharmaceuticals 16 Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, General situation of adminis- trative measures against drug abuse (2007). 17 Amphetamines and Ecstasy: 2008 Global ATS Assessment (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.08.XI.12). 18 T reatment data are those provided by the public health system and do not include treatment provided by non-government and faith-based treatment providers.sold as Captagon - over the last few years. Saudi Arabia, the largest market, has seen increases in problem use that coincide with significant increases in region-wide sei- zures. One specialized drug treatment hospital found that between 1998-2006, treatment admissions for amphetamines-group use increased nine-fold, and the proportion of amphetamines-group treatment relative to all admissions tripled (from 25% to 73%). 19 The Islamic Republic of Iran's recent rapid situation assessment of drug users in treatment centres, prisons, and of homeless persons found that approximately 3.6% of these groups of these groups primarily used crystalline methamphetamine, whereas no use was reported in 2004/5. 20 Iran has reported yearly increases in methamphetamine seizures, suggesting that availabil-ity is increasing. In Europe, amphetamine use stable or decreasing; methamphetamine pockets persist European amphetamines-group use appears stable, with West and Central European countries reporting stability or some decline. Perceived increases were subregional, with some increase in central Europe (Switzerland, Aus- tria, Slovakia, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova) and northern areas (Estonia, Latvia, Norway and Sweden). Annual prevalence continues to decline in the United Kingdom, historically Europe's most significant amphet-amine market. The annual prevalence rate of 1.0% in 19 Abu Madini M. S., Rahima S. I.

However, the same reduction did not take place in Scotland, as rates of annual amphetamine use increased from 0.5% in 2000 to 2.2% in 2006.21 However, some countries in Eastern Europe have wit- nessed increases in amphetamines-group drug use. The Czech Republic is central to Europe's methampheta-mine use, with most of the methamphetamine sourced from domestic clandestine laboratories. Although younger metropolitan users account for the majority, increased use is occurring in small towns and rural are-as. 22 First-time treatment demand for methampheta- mine continues to grow, accounting for nearly two thirds of all drug treatment. Many of the country's \"problem drug users\" inject methamphetamine. Similarly, experts in the Ukraine are reporting increased injecting drug use, particularly ATS: crude home-made synthetic stimulants such as methamphetamine, meth-cathinone and cathinone are often shared by groups of young injecting drug users. 23 21 Brown, M. & Bolling, K.

South African ATS use shows signs of stabilization, but little is known about the rest of the continent Most subregions of Africa lack basic data on ATS use, making it difficult to assess its extent or provide subre-gional estimates of use. However, ATS consumption has been reported in several African countries, including Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and South Africa. South Africa is one of the most significant metham- phetamine markets in Africa and is one example of the rapid increase that can occur in ATS use. In Cape Town and the surrounding area, where most of the country's methamphetamine use currently occurs, demand for methamphetamine treatment was non-existent before 2002. By 2008, it accounted for 36% of treatment, although recent data suggest that use among youth may be on the decline. 24 Egypt has some history of problematic synthetic stimu-lant use (Maxiton Forte 25), however, recent seizure data show that little is currently seized. Recent research on ATS use suggests that 2.2% of state university students across the country had ever used stimulants, of whom approximately one third admitted current use. 26 In a 2005/06 national survey assessing drug use in eight 24 Pl\u00fcddemann, A., Parry, C., Bhana, A., & Fourie, D.

Trends the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market regions, 10% of the population aged 15 and older had ever used drugs, with 0.5% admitting to having ever used stimulants.27 The existence of unregulated (parallel) pharmaceutical markets28 throughout Africa is believed to be a signifi- cant source of ATS.29 These markets exist in large part due to limited access to health-care facilities, the high cost of drugs, a need for privacy, a general lack of public awareness, overly strict drug control regimes, and to meet consumer demand for drugs. 30 According to WHO, between 25-50% of medicines consumed in developing countries are counterfeit, and include ATS. 31 Burkina Faso has significant seizures of (non-specified) ATS pharmaceuticals termed 'm\u00e9dicaments de rue'. Although representative data on ATS use in Burkina Faso is non-existent, authorities in 2005 indicated that the most significant (and increasing) drugs of use were ATS. The same year, a report on psychiatric hospital treatment data in the capital Ouagadougou found that 28% of treatment episodes were primarily for ampheta-mines-group substances, the highest of any drug group apart from cannabis. 32 27 Ghaz I.H., National Study of Addiction Prevalence of the Use of Drugs and Alcohols in Egypt (2005 - 2006), Studies of the National Centre for Social and Criminal Research Fund for the Control and T reat-ment of Addiction and Abuse (Cairo, 2007). 28 Unlicensed individuals and/or business entities that trade in drugs that they are not authorized or entitled to deal with or in contraven- tion of the applicable laws, regulations and norms.

Demandes de traitement pour abus de drogues In Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, metham- phetamine use was previously reported in the northern parts of the country. More recent research however has identified significant use by young people (age 10-19; 6.7% lifetime prevalence) and university students (2.1% lifetime prevalence) in the south-western city of Ilorin and its surrounding catchment area. 33 Methamphetamine use may be declining in parts of North America North America continues to lead the western hemi- sphere in ATS use. Recent data, however, suggest declines, particularly in methamphetamine use in Canada and the USA. Since 1999, Canadian (Ontario) 34 and US students have reported declining methampheta- mine use, but actual use is probably underreported as young people are increasingly using 'ecstasy' sourced from Canada which often contains methamphetamine as the primary psychoactive ingredient. 35 Data from the USA household survey of the general population (12 and older) show that in 2007, the first notable decline in illicit amphetamines-group use took place, driven by declines in methamphetamine use. 36 au Burkina Faso.

Data include clients presenting for both amphetamine or methamphetamine (the methamphetamine category was added in June 2006). Data are reported on a fiscal year, from April - March. 38 Caution should be exercised as these system are funded differently and data are captured differently.

Trends in the world drug markets Amphetamine-type stimulants market also perceive increasing ATS use.43 Historically, stimu- lants originated primarily from licit channels, often through over-prescription or unregulated parallel mar-kets. In 2007, Argentina and Brazil had the second and third highest calculated rates of consumption of Sched-ule IV stimulants in the world. Between 2001 and 2005, Brazil reported that lifetime use of amphetamines-group ssubstances in the general population in urban areas more than doubled from 1.5% to 3.2%, driven in part by comparatively high secondary student use (3.4%). 44 ATS consumption rates tend to be significantly higher for youth than for the general population. For example, the annual prevalence rates for the amphetamines-group substances for Colom-bian secondary school students was 3.5% in 2004/05, a rate seven times that of the estimate for the general population in 2005. (see special features section for fur-ther information) Oceania: Use high, though reductions may be occurring; island nations under threat Amphetamines-group use in Oceania may be declining overall. However, the trend reflects only the populations of Australia and New Zealand. 45 Australian household surveys (aged 14 and above) appear to show a steady decline of methamphetamine use from an annual preva-lence rate of 3.7% in 1998 to 2.3% in 2007. 46 New Zealand household surveys (aged 15 to 45) showed a similar decrease since the peak of 2001. Both countries also collect methamphetamine use data on recent detainees (arrestees) through various drug monitoring programs.47 In Australia, there has been a decline of detainees testing positive for methampheta- mine to 24% in 2007, with little change in New Zea- land levels (which are half of those among Australian detainees).48 43 Only experts from the Dominican Republic noted a perceived decline in ATS use. 44 II Levantamento Domiciliar Sobre o Uso S\u00e3o Paulo. (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, 2006). 45 There have been only sporadic ARQ reports from a small number Pacific Island Member States over the last decade. 46 It must be noted that the underlying methodology for the surveys changed substantially between 1998 and the 2001, thus a direct com-parison of the household survey data in Australia could be potentially misleading. 47 Drug Use Monitoring in Australia (DUMA) and the New Zealand Arrestee Drug Use Monitoring (NZ-ADAM) program assess drug use via urine analysis of recent arrestees in select sites. 48 Includes the first two quarters of 2007 only. There were however, significant increases in positive tests for amphetamine reported (unweighted multi-site average, 2.7% in 2005 to 13.5% in 2007), possibly reflecting some shift in ATS use.While the overall numbers suggest a possible decline over the last several years, use by problematic drug users and the associated impacts on public health may be increasing. For example, in Australia, data from detain-ees suggest increasing use of high potency crystalline methamphetamine and an increase in injecting meth-amphetamine. 49 New Zealand's frequent methampheta- mine users were more likely to have used an ambulance and/or hospital emergency room services, or have con-tacted a drug counsellor or general practitioner in rela-tion to their problematic methamphetamine use in 2007, over prior years. 50 Although UNODC receives no systematic data from the other Oceania countries, there have been sporadic reports of amphetamines-group substances being used throughout the many island nations. For example, crys-talline methamphetamine use has been reported in sev-eral cities of Papua New Guinea. Moreover, a large number of traffickers were recently sentenced for moving significant amounts of methamphetamine into French Polynesia. 51 Of the 12 countries worldwide which are not yet parties to the 1988 Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances , seven are in the Oceania region, leaving the region vul- nerable to manufacturing, trafficking, and use. 49 National Alcohol and Drugs Research Centre, University of New South Wales - presentation to UNODC, 'Australian Drug Monitoring Systems: Overview of IDRS and EDRS' (Sydney, Australia, 2007). 50 Wilkins, C., Girling, M. & Sweetsur, P .

As a proportion of the population, Oceania accounts for the highest annual prevalence of any region (3.6-4.0% of the gen-eral population), but has the fewest users in absolute numbers. The region with the highest number of users is Asia, with an estimated range between 3.6-13.6 mil- lion annual users, aged 15-64. Most are living in the East and South-East Asia subregion. Due to a lack of country-level prevalence estimates, subregional estimates cannot be calculated for South Asia, Central Asia, or the Near and Middle East. Ecstasy-group use concentrated in Western Europe and North America UNODC estimates that there are about 2.6 million ecstasy-group users in North America, with the majority living in the USA. North America's annual prevalence for the general population is about 0.9%, similar to that of West and Central Europe. There are between 3.8 and 4.0 million ecstasy-group users in Europe. Drug use in West and Central Europe appears largely stable but con-tinues to increase in several East and South-East Euro-pean countries, particularly among young people. 52 Reports show that unbeknown to many ecstasy users, what is sold to them as ecstasy (MDMA) is often a combination of many psychoac- tive substances, such as methamphetamine and ketamine. Ampheta- mines and Ecstasy: 2008 Global ATS Assessment (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.08.XI.12).Expert perceptions: Growth in ecstasy-group drug use in developing countries outpacing that of developed countries The unweighted expert perception trends between 1998 and 2007 reflect continued increases in ecstasy-group use. 53 Country experts in developed countries have per- ceived a stable or slightly declining trend since 2004, about the time when developing countries (particularly in Eastern Europe and Latin America) perceived more frequent and more significant increases in their use. 54 In 2007, experts from 63 Member States responded, with 32 identifying a stable ecstasy-group trend over 2006, and 9 identifying a decrease. 55 Decreases in devel- oped countries were driven in part by North America and West and Central Europe. The most recent student surveys in the USA (2008) and Canada (Ontario, 2007) show that little change in annual prevalence of ecstasy-group use has occurred since 2003. However, in the USA and Canada 'ecstasy' is sourced primarily from Canadian-based operations, which increasingly cut it with other psychoactive ingredients. (see special features section for further information) 53 Expert perception data is derived from the ARQ, and is unweighted. The following points are allocated had reported 'some increase', the global trend line would have increased by one point each year and would have reached 109 by 2007. 54 The criteria to calculate subregional estimates include recent repre- sentative prevalence estimates (since 1998) from at least two Member States that combined account for at least 20% of the subregion's population aged 15-64. 55 Increases and decreases were coded from strong increase/decrease or some increase/decrease, and represent the unweighted number of Member States responding.Estimated Fig. 112: ecstasy-group users, by r egion (in numbers and annual prevalence) Sources: UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire; Government reports; reports of regional bodies; and UNODC estimates.

The rate among urban secondary students in Colombia was 3.0% in 2004/05. 57 This is nearly double the rate (1.6%) from surveys of secondary school students conducted just three years earlier. 58 Prior to 2001, there were no indications of measurable ecstasy-group drug use among students. Stabilization in large parts of Europe, with possible shifts detected Data continue to suggest stabilization in Europe, due in large part to stable use in West and Central Europe. Most notable are the trends from the UK, for many years Europe's largest ecstasy market, and Spain. Begin-ning around 2001, annual prevalence trends showed decreases in the general population in England and Wales (aged 16-59) and Spain (aged 15-64). Between 1999 and 2007, European students (aged 15-16) reported increased lifetime use of ecstasy-group substances. However, there were diverging trends by subregion. Students in West and Central Europe 59 have reported relatively stable unweighted lifetime use since 2003. In contrast, students from Eastern Europe60 reported nearly 1.5% higher lifetime prevalence rates than their West and Central European counterparts. (see Special Features section for further information) Consistent with these data, expert perception in 2007 showed 11 experts reporting increasing ecstasy-group use, of which nearly two thirds were from East and South-East European countries. 56 Ecstasy-group trends were systematically collected only as of 2000. There are indications from several countries that late 1990s ATS and ecstasy-group trends followed similar patterns, and thus pre-2000 data represent ATS data used as a proxy. 57 Oficina de las Naciones Unidas contra la Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Per\u00fa y Uruguay (Lima, September 2006). 58 The Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission.

Of these, most were situated in East and South-East Asia, including China, Indone-sia, Thailand and Viet Nam. However, like other regions, a lack of forensic capacity means that it is not known whether ecstasy-group substances actually contain MDMA or other psychoactive ingredients. \"Club drugs\" are increasingly being replaced by other substances, such as ketamine. 61 For example, in Hong Kong, China, the market has changed rapidly and dramatically since 2000, as ketamine-nearly unheard of in 1998-has supplanted ecstasy use. The number of reported drug registry cases for ketamine doubled between 2005 and 2007, and now accounts for 29% of all newly reported cases in Hong Kong, China. Ketamine use has been noted in neigh-bouring areas and follows reports of significant illicit manufacturing operations and seizures throughout the subregion. 61 Ketamine is a licit pharmaceutical illicitly used as a hallucinogen most often found in powder or liquid form that is increasingly encountered on ATS markets, either in connection with the \"club-drug\" scene, or found as an active ingredient in what is sold on illicit markets as 'ecstasy'. Ketamine is not currently under international control.Annual prevalence of ecstasy-group Fig. 114: use among secondary students in select South American countries (rank or dered), 2004/05 Source: Oficina de Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Uruguay.

Both Australia and New Zealand have reported increased annual preva-lence of ecstasy-group among the general population since 1998, and the most recent studies find that their rates reflect some of the highest reported annual preva-lence of use. Annual use in Australia remained stable since 2004, contrary to increases in New Zealand. However, due to some of New Zealand's apparent increase may not be of MDMA-containing pills. Until 2008, New Zealand had a substantial legal \"party-pills\" market which sold, inter alia, benzylpiperazine (BZP), a drug with effects similar to MDMA (ecstasy). A 2006 household survey found that 15.3% of New Zealanders (aged 13-45) had used \"party-pills\" in the past year.

Confronting unintended cons equences : DRUG CONTROL AND THE CRIMINAL BLACK MARKET2.0 Confronting unintended con sequences : Drug control and the criminal black market 163Last year's World Drug Report reviewed 100 years of drug control efforts, documenting the development of one of the first international cooperative ventures designed to deal with a global challenge. This pioneering work brought together nations with very different political and cultural perspectives to agree on a topic of consider-able sensitivity: the issue of substance abuse and addic-tion. Despite wars, economic crises, and other cataclysmic events of state, the global drug control movement has chugged steadily forward, culminating in a framework of agreements and joint interventions with few prece-dents or peers in international law. Today, a number of substances are prohibited in the domestic legislation of almost every country. As dis-cussed below, this unanimity has created a bulwark shielding millions from the effects of drug abuse and addiction. In the past, many of these substances were legally produced and, in some cases, aggressively mar-keted, to devastating effect. The collective nations of the world have agreed that this state of affairs was unaccept-able, and have created an international control system that allows crops such as opium poppy to be produced for medical use, with very little diversion to the illicit market. Despite this achievement, drug control efforts have rarely proceeded according to plan. There have been reversals and set-backs, surprising developments and unintended consequences. T raffickers have proven to be resilient and innovative opponents and cultivators dif-ficult to deter. The number, nature, and sources of con- trolled substances have changed dramatically over the years. None of this could have been predicted at the outset. But then, very little has been simple or smooth about developments in international affairs over the last cen- tury. Other international problems - including poverty, war, weapons proliferation and infectious disease - have defied early projections of a swift resolution. Some efforts have been more successful than others, but, in all cases, the learning process could be described as \"chal-lenging\". Today, the enterprise of global coordination and cooperation remains a work in progress. T remen- dous gains have been made, however, and the need for collaborative solutions to the problems facing us all is greater than ever before.2.1 Why illicit drugs must remain illicit Oddly, of all areas of international cooperation, drug contr ol is uniquely subject to calls that the struggle should be abandoned. Despite equally mixed results in international interventions, 1 no one advocates accepting poverty or war as inevitable. Not so with drugs, where a range of unintended consequences have led some to conclude that the only solution is to legalise and tax substances like cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, methampheta-mine, and heroin. The strongest case against the current system of drug control is not the financial costs of the system, or even its effectiveness in reducing the availability of drugs. 2 The strongest case against drug control is the violence and corruption associated with the black market. The main problem is not that drug control efforts have failed to eliminate drug use, an aspirational goal akin to the elimination of war and poverty. It is that in attempting to do so, they have indirectly enriched dangerous crimi-nals, who kill and bribe their way from the countries where drugs are produced to the countries where drugs are consumed. Of course, the member states of the United Nations cre- ated the drug conventions, and they can modify or annul them at will. But the Conventions would have to be undone the way they were done: by global consensus. And to date, they are very few international issues on which there has been so much positive consensus as drug control. Drug control was the subject of broad-based international agreements in 1912, 1925, 1931, 1936, 1946, 1948, and 1953, before the creation of the stand-ing United Nations Conventions in 1961, 1971, and 1988. Nearly every nation in the world has signed on to these Conventions. 3 Nonetheless, there remains a serious and concerned group of academics and civil society organisations who feel the present system causes more harm than good. Plans for drug \"legalisation\" are diverse, and often fuzzy on the details, but one of the most popular alternative models involves taxation and control in a manner simi-lar to tobacco and alcohol. 4 This approach has appeal of ideological consistency, since all these addictive sub-stances are treated in the same way. The practice of banning certain addictive substances 164World Drug Report 2009 while permitting and taxing others is indeed difficult to defend based on the relative harmfulness of the substances themselves. Legal addictive substances kill far more people every year than illegal ones - an estimated 500 million people alive today will die due to tobacco. 5 But this greater death toll is not a result of the licit substances being pharmacologically more hazardous than the illicit ones. 6 This greater death toll is a direct result of their being legal, and consequently more available. Use rates of illicit drugs are a fraction as high as for legal addictive drugs, including among those who access the legal drugs illegally (i.e. young people). If currently illegal substances were made legal, their popularity would surely increase, perhaps reaching the levels of licit addictive substances, increasing the related morbidity and mortality. Is the choice simply one of drug-related deaths or drug- market-related deaths? Some palliative measures would be available under a system of legalisation that are not available today. If drugs were taxed, these revenues could be used to fund public health programmes aimed at reducing the impact of the increase in use. Addicts might also be more accessible if their behaviour were decriminalised. With bans on advertising and increas-ingly restrictive regulation, it is possible that drug use could be incrementally reduced, as tobacco use is cur-rently declining in most of the developed world. Unfortunately, most of this thinking has indeed been restricted to the developed world, where both treatment and capacity to collect taxes are relatively plentiful. It ignores the role that global drug control plays in protect-ing developing countries from addictive drugs. Without consistent global policy banning these substances, devel-oping countries would likely be afflicted by street drugs the way they are currently afflicted by growing tobacco and alcohol problems.In most developing countries, street drugs are too scarce and expensive for most consumers. They are scarce and expensive because they are illegal. Today, traffickers con-centrate on getting almost all of the cocaine and heroin produced to high-value destinations, placing the burden of addiction on those well suited to shoulder it, at least financially. If these pressures were removed, lower value markets would also be cultivated with market-specific pricing, as they presently are for most consumer goods. For example, cocaine use in the countries where cocaine is actually produced is less than half as high as in many European countries or the United States. This could easily change. Bolivia is a poor country where 42% of the population lives on less than US$2 per day 8 and which produces about 10% of the global cocaine supply. According to reported figures, cocaine in Bolivia was US$9 per gram in 2005, about 10% of the price in the United States. But GDP per capita was 42 times higher in the US than in Bolivia, so the price was effectively four times higher in Bolivia. 9 In contrast, 27% of the adult population of Bolivia smokes cigarettes daily. 10 A pack of cigarettes was priced at just US$0.62 at official exchange rates in 2006, so even the poor find an imported addictive substance more affordable than the locally-produced one. 11 Bolivia is not unique in this respect: in many poor countries, more than 10% of household expenditure is for tobac-co. 12 Indeed, the spread of tobacco to the developing world gives a hint of what could happen if other addictive substances were made legal. Many transition countries have much higher tobacco use prevalence than the richer ones, and Africa's tobacco market is presently growing by 3.5% per year, the fastest rate in the world. 13 By 2030, more than 80% of the world's tobacco deaths will Global deaths related to substance Fig. 1: use in 2002 Source: World Health Organisation7Annual cocaine prevalence Fig. 2: Source: 2009 World Drug Report 0100000020000003000000400000050000006000000 Tobacco Alcohol Illicit drugs0.8 0.80.92.22.33 00.511.522.533.5 Colombia Bolivia Peru Italy England and Wales Spain % of adult population using annually165Confronting unintended consequences: Drug control and the criminal black market occur in developing countries.14 These countries can ill-afford this burden of disease. They are even less capa- ble of giving up a share of their productive work force to more immediately debilitating forms of addiction. \"Vice taxes\" are also used to control the spread of legal addictive drugs, making them more expensive and thus reducing demand. But again, capacity to enforce these taxes is less in developing countries, and high taxes gen- erate large shadow markets, as illustrated by tobacco markets today. Recent estimates suggest 10% or more of global tobacco consumption is untaxed, and that the illicit share of the market is particularly pronounced in Africa (15%) and Latin America (20%). An estimated 600 billion cigarettes are smuggled each year. 15 If these were priced at just a dollar a pack, this would represent a global market worth US$30 billion, comparable to the US$65 billion market for illicit opiates and US$71 bil- lion market for cocaine.18 As with illicit drugs, illicit tobacco has been used to fund violence in places as diverse as the Balkans 19 and West Africa.20 The universal ban on illicit drugs thus provides a great deal of protection to developing countries, and must be maintained. At the same time, the violence and corrup-tion associated with drug markets is very real, and must be addressed. Fortunately, there is no reason why both drug control and crime prevention cannot be accom-plished with existing resources, if the matter is approached in a strategic and coordinated manner. Control drugs while preventing crime Drug addiction represents a large social cost, a cost we seek to contain through the system of international drug control. But this system itself has its costs, and these are not limited to the expenditure of public funds. Interna-tional drug control has produced several unintended consequences, the most formidable of which is the crea- tion of a lucrative black market for controlled sub- stances, and the violence and corruption it generates. Drug control generates scarcity, boosting prices out of proportion to production costs. Combined with the bar-riers of illegality and prevention efforts, scarcity and high prices have helped contain the spread of illicit drugs. This has kept drugs out of the hands of an untold number of potential addicts. At the same time, however, high prices allow transnational traffickers to generate obscene profits, simply for being willing to shoulder the risk of defying the law. Given the money involved, competition for the oppor- tunity to sell is often fierce, resulting in small wars on the streets of marginalised areas in the developed and the Price of a gram of cocaine as a share Fig. 3: of daily GDP per capita in 2005 Source: 2008 WDR, Human Development Report 2007/2008Share of national tobacco markets that Fig. 5: are illicit (recent low end estimates) Source: Framework Convention Alliance, 200717 0.83.2 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5 USA BoliviaDays of income to cocaine 101119562886 0500100015002000250030003500 1970-72 1980-82 1990-92thousands of tonsCigarette UN FAO168%10% 10%20% 20%25%30%40% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45% EU-25 Canada Vietnam Russia South Africa Iran Brazil Albania166World Drug Report 2009 developing world alike. Profits are ploughed back into increasing the capacity for violence and into corrupting public officials. Together, violence and corruption can drive away investment and undermine governance to the point that the rule of law itself becomes questionable. As a result, some have argued that the costs of control- ling illicit drugs outweigh the benefits - in effect, that the side effects are so severe that the treatment is worse than the disease. But this is a false dilemma. It is incum-bent on the international community to achieve both objectives: to control illicit drugs and to limit the costs associated with this control. More creative thinking is needed on ways of reducing the violence and corruption associated with containing the drug trade. Progress must be made toward simultaneously achieving the twin goals of drug control and crime prevention. To do this, there are several ways present efforts could be improved and expanded. First, it is possible for law enforcement to do what it does much better: High volume arrests are the norm in many parts of the s world, but their ecacy is questionable - to conserve r esources, prison space should be reserved primarily for trackers, particularly violent ones. Drug addicts provide the bulk of drug demand; treat- s ing this problem is one of the best ways of shrinking the mar ket. The links between drug users and drug dealers also s need to be severed, closing open drug markets and disr upting information networks using the techniques of problem-oriented policing and situational crime prevention. Second, both local and international efforts need to be strategically coordinated to address the particularities of specific drug problems: The right \"balance\" between supply-side and de- s mand-side interventions depends very much on the par ticularities of the situation, and may require re- sources and expertise beyond those found in agencies traditionally involved in prevention, treatment, and law enforcement. At all points in the market (production, tracking, s consumption), strategies should be based on the specif- ic characteristics of the dr ug involved and the context in which it has become problematic. Focus should be placed on shrinking the markets, not s just disabling specic individuals or groups.Wher e drug flows cannot be stopped, they should be s guided by enforcement and other interventions so that they pr oduce the least possible damage.Finally, the international community must rally together to assist more vulnerable members in resisting the incur-sion of drugs: Post-conflict reconstruction and development aid s should be integrated with crime prevention eorts. B etter use should be made of the Conventions, particu- s larly toward international action on precursor control, money laundering, asset for feiture, organised crime, and corruption. Information systems need to be improved so that prob- s lems can be tracked and interventions evaluated. 2.2 Move beyond reactive law enforcement Drug possession and sale are illegal in most countries of the world, and, as a r esult, the drug problem was long seen as primarily a criminal justice issue. Those who take the \"drug war\" metaphor literally may feel this effort is best advanced by people in uniform with guns. Law enforcement must continue to play a key role, of course, keeping drugs illegal and scarce, but much can be done to make the criminal justice response more effective and efficient. In the end, the criminal justice system is a very blunt instrument for dealing with drug markets. As necessary as the deterrent threat remains, the arrest, prosecution, and incarceration of individuals is an extremely slow, expensive, and labour intensive process. The key to dis-rupting drug markets and the associated violence and corruption must lie in making the business of drug deal-ing more complicated, making it more difficult for buyers and sellers to connect. To do this, the techniques of situational crime prevention and problem-oriented policing should be employed. Stop jailing petty offenders Current street enforcement actions could be divided into two categories: Opportunistic enforcement, usually against those s found in possession of drugs when stopped for an un- r elated reason. Pro-active enforcement, including buy-and-bust ac- s tions against dealers at open markets; searches of sus-pect pr emises or persons; and more sophisticated long- term investigations. All of these actions are justified under the law, but all absorb scarce criminal justice resources. The decision to perform any given form of enforcement has opportunity costs for other approaches. It is important, then, to weigh the impact of any given action both in terms of its efficacy in reducing the size of the black market and any potential side-effects it might have.167Confronting unintended consequences: Drug control and the criminal black market \"Selective enforcement\" evokes a whole range of justified concerns, but the fact remains that, in all areas of law enforcement, the application of the sanctions of arrest and prosecution is a matter of discretion. The number of cases that go to trial is everywhere a small fraction of those brought to the attention of the police. Cases unlikely to produce the desired outcome (generally, a conviction) are abandoned at various stages of the process in favour of those more likely to be successful. These cases should be weighed not just according to their viability, but also with regard to their strategic and social impact. Unfortunately, the quantitative performance manage- ment systems used in civil service worldwide do not encourage this sort of thinking. If the primary perform-ance indicator of the police is volumes of arrests and seizures, little thought will be given to the impact of these arrests and seizures. Not surprisingly, these arrests and seizures are unlikely to have much positive impact. Research indicates that more enforcement is not neces-sarily better. 21 Conservation of resources requires that police commanders carefully gauge the amount of enforcement required to produce the desired effect. As is discussed further below, there is much to be gained by targeting high profile, high volume, and violent crim-inals, be they users or dealers. Resources that could have been focused on these individuals are often wasted on the opportunistic arrest and incarceration of large vol-umes of petty offenders. In the case of casual users, the sanction of imprisonment is excessive; since many are more mainstream than marginal, considerably less expensive options exist for deterring casual use behav-iour, such as the measures currently taken when under-age drinking and smoking are encountered. Evidence-based treatment is the appropriate response to addiction. For low-level dealers and other drug market functionar- ies, these offenders often come from population groups that are too large to incapacitate and nearly impossible to intimidate. Incapacitation of individuals is fruitless when social conditions generate whole classes of people with strong incentives to offend. When these incentives are strong enough and alternatives scarce, all deterrence fails. Those willing to risk death by ingesting a kilogram of condom-wrapped cocaine bullets are unlikely to be put off by the possibility of a jail sentence. Drug addicts and sex workers are equally hard to scare into good behaviour. While the threat of arrest must remain in place to dissuade those who value their future, those who have given up hope are not so easily frightened. Arrest drives focusing on rounding up large numbers of these \"undeterrables\" result in a net loss in enforcement effectiveness. To avoid these losses, police need alternative avenues of response, particularly when confronted with non-prior-ity cases of drug possession. In the opinion of the Inter-national Narcotics Control Board, the 1988 Convention requires that illicit possession of controlled substances must be prohibited, but it does not require criminal prosecution for small quantities. 23 At times, drug pos- session can serve as a pretext to detain an otherwise dangerous or suspect individual, but otherwise, the law must allow for non-custodial alternatives when a police officer stumbles upon small amounts of drugs. It is important that the incident be documented and the opportunity availed to direct the user to treatment if required, but it is rarely beneficial to expend limited prison space on such offenders. According to surveys, between a quarter and a half of the population of many countries in Europe and North America has been in pos-session of illicit drugs at one time or another in their lives. Most remained productive citizens. In only a small share of these cases would arrest, and the lifelong stigma it brings, have been appropriate. 23 2329 293031333740 051015202530354045 Germany Netherlands Italy Spain England and WalesFrance Scotland Denmark USAPercentage of adult population reporting lifetime cannabis use, 2005 or 2006 Fig. 6: Source: EMCDDA; NSDUH22168World Drug Report 2009 Portugal is an example of a country that recently decided not to put drug users in jail. According to the Interna-tional Narcotics Control Board, Portugal's \"decriminali-sation\" of drug usage in 2001 falls within the Convention parameters: drug possession is still prohibited, but the sanctions fall under the administrative law, not the crim-inal law. 24 Those in possession of a small amount of drugs for personal use are issued with a summons rather than arrested. The drugs are confiscated and the suspect must appear before a commission. The suspect's drug consumption patterns are reviewed, and users may be fined, diverted to treatment, or subjected to probation. Cases of drug trafficking continue to be prosecuted, and the number of drug trafficking offences detected in Portugal is close to the European average. These conditions keep drugs out of the hands of those who would avoid them under a system of full prohibi-tion, while encouraging treatment, rather than incar - ceration, for users. Among those who would not welcome a summons from a police officer are tourists, and, as a result, Portugal's policy has reportedly not led to an increase in drug tourism. 25 It also appears that a number of drug-related problems have decreased.26 The approach is not uncontroversial. Portugal did expe-rience an increase in drug use after this policy was imple - mented, but so did many European countries during this period. Cannabis use increased only moderately, but cocaine and amphetamine use rates apparently doubled off a low base. More alarmingly, cocaine seizures increased seven-fold between 2001 and 2006. While cocaine seizures in a number of European countries increased sharply during that period, in 2006, Portugal suddenly had the sixth-highest cocaine seizure total in the world. The number of murders increased 40% during this same period of time, 27 a fact that might be related to the trafficking activity. Although the rate remains low and Lisbon is one of Europe's safest cities, Portugal was the only European country to show a sig-nificant increase in murder during this period. This rapid increase in trafficking was probably related to the use of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, former colo-nies, as transit countries. Most of the traffickers arrested in Portugal in 2007 were of West African origin. As international awareness of the problem increased, cocaine seizures fell in a number of European countries, but France and Portugal, two countries with former colonies in the region, showed the most pronounced decreases. Creative approaches of this sort seem to have been reserved for the parties on the extreme ends of the traf-ficking chain: the farmers and the users. Because these two groups have been seen, in effect, as victims, a variety of social solutions have been explored as alternatives to harsh law enforcement, including alternative develop-Annual prevalence for adult (15-64) Fig. 7: drug use in Portugal, 2001 and 2007 Source: EMCDDA28 Kilograms of cocaine seized in Fig. 8: Portugal, 2001-2007 Source: UNODC ARQ Citizenship of those arrested in Portu- Fig. 9: gal for cocaine trafficking in 2007 (top eight foreign drug trafficking national groups) Source: UNODC, Drug trafficking as a security threat in West Africa297,36334,477 18,083 7,423 3,0213,1405,574 -5,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,00040,000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2007169Confronting unintended consequences: Drug control and the criminal black market ment and a range of prevention and rehabilitation schemes. Drug traffickers do not elicit similar amounts of sympathy. Seen as actors driven by raw profit, they are held responsible for most of the violence and corruption associated with the drug trade, and the response has been to hit them hard, arresting as many offenders and seizing as many drugs as possible. In some parts of the world, drug enforcement has been used as a pretext to wage war on marginalised communities, resulting in serious human rights violations. 30 Some countries even impose the death penalty for drug offences, contrary to Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But even when it comes to notorious and dangerous dealers, there may be alternatives to incarceration. One technique has been piloted in a number of locations in the United States. Investigators compiled detailed dossi-ers on all known dealers in their jurisdiction, with enough evidence to ensure a likely conviction. These dossiers were simultaneously presented to all the sus-pects with a warning: desist or face prosecution. Support services and networks were mobilised to make the option of desisting feasible. The idea is to get a large share of the participants to withdraw at the same time, causing the market to collapse. When confronted in this way, it appears that many opt out of drug markets. 31 The threat of drug arrest has also been used to deter violent offend-ers. 32 While these interventions are labour intensive, they are less costly than processing a similar number of offenders through the criminal justice system. While incarceration will continue to be the main response to detected traffickers, it should only be applied in exceptional cases to users. All this is not to say that drug use should be ignored; it must be addressed. Drug flows, and their devastating consequences for producer and transit countries, would not exist if it were not for demand in the wealthier nations. While \"demand reduc- tion\" is not generally associated with law enforcement, there are ways the criminal justice system can contrib-ute. Demand-side interventions have the advantage of taking business away from traffickers without violent confrontation, unlike police operations aimed at taking the traffickers away from the business. Mainstream the half-a-percentOne of the most efficient ways to deter traffickers would be to undermine their user base. Annual prevalence statistics make it sound like drug users comprise a sig-nificant share of the global adult population, but, in fact, a small part of this group consumes the vast bulk of the imported drugs: the addicts. While around 5% of the adult population used some illicit drug in the last year (140-250 million users), only about 18-38 million could be classified as \"problem drug users\". 33 While definitions of \"problem drug use\" vary, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction pro- vides estimates for the rates of problem drug use in the adult populations of a number of European countries. The size of these populations range from less than a thousand in Cyprus to some 400,000 in the United Kingdom. Taking the extreme example, it is estimated that about one quarter of the UK's problem drug users reside in London, about 74,000 users, just under 1% of the city's population. 34 Those who are continuously intoxicated or regularly binge are the real source of demand on which traffickers rely. Removing a significant portion of this source of demand, even temporarily, would rip the heart out of Estimated number of \"problem drug users\" in some European countries various years Fig. 10: 2002-2006 Latvia Sweden Finland Slovakia Greece Hungary Denmark Czech Republic Austria Poland Spain Italy United Kingdom170World Drug Report 2009 any drug market. Cannabis provides a good example of this phenomenon. Cannabis is generally consumed com-munally - surveys across countries show most users consume with other people most of the time. Often this involves passing around a common joint or pipe. With fairly good quality cannabis, only a few deep inhalations are needed to produce the desired effect among those who don't use frequently enough to have developed a tolerance. The volume of cannabis consumed by any given user in such a session is trivial, a fraction of a gram, and many casual users only experience one or a few such sessions each year. In contrast, about 9% of those who consume cannabis will, at some point in their lives, go through a period of heavy daily use and develop a tolerance. 35 For those whose situations allow, they may be continuously intox-icated. Estimates of the amounts consumed by heavy users vary, but are on the order of several grams per day. In this way, daily or continuous users smoke the vast bulk of the cannabis consumed. The same is generally true in most other drug markets - a small share of the user population appears to consume the bulk of the drug supply. 36 There are a number of ways this share could be removed from a drug market, but, due to the nature of addiction, they are unlikely to go willingly. Drug use arrestees should not be incarcerated, but rather diverted to evi- dence-based treatment or conditional release. Remain- ing drug-free as a condition for release has been found to be successful where random but regular drug testing results in quick (but not necessarily lengthy) jail time for those who fail to pass. 37 In a city like London, removing the addicts would be a mammoth task, but, as of 2005, Her Majesty's Prison Service already had some 12,000 drug offenders in custody in England and Wales alone.38 In less problematic and less populated areas, a far smaller body of addicts would need be removed to substantially reduce the profitability of the market. Unlike cannabis, those who are addicted to less ubiqui- tous drugs tend to congregate around open drug mar-kets. This gives them continuous access, the company of those similarly situated, a competitive market for their business, and access to criminal employment activities. The ecology of an open drug market is premised on particular conditions, however, the most prominent of which is the neglect of the state. Disrupting this ecology is a matter of bringing some kind of order to these under-regulated zones. Close open drug markets Arresting individuals and seizing their drugs is a tech- nique akin to manually pulling weeds. But there are ways of making the environment less receptive to drug markets, effectively making the ground less fertile. These interventions are rooted in the thinking of situational crime prevention, going beyond arrests and seizures to address the social conditions on which drug markets are reliant. In crime prevention theory, a false dichotomy is often presented between solutions involving law enforcement, which are viewed as short-term correctives, and so-called \"social crime prevention\", which is usually portrayed as a long term project. In the world of short political time horizons, the latter often gets neglected in favour of the former. But there is a third way: interventions aimed at changing social conditions quickly, to impact the condi-tions under which drug markets thrive. 39 This sort of thinking is found in the practices of situational crime prevention. While law enforcement personnel are not typically adept at manipulating social circumstances, they can also play a key role. With training, they can work with addicts in a way that helps them move beyond their destructive behaviour without necessarily using the sanction of arrest. The techniques of problem oriented policing can also help them to recognise and disable the mechanics of drug markets. For example, drug dealers pay a price for remaining underground. They cannot advertise without exposing themselves to law enforcement. Users generally find vendors in one of two ways. One is an open drug market, a specific geographic area or location where anyone can show up and buy drugs. The second is through a net-work of social or information connections. Both are vulnerable to disruption. Many open drug retail markets are found in neglected urban spaces, which also harbour fugitives, sex workers, runaways, and illegal immigrants, and anyone else who wants to avoid the law. These areas are growing in a rap-idly urbanising world, especially in developing countries. Tons of cannabis consumed globally Fig. 11: by frequency of use in 2006 Source: 2006 World Drug Report Chronic 12,775Daily 4800Occasional 43Regular 990171Confronting unintended consequences: Drug control and the criminal black market Unable to accommodate the rapid inflow of people, these cities are at risk of acquiring slums and informal settle-ments beyond the capacity of the state to control, where the norms and informal social controls of the countryside are lost, where anonymity and transience allow drug markets to germinate. In some parts of the world, there are whole regions where drugs and other contraband are available for those in the know, including some free-trade areas, breakaway states, and conflict zones. What these areas have in common is the absence of the rule of law. This does not mean these areas are com-pletely unregulated; a closer look generally reveals the presence of a different kind of authority, an authority with an interest in the appearance of chaos. If these authorities could be called to account, these areas could be reclaimed, with serious consequences for the drug markets. For example, traditional law enforcement has a hard time operating in slum areas. Drug addicts, like the poor farmers on the other end of the market chain, can be extremely difficult to deter. Street dealers also represent a formidably hard target. Often they are gang members, whose whole ethos revolves around conflict with the police. Prison is an expected part of their life cycle, and death a price they are willing to pay for posthumous respect. Many deal drugs for very low wages, so non-fi-nancial motives are foremost among the reasons for their continued participation in the market. In this world, arrests and seizures don't seem to have lasting impact. But street drug markets do not exist in a vacuum. The drama is played out on a very particular kind of a stage, and it is the stage manager, not the actors, that must be addressed. The property in these areas is owned by someone, someone whose neglect of their property allows illicit activity to continue. Unlike the street addicts and gang members, this someone has something of value to lose - their property. Surprisingly, run-down urban properties are often highly prized among slum lords for the incomes they generate, since marginal people will pay a premium to avoid excessive attention, or because they simply have no choice. 40 Legislation that requires that owners take responsibility for what goes on in their establishments could go a long way toward restoring order. Those who fail to comply would face an escalating series of fines, ultimately result-ing in forfeiture of the property. As actions under the civil law, a lower standard of proof would be required than under the criminal law, and procedures could be streamlined to reduce delays due to litigation. Either through voluntary compliance or by literally taking ownership of the situation, the state could once again reassert control over these neglected areas. Ownership could be transferred to law-abiding citizens within and from outside the marginal area, and these residents would have a personal stake in assuring their property remains crime-free. 41 Not every drug market is so tightly associated with a particular piece of property, of course, but the general principle behind this sort of intervention still applies: it makes little sense to try to deter those with nothing to lose. Many are drug users themselves, and may not be rationally planning their actions in accordance with their own best interests. They are generally not the ones making the important market decisions in any case. If these people are moved toward the mainstream, drawn in instead of pushed down, the market loses its most important foot soldiers. Instead, punitive measure should be taken against those who are making real profit from the state of affairs. Some of these players are simply negligent, others are complicit. In either case, they are participating in drug markets because they make money doing so. Threats to that money can be expected to produce results. These types of interventions need not have great resource implications. Some forms of regulation are essentially self-enforcing. For example, laws limiting tobacco smok-ing in public places would be a failure if they relied on the state for enforcement - there are simply too many smokers to control. Instead, anti-smoking laws rely on two non-state sources for compliance. One is the owners of the public establishments themselves, who comply because, as property owners, they are motivated to remain in compliance with the law. The second is non-smokers, who, by virtue of the law, are given a chop moral basis to object to public smoking. The paradigm shift in the anti-tobacco campaign came when the issue ceased to be framed as a matter of per-sonal choice and began to be seen as an issue of public health. Drug markets are no less hazardous for those involuntarily exposed to their \"second hand smoke\". Similar vehicles must be designed to empower the major-ity of people who want no part of drug markets in their communities. Partnerships between local community-based or faith-based organisations and state agencies charged with addressing the drug issue could provide both information and networks for uprooting open drug markets. Of course, closing an open retail drug market does not mean the problem has been solved. Addicts need their drugs, and will continue to source them through infor-mation networks. But closing open drug markets can have several benefits: Open drug markets have a devastating eect on the s marginal neighbourhoods that host them; removing them can allo w these communities to heal and become reintegrated.172World Drug Report 2009 The under-regulated zones that host many open mar- s kets also host marginalised populations prone to sub- stance abuse, including r unaways, people with mental health problems, and sex workers; closing the market would break this important spatial connection. Open drug markets allow virtually anyone to show up s and buy; closing them should slow the expansion of the user base bey ond the aected area. Closing open markets removes the territorial element s on which so much drug related violence is based. R emoval of the territorial element may take drug s markets out of the hands of street gangs. In terms of violence, one of the worst things that can happen in a drug market is for it to fall into the hands of street gangs. Street gangs appear to have evolved inde-pendently in many parts of the world, while missing in other areas entirely. They hold in common an ethos of opposition to the law, however, so interventions designed to deter most people may, perversely, encourage illegal activity in gang members. While there is considerable heterogeneity, most gangs are defined by their associa-tion with a particular territory (\"turf\") and their capac-ity for violence, whether or not they deal drugs. Drugs may increase the incentives and occasions for violence, but much of the violence of drug-dealing gangs is related to issues of \"respect\", and is often committed contrary to their market interests. 42 There is evidence that street gang members are among the lowest-paid actors in the entire distribution chain.43 They sell drugs because that is what street gang members do, because it is a job that can be done while standing on a street corner, and because it is perceived as affording greater dignity that fast-food work, not because it pays well. But given limited alternative forms of employment for uneducated young men with criminal records, it may be the only job on offer. And the prospect of possible future riches may be enough to justify continued participation despite relentless evidence that their efforts are fruitless. Removing drugs as an income stream may decrease the attractions of gang membership and result in long-term violence reduction. And the surest way of taking drugs out of the hands of gangs is to close spatially-linked drug markets. Disrupt information networksIn addition to open markets, drugs are dealt through personal networks. These markets rely on trust - new participants are only introduced through the endorse-ment of existing members. This slows their growth and leaves them fragile. An inherent weakness of black mar-kets is that most of the participants are untrustworthy. Removal of key links, the use of informants, and sting operations (or the rumour of sting operations) can cause extended networks to collapse, and reconstitution may be difficult. 44Similar principles apply further up the trafficking chain, at the wholesale level. People who broker drug deals have only their connections to sell, and therefore take great pains to ensure their suppliers never meet their customers. 45 If the brokers are removed, they are not always easily replaced. This weakness was recently exploited to disrupt the heroin markets in Australia, with very positive consequences. The causes of the \"heroin drought\" have been debated, 46 and it is highly likely that a number of factors played a role, but the balance of the evidence suggests that law enforcement action was important. Australian authori-ties had determined that heroin trafficking was proceed-ing in very large shipment through a limited number of nodal points (\"brokers\") who had connections to both Southeast Asian suppliers and a vast network of street retailers. Evidence suggests that coordinated, interna-tional-level law enforcement operations over a number of years may have progressively removed some of these key brokers, disrupting large-scale shipment to the country, reducing the quantity and quality of heroin available to street-level dealers. In the interim, many addicts went into withdrawal, and some appear not to have resumed heroin use; the market remains smaller to this day. By the time connections were resurrected, the market was not nearly as large. The smaller market attracted fewer new users. Violence, drug-related crime, overdoses, and overall use declined dramatically. 47 2.3 Create flow-specific drug strategies In addition to refining local enforcement techniques, ther e is a broader need to approach the drug problem strategically. Drug strategies are usually devised at a national level, but this is not always the most useful frame of analysis. The most important manifestations of the problem are highly local, and not every area is equally affected. Coming to terms with \"the world drug prob-lem\" can be overwhelming when the issues are not described with sufficient specificity. When broken down into specific flows affecting specific areas in different ways, the problem becomes more manageable. At the same time, local issues are deeply connected to what is going on internationally. As is discussed below, the particularities of each situation are tremendously important in designing interventions, but these interven-tions can only be effective if they are coordinated across borders. Failure to coordinate local initiatives reduces the impact and results in displacement, an effect that has become a recurrent theme in global drug control. Develop a truly \"balanced approach\" The incompatibility of the problem and the primary tools used to engage it has long been recognised, and a \"balanced approach\" between supply-side (enforcement) 173Confronting unintended consequences: Drug control and the criminal black market and demand-side (prevention and treatment) interven- tions has become a commonplace of best international practice. The Conventions, however, are rooted in supply reduction: transnational trafficking is an interna-tional issue, whereas efforts to address demand are largely domestic. Coordinated action on supply has a 70 or 80-year head start on demand-side work. As was observed in this Report some 12 years ago, countries are fre-quently criticised for failing to hold up their end in cooperative supply control efforts, but rarely is a nation taken to task for doing too little in prevention and treat-ment. Partly as a result, in most countries, far more resources have been assigned to supply reduction than to demand reduction. The situation is even more pronounced in developing countries. International assistance in fighting drug supply has been eagerly accepted, since it often takes the form of military hardware, technology, and training. These tools can be used to shore up shaky administrations and combat political opponents. Law enforcement assistance can also further the foreign policy interests of the donor. In comparison, the promotion of treatment centres or prevention campaigns is relatively unattractive. Aside from resource distribution, the concept of a \"bal- anced approach\" suggests that someone is weighing the alternatives, assessing drug problems and designing coordinated interventions as part of an integrated strat-egy. It suggests that actors working on both sides of the drug problem are in communication with one another about current developments. Unfortunately, in these respects, a truly balanced approach is rarely realised. Institutional barriers discour-age cooperation between government sectors. More often, departments of law enforcement, education, and public health fight each other for resources in what is seen as a zero-sum game. Even when oversight or strate- gic offices are established, they seldom have the author-ity to overcome this insular bureaucratic tendency. Different markets call for different interventions at dif- ferent times. Resource allocations need to be similarly dynamic and problem-specific. Further, these resources and the programmes they fund should not be limited to those departments who have traditionally dominated anti-drug efforts. Criminal justice agencies lack the tools to take on all aspects of the drug trade, and many do not make full use of the tools they have. Police and prosecutors must continue their work, keeping drugs illegal, but more dramatic change requires a mandate and a skills set not generally found among criminal jus-tice actors. It may be that drug markets are deeply tied to issues in housing, or foreign affairs, or land use, or transportation, or immigration, or urban development. Until the full range of governmental powers is available to the drug control effort, it is likely that the same agen-cies will continue to do the same work in very much the same way. Moving beyond the capacities of any particular govern- ment, international action should also include those involved in development work and peace building. This point is discussed further below. Target specific drug problems There is also a common tendency to treat the galaxy of illicit substances as an undifferentiated mass. Different drugs come from different places, attract different con-sumers, and are associated with different problems, but they are rarely the subject of distinct strategies. Drug policy is too often \"one size fits all\", when what is needed are interventions tailored to deal with each substance and the unique issues it raises in each location it touches.Number of burglaries and the share of inmates testing positive to heroin in Australia Fig. 12: Source: Australian Institute of Criminology, Drug Use Monitoring in Australia and Australian Crime Facts & Figures. 050,000100,000150,000200,000250,000300,000350,000400,000450,000500,000 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006burglaries -5.010.015.020.025.030.035.0 percent Burglaries Share of detainees testing positive for heroin174World Drug Report 2009 Cultivation Different drugs pose different issues from the point of cultiv ation onward. For example, cannabis is grown in at least 176 countries around the world. It can be grown indoors or outdoors, and is often cultivated in small plots by the users themselves. Because cannabis produces high yields and requires no chemical processing before use, it is the only common illicit drug (except maybe opium) where users can comfortably generate their own supply. 48 Since it requires relatively little maintenance, it is often grown on vacant land in developing countries, by small scale farmers also cultivating other crops. As little is invested, eradication does not provide much disincentive to trying again. Law enforcement can dis-courage large-scale plantations, which are clearly main-tained by well-resourced farmers with a great deal to lose, but the point of diminishing returns is quickly reached in ferreting out smaller grows. The eradication of feral cannabis (\"ditchweed\") can actually aid illicit cultivators, as it reduces pollination by lower potency strains and, if carried out vigorously enough, allows outdoor cultivation of sinsemilla. 49 Synthetic drugs pose similar challenges as cannabis, in that they can be manufactured anywhere the necessary chemicals are available. Unlike cannabis, however, for most synthetic drugs the skills needed to access and process the needed chemicals are not widely spread, 50 and, consequently, the market tends to favour more organised groups. Global precursors control is clearly key in disabling this market. In contrast, most of the cultivation of drug crops like coca and opium poppy is confined to small areas within two or three countries. Most of the world's heroin supply is produced on a land area about the size of Greater London (170,000 ha). This area is by no means the only part of the world where opium poppy could grow; its range is actually quite wide. The world's heroin supply comes from this region because it is controlled by insur-gents. Most of the world's most dangerous substances come from areas with serious governance problems, because large-scale cultivation requires swathes of terri-tory which are effectively outside the control of the national government. Since insurgent groups typically tax cultivation in the areas under their control, the two issues become inextricably intertwined. Reducing culti-vation in these areas is contingent upon establishing political stability and the rule of law. This can be seen in Afghanistan, one of the areas where insurgency and drug production are most clearly symbiotic. The 2009 Winter Opium Poppy Assessment found a strong relationship between poppy cultivation villages and poor security. Trafficking Differences on the production end also affect the way the differ ent drugs are trafficked. Since cannabis can be pro- duced virtually anywhere by anyone, it need not be traf-ficked internationally. Surveys in a number of countries indicate that most users get their cannabis for free at least part of the time, and low-end cannabis is relatively cheap in most markets. This reduces the attraction of the drug for organised crime groups in many parts of the world, particularly where drug law enforcement is low, includ-ing much of the developing world. There are obvious exceptions (over 1000 tons of low-grade herbal cannabis is confiscated annually on the southwest border of the United States), and transnational organised crime is most prevalent today in two markets: hashish and the \"new\" cannabis (buds of sinsemilla, bred for high potency, usually produced indoors, often hydroponically). In contrast, ecstasy production is a more complicated matter than growing cannabis, so transnational traffick-Drug yield in dose units per square Fig. 13: meter of illicit crops Source: UNODC yield studiesShare of villages cultivating poppy Fig. 14: with good and poor security Source: Opium Winter Rapid Assessment 200951 250 23 6 050100150200250300 Cocaine Heroin CannabisDose units per sq meter 956 0102030405060 Good Poor% cultivation175Confronting unintended consequences: Drug control and the criminal black market ing is more commonly involved. Ecstasy distribution is also generally more structured and hierarchical. Although social network distribution is common, consumption of ecstasy is often tied to particular events or dance clubs, and control of these venues means control of the drug market. This control is exercised by club or event secu-rity, who have the power to authorise particular dealers or products, often in complicity with the club owners or event organisers. Consumption Cocaine is often consumed in \"binges\", whereas heroin addicts need a pr edictable supply to avoid withdrawal. These differences shape the market and its consequences. Heroin addicts have the time and disposition to plan and execute property crime, such as burglaries. Users in the midst of a crack binge operate on a much shorter time schedule, and are more likely to take property by force in a robbery. 52 Heroin addicts do trade sex for drugs but crack is much better suited for sex work, since it boosts energy, alertness, and confidence - all assets when negotiating delicate transactions on the streets. These differences are real and have implications for con- trol strategies, but they should not be mistaken for inherent properties of the drug. The same drug can have very different sorts of impacts in different social con-texts. 53 The classic example is alcohol, which is associ- ated with violence and sexual aggression in some societies, but not in others. Cannabis is also associated with violence in some societies, a fact that Western con-sumers may find difficult to believe. 54 Cocaine use among the affluent has very different implications than cocaine use among the dispossessed. Any drug-specific strategy should take local context into account. Drug problems, and the appropriate response to them, also vary over time. The ratio between all drug users and the number of addicts depends on where the given market is in the epidemiological cycle of the drug. In the early days of an epidemic, strong law enforcement is often successful; later, when a large body of addicts have become entrenched, treatment tends to provide the best return on investment. 55 Focus on markets, not individuals It is often difficult for law enforcement agencies to par- ticipate in strategic approaches to crime problems because the case-specific nature of their work. In the past several decades, international law enforcement has struggled to come to grips with the phenomenon of transnational criminality generally. Penal law is matter of national legislation and custom, and, historically, has dealt with matters of primarily local interest. The global rise in prominence of \"organised crime\" prompted the creation of a United Nations convention: the 2000 United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.But this agreement itself highlights the difficulties of coming to consensus on the nature of the problem. Remarkably, the convention nowhere defines \"organised crime\". 56 Instead, the Convention settles for a rather broad description of \"organized criminal group\", com-prising the following elements: a group of three or more persons that was not s randomly formed; existing for a period of time; s acting in concert with the aim of committing at least one s crime punishable by at least four years incarceration;in or der to obtain, directly or indirectly, a s nancial or other material benet. Since most \"groups\" of any sort usually involve three or more people working in concert for a period of time, the defining characteristic of organised crime under the Convention is its seriousness and profit-driven nature. The Convention does not require that the groups oper-ate transnationally, and so the definition encompasses strictly local forms of crime-for-profit. 57 Beyond the fact that money must be made, the range of relevant criminal activities is theoretically unbounded. In practice, how-ever, the backbone of global organised crime has long been transnational trafficking, in particular the illicit trade in drugs. The focus in the Convention on the group, rather than the activities of that group, is not unique to the Conven-tion. It is a manifestation of a recurring perceptual prob-lem in law enforcement. Police officers, investigators, and prosecutors are employed to make cases against individuals and groups of individuals. They lack the authority and the tools to take on an entire trafficking flow. As a result, they tend to conceptualise organised crime as the activities of a collection of particular people, rather than a market with a dynamism of its own. Today, organised crime is less a matter of a group of individuals who are involved in a range of illicit activi-ties, and more a matter of a group of illicit activities in which some individuals are presently involved. If these individuals are arrested and incarcerated, the activities continue, because the market, and the incentives it gen-erates, remain. Sometimes, taking action against the market may mean forgoing action against individuals. It is important that the deterrent message reaches those who actually making the key decisions, rather than the undeterrable masses who often make up the face of drug trafficking. The decision makers are generally rational and profit-ori-ented, as opposed to their front-line employees, whose behaviour may have more to do with issues of liveli-hood, identity and emotion. Sending negative economic 176World Drug Report 2009 feedback can be more effective than endless low-level enforcement. For example, since 2000, the authorities at Schipol Air- port in the Netherlands were faced with a tide of cocaine coming in on commercial flights from the Netherlands Antilles. Over 6000 couriers were arrested in less than three years. The couriers were largely body packers, each carrying about a kilogram of cocaine in their intestines. For the traffickers behind these couriers, the difference in the price of a kilogram of cocaine in Curacao and a kilogram of cocaine in Amsterdam was sufficient to cover the cost of the flight, the fee for the courier, and quite a few losses. The couriers themselves were dispos-able, cheap, and inexhaustible, like cardboard boxes. Losing a few was of no consequence if enough drugs got through to turn a healthy profit. Dutch airport security was constrained by the same issues that constrain law enforcement agents everywhere. Processing a subject through the criminal justice system takes a tremendous amount of time. In addition to intake, the arresting officer may be called upon to testify at trial, and may be compelled to appear multiple times before actually taking the stand. As a result, there are limits on the number of suspects who can be arrested on any given flight. T raffickers know this, and \"shotgun\" multiple couriers on a single flight. In the case of the Antilles, this could be 30 couriers on a flight or more, overwhelming the system. Under these circumstances, arresting individual couriers was futile. It sent no message back to those who were making the decisions, since not enough couriers could be arrested to impact on the bottom line. Rather than focusing on the couriers, the emphasis shifted to the drugs. A system called \"100% control\" was imple- mented, with scanners and profiling on both ends of the flight. Europol described the mechanics of the policy in this way: Crews, passengers, their luggage, the cargo and the planes are systematically searched. Couriers with amounts of less than 3 kg of cocaine are not detained, unless they are arrested for the second time or another criminal offense is involved. Instead, the drugs are confiscated and the smugglers are sent back. Couriers who have been identi-fied are registered on a blacklist, which is provided to KLM, Dutch Caribbean Airlines and Suriname Air-ways. 59 While it would be extremely difficult to process 30 sus- pects per flight through the criminal justice system, it was a relatively simple matter to hold them all and wait for the drugs to pass. When the level of seizures reached a point that trafficking through the airport was no longer profitable, the flow of couriers stopped. The responsible parties had finally received the message. Of course, despite the undeniable success of the 100% control strategy, cocaine continued to flow into Europe. The drug supply had not been stopped, but it had been guided. The ability of government to shape drug mar-kets is not without value, however, and can be used to limit the unintended consequences of enforcement. Guide the market Law enforcement has not succeeded in stopping the flow of drugs from their origins to their destinations, but this does not mean it has had no impact on drug markets. As mentioned above, the production costs of drugs com- prise only a tiny fraction of their retail cost, and this fact is entirely attributable to their illegality. In addition to affecting the amount of drugs getting though, there are other ways that interdiction work affects the drug mar-kets. The impact of law enforcement should be used to guide the market in ways that maximise positive side effects and minimise negative ones. For example, the phenomenon of \"displacement\" is often used to criticise drug control efforts. Crackdowns in one country or region cause cultivators and traffickers to move operations to another. This ability of enforce-ment to displace production and trafficking from one area of the world to another is a valuable tool if wielded with some foresight. In particular, it is important not to displace trafficking into areas where the social impact is likely to be particularly devastating. Drug flows do not impact all that they touch in the same way. For example, over decades tons of heroin have tran-sited the Balkans on their way from Afghanistan to Western Europe. The present estimate is that about 80 tons of heroin transits this region each year. It appar-ently does so with surprisingly little impact on the coun-tries through which it passes. The available data suggest rates of drug use, murder, and other forms of crime in Couriers Detected Arriving at Schiphol Fig. 15: from Curacao, by Quarter Source: World Bank and UNODC, control and the criminal black market the Balkans are lower than in West Europe. This may be because the flow through these countries is highly organ-ised, reliant on high-level corruption, and close to the destination markets. 61 In contrast, the flow of cocaine through Central America and the Caribbean appears to be directly related to the violence afflicting those regions. For example, in 2004 the murder rate in the rural and largely indigenous Gua-temalan province of Pet\u00e9n, close to the Mexico border, was higher than that in Guatemala City. The most remarkable thing about this otherwise pacific province is its notorious role in drug trafficking. Pet\u00e9n has less than half a million people and saw its first paved road in 1982, but has long been the site of clandestine landing strips for traffickers who proceed by land across the Mexican border. 64Total recorded robbery and assault Fig. 16: victimisation rates per 100,000 adjusted for under -reporting Source: UNODC, Crime and its impact on the Balkans60 Guatemalan murder rates per 100,000 by province in 2004 Fig. 17: Source: UNODC, Crime and Development in Central America62Average annual drug use prevalence, Fig. 18: 2005 estimate Source: UNODC, Crime and its impact on the Balkans63 1009 378 141402 26 32 020040060080010001200 Burglary Robbery Assault West Europe SE Europe 7.4 1.24 0.4 0.72 0.08 0.2 0.23.8 1.2 0.20.03012345678 Cannabis Cocaine Opiates Amphetamines% West Europe Average SE Europe Average Eastern Europe Average 91011131420212324273232435458707279104109116118 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140Solol\u00e1Alta VerapazTotonicap\u00e1nQuich\u00e9HuehuetenangoQuetzaltenangoBaja VerapazSan MarcosChimaltenangoSuchitep\u00e9quezRetalhuleuEl ProgresoSacatep\u00e9quezJalapaSanta RosaJutiapaZacapaChiquimulaGuatemalaIzabalPet\u00e9nEscuintla178World Drug Report 2009 Recently, another highly vulnerable area became part of a major cocaine trafficking flow for the first time: West Africa, one of the poorest and least stable areas of the world. From sometime around 2004, Colombian traf-fickers increasingly made use of West African countries as a transit area for their cocaine shipments to Europe. Between 2004 and 2008, at least 46 tons of cocaine were seized in the region and approximately 3.4 tons of cocaine were seized in Europe from some 1400 couriers on commercial air flights from West Africa. The impact on the region was immediate and devastat- ing. Drug traffickers used their financial leverage to cor-rupt top political, military, and law enforcement officials in several countries in the region. There were many inci-dents in which drug seizures disappeared or traffickers escaped inexplicably. In Guinea-Bissau, there was a stand-off between the police and the military over the search of a plane later determined to have contained cocaine. In Sierra Leone, the minister of transport stepped down after his brother was implicated in a large air shipment. Reports began to circulate, including in the affidavits of trafficking suspects, that trafficking through Guinea was controlled by the son of the president who had ruled that country since 1984, Lansana Cont\u00e9. After Cont\u00e9's death at the end of 2008, his son was arrested and confessed to his participation on national TV, alongside the former president's brother-in-law, head of intelligence, and head of the national drug squad. Around 2006, cocaine trafficking through West Africa began to attract international attention, including that of the United Nations Security Council. A wide range of players began to offer emergency assistance, including resources for law enforcement, intelligence, and direct interdiction. Air flights from the region began to receive special scrutiny. In short, the region was put under a spotlight, presenting less than optimal conditions for drug traffickers. By 2008, seizure volumes were in sharp decline, and as of May 2009, there have been no multi-ton seizures reported. The number of air couriers detected in Euro-pean airports has plummeted. According to the database of one network of European airports, of all cocaine cou-riers detected, the share coming from West Africa dropped from 59% in the second quarter of 2007 to 6% in the first quarter of 2009. While many of the vulnerabilities that made West Africa attractive to cocaine traffickers remain in place, the increase in international attention appears to have been sufficient to persuade them to find paths of less resist-ance. It is possible, if not likely, that they would return should international attention falter. But for now, West Africa has been spared the corrupting influence of a cocaine flow valued at more than the GDPs of some countries in the region. Cocaine continues to find its way to Europe, of course, and there are no indications that the loss of this route significantly curtailed supply. There are few regions of the world as vulnerable as West Africa, however, and international attention has apparently given this poor region a reprieve. The threat was addressed early enough that the impact need not be long-lasting. On the whole, this was a very positive result. This example shows that while international cooperative efforts have not plugged every hole, they can present significant disincentives, guiding markets. Aside from guiding flows, there are many other ways enforcement could be used strategically to reduce violence, corrup-tion, and other unintended consequences. For example, the decision to target violent drug traffickers has the Share of detected cocaine couriers whose flight originated in West Africa Fig. 19: Source: UNODC, Transnational trafficking in West Africa: A threat Africa179Confronting unintended consequences: Drug control and the criminal black market effect of advantaging non-violent offenders. The size of the drug market may remain the same, but the state has provided an economic incentive to avoid violence. 66 With some practice, these sorts of interventions could also be used as part of a broader plan to significantly undermine specific trafficking organisations or even whole markets. 2.4 Strengthen international resistance to drug markets In addition to creating viable international and local strategies for dealing with dr ug problems, it is important that the actors themselves be strengthened. The weak link in drug control has long been those parts of the world where the rule of law is absent. Building institu-tional strength and capacity in these countries is key to the mission of supporting democracy, economic growth, and human rights. It is also important that the bedrock of international cooperation be strengthened, through enhanced use of the United Nations Conventions. In addition to the drugs Conventions, those on T ransnational Organised Crime and Corruption present great opportunities for reducing the size of drug markets and associated prob-lems. Spread the rule of law As mentioned above, large-scale illicit crop cultivation seems to require political instability because accountable governments can be compelled to take action against drug production in areas under their control. It is no coincidence that most of the world's cocaine and heroin supplies come from countries with insurgency problems. Almost all of the world's cocaine supply comes from three countries and almost all the world's heroin supply comes from two. This is not because coca and opium poppy could not be cultivated in other areas - in the past, most of the world's supply of these drugs came from countries not presently leading illicit production. All of these countries have problems with the rule of law in the cultivation areas. But while cultivators may enjoy zones of chaos, some traffickers may prefer authoritarian regimes. Areas too fraught by conflict lack the infrastructure and the pre-dictability to be good commercial nodes, whether the trade is licit or illicit. In contrast, areas under control of an absolute, and absolutely corrupt, leadership allow what would normally be clandestine activities to be con-ducted openly, greatly increasing efficiency. Rather than risk the unpredictable cost of interdiction, traffickers may opt for the more predictable costs of corruption. In the end, the two phenomena go hand in hand. Abso- lutist governments are often formed (and tolerated) in response to the threat of instability. This threat typically exists because some portion of the population is poor and marginalised, and the state is either unwilling or unable to meet its needs. As a result, dealing with drug cultivation countries and transit countries often boils down to the same thing. The rule of law must be strengthened in all its aspects, including promoting democracy, increasing the capacity for law enforcement, and ensuring the protection of human rights, as well as promoting economic development. Economic development is also key in promoting politi- cal stability. Civil war has been linked to both low income and low growth. 67 Unfortunately, political sta- bility is also key to economic growth. As one authority points out \"Civil war is development in reverse.\" 68 To break out of this cycle, measures taken to establish civil order can establish the foundation for investment and growth. In this way, all aspects of international coopera-tion are related. Development assistance, post-conflict planning, and crime prevention must be coordinated, for any weakness in the chain can lead to the collapse of the whole. 180World Drug Report 2009 Cocaine/heroin trafcking routes and instability Map 1: Source: UNODC Main insurgencies involved in drugs Trafficking by sea Trafficking by air Coca production Opium production Opium/heroin trafficking routesCocaine trafficking routes UN Political/Peace Building m issions (excluding regional m issions) UN Peace Keaping missions (with more than 2000 personnel deployed)181Confronting unintended consequences: Drug control and the criminal black market Make better use of the international tools and interventions The 1988 Convention established the means to move beyond arrests and seizures in dealing with international drug problems. The anti-trafficking measures, including those aimed at chemical precursors, money laundering, and asset forfeiture, greatly expanded the tools available to law enforcement. T wo decades later, much more could be done to apply these tools to transnational traf-ficking flows. Cooperative work on money laundering and asset forfeiture in particular could greatly be expanded. Those involved in work on transnational drug issues are very familiar with the three drug Conventions, but may be less familiar with those on T ransnational Organised Crime and Corruption. This is a pity because these two under-utilised instruments could be used to great effect in combating drug markets and related violence and corruption. The United Nations Convention on T ransnational Organised Crime is key in establishing the legislative framework needed to address the drug business, and in building the mechanisms for international cooperation. But there is a large gap in the rate of ratification and the implementation of its provisions. Many countries have passed legislation that is rarely used, but has tremendous potential if applied strategically. For example, the Con-vention allows for the criminalisation of membership in an organised crime group without the need to prove any particular individual was associated with any particular offence. This can be used to confront organised crime groups with the certainty of arrest if drug market activity or violence does not stop, as discussed above. Another underutilised opportunity for cooperation lies in the area of money laundering and asset forfeiture. Perhaps because law enforcement officials lack financial expertise, police departments across the globe find the process of tracing and seizing money far more difficult than tracking contraband. Even more unusual is inter-national cooperation in the recovery of illicit assets. But much of the costs of enforcement could be redeemed if asset forfeiture were taken seriously. If legal challenges and administrative difficulties have proven insurmount-able, a renewed effort must be made to streamline the process so that money made in crime can be used to prevent it in the future. The same is true in the area of corruption. By providing criminals with virtual immunity from prosecution, cor-ruption can nullify the deterrence effect normally expected from the enforcement of the drug control system. In adopting the United Convention against Corruption, the Member States have equipped them-selves with a powerful instrument to remove an essential lubricant of criminal black markets. But despite the fact that the convention entered into force four years ago and has already been signed by 140 countries, this effort has also fallen short of its potential when it comes to its concrete application. When dealing with corruption, the basic principle of focusing on those who can be deterred applies once again. A dealer risks very little in offering a bribe, an but official risks quite a lot in receiving it. In a word, they can be deterred. Those who might be expected to encounter traffickers in their daily business should expect to be especially scrutinised, if not audited. T rans-parency should be the price of the job. Corruption and drug markets are locked in a mutually re-enforcing cycle. Drug money is a powerful corrupting force, but many drug markets would be impossible without corruption. Anti-corruption work has the potential to simultaneously improve governance while undermining the ability of criminals to operate with impunity. Once the cycle is reversed, growing confi-dence in government will improve citizen cooperation, further undermining corrupt officials and the criminals that rely on them. In parallel to these efforts to strengthen international resistance to drug markets broadly, there is a need to act on an emergency basis in those parts of the world where the rule of law has collapsed, and ensure that crime pre-vention is at the head of the agenda when reconstruction begins. Tottering states everywhere both generate and attract organised crime. Crime predictably comes with periods of transition and upheaval, and planning should proceed with this fact in mind. Peacekeeping and crime prevention must go hand in hand. Their object is the same: the provision of safety and security. Their opponents are also often the same: the agents of instability that profit off human misery. Even after the open hostilities have ceased, however, these same agents continue to operate in states strug-gling to get back on their feet. As has become evident in Afghanistan, those who earn their money from instabil-ity will go to great lengths to ensure this instability persists. Peacekeeping and reconstruction missions are not complete until these countries are able to cope with the security challenges confronting them, be they armed insurgencies or organised crime. Reconstruction and development cannot proceed without the rule of law in place. Improve information systems As the first part of this World Drug Report demon- strates, there remains a great deal of uncertainty around the extent and nature of drug production, trafficking and consumption. This is not because these data involve clandestine markets and are therefore unattainable. The methods and techniques for extracting reliable informa-182World Drug Report 2009 tion about drug activities have been honed over decades. In many cases, all that is needed is the small amount of effort required to gather and submit administrative data, data that are gathered in the normal course of business for government in any case. A renewed effort must be made to bolster our collective knowledge base around global drug issues. This infor-mation is in the strategic security interests of all parties concerned. Information-sharing obligations embedded in the Conventions are not consistently fulfilled by a number of key parties. Without this information, it become very difficult to describe the present situation or the direction things are going. It also becomes impos-sible to gauge the impact of specific and collective inter-ventions. 2.5 Take the crime out of drug markets The discussion above has outlined some of the ways that global dr ug control efforts could be improved to reduce the size of the drug markets and the associated violence and corruption. First, it suggests several ways current enforcement practices could be refined: Drugs must remain prohibited because the fact of il- s legality alone reduces the number of potential addicts, par ticularly in developing countries. Drug control must be conducted in ways designed to s limit associated violence and corruption. D rug enforcement should focus less on high volumes s of arrests and more on reducing the size of drug mar- kets thr ough targeted enforcement and situational crime prevention. The incarceration of drug users should be exceptional; s rather, users should be tracked and addicts brought into tr eatment. The addict population should be a priority, as they pro- s vide the bulk of the demand. O pen drug markets must be closed, using the tech- s niques of situational crime prevention and problem- oriented policing. The discussion then endorses the creation of multidisci- plinary strategies tailored to meet the problems posed by particular drugs in particular places: Planning s for drug control must not be centred on law enfor cement agencies, and should involve coordinated actions from actors in a range of disciplines and gov- ernment agencies. Enforcement agencies can participate, but need to s move beyond a focus on punitively incarcerating in- dividuals to look at ways of disabling the mar ket, even when this means forgoing arrests.Although entrenched markets may be dicult to dis- s able, they can be guided by enforcement action so that they do the least possible damage. Finally, this chapter looks at ways the international com- munity can build resistance to drug markets: Both cultivation and transit countries suer from weak- s ness in the rule of law; supporting the growth of insti- tutional str ength and integrity in these countries will make them more resistant to the tracking of drugs and other forms of contraband. There remains great potential in the Conventions on s T ransnational Organised Crime and Corruption to col- lectiv ely address the problem of global drug markets. There is a strong need to improve and develop inter- s national information sharing systems, so that progress can be measur ed and interventions evaluated. A common thread throughout these proposals is the need to integrate the marginalised individuals, areas, and nations that cultivate, consume, and distribute drugs. These people need to be brought in, not pushed down. They will find it impossible to develop without getting beyond crime, but it is very difficult to get beyond crime without some prospect of development. It is incumbent on all in the international community to ensure that no one is faced with impossible choices, and that behaviour that benefits all of us is in the interest of each of us.183Endnotes 1 While the share of the global population living in poverty declined by half between 1981 and 2005, much of this is due to the growth of the Chinese economy. During the same period, the number of poor people in sub-Saharan Africa doubled, and little progress has been seen in reducing the number of poor in South Asia, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East/North Africa. See: http://go.worldbank.org/VL7N3V6F20. The structural adjust-ment conditionalities of international lenders have been widely criti-cised as actually aggravating poverty, including by the World Health Organisation. See: http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story084/en/index.html. It has even been asserted that, by providing an influx of unearned wealth, international aid can produce an effect similar to the \"resource curse\" and can have a negative impact of democracy.

Dead aid: Why aid is not working and how there is another way for Africa. London: Allen Lane, 2009. International peacekeeping has been similarly criticised. The international commu-nity has been taken to task for both its actions and its failure to act, including in instances of genocide. Some have even argued that inter-national efforts to build peace have the unintended consequence of prolonging civil wars, since the lack of a clear victor keeps grievances at a simmer. See Luttwak, E. 'Give war a chance'. Foreign Affairs, July/August 1999. There have been scandals in which peacekeepers have been found to be involved in criminal rackets, including human trafficking. Despite these issues, there is very little serious discussion of abandoning cooperative efforts to address poverty or conflict, only debate as to how best to improve current efforts. 2 There are, of course, other costs associated with drug criminalisation, including the mass incarceration of non-violent offenders and nega-tive impact on the ability of people to access treatment. 3 \"Ninety six percent of all countries (186 countries) are State Parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961.

We cannot destroy the appetite for psychotropic drugs...What we can and should do is eliminate the black market for the drugs by regulating and taxing them as we do our two most harmful recreational drugs, tobacco and alcohol.\" http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124061360462654683.html Similarly, Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron recently argued, \"The right policy ... is to legalize drugs while using regulation and taxation to dampen irresponsible behavior related to drug use...This approach also allows those who believe they benefit from drug use to do so, as long as they do not harm others... Legalization is desirable for all drugs, not just marijuana. ...It is impossible to reconcile respect for individual liberty with drug prohibition.\" http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/24/miron.legalization. drugs/index.html Others have been cautious, arguing generally against \"prohibition\" while limiting discussion of taxation to cannabis. For example, Milton Friedman and 500 other economists endorsed a plan to legal-ise and tax cannabis in the United States in June 2005: http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/ 5 World Bank, Tobacco control in developing countries. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000. 6 There are several ways drugs can kill, including their acute physical effects, their long term health impact, and their influence on behav-iour. Neither alcohol nor tobacco are likely to kill the user through their acute effects; the same cannot be said of heroin or stimulant drugs, particularly for those with pre-existing health conditions. Long term health consequences have not been well studied for many of the illicit drugs, but heavy tobacco and cannabis smoking pose similar hazards. Unlike tobacco, alcohol can have an extremely dangerous impact on behaviour, but so can most of the currently illicit drugs. According to the Oxford Medical Companion (1994), \"...tobacco is the only legally available consumer product which kills people when it is used entirely as intended.\" This would not be the case if drugs like crystal methamphetamine were legalised. 7 http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/facts/en/ 8 United Nations Development Programme, Human Development Report 2007/2008. New York, UNDP , 2008. 9 Data on drug prices from WDR 2008; data on GDP per capita from Human Development Report 2007/2008. Restrictions on coca cultivation have softened since 2006, and the reported price of cocaine in Bolivia has dropped to US$3.50 per gram, despite the fact that cocaine remains illegal and seizures have increased. The impact this will have on cocaine use in Bolivia has yet to be evaluated, but there is evidence of rising problems with cheap cocaine base products throughout the region. 10 World Health Organisation, Report on the global tobacco epidemic 2008.

Almost the entire cultivation (98%) was confined to seven out of 34 provinces, all of which had security problems: five of these provinces were in the south (Hilmand, Kandahar, Uruzgan, Daykundi and Zabul provinces) and two in the west of Afghanistan (Farah and Nimroz provinces). In 2008, 18 provinces were poppy-free, five more than 2007. This included the eastern province of Nangarhar, which, in 2007, had the second largest area under opium poppy cultivation in the country. Only a very small portion of the total cul- tivation took place in the north (Baghlan and Faryab north-east (Badakhshan province) and east (Kunar, Laghman and Kapisa provinces). Together, these provinces accounted for less than 2% of cultivation. Eradication activities in 2008 were severely affected by resistance from insurgents. In 2008, a total of 5,480 ha of eradicated opium poppy fields were verified by the Ministry of Counter Narcotics, Afghanistan/UNODC. This included governor-led eradication (4,306 ha) and eradication led by the centrally controlled Poppy Eradi-cation Force (1,174 ha).

Regional trader prices for dry opium decreased in all regions except the Central Region. Prices fell by 30% in the Eastern Region, 20% in the Northern, 20% in the Southern and 17% in the Western Region. In general, in 2008, regional trader price differences were less pro-nounced than in the three previous years. Regional prices tended to be higher in the Eastern and Western Regions, which are thought to be the two main exit routes for opium and heroin exports, and low in the South, where the bulk of opium production occurs. Low prices can be a consequence of many factors, including difficult marketability of opium due to law enforcement activities, cost of transport from northern to southern Afghanistan for heroin production and onward traffick-ing to other countries, or a high volume of opium being offered on the market.Afghanistan, potential opium production (mt), 1994-2008Production The total opium production in 2008 was estimated at 7,700 mt, a reduction of 6% compared to 2007. Due to higher than average yields in the seven provinces where most of the opium poppy cultivation took place, the decrease in production was smaller than the decrease in cultivation. Taking domestic consumption of opium, seizures and opium exports into account, Afghanistan's morphine and heroin production destined for export was estimated at 630 mt in 2008, a decrease of 5% compared to 666 mt in 2007. 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Afghanistan, monthly farm-gate prices of dry opium (US$/kg), Nov 2002 Production Farm-gate value The gross income for farmers who cultivated opium poppy was estimated at US$ 730 million in 2008. This is a decrease from 2007, when farm-gate income for opium was estimated at US$ 1 billion. The farm-gate value of opium as a proportion of GDP decreased in 2008 to 7% compared to 12% in 20076. The total farm-gate income from opium in Afghanistan is calcu-lated based on dry opium prices at harvest time. 6 These percentages were calculated considering the 2007 GDP esti- mated by the Central Statistical Office of Afghanistan at US$ 10.2 billion.Households involved In 2008, the survey estimated that 366,500 families were involved in opium poppy cultivation compared to 509,000 families in 2007 (a decrease of 28%). Given an average of 6.5 members per family, this represents an estimated total of about 2.4 million persons, or 9.8% of Afghanistan's population of 24.5 million.

Overall, cultivation levels remained well below the levels reached in the early and mid-1990s. Increases in the country's two largest cultivation regions, the Yungas of La Paz and Chapare, occurred roughly at the same rate.

Statistical Annex Production Production In 2007, potential cocaine production in Bolivia increased by 9% to113 mt. The increase in cocaine pro-duction is more pronounced than for the area under coca cultivation. This is because areas of relatively low yield where coca leaf is produced for traditional pur-poses have not been included. Prices Farm-gate prices of sun-dried coca leaf in Chapare Region outside the state-controlled market experienced a strong increase in 2008 and reached a level of over US$ 6/kg (average US$5.5/kg), which was last reached in 2002. However, information from the first months of 2009 indicates a return to prices of around US$ 4/kg after good coca leaf harvests in the preceding rainy season. Coca leaf prices in the Yungas of La Paz, on the other hand, remained relatively stable over the course of the year. The monthly average price ranged from 36 bolivianos (Bs) or US$ 5.1/kg to Bs 39 or US$ 5.3/kg. The annual average is of Bs 38 was similar to 2007, however, expressed in US$ terms, it increased from US$ 4.8/kg in 2007 to US$ 5.2/kg in 2008 due to a change in the currency exchange rate. The annual average price of sun-dried coca leaf in the state-controlled market increased significantly both in Bolivianos and US$ terms, from an average of Bs 35 or US$ 4.6/kg in 2007 to Bs 44 or US$ 6.1/kg in 2008 (weighted by the amount of coca leaf traded in the state-controlled markets of Sacaba in Chapare region and Villa Fatima in La Paz).

Source unless otherwise indicated: National monitor- ing system supported by UNODC.198World Drug Report 2009 Cultivation and eradication In 2008, the area under coca cultivation decreased by 18% to 81,000 ha, roughly the same level as in 2006. Most of the decrease of 18,000 ha took place in the regions of Meta-Guaviare, Putumayo-Caquet\u00e1 and Ori-noco. On the other hand, a significant increase was observed in the Pacific region as well as in some smaller cultivation regions. Thus, the Pacific region remained the region with the largest area under coca cultivation, with just below 30,000 ha or 38% of the total area, fol-lowed by the Central region (23%), Putumayo-Caquet\u00e1 (17%) and Meta-Guaviare (15%). The Colombian authorities continued to intensify manual eradication activities, which increased by 43% and reached a record high of 95,634 ha in 2008. In the Departments of Putumayo and Antioqu\u00eda (Central region) alone, 30,834 ha and 19,366 ha were eradicated, respectively. In addition, in 2008, more than 133,000 ha of coca bush were sprayed in 14 Departments. Most spraying took place in the Department of Nari\u00f1o (Pacific region), where over 54,000 ha were sprayed, followed by Guaviare, Putumayo, Caquet\u00e1 and Antioqu\u00eda. 1994-2008 Sources: Cultivation: 1994-1998: CICAD and US Department of State, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report; since 1999: National Illicit Crop Monitoring System supported by UNODC; eradication/spraying: Government of Colombia. 020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000140,000160,000180,000200,000 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008Hectares Net coca cultivation area (end of year figure) Spraying (cumul.)

Statistical Annex Production Production In 2008, the potential cocaine production in Colombia was estimated at 430 mt, much lower than in any of the four preceding years for which comparable data is avail-able. The reduction in potential cocaine production (-28%) was more pronounced than the decrease in area under coca cultivation (-18%). Among other reasons, this was due to strong area decreases in some of the main coca cultivation regions (Meta-Guaviare, Putumayo-Caquet\u00e1 and Orinoco), which were only partly counter-balanced by area increases in Pacific and other regions with average or below average yields. Lower coca leaf yields in Meta-Guaviare and Putumayo-Caquet\u00e1 also contributed to the overall reduction in potential cocaine production. Prices for coca leaf, cocaine and opium UNODC's monitoring of coca leaf prices in Colombia is not yet fully developed and the availability of monthly average farm-gate prices differs from region to region and over the course of a year. Thus, small-scale price changes should be interpreted with caution. Farm-gate prices are also thought to be influenced by armed groups who are able to control prices in their region of influ-ence. Farm-gate prices in Colombian pesos (COP) for coca leaf and derivatives changed little in 2008 compared to 2007. Over the last three years, farm-gate prices for coca leaf and paste were decreasing, despite higher costs of agricultural inputs and precursors necessary for produc-ing coca paste. On average, the per kilo price of fresh coca leaf decreased from COP 2,400/kg or US$ 1.2/kg in 2007 to COP 2,200/kg or US$ 1.1/kg in 2008. Farm-gate prices of coca paste have seemed relatively stable or slightly declining since 2004. Regional price averages ranged between a maximum of COP 2,056,000/ kg in the Central region and a minimum of COP 1,714,583/kg in the Pacific region. In 2007, both the regional maximum and minimum prices were slightly higher with a maximum of 2,121,107/kg observed in the Central region and the minimum at COP 1,772,677/ kg in the Putumayo-Caquet\u00e1 region. Coca leaf, which in Colombia is sold as fresh leaf (not sun-dried as in Bolivia and Peru), and coca paste, which many farmers in Colombia produce on the farm, are traded in Colombian pesos. Cocaine at the wholesale level, however, is thought to be traded mainly in US dollars.

Overall, the level of opium poppy cultivation in the country remains extremely low and is restricted to isolated plots in remote areas. According to Government reports, eradication took place on 575 ha (during or after the helicopter survey). In the majority of cases, eradication took place when opium harvesting was already underway. The largest area eradicated was in Phongsaly where 310 ha or 54% of the total eradication was undertaken, followed by Huaphanh (53 ha) and Oudomxay (47 ha). 1 The information in this section comes from the report on Opium Poppy Cultivation in South East Asia (UNODC/Governments of Lao PDR, Myanmar and Thailand, December 2008), and can also be found on the Internet (http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/crop-monitoring/index.html). 2 Source of cultivation, yield and production estimates: National moni- toring systems supported by UNODC.

Statistical Annex Production Prices Opium prices were collected at the provincial level by local authorities during or soon after the 2008 opium harvest. 7 The average opium price increased to US$ 1,227/kg in 2008, a 26% increase over the same period in 2007. Strong regional disparities in price indicated that there were significant local variations in supply and market access. Opium prices ranged between US$ 556/kg and US$ 744/kg in Phongsaly and Huaphanh prov-inces, where opium poppy production still exits, and reached record levels of US$ 2,209/kg and 2,124/kg in Vientiane, the capital city, and Luang Prabang province where opium poppy cultivation has been completely eliminated, or is very scarce, and while demand is high. Addiction In line with a decrease in opium cultivation, the Gov-ernment reports a decline in the prevalence rate of opium use the northern provinces from 0.6% in 2006 to 0.3% in 2007 and 0.2% in 2008 (expressed as a percentage of the population aged 15 and above). Relapse, however, continues to be a problem. In 2008, 4,906 opium addicts were identified as having relapsed. The total number of addicts amounted to 12,680 persons. 7 Since 2006, no clear distinction can be made between retail, wholesale and farm-gate prices. Only limited amounts of opium are thought to be sold in or to markets outside the province of origin.Lao PDR, potential opium production (mt), 1994-2008 Lao PDR, annual opium prices (US$/kg), 2002-2008Production The potential production of opium in the year 2008 was estimated at 9.6 mt, representing a 7% increase in pro- duction over 2007 based on the estimated area under cultivation. Bad weather conditions in northern Lao PDR did not permit the survey team to undertake a yield survey in 2008. Observations made from the heli-copter indicated that the crop health was similar to that of 2007, that is, characterised by poor fields and low plant vigour. At the harvest stage, the capsules observed were small and capable of producing only a limited amount of opium gum. Therefore, the 2007 yield esti- mate of 6 kg/ha was also used to estimate production in 2008. 020406080100120140160180Metric tons P roduction 120 128 140 147 124 124 167 134 112 120 43 14 20 9.0 9.6 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 0200400600800100012001400 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008US$/kg3.1.5 Myanmar 204World Drug Report 2009 1 1 The information in this section comes from the report on Opium Poppy Cultivation in South-East Asia (UNODC/Governments of Lao PDR, Myanmar and Thailand, December 2008), and can also be found on the Internet (http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/crop-monitoring/index.html).

Statistical Annex Production Cultivation and eradication In 2008, the total area under opium poppy cultivation in Myanmar was estimated at 28,500 ha. Despite the small increases observed in the past two years, opium poppy cultivation in Myanmar remains far below the levels reached in the 1990s. The vast majority of the opium poppy cultivation in Myanmar continued to take place in South Shan (53%) and East Shan State (33%). In 2008, the most important increase in opium poppy cultivation was observed in East Shan State, with 36% more opium poppy under cultivation as compared to 2007, whereas in South Shan State cultivation decreased by 17%. According to official reports from the Government of Myanmar, a total of 4,820 ha were eradicated in 2007-2008, which is an increase of 34% compared to the eradication in 2006-2007 when 3,598 hectares were eradicated. Eradication in Kachin State was four times higher than a year earlier but still below the level reported in 2005. Eradication in East Shan State increased by 13% and in South Shan State by 33%. In Chin State, eradication teams eradicated all the opium poppy found in the region, which was mainly concentrated in the border areas.

In 2007, the estimated yield was 16.6 kg/ha and the estimated potential opium production was 460 mt.Due to the lower yield, opium production in 2008 was lower than in 2007 although the area under opium poppy cultivation was roughly the same. Most opium was produced in the Shan State (88%), particularly in South Shan (56%) and East Shan (30%). Prices In 2008, the average farm-gate price of opium at harvest time was estimated at US$ 301/kg. This represents an increase of 15% compared to the average price reported in 2007 (US$ 261/kg). A similar price increase was observed between 2006 and 2007. In 2008, prices con-tinued to differ strongly across states, with Kachin State reporting the highest price (US$ 518/kg) and South Shan State reporting the lowest (US$ 265/kg). The larg-est increase in price compared to last year was observed in Kachin and North Shan States; both states where little opium poppy cultivation took place. Whereas in South Shan and East Shan States, which together pro-duced 88% of the opium, the price increase was less pronounced.

Statistical Annex Production Myanmar, prices for dry opium (US$/kg), 1999-2008 The wholesale opium prices collected in the Mong Pawk area, which is located in Special Region 2 (Wa region), Shan State, by and large reflect the increase in farm-gate prices. The monthly opium wholesale prices, which were close to the average farm-gate price before the opium ban in the Wa region, seemed to have increased more rapidly than the farm-gate prices. This could be due to the higher risk premium, which traders have to consider in a region where opium poppy is banned. However, it has to be noted that wholesale prices were collected on the open opium market in Mong Pawk town until an opium ban was introduced by the author-ities in mid-2005, but had to be collected from a wider range of places and under more difficult conditions after the ban. This limits comparability. Household income and strategies In 2008, the average annual cash income of an opium poppy growing household was estimated at US$ 687, while that of a non-opium poppy cultivating household was slightly higher, at US$ 721. As in past years, in most states, the average household cash income in villages that never grew opium poppy was higher than the average household income in villages in the same region that were still growing poppy in 2008 or had grown in the past. Villages reporting opium poppy cultivation were also characterised by lower food security compared to opium poppy-free villages. The survey findings suggest that non-poppy growing villages could achieve a higher level of food security through cultivation of rice. The importance of rice cultivation for food security and poppy cultivation is emphasized by the fact that villages with access to paddy land (irrigated rice fields) were less likely to grow opium poppy. The situation was different in South Shan State, where the average income in poppy growing villages was higher than non-poppy growing villages and over half of the average household cash income in poppy growing villages was reported to stem from opium. This may be due to the relatively large scale of poppy cultivation and higher than average opium yields in this region. In 2008, the survey findings also indicated that house- holds in former poppy growing villages could not find adequate means of substituting their lost cash income from opium. Villages growing opium poppy showed a significantly higher intensity of shifting cultivation, both in terms of acreage of forest cleared and duration of fallow periods, compared to non-growing villages. The most common coping strategy for the farmers who had stopped opium poppy cultivation was to grow more rice and maize and to sell livestock. There is also some evidence of migration occurring in the Wa region where opium poppy cultivation was abandoned in 2005. Addiction Within the surveyed area in 2008, the average level of addiction was higher in villages with opium poppy cul-tivation compared to non-growing villages. As in previ-ous years, opium addiction continues to be a predominantly male phenomenon. The level of amphet- amine-type stimulant (ATS) and heroin addiction was low compared to opium abuse in both growing and non-growing villages. The survey did not cover urban areas where these types of addiction are thought to 2002-2008 Mong Pawk, open opium market (Jan '99 - Jun '05) Mong Pawk area, clandestine trading (since Jul '05)3.1.6 Peru 208World Drug Report 2009 * As reported by the Government of Peru. 1 The information in this section comes from the report on Coca Cultivation in Peru (UNODC/Government of Peru, June 2009), and can also be found on the Internet (http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/crop-monitoring/index.html).

For the calculation of coca leaf available for cocaine production, 9,000 mt of sun-dried coca leaf were deducted from this figure, which, according to Government sources, is the amount used for traditional purposes.3 The weighted average price takes into account that different amounts of coca leaf are sold in different coca cultivation regions at different price levels. The exact volume of coca leaf traded and the prices of the transaction are not known. As an approximation, the annual average prices of the main coca cultivation regions were multiplied with the potential annual coca leaf production in these regions to calculate the weights. These regions represent 82% of estimated amount of coca leaf available for cocaine production. 4 Excluding coca leaf macerations pits.2007 Change on 2007 2008 Coca cultivation Of which Alto Huallaga Apur\u00edmac-Ene ha sun-dried coca leaf yield 2,200 kg/ha 2,200 kg/ha Potential production of sun-dried coca leaf 2 Potential production of sun-dried coca leaf available for cocaine production Potential production of cocaine HCl116,800 mt 107,800 mt 290 mt+5%+5% +4%122,300 mt 113,300 mt 302 mt Average farm-gate price of sun-dried coca leaf Average farm-gate price of sun-dried coca leaf (weighted) 3 Average farm-gate price of coca paste Average price of cocaine HCl*US$ US$ farm-gate value of sun-dried coca leaf US$ 292 million US$ 379 million Reported eradication of coca cultivation* Reported seizure of sun-dried coca leaves*Reported seizure of coca paste*Reported seizure of cocaine HCl* Reported destruction of coca laboratories 4* Of which cocaine HCl processing laboratories12,072 ha kg Reported seizure of opium latex* 126 kg n.a.Fact sheet - Peru Coca Survey 200812093. Statistical Annex Production Production In 2008, total production of sun-dried coca leaf was estimated at 122,300 mt. After a deduction of 9,000 mt, which, according to Government reports, is the amount used for traditional purposes, 113,300 mt would be available for cocaine production. Based on a conversion rate of 375 kg of sun-dried coca leaf for one kilogram of pure cocaine, this corresponds to a potential cocaine production of 302 mt. Cultivation and eradication In 2008, the area under coca cultivation in Peru increased by 4% or 2,400 ha to 56,100 ha, which is the third, albeit relatively small, consecutive increase in three years. Peru remains the world's second largest cultivator of coca bush after Colombia. Peru's three largest cultivation region, Alto Huallaga, Apur\u00edmac-Ene and La Conven-ci\u00f3n-Lares, represented 85% of the area under coca cultivation in 2008. The rate of expansion was average or below average in these regions, which nonetheless contributed most to the increase in absolute terms, and even more in most of the smaller production areas. The area under coca cultivation eradicated, 10,430 ha in 2008, decreased by 16% compared to 2007 and was lower than in any year since 2003. Government reports on eradication indicate that opium poppy cultivation continues to exist in Peru. However, the area currently cultivated with opium poppy is not known.

The simple average farm-gate price of sun-dried coca leaf traded outside the Government-controlled market was US$ 3.4/kg, over one third more than in 2007, compared to just US$ 1.7/kg for coca leaf traded under Government control. Wage labour costs for coca har-vesting increased noticeably in the main coca cultivation regions, for example in Monz\u00f3n in Alto Huallaga from under 14 Peruvian soles per day in 2007 to more than 23 soles in 2008. Costs of other agricultural inputs such as fertilizer (urea) also went up, which may explain at least partly the price increase in coca leaf. Some farmers produce coca paste, called locally pasta b\u00e1sica de coca\u00edna lavada. Farm-gate prices of coca paste increased by 21% in 2008 and reached US$ 723/kg. Higher prices for precursor chemicals were observed in coca cultivating regions, which may have contributed to the increase. Production costs and price mechanisms for illicit trading and trafficking of coca derivatives are not well understood and are thought to be influenced by the presence of armed groups in coca cultivating regions. However, the proportional price increase in 2008 was smaller the more refined the product, that is largest at the level of the coca leaf (36%) and smallest at the level of cocaine HCl (10%), which may indicate that local factors played a more important role than external ones.Peru, potential cocaine production (mt), 1994 to 2008 Sources: US Dept. of State (1994-1999), National monitoring system supported by UNODC (since 2000) based on conversion rates for coca leaf to cocaine from US Dept. of State.

The definition applied by the Tenth UN-CTS for 'drug-related crime' is 'intentional acts that involve the cultivation, production, manufacture, extraction, preparation, offering for sale, distribution, purchase, sale, delivery on any terms whatsoever, brokerage, dispatch, dispatch in transit, transport, importation, exportation and possession of internationally controlled drugs. Where applicable, reference may be made to the provisions of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and other regulations adopted in pursuance of the provisions of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 and/or the Convention against Illicit T raffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988'.

Justice Systems (UN-CTS) as 'drug-related crime'. The definition applied by the Tenth UN-CTS for 'drug-related crime' is 'intentional acts that involve the cultivation, production, manufacture, extraction, preparation, offering for sale, distribution, pur-chase, sale, delivery on any terms whatsoever, brokerage, dispatch, dispatch in transit, transport, importation, exportation and possession of internationally controlled drugs. Where applicable, reference may be made to the provisions of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and other regulations adopted in pursuance of the provisions of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 and/or the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988'.

METHODOLOGY4.0 Methodology 293Considerable efforts have been made over the last few years to improve the estimates presented in this report. Nonetheless, challenges remain in making such esti-mates because of the gaps and variable quality of the data available. A major problem relates to the irregularity and incom- pleteness in reporting by Member States. First, the irregular intervals at which some Governments report may result in absence of data in some years. The lack of regular data, for which UNODC tries to compensate by referring to other sources, can influence the reported trend in a given year. Second, submitted questionnaires are not always complete or sufficiently comprehensive. Third, as will become clear in this section, many of the data collected are themselves subject to limitations and biases. These issues affect the quantity, quality and com-parability of information received. Attempts have been made to provide information about the accuracy of the data throughout this Report. This section presents detailed information on the data sources and methods used to make the estimates featured throughout the Report. This information can be used to inform the reader's understanding of the quality of the data presented. Sources of information Under the international drug control conventions, Member States are formally required to provide drug-re-lated information annually, as detailed by the Commis-sion on Narcotic Drugs, to the 'Secretary-General of the United Nations' (that is, the Secretariat of UNODC). The Commission on Narcotic Drugs developed the Annual Reports Questionnaire (ARQ) to collect these data. The 2009 World Drug Report is based primarily on data obtained from the ARQs returned by Governments to UNODC over the June 2008 to May 2009 period. Where no ARQ was submitted in this year, data from the previous ARQ submission were used. The data col-lected during this period (2008-2009) normally refer to the drug situation in 2007. UNODC sent out the questionnaire to 192 countries, where some were also forwarded on to autonomous ter-ritories. UNODC received 118 replies to its question-naire on Drug Use Demand (Part II) and 116 replies to its questionnaire on Illicit Supply of Drugs (Part III). a The best coverage was from countries in Europe (84% of all countries in Europe returned Part II and 87% Part III of the ARQ), followed Asia (76% both Demand and Supply), and the Americas (60% of the countries pro-viding the Demand, and 57% the Supply ARQ). In the case of Africa, only a third of countries replied to the Supply ARQ and 38% to the Demand ARQ. In the Oceania region, two countries supplied information, equivalent to 14% of the countries in the region. Member States' responses to the ARQs are shown on the subsequent maps. Typically, the ability of Member States to provide infor- mation on illicit drug supply is significantly better than their ability to provide demand-related information. However, as noted above, two more Member States responded to the Demand ARQ than the Supply ARQ. Both the Demand and Supply ARQ's have sets of \"key\" questions (see below). ARQs where more than 50% of these key questions were completed are defined as having been 'substantially filled in'; the rest were classified as having been 'partially filled in'. This term reflects whether countries provided some replies to the \"key\" questions, but that not all of the data were provided, since in many cases Member States do not have the information. The analysis of the 'Supply ARQs' submitted this year revealed that 84% of them were 'substantially' com-pleted compared to just 59% of the 'Demand ARQs'. In order to identify the extent to which Member States are able to provided at least some information, a number of key questions in the ARQs were identified b: For the 'Supply ARQs (Part III)', this included replies s to the questions on 'drug seizures', i.e. on the quanti- ties seiz ed (replied by 95% of the countries returning the ARQ), the number of seizure cases (70%), 'track-ing' (origin of drugs 'drug related arrests' and/or 'convic-tions' (92%). a From 115 and 113 Member States, respectively with additional responses from their territories. b Each key question includes several subsections, typically by drug group (i.e. cannabis, cocaine, opiates, etc.). If Member States provide any quantifiable data in any part of key question's subsection, the key question is classified as \"filled-in.\" There is no assessment of the accuracy of completeness of the data or information provided.294World Drug Report 2009 For the Demand ARQs (Part II), the key questions s used for the analysis referred to 'trends in drug use' and 'ranking of dr ugs in terms of their prevalence among the general population' (replied by 91% of the Mem-ber States); (59%) and treatment' (74%)). Information provided by Member States in ARQs form the basis for the estimates and trend analysis provided in the World Drug Report. Often, this information and data are not sufficient to provide an accurate or compre-hensive picture of the world's drug situation. When necessary and where available, the data from the ARQs are thus supplemented with data from other sources. As in previous years, seizure data made available to UNODC via the ARQs was complemented primarily with data and reports from international organizations such as INTERPOL, the World Customs Organization (WCO), EUROPOL, the Organization of American States (OAC)/ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD), and data provided to UNODC by the Heads of National Law Enforcement Agencies (HONLEA) at their regional meetings, data provided through UNODC's 'Data for Africa' project, and UNODC's 'Drug Use Information Network for Asia and the Pacific' (DAINAP). In addition, Government reports and on-line electronic resources are used if they are located. Other sources considered included data pub-lished by the United States Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs in its International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR). Price data for Europe was complemented with data from Europol. Precursor data presented are basically those collected by the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB). Demand-related information was obtained through a number of additional channels, including UNODC's Global Assessment Programme (GAP), the drug control agencies participating in UNODC's DAINAP network, as well as various national and regional epidemiological networks such as the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and the Inter-American Drug Use Control Commission (CICAD). National government reports and scientific literature were also used as sources of information. This type of supplementary information is useful and needed as long as Member States lack the monitoring systems necessary to produce reliable, com-prehensive and internationally comparable data.To this end, UNODC encourages and supports the improvement of national monitoring systems. Major progress has been made over the last few years in some of the main drug producing countries. In close coopera-tion with UNODC's Illicit Crop Monitoring Pro-gramme (ICMP) and with the support of major donors these countries have developed monitoring systems designed to identify extent of and trends in the cultiva-tion of narcotic plants. These data form another basis for the trend analysis presented in the World Drug Report. There remain significant data limitations on the demand side. Despite commendable progress made in a number of Member States, in the area of prevalence estimates, for example, far more remains to be done to provide a truly reliable basis for trend and policy analysis and needs assessments. The work being done for the 2009 World Drug Report provides yet another opportunity to emphasise the global need for improving data collection and monitoring to improve the evidence base for effec-tive policy. 296World Drug Report 2009 Supply side data Drug cultivation, production and manufacture In line with decisions of the Member States (1998 UNGASS and subsequent Commission on N arcotic Drugs resolutions), UNODC launched an Illicit Crop Monitoring Programme (ICMP) in 1999. The objective of the programme is to assist Member States in establish-ing national systems to monitor the extent and evolu-tion of the illicit cultivation of narcotics crops on their territories. The results are compiled by UNODC to present global estimates on an annual basis. Data on cultivation of opium poppy and coca bush and produc- tion of opium and coca leaf, presented in this report for the main producing countries (Afghanistan, Myanmar and Lao PDR for opium and Colombia, Peru and Bolivia for coca) have been derived from these national monitoring systems operating in the countries of illicit production, covering the period up to, and including 2008. The Government of Morocco, in cooperation with UNODC, also conducted surveys on illicit can-nabis cultivation and cannabis resin production in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Estimates for other countries presented in this report have been drawn from replies to UNODC's Annual Reports Questionnaire, from various other sources including reports from Governments, UNODC field offices and the United States Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforce-ment Affairs. Area under cultivation Heroin, cocaine and cannabis (herb and resin) are so-called plant-based drugs. A first step towards estimating their global production is to estimate the area cultivated with opium poppy, coca bush and cannabis. Three dif- ferent methods of illicit area monitoring are used by UNODC supported national monitoring systems: Area estimation from satellite imagery s Area estimation from helicopter survey s Area estimation from village survey s In the coca cultivating countries Bolivia, Colombia and Peru, the area under coca bush is identified on satellite images, which cover the whole area where coca cultivation is thought to take place. In Bolivia, aerial photography is occasionally used as well. The UNODC supported cannabis survey in Morocco used a similar approach. In Myanmar, areas with a high density of opium poppy are covered with a sample of satellite images. The final area estimate is derived by extrapolation. In low density areas, the area estimate is derived from the village survey (sample survey), which is conducted in all poppy grow-ing areas. In Lao PDR, the survey is conducted by heli-copter over sample sites. Digital photographs of all opium poppy fields falling into these sites are taken, geo-referenced and analysed in a geographic information system. The area estimate is derived by extrapolation. In Afghanistan, similar to the method used in Myanmar, satellite imagery over sample sites are analysed and the area measured is extrapolated. In addition, a nationally representative survey of villages is conducted in order to collect information on the socioeconomic status of farm-ers, including areas with high, low and zero levels of poppy cultivation. In regions with a low level of poppy cultivation, which are not covered by imagery, the area estimate is derived from the village survey. In some countries, the methods used have changed over the years as new technologies became available and to adapt to the dynamics of illicit cultivation. Only the methods used in the most recent year reported are described here briefly. A full technical description of the methods used in all years can be found in the respective national survey reports available at http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/crop-monitoring/index.html . Yieldc As a second step in the production estimation chain, the number of harvests per year and the total yield of pri-mary plant material has to be established. The UNODC-supported national surveys use measure yield in the field and interviews with farmers, using results from both to produce the final data on yield. For cannabis, the yield of cannabis plant material per hectare can be established by directly harvesting the plant material. Opium yield surveys are more complex. Harvesting opium with the traditional lancing method can take up to 2 weeks as the opium latex that oozes out of the poppy capsule has to dry before harvesters can scrap it of and several lancings take place until the plant has dried. To avoid this lengthy process, yield surveyors measure the number of poppy capsules and their size in sample plots. Using a formula developed by scientists based on research experiments, the measured poppy capsule volume indicate how much opium gum each plant potentially yields. Thus, the per hectare opium yield can be estimated. Different formulas were devel-oped for Southeast and Southwest Asia. In Afghanistan and Myanmar, yield surveys are carried out annually. Coca bush, a perennial plant cultivated in tropical cli- mate, allows several harvest per year. The number of harvests varies, as does the yield per harvest. In Bolivia and Peru, the UNODC supports monitoring systems that conduct coca leaf yield surveys in several regions, by c Further information on the methodology of opium and cannabis leaf yield surveys conducted by UNODC can be found in United Nations (2001): Guidelines for Yield Assessment of Opium Gum and Coca Leaf from Brief Field Visits. New York. (ST/NAR/33).297Methodology harvesting sample plots of coca fields over the course of a year, in the rhythm indicated by the coca farmer. In Colombia, where the security situation did not allow for surveyors to return to the sample fields, only one harvest was measured, and the other harvests were estimated based on information from the farmer. In all three coca countries, yield surveys are carried out only occasionally, due to the difficult security situation in many coca regions, and because of funding constraints. Conversion factors The primary plant material harvested - opium in the form of gum or latex from opium poppy, coca leaves from coca bush, and the cannabis plant - undergo a sequence of extraction and transformation processes, some of which are done by farmers onsite, others by traffickers in clandestine laboratories. Some of these processes are complex, involve chemical precursors and may be done be different people in different places under a variety of conditions, which are not always known. In the case of opium gum, e.g., traffickers extract the morphine contained in the gum in one process, and transform the morphine into heroin base in a second process, and finally produce heroin hydrochloride. In the case of cocaine, coca paste is produced from either sun-dried (in Bolivia and Peru) or fresh coca leaves (in Colombia), which is later transformed into cocaine base, from where cocaine hydrochloride is produced. The results of each step, e.g. from coca leaf to coca paste, can be estimated with a conversion factor. Such conver-sion factors are based on interviews with the people who are involved in the process, e.g. farmers in Colombia, who reported how much coca leaf they needed to pro-duce 1 kg of coca paste or cocaine base. Tests have also been conducted, where so-called 'cooks' or 'chemists' demonstrate how they do the processing under local conditions. A number of studies conducted by enforce-ment agencies in the main drug producing countries have provided the orders of magnitude for the transfor-mation from the raw material to the end product. The problem is that this information is usually based on just a few case studies which are not necessarily representa-tive of the entire production process. Farmer interviews are not always possible due to the sensitivity of the topic, especially if the processing is done by specialists and not by the farmers themselves. Establishing conversion ratios is complicated by the fact that traffickers may not know the quality of the substances they use, which may vary considerably, they may use a range of substances for the same purpose depending on their availability and costs, and the conditions under which the processing takes place (temperature, humidity, etc.) differ. It is important to take into account that the margins of error of these conversion ratios - used to calculate the potential cocaine production from coca leaf or the heroin production from opium - are not known. In order to be precise, these calculations would require detailed infor-mation on the morphine content of opium or the cocaine content of the coca leaf, as well as detailed infor-mation on the efficiency of clandestine laboratories. This information is very limited. This also applies to the question of the psychoactive content of the narcotic plants. One study conducted in Afghanistan by UNODC over two years indicated, for instance, that the morphine content of Afghan opium was significantly higher than had been thought earlier. Based on this study, and in combination with information on the price structure d, it became clear that the conversion ratio that had been used (10:1) had to be changed. In 2005, therefore, the transformation ratio was estimated at 7:1, following additional information obtained from interviews with morphine/heroin producers in Afghanistan. Many cannabis farmers also conduct the first processing steps, either by removing the upper leaves and flowers of the plant to produce cannabis herb or by threshing and sieving the plant material to extract the cannabis resin. The herb and resin yield per hectare can be obtained by multiplying the plant material yield with an extraction factor. In Morocco, this factor was established by using information from farmers on the methods used and on results from scientific laboratories e. Information on the yield was obtained from interviews with cannabis farm- ers. Greater details on the methodology to estimate global cannabis herb and resin production are provided in the Cannabis Production section of this Report. 'Potential' heroin or cocaine production shows the level of production of heroin or cocaine if all of the cultivated opium or coca leaf were transformed into the end products in the respective producer country. Part of the opium or the coca leaf is directly consumed in the pro- ducing countries or in neighbouring countries, prior to the transformation into heroin or cocaine. In addition, significant quantities of the intermediate products, coca paste or morphine, are also consumed in the producing countries. These factors are partly taken into account: for example, consumption of coca leaf considered licit in Bolivia and Peru is not taken into account for the trans-formation into cocaine. Potential production is a hypo-thetical concept to be used at the global level and not as an indication of heroin or cocaine production at the country level f. The overall accuracy of the global heroin d Prices suggested that, using a 10:1 conversion ratio of opium to heroin, laboratory owners would have been losing money. e For greater detail on studies with cannabis farmers, see: UNODC (2007). Enqu\u00eate sur le cannabis au Maroc 2005 . Vienna: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. f The calculation of 'potential' cocaine production estimates for Peru, for instance, probably exceeds actual local cocaine production as some of the coca paste or cocaine base produced in Peru is thought to be exported to neighbouring Colombia and other countries for further processing into cocaine.298World Drug Report 2009 and cocaine estimates has certainly improved over the last few years and can used with a good level of confi-dence. ATS manufacture estimates The approach taken to estimate ATS manufacture changed significantly in this year's Report. Since 2003, UNODC triangulated three estimates: 1) estimates based upon ATS consumption; 2) estimates based upon ATS drug seizures, and 3) estimates based on seized precursor chemicals likely used in the illicit manufacture of ATS. g There have been significant changes, however, in both ATS use and manufacture, which severely limit the usefulness of this approach. h In this Report, UNODC therefore presented a model based only on estimated consumption, to produce a range of ATS manufacture. This approach utilizes the estimated range of annual global users, and multiplies this by the average amount of pure ATS believed to be consumed (i.e. among both casual and problem users) for each drug type. The average user of amphetamines-group substance was estimated to consume 12 grams of pure meth/amphetamine per year (range 1.6 - 34.4); and the average 'ecstasy' user was estimated to consume 5 grams of pure MDMA per year (0.8 - 13.6). The amount of seized drugs for each group are added to the total quantity of ATS and ecstasy estimated to be con-sumed globally. Totals are derived to estimate the lower and upper range of likely manufacture for ampheta-mines-group and ecstasy-group substances. There are a range of issues with this approach related to the quality of the data on the level and amount of con- sumption of ATS and ecstasy by users, and uncertainty around the applicability of data on consumption pat- terns from studies of ATS and ecstasy users in a limited number of countries to all such users in all countries. Further, estimates using a similar consumption-based approach for cannabis produced estimates with a much lower range compared to other methods of estimating cannabis production. Considerable caution should therefore be taken when considering the estimates pro-duced by this method. UNODC is reviewing this approach to estimating ATS manufacture, and is in discussions with experts in the field to develop a more sophisticated approach to deter-mining global levels of ATS manufacture. g See Ecstasy and Amphetamines, Global Survey 2003 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.03.XI.15). h See Amphetamines and Ecstasy: 2008 Global ATS Assessment (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.08.XI.12).Drug trafficking The information on drug trafficking, as presented in this r eport, is mainly drawn from the Annual Reports Ques- tionnaires (ARQ). Additional sources, such as other Government reports, INTERPOL, the World Customs Organization (WCO), reports by the Heads of National Law Enforcement Agency (HONLEA), data provided via UNODC's 'Data for Africa' project, data provided via UNODC's, 'Drug Use Information Network for Asia and the Pacific' (DAINAP), and UNODC's field offices, were used to supplement the information. Prior-ity was given to officially transmitted data in the Annual Reports Questionnaire. The analysis of quantities seized, shown in this report, was provided from 107 ARQ's over the June 2008-May 2009 period. Including informa-tion from other sources, UNODC was able to obtain seizure data from 143 countries for 2007. Seizures are thus the most comprehensive indicator of the drug situ-ation and its evolution at the global level. Although seizures may not always reflect trafficking trends cor-rectly at the national level, they tend to show reasonable representations of trafficking trends at the regional and global levels. There are some technical problems as - depending on the drugs - some countries report seizures in weight terms (kilogram - kg), in volume terms (litres - l) while other countries report seizures in 'unit terms'. In the online inter-active seizure report ( www.unodc.org ), sei- zures are shown as reported. In the World Drug Report, seizure data have been aggregated and transformed into a unique measurement: seizures in 'kilogram equiva-lents'. For the purposes of the calculations a 'typical consumption unit' (at street purity) was assumed g, cannabis resin: g; LSD: 0.00005 g (50 micrograms). A litre of seizures was assumed to be equivalent to one kilogram. For opiate seizures (unless specified differently in the text), it was assumed that 10 kg of opium were equivalent to 1 kg of morphine or heroin. Though all of these transformation ratios can be disputed, they provide a means of combin-ing all the different seizure reports into one comprehen-sive measure. The transformation ratios have been derived from those normally used by law enforcement agencies, in the scientific literature and by the Interna-tional Narcotics Control Board, and were established in consultation with UNODC's Laboratory and Scientific Section. No changes in the transformation ratios used in last year's World Drug Report were made. Seizures are used as an indicator for trends and patterns in trafficking. In combination with changes in drug prices or drug purities, changes in seizures can indicate whether trafficking has increased or declined. Increase in seizures in combination with stable or falling drug prices is a strong indication of rising trafficking activities. 299Methodology Increasing seizures and rising drug prices, in contrast, may be a reflection of improved enforcement effective-ness. Changes in trafficking can also serve as an indirect indicator for global production and use of drugs. Sei-zures are, of course, only an indirect indicator for traf-ficking activities, influenced by a number of additional factors, such as variations in law enforcement practices and changes in reporting modalities. Seizures can also sometimes be double counted when more than one organization is involved. Overall seizures have proven to be a good indicator to reveal underlying trafficking trends if analyzed over long periods of time and across large geographical entities. While seizures at the national level may be influenced by large quantities of drugs in transit or by shifts in law enforcement priorities, it is not very likely that the same is true at the regional or at the global level. If a large drug shipment, while in transit, is taken out of the market in one country, fewer drugs will be probably seized in the neighbouring countries. Similarly, if enforcement efforts and seizures decline in one country, the neighbouring countries are likely to suffer from intensified trafficking activities, resulting in rising levels of seizures. The impact of changes in enforcement pri-orities of an individual country are, in general, not sig-nificant at the regional or global level. Drug price and purity data UNODC also collects and publishes price and purity data. These data, if properly collected, can be very pow- erful indicators of market trends. T rends in supply can change over a shorter period of time when compared with changes in demand and shifts in prices and purities are good indicators for increases or declines of market supply. Research has shown that short-term changes in the consumer markets are first reflected in purity changes while prices tend to be rather stable over longer periods of time. UNODC collects its price data from the Annual Reports Questionnaire, and supplements this data with other sources, such as price data collected by Europol and other organisations. Prices are collected at farm-gate level, wholesale level ('kilogram prices') and at retail level ('gram prices'). Countries are asked to provide mini-mum, maximum and typical prices and purities. When countries do not provide typical prices/purities, UNODC calculates the mid-point of these estimates as a proxy for the 'typical' prices/purities (unless scientific studies are available which provide better estimates). What is not known, in general, is how data were col-lected and how reliable it is. Although improvements have been made in some coun- tries over the last few years, a number of law enforce-ment bodies in several countries have not yet established a regular system for collecting purity and price data. Data on drug consumption Overview UNODC estimates of the extent of illicit drug use in the world hav e been published periodically since 1997. The latest estimates, presented in this report, are based on information received until April 2009. Assessing the extent of drug use (the number of drug users) is a particularly difficult undertaking because it involves measuring the size of a 'hidden' population. Margins of error are considerable, and tend to multiply as the scale of estimation is raised, from local to national, regional and global levels. Despite some improvements in recent years, estimates provided by Member States to UNODC are still very heterogeneous in terms of quality and reliability. These estimates cannot simply be aggre-gated globally to arrive at an \"exact\" number of drug users in the world. In this year's World Drug Report, the new country data presented (not reported in previous World Drug Reports) are expressed in ranges where point estimates could not be produced given the level of uncer-tainty. Regional and global estimates are also reported as ranges reflecting the lack of information in some coun-tries. It can be noted that the level of confidence expressed in the estimates vary across regions and across drugs. This approach marks a departure from the approaches used in all previous World Drug Reports. Comparisons are therefore not valid for this year's global and regional estimates with those made in previous years. A global estimate of the level of use of specific drugs involved the following steps: Identication and analysis of appropriate sources; 1. Identication of key benchmark gures for the level of 2. drug use in all countries where data are available (an- nual pr evalence of drug use among the general popula- tion aged 15-64) which then serve as 'anchor points' for subsequent calculations; 'Standardisation' of existing data if reported with a dif-3. ferent reference population than the one used for the R eport (for example, from age group 12 and above to a standard age group of 15-64) ; Adjustments of national indicators to annual prevalence 4. rate if annual prevalence is not available (for example, lifetime pr evalence or current use to annual prevalence or school survey results to annual prevalence among the general population). This included the identica-tion of adjustment factors based on information from neighbouring countries with similar cultural, social and economic situations; Imputation for countries where data is not avail-5. able based on data from countries in the same region.

Country-level estimates of the number of people who have used drugs at least once in the past year Estimates of illicit drug consumption for a large number of countries hav e been received by UNODC over the years (in the form of Annual Reports Questionnaires (ARQ) submitted by Governments), and have been identified from additional sources, such as other govern-mental reports and research results from scientific litera-ture. Officially transmitted information in any specific year, however, would not suffice to establish global esti-mates. Over the period June 2008 to May 2009, for instance, 115 countries provided UNODC with responses to the ARQ on Drug Use (Part II), but less than half of them (42 countries) provided new quantita-tive estimates and most of these estimates did not refer to 2007 but to some previous year. For countries that did not submit information, or in cases where the data were older than 10 years, other sources were identified, where available. In addition, a number of estimates needed to be 'adjusted' (see below). Since 1998, with the inclusion of estimates referring to previous years, UNODC has collected quantitative estimates of drug use among the general population for 128 countries and territories and 99 for student/youth populations. In cases of estimates referring to previous years, the preva-lence rates were left unchanged and applied to new population estimates for the year 2007. Results from these countries were extrapolated to the sub-regional level and then aggregated into the global estimate Detailed information is available from countries in North America, a large number of countries in Europe, a number of countries in South America, the two main countries in the Oceania region and a limited number of countries in Asia and in Africa. For other countries, available qualitative information on the drug use situa-tion only allows for some 'guess estimates'. One key problem in national data reported is still the level of accuracy, which varies strongly from country to country. While a number of estimates are based on sound epidemiological surveys, some are the result of guesswork. In other cases, the estimates simply reflect the aggregate number of drug users found in drug regis-tries which probably cover only a small fraction of the total drug using population in a country. Even in cases where detailed information is available, there is often considerable divergence in definitions used - registry data (people in contact with the treatment system or the judicial system) versus survey data (usually extrapolation of results obtained through interviews of a selected sample); general population versus specific sur-veys of groups in terms of age (such as school surveys), special settings (such as hospitals or prisons), lifetime, annual or monthly prevalence, et cetera. In order to reduce the error from simply aggregating such diverse estimates, an attempt was made to standardize - as a far as possible - the very heterogeneous data set. Thus, all available estimates were transformed into one single indicator - annual prevalence among the general population aged 15 to 64 - using transformation ratios derived from analysis of the situation in neighbouring countries, and if such data were not available, on estimates from the USA, the most studied country world-wide with regard to drug use. The basic assumption is that the level of drug use differs between countries, but that there are general patterns (for example, lifetime prevalence is higher than annual prevalence; young people consume more drugs than older people) which apply to most countries. It is also assumed that the ratio between lifetime prevalence and annual prevalence among the general population or between lifetime prevalence among young people and annual prevalence among the general population, do not vary too much among countries with similar social, cultural and economic situation. Various calculations of long-term data from a number of countries seem to confirm these assumptions. Indicators used The most widely used indicator at the global level is the annual prevalence rate: the number of people who have consumed an illicit drug at least once in the last twelve months prior to the study. As \"annual prevalence\" is the most commonly used indicator to measure prevalence, it has been adopted by UNODC as a key indicator to measure the extent of drug use. It is also part of the Lisbon Consensus i on core epidemiological demand i The basic indicators to monitor drug use, agreed by all participating organizations that formed part of the Lisbon Consensus in 2000, and endorsed by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, are: - Drug consumption among the general population (estimates of prevalence and incidence); - Drug consumption among the youth population (estimates of prevalence and incidence); - High-risk drug use (estimates of the number of injecting drug users and the proportion engaged in high-risk behaviour, estimates of the number of daily drug users); - Utilization of services for drug problems (number of individuals seeking help for drug problems); - Drug-related morbidity (prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus among illicit drug consumers); - Drug-related mortality (deaths directly attributable to drug consumption). While in the analysis of the drug use situation and drug use trends all these indicators were considered, when it came to provide a global comparison a choice was made to rely on the one key indicator that is most available and provides an idea of the magnitude for the drug use situation: annual prevalence among the population aged 15 to 64.301Methodology indicators (CN.7/2000/CRP .3). The use of \"annual prevalence\" is a compromise between \"lifetime prevalence\" data (drug use at least once in a lifetime) and data on current use (drug use at least once over the last month). Lifetime prevalence data are often collected, but they are less useful in providing informa-tion about recent trends in the levels of drug use across countries. Data on current use could provide informa-tion to study even more recent trends. However, they often require larger samples in order to obtain meaning-ful results, and are thus more costly to generate, notably if it comes to drugs other than cannabis which is wide-spread. The \"annual prevalence\" rate is usually shown as a per- centage of the youth and adult population. The defini-tions of the age groups vary, however, from country to country. Given a highly skewed distribution of drug use among the different age cohorts in most countries (youth and young adults tend to have substantially higher prev-alence rates than older adults or retired persons), differ-ences in the age groups can lead to substantially diverging results. Typical age groups used by UNODC 15-64. The revised version of the Annual Reports Questionnaire (ARQ) stipulates the age group 15-64 as the key population group to be measured. Where the age groups reported by Member States did not differ significantly from this age group, they were presented as reported and the age group specified. Where studies were based on signifi- cantly different age groups, results were adjusted to the age group of 15-64. The methods used for collecting data on illicit drug use vary from country to country. This reduces comparabil-ity. The options for post adjustment to reduce these differences are limited. UNODC thus welcomes efforts at the regional level to arrive at more comparable data (as is currently the case in Europe under the auspices of EMCDDA and in the Americas under the auspices of CICAD). Diverging results have also been obtained for the same country by applying differing methodological approaches. In such cases, the sources were analysed in-depth and priority was given to the most recent data and to the methodological approaches that are considered to pro-duce the best results. For example, it is generally accepted that household surveys are reasonably good approaches to estimating cannabis, ATS or cocaine use among the general population, at least in countries where there are no adverse consequences for admitting illicit drug use. Thus, household survey results were usually given prior-ity over other sources of prevalence estimates, such as reported registry data from the police or from treatment providers. However, when it comes to heroin use (or drug inject-ing), annual prevalence data derived from national household surveys tend to grossly under-estimate such use j, because heroin users often do not live in \"typical\" households (and may be homeless, in hospitals or in prisons); heroin use is often highly stigmatised so that the willingness to openly report heroin use may be lower; and users are often geographically concentrated in cer-tain areas. A number of \"indirect\" methods have been developed to provide estimates for this group of drug users. They include various multiplier methods (such as treatment multipliers, police data multipliers, HIV/AIDS multipliers or mortality multipliers), capture-re-capture methods and multivariate indicators. In coun-tries where evidence existed that the primary \"problem drug\" in those countries was opiates, and an indirect estimate existed for \"problem drug use\" or injecting drug use (largely Western European countries), this was used in preference to household survey estimates of heroin use. For other drug types, priority was given to annual prev- alence data found by means of household surveys. A number of countries, however, did not report annual prevalence data, but lifetime or current use of drug con-sumption, or they provided annual prevalence data but for a different age group. In order to arrive at basically comparable results, it was thus necessary to extrapolate from reported current use or lifetime prevalence data to annual prevalence rates and/or to adjust results for dif-ferences in age groups. j The problem of under-estimation is more widespread for heroin, but does also exist for other drugs such as cocaine or methampheta- mine. 302World Drug Report 2009 Extrapolation methods used The methods used for these adjustments and extrapola- tions are best explained by providing a number of con- crete examples: Adjustment for differences in age groups The approach to age adjustments is highlighted using an example from New Zealand. New Zealand carried out a household survey in 2006, covering the population aged 15-45. According to this survey, annual prevalence of ecstasy use was found to affect 3.4% of the population aged 15-45, equivalent to about 71,200 people. Given the strong association between ecstasy use and younger age groups it can be assumed that there is little ecstasy use in the 45+ age group. Thus, dividing the ecstasy using population established above by the population size 15-64 (2.764 million) gives an estimated prevalence rate of 2.6%. The situation is slightly more complex when it comes to cannabis. New Zealand reported a cannabis prevalence rate of 17.9% among the population aged 15-45; it is more likely that use would continue past the age of 45 years, based on studies of cannabis users in other coun-tries. An estimate of cannabis use among those aged 15-64 years was therefore derived from an extrapolation from the age structure of cannabis users found in Aus-tralia, which was then applied to existing data for New Indirect methods of estimating heroin use T reatment multiplier: If a survey among heroin users reveals, for instance, that one quarter of them were in treatment in the last year, the multiplication of the total treatment population with a multiplier of four provides an estimate of the likely total number of problem heroin users in a country. Police data multiplier: Similarly, if a survey among heroin users reveals that one out of five was arrested in the previ- ous year, a multiplication of the persons arrested for heroin possession by the multiplier (five) provides another estimate for the number of heroin users. Establishing various multipliers and applying them to the registered drug using population provides a range of likely estimates of the heroin use population in a country. Either the mid-point of the range, the median or the mean of these estimates can be subsequently used to arrive at a national estimate. Capture-recapture models are another method based on probability considerations. a If in one register (for example, an arrest register) 5000 persons are found (for possession of heroin) and in a second register (such as a treatment register) 2000 persons are found (for treatment of heroin use), and 400 persons appear in both registers, the total population of heroin dependent users can be estimated through the following calculations. It can be assumed that 20% (400/2000) of heroin-dependent users have been arrested, so that the total heroin-using population could be around 25,000 (5000/20%). b Results can usually be improved if data from more than two registers are analysed (such as data from an arrest register, treatment register, ambulance register, mortality register, substitution treatment register, HIV register, et cetera). More sophisticated capture-recapture models exist, and are used by some countries to make calculations based on more than two registries. Another approach is the use of multivariate indicators. For this approach, a number of local/regional studies are conducted, using various multiplier and/or capture-recapture methods. Such local studies are usually far cheaper than comprehensive national studies. They serve as anchor points for the subsequent estimation procedures. The subsequent assumption is that drug use at the local level correlates with other data that are readily available. For instance, heroin arrest data, heroin treatment data, IDU-related HIV data, etc. are likely to be higher in communi-ties where heroin use is high and lower in communities where heroin use is low. In addition, heroin use may cor-relate with some readily available social indicators (higher levels in deprived areas than in affluent areas; higher levels in urban than in rural areas et cetera). Taking all of this additional information into account, results from the local studies are then extrapolated to the national level. a Such methods were originally developed to estimate the size of animal population. If, for instance, 200 fish are caught (' ca pture'), marked, and released back into the lake, and then the next day 100 fish are caught, of which 10 were already marked ('re-captured'), pr obability considerations suggest that the number of fish captured the first day were a 10% sample of the total population. Thus the total population of the lake can be estimated at around 2000 fish. b The advantage of this method is that no additional field research is necessary. There are, however, problems as the two ' sam pling processes' for the registries in practice are not independent from each other so that some of the underlying assumptions of the model may be violated (e.g. the ratio could be higher as some of the people arrested are likely to be transferred to a treatment facility; thus the ratio does not cor- respond any longer to the true proportion of people arrested among the addicts population, and may lead to an under-estimation of the total heroin addict population).303Methodology Zealand. Based on the assumption that the age structure of cannabis users in New Zealand is similar to the one found in Australia the likely annual prevalence rate of cannabis use in New Zealand for the population aged 15-64 can be estimated at around 13.3%; this is the estimate reported in the Statistical Annex. Similar approaches were also used for the age-group adjustments of data from other countries. A number of countries reported prevalence rates for the age groups 15+ or 18+. In these cases it was generally assumed that there was no significant drug use above the age of 65. The number of drug users based on the popu-lation age 15+ (or age 18+) was thus simply shown as a proportion of the population age 15-64. Extrapolation of results from lifetime prevalence to annual prevalence Some countries have conducted surveys in recent years but did not ask the question whether drug consumption took place over the last year. In such cases, results were extrapolated to arrive at annual prevalence estimates. Let's assume for example that a country in Europe reported a life time cocaine use of 2% and an annual prevalence rate is estimated based on this life time data. Taking data for lifetime and annual prevalence of cocaine use in countries of Western Europe it can be shown that there is a strong positive correlation between the two measures (correlation coefficient R = 0.94); that is, the higher the lifetime prevalence, the higher is the annual prevalence and vice versa. Based on the resulting regres-sion curve (y = annual prevalence and x = lifetime prev-alence) it can be estimated that a West European country with a lifetime prevalence of 2% is likely to have an annual prevalence of around 0.7% (see figure). Almost the same result is obtained by calculating the ratio of the unweighted annual prevalence rates of the West Euro-pean countries and the unweighted lifetime prevalence rate (0.93/2.61 = 0.356) and multiplying this ratio with the lifetime prevalence of the country concerned (2% * 0.356 = 0.7%). A similar approach used was to calculate the overall ratio by averaging the annual/lifetime ratios, calculated for each country k. Multiplying the resulting average ratio (0.387) with the lifetime prevalence of the country con- cerned provides the estimate for the annual prevalence (0.387 * 2% = 0.8%). Given this close relationship between lifetime and annual prevalence (and an even stronger correlation between annual prevalence and monthly prevalence), extrapolations from lifetime or cur-rent use data to annual prevalence data was usually given preference to other kinds of possible extrapolations. k For each country the ratio between annual prevalence and lifetime prevalence is calculated. The results are than averaged: In our exam- ple: ( 0.64 + 0.32 + 0.43 + 0.14 + 0.32 + 0.38 + 0.35 + 0.32 + 0.75 + 0.31 + 0.32 + 0.33 + 0.46+ 0.34) : 14 = 0.387. Good quality results (showing only a small potential error) can only be expected from extrapolations done for a country in the same region. If instead of using the West European average (0.387), the ratio found in the USA was used (0.17), the estimate for a country with a lifetime prevalence of cocaine use of 2% would decline to 0.3% (2% * 0.17). Such an estimate is likely to be correct for a country with a drug history similar to the USA, which has had a cocaine problem for more than two decades which is different from Western Europe, where the cocaine problem is a phenomenon of the last decade. Data from countries in the same region with similar patter in drug use were used, wherever possible, for extrapolation purposes. Extrapolations based on treatment data For a number of developing countries, the only drug-related data available on the demand side was treatment demand. In such cases, the approach taken was to look for other countries in the region with a similar socio-economic structure, which reported annual prevalence data and treatment data. A ratio of people treated per 1000 drug users was calculated for each country. The results from different countries were then averaged and the resulting ratio was used to extrapolate the likely number of drug users from the number of people in treatment. Extrapolations based on school surveys Analysis of countries which have conducted both school surveys and national household surveys shows that there y = 0.3736x - 0.0455 R = 0.94 R2 = 0.880 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 life-time prevalence in % of population age 15-64annual prevalence in % of population age 15-64 Data points Regression curveAnnual and lifetime prevalence rates of cocaine use in Western Europe Sources: UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire Data / EMCDDA, Annual Report.304World Drug Report 2009 is, in general, a positive correlation between the two variables, particularly for cannabis, ATS and cocaine. The correlation, however, is weaker than that of lifetime and annual prevalence or current use and annual preva-lence among the general population. But it is stronger than the correlation between opiate use and IDU-related HIV cases, and between treatment and drug use. These extrapolations were conducted using the ratios between school surveys and household surveys of coun-tries in the same region or with similar social structure. T wo approaches were taken: a) the unweighted average of the ratios between school and household surveys in the comparison countries; and b) a regression-based extrapolation, using the relationships between estimates from the other countries to predict the estimate in the country concerned based upon the school survey estimate in that country. A range was generated by these two estimates. These were used as the low and high range of the estimates of the annual prevalence of drug use among those aged 15-64 years in that country. A note on ranges at the country level As is no doubt clear from the discussion above, in many instances there is uncertainty about the exact values for extrapolated or imputed data. Different approaches can be used within a study, or to make estimates of the prevalence of drug use across studies. In this year's World Drug Report, where a number of estimates existed, or a variety of approaches to making estimates could be used, ranges were reported at the country level. This was intended to reflect the variation that can occur even within a country when different approaches to estimat-ing the level of drug use are taken. Making regional and global estimates of the number of people who use drugs For this purpose the estimated prevalence rates of coun- tries w ere applied to the population aged 15-64, as provided by the United Nations Population Division for the year 2007. The methods of calculating regional and global numbers were changed in this year's report rela-tive to previous years. Due to the considerable uncertainty and in the spirit of reflecting data gaps, no \"absolute\" numbers are pro-vided, but rather, ranges have been produced. These reflect the uncertainty that exists when data are being either extrapolated or imputed. Ranges (not absolutes) are provided for estimated numbers and prevalence. Larger ranges will exist for those regions where there is less certainty about the likely level of drug use - in other words, those regions for which fewer direct estimates are available, for a comparatively smaller proportion of the region's population.The data being used to generate the estimates comprise only those estimates considered sufficiently robust and/or recent to be published at the country level in the 2009 World Drug Report's tables. Unpublished estimates are not de facto included in estimates of prevalence at the country, subregional or global level. Efforts were made to produce subregional and regional estimates. Such estimates were only made where direct estimates were published for at least two countries that comprise at least 20% of the subregion or region's popu-lation aged 15-64. Countries with one published esti-mate (typically those countries with a household survey, or an indirect prevalence estimate that did not report ranges) did not have uncertainty estimated. The same estimate was used for the lower and upper range. In estimating ranges for populations in countries with no published estimate, the 10th and 90th percentile in the range of direct estimates was used to produce a lower and upper estimate. This produces conservative (wide) intervals for regions where there is geographic variation and/or variance in existing country-level estimates; but it also reduces the likelihood that very skewed estimates will have a dramatic effect upon regional and global figures (since these would most likely fall outside the 10th and 90th percentile). World Drug Report estimates of the total number of people who used illicit drugs at least once in the past year The approach used in this year's R eport was the same as that of previous years, with the exception that ranges are now reported. T wo ranges were produced, and the lowest and highest estimate of each the approaches were taken to estimate the lower and upper ranges, respectively, of the total illicit drug using population. This estimate is obviously tentative given the limited number of coun-tries upon which the data informing the two approaches were based (see the list of countries below). The two approaches were as follows: Approach 1. The global estimates of number of people using each of the five drug groups in the past year were summed together. To adjust for the fact that people use more than one drug type and these five populations overlap, the total was then adjusted downward. The size of this adjustment was made based upon household surveys conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Brazil, Mexico and Germany, which all assessed all five drug types, and reported an estimate of total illicit drug use. Across all of these studies, the extent to which adding each population of users overestimated the total population was an average of 116%. The summed total was then therefore divided by 1.17.305Methodology Approach 2. This approach was based on the average proportion of the total drug using population that com- prises cannabis users. The average proportion was obtained from household surveys conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Brazil, Mexico and Germany, which all assessed all five drug types, and reported an estimate of total illicit drug use. Across all of these studies, the average proportion of total drug users that comprised cannabis users was 76%. The range of cannabis users at the global level was there-fore divided by 0.76. World Drug Report estimates of the number of \"problem drug users\" There is clear utility in making estimates of the number of dr ug users who are experiencing problems related to their use. It is this subgroup of drug users who are most likely to come to the attention of health and law enforce-ment, and who drug use has been estimated to cause the majority of the public health and public order burden. The number of problem drug users are typically esti- mated with the number of dependent drug users. Some- times an alternative approach is used, employing a definition of injecting or long duration use of opioids, amphetamines or cocaine, as the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) uses to guide country level indirect prevalence estimation studies l. Making such estimates is a challenging undertaking, even at the country level. These challenges become even more salient when attempting to make regional and global estimates of the size of this population, where there are additional issues of data gaps at country and subregional levels on dependent or injecting drug use. The most common approach is to use some kind of extrapolation techniques. In this Report, as in previous years, the following approach was taken. Each of the five range estimates for number of people using each of the five drug groups was l See http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/themes/key-indicators/pdu.converted into a \"heroin user equivalent\". This was cal- culated through the use of \"relative risk coefficients\" (see below) derived using the UNODC's Harm Index m. This allows for aggregating results from different drugs into one single reference drug (in this case, heroin). Using this coefficient, each of the five drug use estimates was converted into an estimate of the number of \"heroin user equivalents\". A lower range was calculated through summing each of the five lower range estimates; the upper end of the range was calculated by summing the upper range of the five estimates. To obtain an estimate of the number of \"problem drug users\", these totals were multiplied by the proportion of past year heroin users in the United States National Survey on Drug Use and Health (range 53-68% over the past six years of the NSDUH). Hence, The LOW esti-mate of \"problem drug users\" is the lower proportion (53%) multiplied by the lower estimated size of the heroin use equivalent population (34.1 million heroin user equivalents).The HIGH estimate of \"problem drug users\" is the higher proportion (68%) multiplied by the higher estimated size of the heroin use equivalent popu-lation (56.3 million heroin user equivalents). Concluding remarks It goes without saying that each method of extrapolating r esults from other countries has weaknesses. These esti- mates should still be interpreted with caution. The 2009 World Drug Report reflects the different uncertainty that exists in the data. UNODC made an attempt to reduce the risk of bias by extrapolating data using, as far as pos-sible, data from nearby countries in the region. The global estimates presented in this report reflect likely orders of magnitude, as opposed to precise statis-tics on the prevalence and evolution of global drug use. More precise ranges can be produced when a greater number of countries provide estimates based on rigorous scientific methods. m For considerable detail on the logic and data underlying this Harm Index, please consult the 2005 World Drug Report.Treatment index IDU index Toxicity index Deaths index\"Relative risk coefficient\"* Opiates 100 100 100 100 100 Cocaine 85.3 47.8 88 18.5 59.9 Amphetamines 20.1 59.5 32 6.8 29.6 Ecstasy 3.8 6.1 20.7 1 7.9 Cannabis 9 0 1.5 0.6 2.8 * Unweighted average across the four indices.\"Relative risk coefcient\"306World Drug Report 2009 Editorial and production team The 2009 World Drug Report was produced under the supervision of Sandeep Chawla, Director, Division of Policy Analysis and Public Affairs, by the Statistics and Surveys Section and the Studies and Threat Analysis Section.
