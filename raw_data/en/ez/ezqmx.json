What is Quantum Body Alignment? This is a body ceremony. These 1:1 sessions are designed to go deep within your bodies memory as well as your subconscious mind to release old patterns that are no longer serving your nervous system and brain. This is a mix of science and spirituality. Of chiropractic neuroscience and energetic healing. During the sessions she listens to the body and applies the least amount of force needed to create change in the system. MANUAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE NOT REQUIRED. She has a variety of tools to help those who also need soft low force techniques that do not require twisting or cracking and still create a neurological change within the body. The focus is the best point of access for the system in that moment to receive optimal healing. Space will be held to integrate and transmute any patterns or stagnant energy. To better understand the science of how it works: Your nervous system is the super conductor of your LIFE. It runs every organ and tissue in your whole body. When you adjust the spine it send electrochemical signals through the spinal cord to the brain. The messages that get sent from your spine signal the BRAIN to make reactive changes in its activity and FUNCTION. The brain's ability to make changes in response to the demands placed on it is referred to as nueroplasticity. As your brain responds and adapts to demands it reaches higher and more complex levels of function and adaptability. This can allow for better function of your entire body including your digestive system, respiratory system, immune system, and nervous system. How do these sessions also affect your quantum field and energy? During these sessions Dr. Danielle is also using somatic experiencing techniques to help release trauma and old patterns in order to start to allow the body and mind to reconnect and create new frequencies at which it resonates at. She also channels high energy so that your system is being put into a state of higher frequency at which higher levels of healing can occur. During the session one will be asked to be actively involved by using their breathe, visualIzation, and feeling into sensations into their body to empower more safety within their system and begin to consciously create the energy of the life they want to have. Some clients have had visions, sensations, or received messages of guidance from their higher power or loved ones on an energetic level. Some of the reasons why people work with Dr. Danielle are as follows: - Experienced any form of physical or emotional trauma/abuse (including sexual assault, major accidents, trauma at birth) - Chronic pain, illness, or inflammation (autoimmune disorders, digestion issues, reproductive issues, disabilities, chronic migraines, structural pain, etc.) - Anxiety, Depression, or Self -Harm - Struggled with disordered eating or exercise - Struggled with addiction of any form - Shame around emotions, inability to express them in a healthy manner, or work through them - Post-partum and pregnancy - Any sever of relationship to body These sessions are about learning to be in relationship with our body and to re-connect to self.
