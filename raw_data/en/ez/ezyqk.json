Populationsof maey countries expanded faster than food supplies in the postwar period. With improved zommunication, rural families were no longer satisfied with bare subsistence ingood years interspersed with periods of famine. They demanded of their governmentsassistance in obtaining economic and social equality with more fortunate segments of the populations.Newly formed nations, the rural population of which formerly maintained asubsistence agriculture with limited industry, found it essential to establish a better balanced economy. Increased and more efficient domestic food production was required tosupply the rapidly growing cities and to save or gain the foreign exchange necessary foreconomic development. And finally, the whole philosophy of government changed from one of exploitation of the masses of rural people to one of recognition of a responsibilityfor their welfare. These and many other factors led to the establishment of a variety of rural services and institutions, including agricultural extension services.The basic philosophy of agricultural extension as well as methods of operation havebeen established in the more highly developed countries over the past century. Muchinformation has been published on this subject. Although the basic principles ofextension education have gained acceptance throughout the world, their application ineffective programs must necessarily vary with the circumstance in each country and with the situation in each local community. The purpose of the Food and AgricultureOrganization in arranging for this publication is to draw together those basic principleswith worldvide application to the development of .gricultural extension services; to show how they may be applied under varying circumstances; and to explain somo techniquesand methods of organization and operation which have proved effective in a variety of economic, social and political situations. The author recognizes the dangers inherent in offering specific recommendations forthe organization and operation of agricultural extension services.Certain organizationalstructures, although sound and desirable, may not be feasible in a given country due to theexisting overall structure of government. It may not be possible to adopt a desirablestaffing pattern at this time because of shortage of trained personnel or lack of financial-support.Community organization for extension work or educational methods suggested maynot be compatible with tradition or the mores of the society.Therefore, the reader isurged to work out his own application of useful principles adapting the method to existingcircumstances. The primary audience to which this publication is directed is the professional,operating field extension worker and the supporting staff of technical specialistssupervisors and administrators responsible for the effective operation of extension work in each country. Secondly, personnel of departments of extension education may find it of value in the preservice training of future extension workers.And finally, it is hopedthat government officials who are responsible for national economic and social policy, willfind this book useful in obtaining a clearer understanding of the role of agriculturalextension in economic and social development. Their decisions on the allocation oflimited financial and human resources have a vital bearing upon the balanced developmentof rural institutielis, including agricultural extension. Although the basic principles included in this publication have evolved for the mostpart in the more advanced countries, the author has endeavoured, to the extent possible,to apply them to countries now in earlier stages of development of their extension services.Much of the material included has been prepared either by national or by technical assis-tance experts working in those countries and has proved to be affective in these situations. The author wishes to express appreciation tc a large number of people of broadexperience Who have contributed in a variety of ways to this publication. Credit is givenin each chapter to specific contributors. Many others have very kindly allowed shortquotations of their published materials or have offered invaluable suggestions. Finally,I should like to express my appreciation to the Rural Institutions Division (new retitledHuman Resources and Institutions Division) of the Food and Agriculture Organization forproviding the opportunity to prepare this publication. Chapter 1- 1 - Section IEXTTISION DEFINED THE MEANING OF EXTENSION2.sealsandor Terminolo in ApricUltural Extension JThe term 'extension education' was first introduced in 1873 by CambridgeUniversity to describe a particular educational innovation.This was to take the educationaladvantages of the universities to the ordinary people, where they lived and worked, The term 'extension' was first coined in England, not in America as often thought.Within a decade or so the movement had spread to other institutions in Britain, the United States, and elsewhere. It is of interest to find that the first grants to the extension movement from public funds, in this case from English county councils, were for extension lectures in agricultural science. As the movement was taken up, its programmes became adapted to meet the needs ofthe people, the place, and the time. In England, the first major change followed theformation of the Workers' Educational Association in 1903.The latter virtually took overthe university extension movement and adapted it to the now familiar W.E.A. tutorial-class type of extension education. The American extension movement started, on the same basis as in England, from theUniversities and large public libraries. The first Director of Extension within the UnitedStates (University of Chicago, 1892) was an Englishman named Moulton. He had been one of Cambridge University's original extension workers and in 1885 had documented the first ten years of the extension movementthe world's first real treatise in extension. But, as with several Other American adult education movements of the 19th century, popularenthusiasm waned almost as quickly as it had grown.There was some revival early in the next century, but it was largely by its agricultural and rural home programmes thatextension made its major impact in the United States. Agricultural extension, as we now know it, developed much later than the.other extension programmes. But its origins in agricultural education, advice, and demonstration are as old as agriculture itself. And the sources of information and ideas include many countries.The student of comparative extension finds that most of the apparentlyindigenous national programmes are syntheses of inter-national ideas adapted to meet the local situation. The Scottish Advisory Service is one of the oldest agricultural extension servicesin the world..It was established around the turn of this century virtually in its presentform as a cooperative county /agricultural college national programme.Concurrentagricultural education and advisory movements developed in England, continental Europe,and. elsewhere, including Australia. For example, as early as 1889 Queensland starteda successful dairy extension programme based on the use of two 'mobile dairy extension units' (trains).From this innovation and from its description as 'extension', it is apparentthat local thinking was at least abreast of the then professional development. 1 R.N. Farquhar, Agricultural Liaison Officer CSIRO - Australian AgriculturalExtension Conference 1962 - Reviews, Papersand Reports pp.114 - 117 - 2 - The United States and Canadian developmentmutual influences, and trans-Atlantic exchanges.to the isolated agricultural extension work ofInstitute movement originated in the northeaste:was adopted by the United States and-the United Jill Canada.Dr. Seaman Knapp's'Rumnand Home Demonstration' programme started in southern U.S.A. in 1902. It was sponsoredand originally financed by the U.S, Department of Agriculture as a national effort torehabilitate the cotton-growing areas. Later, state and local government finance andparticipation were added and it became a cooperative project.The 'County DemonstrationAgent' system was inaugurated concurrently with the appointment of the first six district'Agricultural' Representatives' by the province of Ontario in 1907.a complex of local ideas,extension of England ledt Colleges.The Farmers'.:joThe Women's Institute It should be noted that the term 'extension' was not used in connection withmost of these early European and North American programmes. The term 'agriculturalextension' was not finally adopted until the U.S. federal Smith-Lever Act of 1914formalized a nation-wide cooperative federal-state-county programme, and gave operationalresponsibility for this to the Land-Grant Colleges and Universities. The present patternof American agricultural extension resulted from this merger of a major nationalagricultural rehabilitation programme, plus some farmer and local adult education movements,with 'university extension'. However, it soon became such a large and vital programmethat the use of the term 'extension' tended to be restricted to agricultural and homedemonstrations.The concurrent developments in Australia and elsewhere were based primarily onthe appointment of 'inspectors', 'specialists' and 'experts' Who had some advisory functions.From these, groups branches, and eventually subject-matter divisions evolved, with gradualdecentralization of staff responsible for investigation, regulation, and extension. Thiswas in sharp contrast to the North American developments which were based from the start ondecentralized general practitioners serviced by state and regional specialists. With the tremendous development of rural extension work in the United States inthe following four decades, the term 'extension', and some of the know-how associated withthis work, was again exported--this time from the United States and in further modifiedform.It should be noted that the original educational content and philosophy, and widerconcept of rural extension as a method of assisting the development of farmers and farmfamilies as well as of farms and farm production, were also exported. The present'importing countries' include the United Kingdom--for where the philosophy, term and practiceof extension originally came. The numerous changes in extension implemented in Europe inthe post-war period reflect the strong American influence. A further major modification should be noted.There is a definite trend,particularly in the United States and Canada, and most pronounced in the 'newly developing'countries of Asia and elsewhere, either for agricultural extension to broaden its subjectmatter base to include a wider range of subjects or for agricultural extension to be closelyintegrated into a much wider programme of 'extension' or 'community development'. Forinstance the four regional directors of extension in Utah are now responsible for allaspects of extension and adult education activities, including the agriculture and homedemonstration programmes. The territory of Papua and New Guinea has a Department ofInformation and Extension Services which has a broad 'community development' approach andaims at coordinating and integrating extension activities in agriculture, health, localgovernment, etc. somewhat on the lines of the huge 'community development' programme ofIndia and elsewhere.Detailed studies of how, when, where, and why our present extension programmescame into being some aspects of which have been briefly summarized above, led the authorto the formulation of some broad operational definitions. Extension, in its broad sense, may be defined as: 'The extending of, or aservice or system which extends, the educational advantages of an institution to personsunable to avail themselves of them in a normal manner.' 3 In other words, all forms of extension take education to the people. By definition, 'extension' and 'extension education' are synonymous. 'Agricultural extension' takes to the rural people that form of educational assistance best suited to their needs.The author's definition of agricultural extension is:'A service or system which assists farm people, through educational procedures, in improving farming methods andtechniques, increasing production efficiency and income, bettering their levels of living, and lifting the social and educational standards of rural life.'The above definition is quite broad. It includes the whole environment in whicha farmer lives and operates as a legitimate field for extension activity.It recognizes that standards are usually different from levels of achievement. It is not restricted to farmer - contact work, but includes extension research, training, liaison, and information work as integral parts of the agricultural extension system.It was in Europe that the author finally facedthe hotly contested, values- weighted question of the difference, if any, between agricultural extension and agricultural advisory work. Investigations showed that, usually, the title in itself meant little. Often it was merely 'a rose by any other name'.In the opinion of the author, whatever difference there is depends on the philosphies and attitudes of the extension or advisory workers themselves, and on the objectives of their organizations. If the approach is'to supply information and help farmers in such a way as to make them dependent on continuing advice, the work is advisory work.Nhere the farmers are educated on how to tackle their problems, where to getinformation, etc., and the philosophy of the adviser is to 'work himself out of a job' (which, of course, he does not achieve in practice), then the work is truly educational and is definitely extension. This type of differentiation is new being recognized by many extension leaders throughout the world, But the fact remains that, for the present, the title of a service does not necessarily nominate whether or not it is solely or partlyengaged in 'extension' work in the true sense of that word.According to Savilelj 'the aim of all extension work is to teach peopleliving in rural areas how to raise their standard of living, by their own efforts, usingtheir own resources of manpower and materials, with the minimum of assistance fromgovernments.By encouraging local leadership and a spirit of self-help, extension develops'civic pride and the progressive growth of the community.' The concept that the broader function of extension work is to help people tosolve their own problems through the application of scientific knowledge is now generally accepted.If this be true then extension must be regarded as largely educational. But it is a different type of education, than' that taught in schools and colleges, a principle difference being that extension education involves no coercion of any sort. Adult farmers cannot be forced to learn new and improved practices. No extension service has thenecessary staff to direct every action and See that it is carried out effectively.Extension education is dependent upon the ability of a limited staff of advisers to inspire rural people and to create a desire for more efficient production, and better living in the rural community. Farmers must be encouraged to meet in groups to secure the information The term 'Agricultural Extension' is widely used to differentiate between extension servicesto rural people with emphasis upon farming and farm living and extension of university teaching in other disciplines to those unable to attend institutions of formal education. In this publication the term 'Aerricultural Extension' will often be shortened to 'Extension' for the sake of brevity. And both terms will be used to designate a system or service designed to help rural people to improve their own agricultural methods, incomes and levels of living.1/ A.H. Scvile, '7xtension in Rural Communities -- Oxford University Press 4 and assistance they have come to desire. As a representative of one developing countryexpressed it, if extension workers would devote more effort to the creating of a desirefor information, farmers would come and ask for itrather than wait for it to be broughtto them.Farmer motivation thus becomes a phase of extension work worthy of carefulstudy in any area.Extension education differs from fcIt is concerned not only with learning br'to the everyday problems of rural livinc Iteducation that may in most cases be put 'nmatter of timeliness must always be borne inal education in another important respect.the application of the knowledge gainedal extremely practical and concrete type of,t once.Otherwise it is forgotten. Thismind in planning extension programs. All definitions of extension education involve change; changes in the behaviorof rural people presumably resulting in improved agricultural production, better living anda strengthening of the national economy. But fundamental to any permanent behavioralchange is that of attitude. This is especially relevant when working with traditionalsocieties.One has often heard the expression \"farmers are conservative.\" They are inclinedto trust the familiar and distrust the uiSamiliar.They judge any change or innovationin the light of their own experience and the principles taught them by their fathers andforefathers.They seldom question these principles but try to apply them to the specificproblem at hand. Conformity is a mark of a traditional culture. In order to change behavior of many people extension must first change theirattitude toward change, to cause them to question traditional practices, and to realisethat they have the power to improve their own socialand economic situation. To bring about a change in attitude is a basic educational function of extension.It has been suggested that \"it (extension) is not solely concerned with teaching andsecuring the adoption of a particular improved practice, but with changing the outlook ofthe farmer and encouraging his initiative in improving his farm and home. The effectivenessof extension is measured by its ability to change the static situation which prevails inrural areas into a dynamic one.\" 1/ Concepts of agricultural extension vary in respect to relative emphasis uponeducation, service, operations, programme and the aggressiveness of leadership of theextension service in bringing about change. The difference between an extension serviceand an advisory service as traditionally operated has already been noted. Accordingto Savile, y Advisory Services \"were designed to advise farmers of improved farmingtechniques which would be of help to them and also to assist them to implement a benevolentgovernment plan for the development of the country's economy. The personal wishes ofindividual farmers and their families were seldom if ever considered\" But as Farquharindicates, at present in Europe, the name of the service means little and again quotingSavile \"Agricultural Extension is an evolution of the advisory service which can beregarded as a form of community development with an agricultural bias and an educationalapproach to the problems of rural communities.\"In some countries the educational role of extension has been given too narrowan interpretation with undue emphasis on the educational process and. too little on content.This has been true in some countries using the community development approach and inothers where all agricultural subject matter is the province of technical departments.In such cases, the extension worker finds himself working in a vacuum with no source of.subject matter at his disposal and no authority to assist the farmer in obtaining seed,fertilizer, implements, markets and other requisites of production. .1/ United Nations; Science and Technology for DevelopmentReport of the United NationsConference on the Application of Science and Technology for the Benefit of the LessDeveloped Areas (N.Y. United Nations, 1963) Vol. 6, Education and Training2./ A.R. Savile, Extension in Rural CommunitiesOxford University Press pp 12. 5 At the other extreme is the Department of Agriculture whose Director told the writer that all of his field employees were extension workers because they had occasional contacts with farmers. In this case their field employees were so involved in administration and operation of other government p ograms that they had little time for educational activities. Service rather than education may be justified when the national interest requires immediate action on a broad scale such as an infestation of cotton leaf worm in Egypt. At such a time spraying of the crop by extension employees may be justified. However, since this is an annual occurrence P17\"Irlinr\" rrmers cooperative societies to conduct control programs would seem a more f'or the extension worker.A number of years ago the writer observed with interest a dairy extension project in a European country in which extension workers weighed the daily milk production and feed consumption of each cow in the herd and recommended a specific ration. Dairymen who received this service reported considerable saving in feed cost and increased profit.However, this was a repetitive service and there was no evidence to indicate that the farmer learned how to feed according to production. The cost of such service should be considered a part of the cost of operating a dairy and not as a free extension service, financed in part by the Government. Many farmers will ask the local extension worker to prune their fruit trees, culltheir chickens and vaccinate their animals every year.Unless the farmer learns to do these things himself, this is not extension education but a free service. If such service is desired, it may be provided through a cooperative society or commercial agency with the cost being borne by the producer who benefits rather than the public.In many developing countries, the extension officer is responsible for direction of a number of government programs for agricultural development including marketing cooperatives, land reclamation projects, irrigation projects, gathering of statistics, enforcement of regulations and many others. All of theseactivities are essential elements of economic and agricultural development and require education of the rural population.However, an extension worker with such concrete operational responsibilities seldom has time to develop with the people a truly educational program to help them solve theirrecognized problems, or even to use the above mentioned services effectively.The extension worker has an educational role in relation to each of these services and programs.It can be summed up in four words involvement of the people. This includes such matters as analyzing with people the problems such programs are designed to solve; informing them as to technical and other available resources, explaining why such programsare desirable; obtaining a commitment from people to cooperate; organizing people to useresources made available; obtaining the views of people on ways of making these programs most effective under local conditions and training leaders for local administrationof programs to the extent practicable. Assigning personnel with exclusive educational functions may be difficult incountries without sufficient numbers of technically trained personnel to staff all essential agricultural institutions and services. This problem will be treated in the chapter on Extension Administration. Objectives of Agricultural Extension The concept is now generally accepted that the role of extension is to help people to help themselves through educational means to improve their level of living.However, this concept is only a very general guide to extension advisers, administrators and policy makers. Extension workers are interested in more concrete expression of purpose. Rural people want help in solving their immediate problems.And policy makers are concernedwith the contribution extension can make to national economic and social progress. -6- Extension is one of many essential institutions and services dependent upon publicfunds for support. Althoue- complementary to these other institutions and services, itmust compete with them for ::eancial support and for trained personnel.It must justifyits existence not only to the rural people served directly but to policy makers, leeislatorsand in fact the population as a whole. To do this it must not only satisfy immediate needs ofits rural clientele but also contribute to the nutional welfare both immediate and lone ranee. In certain situations, national needs may surmount in importance the needs ofthe individual villager. In India today, food production is the overriding considerationin view of widespread food shortages. During the Second World War, food production wasalmost the exclusive objective of the Arleultural Advisory Services in Great Britainand the extension services of many countries. Where nutritional diseases are a seriousproblem, better use of foods in the diet may be more important than volume of production.Where soil erosion is serious and land resources are limited, conservation of the soilmay be a major longtime objective of the extension service. But such national objectives can only be achieved through the action of ruralpeople.People may be motivated by patriotism for a time but soon lose their enthusiasmunless programmes appeal to their own best interests as they see them.For examplecertain governments reduced the establishea prices of food grains so that consumers couldafford a higher level of nutrition. This resulted in lower domestic production and ashortage of supplies because of the reduced incentive to farmers. To achieve its purpose,both nationally and locally, the objectives of extension must be known and acceptedby rural people as valuable contributions to their own welfare. The Role of Extension in Economic and Agricultural DevelopmentThe economics of most developing countries are based on agriculture, with sixtyto eighty percent of the people living in rural areas. Moat of the available resourcesconsist of land and people. Capital is in limited supply and must be generated throughdevelopment of agriculture or procured from more advanced countries either through creditsor foreign investment. Governments of most developing countries prefer to held foreirninvestment to a minimum while generating capital through the development of their ownresources.Thus agricultural development becomes a prime factor in economic development. Although there is great variation in quantity and quality of arable land, climate,water and other natural resources and ratio of land to people, developing countries havetwo characteristics in common. First, there is great potential for the development ofincreased agricultural productivity, and secondly, the potential for developing the humanresources is almost unlimited. Almost without exception, crop yields average farbelow these in more economically advanced countries with comparable land and climate.Comparative yields of meat, milk and eggs are even less. Thus the difference betweenactual and potential agricultural productivity is far greater in the less developedcountries than in their more technically advanced neighbors. Anthropologists tell us there is no appreciable difference in the inherentintelligence or capacity of people of different countries or races. Difference in abilityarise from environmental factors, one of the foremost of which is education. Accordingto Leaganslj \"Studies of the agricultural development process are increasingly recornizingthe contribution of education as one of the essential elements in the process. Thesestudies indicate that economic growth cannot be explained alone in terms of capital accumulationand growth of the labor force. But rather, the explanation for a large and possibly amajor part of economic growth lies in investments in the development of human resourcesthrough education.\" 2.1J. Paul Leagans, Professor of Extension Education, Cornell UniversityIthaca, N.Y. It is well known that economically less developed countries have a higher ratio of illiterates in the total population than more advanced countries and that the rural population has a higher rate of illiteracy than urban population.Any sharp and continuing acceleration of agricultural productivity requires the breaking away from traditional attitudes toward chance. This can be achievcd only with the aid of mass education. Thus the development of human resources through education offers not only one of the greatest possibilities for economic advancement but is a prerequisite to the application of the technology required to increase agricultural productivity. Agricultural extension is only one, althou7h a very important form of education. Elimination of illiteracy through mass education, social education to teach people to live and work together in harmony and greatly expanded technical education all contribute to agricultural and economic development. But development can not wait for a new generation of educated people before begining to move.Furthermore, rapidly advancing agricultural technology requires continuing education for rural'adults regardless of their level of formal education. Governments are increasingly recognizing that this need must be filled through some form of voluntary adult education, usually in the form of agricultural extension.It is important at this point to put agricultural extension in perspective in relation to other elements of agricultural development.Mosher 1/ makes a distinction between \"essentials for agricultural development\" and \"accelerators of agricultural development\" contending that autonomous changes may occur due to changes in environment. Agricultural development requires certain essentials but equally important, means of accelerating change in the desired direction.Among the essentials of agricultural production Mosher lists the following:1. Markets for farm products2. Constantly changing techncleFY3. Local availability of supplies and equipment4. Productionincentives for farmers5. Transportation The accelerators include: 1. Education for development2. Production credit3. Group action by farmers4. Improving and expanding agricultural land, and5. National planning for agricultural developmentAdmitting that some development will take place without the \"accelerators\" mentioned by Mosher, such development is nearly always so slow or temporary that the writer would lump the essentials and accelerators together as requirements for a viable progressive agriculture.With the above reservation, Mosher's classification provides a tool useful in putting agricultural extension in perspective in relation to other requirements for agricultural development.Pew if any governments of developing countries have provided all of the above requirements in balance and to the extent necessary to be effective. Some governments have invested a major part of their available resources in improving and expanding agricultural land through irrigation and land development and neglected many of the other essentials.In most instances these efforts have failed to achieve the expected increase in production. In other instances, governments have been oversold on education as a cureall for agricultural ills. They have based their hopes for agricultural development2/A.T. MosherGetting Agriculture Moving, Essentials for Development and Modernization, The Agricultural Development Council Inc., New York. 8 upon their extension or community development programs while neglecting to supply thefacilities or incentives for production, or one or more of the other essentials. In somecases governments have assigned to their extension services responsibility for distributionof supplies and equipment, supervision of credit, regulation of markets and other functionsnot compatible with their basic educational role. In most instances the extension serviceswere not well enough staffed or financed to assign additional personnel to these noneducational functions. Consequently, either the educational program or the operationalactivities or both were only partially effective.Extension has not made the expected impact on agricultural production in manycountries where extension services have been in operation for a decade or longer. Tilleis not because the concept of extension education is invalid.Failure to achieve itspurposes is usually due to one of three factors: 1:failure of governments to providethe other essentials of agricultural development, 2: inadequate support of extensionwith financing or personnel, or 3: ineffective administration and operation of theextension service. The main purpose of this publication is to assist extension workersto conduct a more effective extension education program with the resources provided andwithin the structure of essential rural services. The Role of Extension in Agricultural Policy FormationExtension education can and should play a vital role in the formation andimplementation of agricultural policy. Black 1/lists two important interests inrelation to food and agriculture policy: First, the wellbeing of farming folk andlecondly, the better nutrition of mankind. Although these interests are basic the writersuggests that a third interest is important in many newly developing countries. Thisinterest is the overall and continuing economic and social growth of the nation. Economicsof most newly developing countries are based largely upon agriculture, although some havemineral and other basic resources. At this stage cf development, most of these countriesare dependent upon agriculture not only to feed the population but to provide food andfibre or the raw materials for manufacture into items for export and to provide a domesticmarket for a growing manufacturing industry. Cotton in Egypt, rice in Philippines andThailand, cocoa in several African countries, coffee in Brazil, tea in Ceylon and Indoneeraand jute in India are important earners of the foreien exchange so necessary in financingeconomic development. Agricultural policy must contribute to the economic and socialprogress of the country as a whole as well as fulfilling its central responsibility for thewellbeing of rural people and nutrition of the population. It is the task of agricultural policy makers to determine the direction of growthof agriculture, to set goals for development, to devise means of achieving these goals,to evaluate progress periodically and to revise goals and programs when necessary. It isusually necessary also for policy makers to devise legislation required for the implementaeeenof the policies which have been adopted.Agricultural extension has an important role to play in both the formation andimplementation of agricultural policy. Although agricultural policy is formulated bygovernment officials and touches upon the interests of all segments of the population, itsexecution starts with changes in the attitudes and redirection of the actions of themasses of primary producers, the farmers. Without their cooperation nothing happens. Foodand fibre must be produced before they can feed and clothe the population, be used inindustry or be exported to generate foreign exchange. if John D.

Effective extension workers are in close touch with the people they serve, koolq their problems and capabilities and have their confidence.

Chapter 2.-10- EXPERIENCE WITH HUMAN FACTORS IN AORI.JUTURAL AREAS OF THE WORLD=' The Contribution Sociology, Anthropology, and Social Psychology Can Make to an Understandingof the Problems InvolvedAn effective program consists of a synthesis of technical and praotical knowledge.It also consists of the construction and operation of channels of -0mmunication betweenrural folk knowledge at one end of these channels and scientific knowledge and administrativeauthority at the other. Sociology, cultural anthropology, and social psychology are the'social sciences that have developed knowledge of, and techniques for, analyzing and under-standing the groups that live and work at the two ends of these channels. These sciencesalso possess the teohiques that make possible continuous study of the interactions of thegroups involved in the operation of an extension program. Some of the knowledge and understanding that these social sciences can contribute areneeded even before an extension program is launched. But successful operation of the extensionprogram will automatically change the behavior of groups involved in the program, will almostcertainly char ge the channels of communication between these groups, and thereby will changeall the situations that existed before the program was launched. Social sciences can thereforemake a contribution to an extension program after it is launched, while it is in operttionand while it is in, preparation.The very purpose of an extension program is to introduce change. In human relationsit is impossible to foresee the effects of one change after another, hence there is no why-of planning or plotting the program by a fixed blueprint, such as is possible and feasiblein constructing a bridge or a highway. It is within the function and capacity, and shouldbe the responaibility of the social scientist to observe, analyze, and report upon theinfluences of changes that are accomplished and to make recommendations for the constanteffective adjustment and readjustment of the extension program and processes.Cultural anthropologists have made hundreds of studies of rural folk groups and folkcultures.Sociologists are constantly studying social structures and social processes.Sociologists and social psychologists are constantly studying personal and group interactions.Out of the understanding they have developed, and by means of the analysis techniques theyhave evolvedt they are in a position (1) to analyze the groups involved in an extensionprogram, (2) to analyze the relationships of these groups one to the other - that is, thechannels of communication between them - anC(3) constantly to analyze and appraise thechanges that have been accomplished and the..prOgressive adjustments that are needed in theprogram in light of these changes.In a report of this length, the best that can be done is to set forth principles and;resent a few examples of where and how these principles have operated in situations similarto those technical people will meet in the underdeveloped areas of the world. 1.Introducing and Inducing Change in Folk Practices A.Societies Differ in Their Value SystemsEvery society has certain practices and beliefs which the members of that society I/ Report of the Committee on Social Sciences in Relation to Extension Work, of the Confe-rence am Extension Experiences Around the World, Extension Service and Office of ForeignAgricultural Relations, cooperating. May 16-20, 1949 consider the most important and valuable things in life. Through the years, elaborate institutions have developed to safeguard and perpetuate these values, and the elders see to it that all young members of the society become thoroughly conversant and imbued with the beliefs that sustain these institutions. In the United States, a premium is put upon success and individual initiative, whereas many other societies minimize individual ini tiative by urging social conformity as tremendously important.Thus there are two important points to remember in connection with the value system of any society: (1) It exists and is so deeply ingrained that to ignore it would be folly; (2) the valuesystem of one society differs in many details from that of another society. Programs must be tailored to fit in with the value system of the specific group whose practices it is desired or necessary to change and to use that system.These points become clear if we use an Arab society as an illustration. There the social valuesare based on the family, church, and village rather than on the individual. Tannous says, \"To the fellah there is no segregation of his land and agriculture from his religion, social activity, family life, and community organization.This influence (of church, familyland community) extends also to such personal affairs as marriage, funerals, rotation of crops, and methods of cultivation\". Be adds, \"Social control in these compact settlements is strong and effective, and the fellah will hesitate to take a new step independently. In facing such situations individuals manifest their community oonsciousness through such statements as 'The whole village is for the new idea,'The village is against this innovation,' 'I like what you suggest, but I cannot stand against my village.' 1/Anyone from a nonArab society who compares the aforementioned traits with the values of his own society can readily see that he cannot approach an Arab community through an American value system. Any program must be fitted into the specific characteristics of a. particular society and make use of those characteristics. There are fur too many examples of programmes, wellintentioned and unselfishly inspired, that fail because these basic cultural principles are ignored.B.Societies Are Already Organized A second principle of ma,,,,r importance in the task of changing folk practices is the recognition that societies are already organized to do for their members what those people think is important. Through the centuries, every group has worked out a way of life, a set of social relationships that is accepted as \"normal\" and considered to be the proper and right way of getting anything done.We can understand this social organization better if we look atsome of the parts of which it iscomposed, provided we recognize that each of these parts is interrelated.1.Soojal institutions The social arrangements worked out over a long period of time to meet life's basic needs include:a. Families, through which procreation is carried on and the cultural heritage transmitted to each succeeding generation.Societies differ ccnsiderably with respect to specific family patterns, but universally we find infanteborn into a family circle in which parents or relatives have fixed responsi bilities for the customary upbringing of the child. Anyone wishing to change established Tannous, Afif Z. Extension Work Among the Arab Fellahin.Farmers of the World, Ch. 7. Edited by Edmund deS. Brunner, Irwin T. Sanders, and Douglas Ensminger. New York. 1945.See pp. 78-100 - 12 - practices must know the important role played by the family and try to find the points atwhich the institution of the family can be made to serve the program of change. If parentscan be really shown that their children will benefit by a different health procedure, thenthey may adopt it. If young people, before establishing homes of their own, can be taughtnew ways of doing things, they will be likely to pass on such practices to their onchildren.The Chinese family as one of the ancient institution cultures.\"Continuing thefamily line is the main concern of the Chinese farmer,\" says Martin Yang. \"Children, parents,and grandparents are a tightly knit unit and when that unit or unity is imperilled, allmembeis feel the disaster. Those who work on the farm, work for the whole family. Individualperbonal belongings are negligible, all is family property and the continuity of the familyline depends upon the uninterrupted transmission of the family's common property. So strongis this value system that even though a man inherited nothing from his parents but has accumu-lated all he possesses through efforts of himself and wife, he wil] leave his property to hischildren with the admonition, 'Keep it intact forever.'\"1/ One who assumes that any programme of activity is possible when it contemplates merelytraining individuals to act purely as individuals, is doomed to disappoint in societies wherefamilies are the core uni.ts of culture. As Yang says, \"The individual when he attempts to actin a purely secular fashion finds that he is enmeshed in a family structure which dictatesthat he do only his age-old assigned division of labor and do it for a family, not a personalobjective.\"b. Maintenance institutions, through which the material needs are met. Every people has organized itself so as to insure a food supply, shelter, whateverclothing is deemed necessary, and transportation. In the simpler economies, such activitiesare primarily connected with the family institution, but along with advancing technology comea more complicated property system, greater occupational specialization, a marked divisionof labor, and social arrangements for producing the material necessities by joint effortand for distributing such products widely.Any attempt to change methods of production, to equalize distribution, or to alterconsumers' demands must take into account the existing maintenance institution. Propertyrights, for example,' cannot be blithely ignored, nor can people be easily persuaded to eatwhat they consider to be unclean or what they revere as a totem.Furthermore, cash incomesare very small among most of the world's people, and they do not possess the economic capacityto pay for many of the implements, purebred stock, animal feeds, commercial fertilizers,etcetera that would-be reformers urge them to procure. In most peasant societies a villagerprefers an extra strip of land to a tractor. He will say, \"I can grow more food out of theland and can eat this food, but the tractor produces nothing out of itself.\" A tractor, ofcourse, does save labor and make for more-efficient plowing, but most peasant families alreadyhave a surplus of labor for the small farms they call their own. Therefore, any program ofchange, if it is to be successful, must face this reality, not just in terms of buying andproductive capacity, but also in terms of the existing social arrangements governing economicactivities.An example of the resistance of a group of natives to the adoption of \"wet rice\"cultivation is cited by Linton. One of the Tanalan clans of Madagascar objected becauseirrigation practices would result in continuous farming of one tract and, as a consequence,would develop individual rather than group rights in land holdings. Such a developmentwould lessen the importance of the \"joint-family\" not only in ownership but also in cooperative 1/ Yang, Martin C. A Chinese village: Taitou, Shantung Province, Ch. 7. New York: 1945. - 13 - labor and mutual sharing. The clan did not deny the superiority of \"wet rice\" culture in producing maintenance goods, but it was resistant to an innovation that so drastically altered social arrangements that are sacred to it. 1/any similar instances could be cited. There are otherelaltogether too few, where administrators have tied their programmes to existent local social structures and value systems and thereby facilitated adoption of new practices.0. Government: which is supposed to maintain law and order, protect from foes without, and in general to promote the welfare of the society.In Western nations, governments increasingly become associated with programs designed to change the old established ways in favor of scientific, rational practices. But those societies where government by elders is the chief pattern are largely ruled by custom and tradition and tend to resist rapid change. Even so, every government, since it is essentially a social arrangement, has ways of reaching those within its territory and there is no escape from using it. In some countries, the central government is in fairly close touch with its citizens and is a relatively effective mechanism for transmitting new ideas and initiating social change.In other countries, the people view government as nothing but a tax-collecting agency wLich takes, but gives little in return.The people of such countries are suspicious of governmental programs. This is a hurdle that a promoted extension program must jump because it must enter all underdeveloped areas through governments.If government is to be an effective instrument in programs of change among the masses, it must work through local officials who are truly leaders in local areas.Progress comes faster and is surer when these officials are made intelligent about programs and given heavy responsibility for them.Let us note, for example, the approach that would need to be made in a Japanese village.Each village is generally subdivided for administrative purposes into from 6 to 12 local units called buraku.Each buraku has long been headed by an elected official, whose primary function is to maintain liaison between the village office and the buraku residents. These burakus are the age-old natural groupings of the people which have been converted into administrative units. They in turn are composed of kuru, also ancient neighborhood groups each consisting of from 5 to 10 households. Nothing comes into these local areas from the village, prefecture, or central government except through this official. To attempt to promote any program in a Japanese village without using these instruments of social action and these units of local government would be little short of folly.If the social sciences have anything at all to teach, they certainly have proved that popular acceptance of a program is in direct ratio to the degree that local represenr- tatives have participated in the conception and formulation of the program, and that progress comes faster when those who are supposed to be helped have something to say about the pro- gramme in the beginning. Nations with colonial empires have learned, or partially learned, this lesson through painful experience.Anyone who doilbts it should read Prof. T.S. Simey's revealing analysis entitled \"Welfare and Planning in the West Indies.\"2/d. Some system of education, which is supposed to aid in the preparation of the young for adulthood by inculcating in them the basic social values, and in developing the skills necesary for participation as citizens and as economically self-supporting individuals. 1/Linton, Ralph. The Study of Man. New York, London. 1936.See pP. 348-55/Simey, T.S.Welfare and Planning in the West Indies.Oxford. U.P. 1946. 14 In many societies, the institution of education conducts activities among adults andthus increases their personal satisfactions and social usefulness. The schools, which arethe concrete expression of this widespread institution, become the channels for directingsome social change. They frequently are busy conserving the past, but do at times bringtheir energies to bear upon solving local current problems. Rapidity of social change seemsdirectly related to literacy and educational attainment, for these cultivate a questioningframe of mind and open up through pamphlets and books additional channels of communication. Any program for change, therefore,play.Far too often the school is a meanstheir local communities, when it should beon the part of the young into constructiveshould carefully assess the part the school canof weaning the brightest boys and girls away frommore concerned with directing awakened interestefforts to improve local conditions. Social change comes more easily when people have developed an experimental oreducational point of view, a willingness to try a new practice before condemning it.Asschools spread the scientific spirit, even though they may not train professional scientists,they lay a splendid foundation for local and national authorities to use in improvinghealth, agriculture, and homemaking.The experience of Mexico in launching and carrying forward her great movement ofchange is a good example of the need for schools and their use. A Federal Secretariat ofPublic Education was organized and a programme designed to carry education to the Indianmasses.Persons were first sent into isolated regions to familiarize themselves with localconditions and to stimulate a desire for schooling.Then, when schools were organized,attendance was not confined to children, or the subject matter to literacy education.Itwas deemed necessary to educate adults as well as children, and it was recognized that theprogram of change included many types of activityproduction, health and sanitation, landreform, and even the reorganization of communities. The first teachers were called missionersand ... were expected to play the combined roles of teacher, supervisor, administrator,research workers and philosopher.1/ Mexico's leaders recognized that their programme_ofchange meant change in the life of the masses, and that only the government could sponsorsuch a giant movement.e. A religion, which represents man's adjustment to the uncontrollable forces ofhis universe, and seeks to orient the individual to these forces (God, Allah, spirits ofmany kinds) and to acceptable behavior toward his fellow men. This orientation includes not only a set of beliefs and a means, through worshipand sacrifices, of obtaining sufficient dynamics (a recharging of his spiritual batteriesias it were), but it also provides a set of intermediaries (clergy, priests) who stand betweenthe worshipper and the deity and who interpret to the worshipper the will and attributes ofthe deity.The history of every society is full of instances in. which the intermediaries andthe more zealous of the worshippers have opposed social change on the grounds that it wascontrary to the will of Cod. But the records also show, and with increasing frequency inour own day, that the world's major religions are also playing an active part in ministeringto the nonspiritual as well as spiritual needs of their adherents. Here, as in the case ofgovernment, much depends upon the attitude and training of the local religious leaders.Where there is a desire to change, precedents can be found in almost every religion thatwould give some religious support to the change.Tannous tells the story of how the installation of a village pump was accomplished in an Arab village after outsiders had absolutely 1/ Whetten, Nathan L. Rural Mexico.Chicago.1948.See pp. 404-53 -15- failed in their attempts to accomplish this much needed sanitary improvement. It was accom- plished not only by patiently explaining that the iron pipes would not spoil the taste of the water or quickly drain all the water out of the spring and by demonstrating the labor- saving use of the pump, but also by quoting from the Koran - their Bible - that cleanliness was required from every faithful Moslem and that man should do his best to avoid the danger of disease.1/ C.Locality Groupings: Neighborhoods and CommunitiesEvery society contains locality groupings that play an important part in the daily lives of individuals. In rural societies the neighborhood, composed of families livingnear one another, provides the basis for mutual aid, much social visiting, and the play activities of children. Extending beyond the neighborhood is the community, often a village, with which each individual feels closely identified and which frequently is the centre of his little universe. He is susceptible to village opinion and many of his wants are satisfied locally. In the local setting one finds the various institutional representatives in competi- tion or in cooperation with each other. The \"open sesame\" to most homes may be through the family elders or the priest, the governmental authorities or the school teacher, the merchant or the physician. Knowing which institutions to stress on the local level grows out ofunderstanding the community and its relation to the larger society of which it is a part. Programme;with a community orientation have the greatest chance of success, since the appeal is not to people as separate individuals but as members of a-going concern, a set of social relationships, in which all members of the group participate willingly.Leonard describes such groups among the Bolivian Indians. Be said the present-day Ayllus are small closely but communal types of locality groupings which originally were held together by social and kinship bonds (clans). The most obvious solidifying force now is common ownership in land. Leonard says, furthermore, that except for the more accessible Ayllus in the Lake Titicaca basin, this fundamental unit of organization in the Bolivianhighlands has undergone few fundamental changes in four centuries. The severe exploitation of the native peoples by outsiders has fostered in the Indian fear and distrust of other than his own immediate fellows. Out of this arose the general belief that his only chance for any remnant of social, political and economic security lay in his ability to remain a part of and among his own kindl for it is in the communal life of the Ayllu that he is a bona fide member of a social grouping composed of indiViduals whom he considers little different from himself.2/ Within every community are a number of informal groups that come into existenceas people gather to gossip, loaf, or drink. Often the same pec.le come together periodicallyand obr,..re their views with each other, thus becoming a part of tie gossip chain which has so moil to do with the formation'of public opinion. Any extension program should recognize such groupings and see to it that a correct interpretation is made to enough of the \"right\" people so that the word-of-mouth version aids instead of hinders the activities in view.Formal organizations also loom large on the horizon of many communities, and where the participation is widely representative or embraces those most influential, these groups can be used to advantage. A number of people can be reached simultaneously and are in position to give the weight of their backing once they become supporters of a program. Tannous, Afif I. Op. cit.See pp. 97-100 16 D.The Status System and LeadershipEvery society has ways of ranking individuals either at the top, the middle, or thebottom of the social scale, and expects them to perform the roles appropriate to their socialpositions.The status system is directly connectel with the social values which most of thepeople share.Since every program needs leadership to carry it on, those responsible for it mustdo more then rely upon the institutional leaders previously mentioned. They should alsoinclude representatives of the various social layers involved in the program. A landlordis not necessarily the best spokesman for his tenants, nor can the disadvantaged farmerobjectively appreciate some of the problems of the large landowner. The views of artisangroups in a village and those of the landed peasants may differ, and the village merchantsand their coterie of followers may seriously oppose an uplift program that might seem toendanger their position. In general, the programme's accomplishment will be greatly speededup if is has the blessings of the \"powers that be,\" but this alone will not guarantee programme acceptance. This is where a broader representation proves of value. Witness thefollowing (in establishing folk schools):\"Because no headway had been made within 3 months' time, it was necessary for theDirector to visit the community. Upon his arrilv. he discovered that his three representatives had ignored 'Old Chang,' who was the 'headaye' man of the oommunity. A sooial gettogether was immediately arranged to which 'Old Chang' was invited and acoorded due respect.Within 3 weeks three folk schools were opened. 'Old Chang' gave his blessing and his fullsupport once his position as 'the boss' of the community was recognized.\"2/ 1.Disadvantaged people cling,stronfzlv to attitudes and beliefs. By and large, peopleunder stress tend to cling strongly to their beliefs and regard an effort to change them asan increased source of insecurity. However, not all beliefs are equally strong. Some aremore intimately tied with the sense of security than are others. It is therefore importantto distinguish the fundamental beliefs from those of a more superficial character. As arule of thumb, one should never attack the fundamental types of belief, directly. If erroneous and incompatible with reality, the fundamental beliefs'will themselves dissolve in thecourse of time, but nothing gives them life like a direct attack upon them. Their untruthhas to be discovered slowly by the people and at the same rate at which the people are findingnew sources of seourity. A belief upon which a person's security depends cannot simply bewiped out.Disillusion from the belief has to be acoompanied by a shift of dependence upona new kind of support. This means that remedial changes such as those called for in extensionwork should be planned in successive stages stretched over a period of time.The extension worksr who is trying to make changes within a culture may expect tofind one of three attitudes in conneotion with his program: acceptance and cooperation,hostility and resistance, or apathy and indifference. It is important for him to realizethat these three states of mind can exist and come to bear on him without the main drivingforce behind them having very much to do with what he does or ORys. The alert, cooperative,rational type of action is found when people have a reasonable basis for existence; butpeople under severe stress physical, social? and phychological characteristically reactby having either a high degree of hostility and aggression which they will discharge on anyconvenient object that will not annihilate them by retaliation, or by being apathetic andindifferent and therefore not lift a hand to do much to save themselves. It cannot bestressed too muoh that behavior of this kind is reactive and almost reflexive among humanbeings.Therefore, the person who goes out to make ohanges within the culturs of otherpeoples must expect to find these negative reactions when the people are suffering stress, 2/ Yang, Hsin Pao. Promoting Cooperative Agricultural Extension Service in China.Farmers of the World, Ch. 5 See footnote 2 -17- which of course is the case in most of the underdeveloped areas across the world. One is doomed to failure and disappointment if he expects to be able to overcome resistance, hostility, or apathy quickly or by any single device or formula. A very long period of consistent and successive demonstrations of the person's reliability and integrity, and his capacity to produce results will be required. The hope needs to be on the cumulative effect and not on any one or two \"shots in the arm.\"The positive toeholds that exist in almost all communities, though they do vary in the cultural form, are the opportunity to create a greater economic or subsistence security, and to gain prestige and admiration, that is, for the individuals in the community to gain prestige and admiration by participating in a given activity or having something to do with it. The best remedy for uncooperative, hostile, and resistant types of behavior is relief of the stresses that are causing these attitudes and actions. That is, one should try to cope with the fundamental causes and not with the symptoms, always bearing in mind, however, that neither one remedy nor a single dose is going to do the job.If the program of introducing a change is successful, then not only will the change itself take place, but a whole series of repercussive changes will result from it which markedly alter the picture. The successful operation of this process was illustrated among the Navajo Indians a few years ago in an attempt to change their breeds of sheep. It was impossible to convince them to follow the type of information that had been thoroughly validated by scientists. They were fearful that they were being tricked by outsiders whom they had not invited into their midst.Only after a few producers had been induced to use one-half of their grazing land for the production of their old type and the other half for the new type, with a firm financial guarantee of no loss, were the new breeds allowed to prove their superiority in the production of both wool and mutton.Once the new practice was understood, however, the gates to other accomplishments were opened, because the fear, even hostility, of a disadvantaged group had been dispelled by a willingness on the part of the scientist to compromise and wait for proved results.2.Introdueinand InducinChan e at the Top of the Social StructureEctension and all other large organized programs must find their way into the economic and social structure and practices of the underdeveloped areas of the world through the medium of the governments of the nations within whose boundaries those areas exist.Therefore, an understanding of, and work with, groups of administrators and techni- cians who function at the. top end of the channels of communication is as important as an understanding of the folkways and social structure of the farm people 'at the other end of the channels.These groups of administrators and technicians in practically all areas include the national rural-life leaders who have the status and prestige needed not only to launch but to sustain and operate programs of change and improvement.Like similar groups all over the world, the status and prestige of the groups of administrators and technicians are part of the social structure and culture of their societies. Like every other status group, they have accepted and sanctioned ways of doing things which must be used, must often be mobilized, and sometimes must be changed.In some ways the established patterns of behavior of these groups are more difficult to change than are the folk practices of the common people, chiefly because personal and professional prestige is at stake. Their members have come into possession of prestige and power partly because they have become qualified by either political activities or technical training.They may not be persons with a large body of knowledge and an understanding of the people in the underdeveloped areas of their countries, but they are educated, influential, and powerful.To the extent that change and improvement are necessary in their ideas, -18- understanding, and operational behavior, no matter how delicate the task, such change andimprovement are necessary. Not to utilize their prestige and power and to build upon theirpast accomplishments is to violate cultural processes. Not to help improve their knowledgeand practices is to block or impede the channels of communication by which extension programsreach the people they are designed to assist. Like all cultural change the components ofchange are complex in these groups, and the process of change neoessarily is evolutionary.The class structure of many areas of the world is such that it is scarcely conceivablethat a farmborn and reared person will be represented among the technical and governmentalleaders. Nonfarm persons must be able to perform the roles of leadership in all agriculturalprogrammes.They may or may notbe theoretically trained, but they are seldom, if ever,practically trained for these roles. Nevertheless, they must be depended upon as the channelsthrough which, and the instruments by which, programmes of change and reform are initiatedin the agriculture and life of the farm people. To ignore them is impossible; not to understand them as a culture group would be to defeat any and all programmes.In countries in which few or no farm youth reoeive college or even highschooleducation, the surest programme of change would be to construct a professional ladder bymeans of which farm youth could and would climb from the level of their folk knowledge tothe levels of science. They would then know their way back down the channels of communication to the folk from which they came.The construction of such a professional ladder, however, necessitates an integralprogramme of education and training from grade schools, through high schools, to college,and this cannot be done quickly. Until a small stream of farm boys and girls with theknowledge of the folk practices and values of the common people has passed through gradeschool, high school, and college, and these young people have become members of administrative and technical groups at the top of the channels of communication, others must be workedwith and depended on.It cannot be too strongly emphasized that these administrative and technical groupsare an integral part of the social structure and culture of every country, that they havetraditional and established ways of doing things, have status, prestige, and power; andthat they are leaders. They are the vehicles through which extension programs must enterthe country, and they must be depended upon to guide and operate the programs once theyare established. They must be used and must be understood.In broad terms, the following are part of the social structure and folk culture ofthese toplevel groups in most of the countries that include the underdeveloped areas ofthe world:1. Ordinarily, they are persons who were not born and reared on farms.2. They are few in number and generally highly centralized in both location and organization.3. The folklore of the class to which they belong, and indeed of their wholesociety, does not assume that they will communicate freely with the farm people whomextension programs are designed to serve. 4. One of the symbols of their prestige isthat they do not work with their hands or talk the langugae of manual workers or farmers.5. In many cases the economic and political structure of their culture has dictated thatthey chiefly serve special segments of the farm population instead of serving all of thefarm people.6. In their official capacities they are burdened with many duties of inspection and other police functions. 7. Frequently, neither their technique nor-experience hashelped them to understand the simple people in isolated rural areas, or to be experts inconstructing and operating channels of communication.These characteristics are not listed as criticism of persons or groups, but merelyto emphasize that no extension program can effectively enter the lines of communicationbetween technicians at the top and practising farmers at the bottom without passing throughthe culture groups that constitute the national rural life leaders of all countries; andfurther to emphasize the fact that the traditional attitudes and functioning operation ofthese groups are just as truly a part of the country's culture as are the folk practices andattitudes of the farm people of the country. -19 Extension programs will work effectively to the extent that these groups (a) have a combined knowledge of folk practices and science, (b) have a thorough knowledge of the lines of transmission between science and folk knowledge and between scientists and the folk peoples, and (c) be thoroughly capable of communicating their scientific and technical knowledge by means of all levels of communication through which extension programs must pass from top to bottom and bottom to top. Furthermore, only after this process has worked for a period of time will psychological impediments to communication disappear.In the meantime, scientists and experts from other areas of the world must and will be working side by side with the administrative and technical groups of the nations within whcze boundaries lie the underdeveloped areas.In such cooperative work it is imperative that the foreign experts be sympathetically cognizant that (1) they, as truly as those who work with the simple folk at the grass roots, are working with the processes of cultural change;(2) the people with whom they work have both personal and professional selfrespect which must not be violated; and (3) even though the technical and administrative groups of the country may not be as thoroughly trained in the sciences and administrative procedures of extension programs as are their foreign collaborators, they undoubtedly have a far greater knowledge and understanding of their own country, its people, its governmental structure, its social classes, and its customs and traditions. 3.The Channels of Communication Between Scientists and Administrators and Polk GroutsIt has been made clear that extension plays the very important role of a dynamic medium of communication between rural folk on the one hand and scientific and administrative authorities on the other. For extension to bear its desired fruit, it must maintain a smooth functioning of this twoway traffic; from the farmer to the scientist and administrator, problems and field experience; and from the scientist and administrator to the farmer, improved practices and techniques. The extension program will suffer to the extent that the channels and techniques of communication between these two groups are inadequate or ineffective.Social science is in a position to make a fundamental contribution to extension in this respect. Its analyses of group relations is a constant reminder of the significance of efficient means of communication and the necessity for them. The knowledge it affords keeps the authorities concerned alert to the possibility of adopting more effective techniques continually.Social scientists, therefore, are equipped with the knowledge that enables them to make a thorough analysis of the channels and techniques of communication that exist in specified situations. By virtue of such analysis, they are able to make pertinent and specific observationsv such as:1. Each culture, and sometimes a region or a community within a culture, has its peculiar means of communication as well as those common to other cultures. It must not be taken for granted that the channels and techniques of one culture necessarily exist in another, or that they would function effectively if they were introduced. To illustrate, written literature is of little value among groups that are highly illiterate; yet we have many examples of authorities indulging in the production of bulletins, pamphlets, and the like, supposedly for the benefit of such people. Other means of communication of advanced cultures such as mail service, the telephone, the radio, and the automobilei might be lacking or much restricted in the rural areas of less advanced cultures. Local means must be depended upon, possibly improved, until the more advanced techniques are established.Examples of such local channels follow: (a) Womenfolk gossiping at the village bakery and the village well, and during social visits or while doing field workv(b) men gossiping in coffeehouses, at threshing floors, during social visits, and sometimes while doing field work; (c) news and views exchanged during the weekly market, at funerals, and during religious festivals; (d) the village crier, who informs the whole community of important news by shouting it out at night; (e) the church bell, which, when struck at a time other than at regular worship, is the signal for the community to be on the alert for an important event; (f) the homes of recognized community leaders, the carriers of prestigev 20 where people gather for uptodate and authentic information on vario:is topics; (g) specialcarriers of messages; (h) the village writer, who specializes on writing petitions, letters,and the like, for illiterate folk; (i) the story reader or teller; (j) other key persons,such as the teacher, the priest, or the headman, who read the paper or other literature to thepeople and pass on instructions from authorities. Knowledge of these channels and instrumentsof communication should be had before programs are launched, because the gossip groups can beused to develop suspicion and hostility against the programmes as well as receptivity for them.To understand these types of groups and their behavior is as important as a knoledge ofphysical roads and paths leading into the areas where programs are to be launched. To obtainthis understanding, we must turn to the social scientists, who are expert in analyzing thes,!,groups.2. Every means or type of communication has two aspects, the tangible physical ormaterial aspect, and the less tangible social or psychological aspect. The former differslittle, whereas the latter differs a great deal from culture tp culture. A thorough studyof a means of communication with proper evaluation of its psychosocial implication is essential.A poster using a pig to illustrate the essentials of good feeding would certainlydefeat its own purpose if used in Muslim communities. An illustration based upon the butcheringof a cow would be equally ineffectual among the Hindus.When, some 20 years ago the King ofan Arab oountry introduced the telephone, he was strongly opposed by the religious leaderson the groundethat it was the work of the devil.The wise king established that efficientmeans of communication in the sanctions of his people by making it transmit a verse from theKoran, Allah's Book. This proved that the telephone could not be an evil instrument. 3. The personal touch in human relations is an outstanding characteristic of mostfolk cultures, where the material aspects of living are not advanced.This trait could verywell be utilized by extension as an effective means of communication. In such cultures,ideas and techniques that are transmitted through formal, official, businesslike channelsare likely to fall upon deaf ears and blind eyes.The people might do something in responseto such an approach, but they would do it as a superficial gesture of compliance, ratherthan as the expression of a genuine, motivated desire to adopt the new practices. The effectiveness of the personal touch is well illustrated by the following examplesof statements that are heard in the villages of certain countries: \"Here I come in personto appeal to you to do this, and I know you will not turn me away with an empty hand:\"\"For your sake, my friend, I will do anything; you order and I will obey:\"\"For the sakeof my old beard, don't oppose this community project in which we have all agreed:\" \"This isnot a usual order: it is a personal letter from the Director of Agriculture, appealing toeach of us in this village to use the new improved seed. Surely we are not going to refusehim this request, which is also for our good:\" \"I was received by the Director of Educationin person, who inquired about our village school. He said he was going to visit us upon thecompletion of the new school building. We have to finish the job soon now \". 4. In simple folk cultures, demonstration is an important channel through which animproved technique can be transmitted effectively. These people don't have much of aneconomic margin that would permit them to experiment with new practices and take the riskof possible failure. Furthermore, they have not built up a tradition of faith in what iswritten on paper and what is proposed by central authorities. Consequently, the localdemonstration of a suggested improved technique goes very far in convincing the people ofthe validity of the proposal.5. An overall appraisal of this process of communication reveals that each culturehas two systems of channels and techniques, one developed and utilized by the scientific,technical, and administrative authorities, the other developed and utilized by the ruralcommunities.Each of these is deeprooted and firmly established among its supporters, withits peculiar equipment of material facilities, institutions, behavior patterns, and emotionalcontent.The two differ from each other to one degree or another, depending upon the pattern 21 of the culture concerned. In the Middle East and in most Latin American countries, the degree of difference is striking, and represents the great gap that exists between the authorities and the great rural masses. One of the primary tasks of extension is torecognize and understand these differences, and then to work at bringing the two systems of communication closer, until they are geared effectively.4Continuous Aonraisal as a Basis for Constant Ad'ustments in Pransnctension programa will induce and introduce change, thus not only practices but social relationships and attitudes will be changed. To know :;advance what all of these changes will be is impossible, and since some of them will be chain reactions, constantanalysis is essential to necessary constant adjustments. If hostility develops at either the top or the bottom of the lines of communication or within them, the fact needs to be taken into account immediately. If it becomes apparent that lines of communication are not adequately carrying through from top to bottom or bottom to top because of leaks or blocks,quick rectification is essential in order to forestall hostility or discouragement.The social scientist's role is constantly to observe, analyze, and understand these processes.To do so, he should not be in an administrative position, but instead be free to study al segments of the total process of change and made responsible for doing so. If his position is an administrative one, he will almost certainly be restricted to onesegment of the process and therefore not be able to make the observations and recommendations of which he is capable. He should, however, be a staff person, free to communicate and advise with all responsible administrators and technicians, including those in the highest authority.In such consultation he is the specialist who should be depended upon for anunderstanding of the beliefs and attitudes that lie back of present practices, and which of these it will be difficult and which easy to change. He should also know to what extentscience is being accepted and blended with folk knowledge. His analysis must be sufficientlyprecise and, especially, sufficiently current to spot chain reactions and keep the program in continuous adjustment. By no means the least of his oontributions should be a continuous appraisal of the extent to which the knowledge and desires of the people,at the bottom of the channels of communication are travelling upward and being interpretedto technicians and administrators. As important and essential as is the social scientist's advanced appraisal of social and cultural situations before programmes are initiated, far more important is his special role as a member of a team. It must be kept in mind that this team will include not only outside technicians but all the highest authorities and best technicians of the country and the leaders of the folk groups that extension programsare designed to serve. Because human relations are dynamic, the social scientist has learned that his chief task is to studypeople and programmes in action. To do this effectively, he must learn what the humanrelations, attitudes, and practices are before programs are launched and what desired changes are contemplated. He must analyze constantly what has happened to these human relations, attitudes, and practices in the process of change. Such an analysis is his greatestsingle contribution -Lo the other members of the team on which he works.Conclusion In conclusion it should be stated forthrightly that to the extent that marked change (progress) is accomplished in the development of the natural resources and the economics ofthe underdeveloped areas of the world, drastic change in the social organization and established patterns of life of the people in these areas will also be changed. These patternsof life are sanctioned by beliefs that their customs and practices are good and to observethem is the right way to live. Leaderfollower patterns will be changed, old social institutions will be disturbed, even religious beliefs will have to change.It is not impossible that more harm than good could result unless the changes are initiated and accomplished withthe greatest understanding that can be obtained or developed. 22 The knowledge of sociologists, anthropologists and social psychologists will neverbe as exact as that used by the engineer or biologist, but a committee* of sociologicalscientists agrees with President Conant of Harvard who said \"It is my belief that methodshave already been developed to a point where studies of society by competent scholars canprovide basic information to assist all those practical men who struggle with the group ofproblems we list under the head of human relations....powerful tools are in the process ofbeing forged by the scientist who studies man as a social animal. These tools can beused to further or to destroy certain types of behavior and certain social patterns.\" I/With him we believe that policy markers in government, business and education must beincreasingly aware of the assistance they can receive from those Who study man and society.In no field of human behavior can they receive, or do they need, greater assistance than inprograms designed drastically to change the economy and culture of the underdevelopedareas of the world. *Irwin T.

Chapter 3,23 aTENsION ORGANIZATIONOrganization involves the establishment of a system of harmonious and effective working relationships among people engaged in a common endeavor and their relationships with ether individuals and groups engaged in complimentary activities. Its objective is the efficient use of human, economic and physical resources in accomplishing the purposes for which the Grgenization is established. Harmonious internal working relationships are essential to the success of any organization. But when accomplishment of its purposes hinge upon the reaction of persons outside the organization, external relationships become equally important. Agricultural extension services are established for the purpose of changing the knowledge, skills, practices and attitudes of masses of rural people. Schools, health servicestregulatory agencies, churches, buyers of agricultural products, suppliers of production requisites and many other institutions and services are also involved inactivities affecting rural people. It is the function of extension service organizations not only to establish a system of harmonious internal relationships but also to establish complimentary rather than competitive relationships with all other institutions, services and organizations contributing to progress in the rural community. In this chapter we will limit the discussion to external relationships. Internal organization will be developed under the heading of Extension Administration. The work to be done is the basic consideration in determining the structure of any organization.The broader the scope of responsibilities and program of an extension service the more involved become relationships with other institutions, services and agencies.An extension service whose program involves educational activity in marketing must develop a satisfactory working relationship with marketing agencies such as cooperative marketing associations and processors and purchasers of agricultural products. An extension service assigned or assuming responsibility for educational activities of rural youth must establish not only good relations with rural young people but also with schools, churches, boy and girl scouts and other agencies concerned with rural youth. Agreement with these agencies and institutions as to method of cooperation, definition of responsibilities and division of functions is essential if the best interests of young people are to be served and friction and duplication of effort are to be avoided.Whether directly involved or not, an extension service should be concerned with all aspects of the welfare of rural people. But it should keep in mind that its role is educational and its program should compliment socalled action or administrative programs oother agencies, and cooperate to the extent deemed feasible and mutually agreeable in other educational programs. It is therefore highly desirable that the scope of responsibility and programs of the extension service and its relationship with other agencies be defined either through legislation or official statement of policy.In the following article, Dr. J.Di Franco 1/ described the scope and responsibility of the extension service as worked out by a high level committee in the United States. The reader should bear in mind that in each instance extension's responsibility is strictly educational.Any operational activities involved such as marketing, public affairs and farm management will normally be carried out by other government or private agencies or by the people themselves. 3.Bi.Franeo FAO Paraphrased from \"Guide to Extension Programmes for the Future\" article appearing in the Agricultural Extension Service Publication, July 1959, North Carolina State College, Raleigh, North Carolina, 1.S.A. 24 Scope and Reuelesibilities of Extension ServicesAlthoueh programs may vary in detail from service to service, all extensionsem:ices have areas of common interest. These areas of responsibility can be identified as: 1. Agricultural Production2. marketing, distribution and utilization of farm products3, Conservation, wise use, and development of natural resources4. Management on the farm and in the home5, Family living6. Youth development7. Leadership development8. Community improvement9. Public affairsThe scopes of these areas of responsibility also vary between services. Logically,programs must reflect needs and priorities of the people with whom they work. This doesnot, however, negate the fact that extension personnel must be aware of the total scope andresponsibility of their service. In addition it is as important that the NationalAdministrative Unit to which the extension service is attached (i.e. Ministry of Agriculture)and the rural people should be adequately informed as to the scope and responsibility ofextension.Only in this way can a cooperative and understanding relationship evolve andsupport an affective extension program.To help in clarifying the scope and responsibility we need to define further thenine areas that have been identified. 1.Agricultural ProductionA nation of rural people must spend most of its manpower and energy in the endlessquest for food. Only when men and women can be released from this struggle for food is itpossible to produce the other amenities that result in a high standard of living. Thus the United States' fabulous economic productivity rests, in a very immediateway, on efficiency in agriculture. The place that efficient farming plays in that nation'seconomic wellbeing cannot be overlooked or slighted.Interpreted accurately, efficiency means using land, labor, capital, and managerialability in the beet possible combination to be a marketable product with the least expenditureof productive resources and human effort.The task is immensely complicated by the continual changes that are taking placein the technology of production, processing and distribution.Human food habits changeand this also affects the farm. Industry competes vigorously for the farm labor supplyand also for markets. Urban needs compete for the land itself. Mechanization makesfarming a major investment. Government programs affect the pattern of agriculture. To cope with such complexities, farm operators are faced with major or minoradjustments every day of their lives, The extension service can serve agriculture and thewhole economy by actively helping farm people make these adjustments wisely. 2.Marketing, Distribution and Utilization of Farm ProductsFifty years ago many agricultural marketing services were performed by the farmerhimself.Today they are performed by thousands of highly specialized marketing firms,with little or no direct contact between the producer and the consumer. Increasedefficiency of the entire agricultural marketing system is one of the major needs fordeveloping economies. An organization which accepts responsibilities aimed at such a goalwill need to work with the farmer and also with the processor, the distributor, the retailer,the consumer, and a host of others to the mutual advantage of all. -25- Extension has made a good start (in some areas of the world) with an educationalprogram in marketing, distribution, and utilization of farm products, but much is yet to be done.The objectives of this extension program are three-fold:-To reduce the cost of marketing farm products-To expand the market for farm products-To help people understand the marketing system 3.Conservation, Wise Use, and Development of Natural ResourcesThe wealth of a nation depends -_pon the natural resources available to it, thedetermination and resourcefulness of its people, and the efficiency with which peopleconserve and use resources for the common good. The attitude )f government toward resources is a critical factor, Few resources can be considered an individual's exclusive concern. His actions affect the lives of his neighbors and the lives of future generations.Resource programs require two things that few individuals can give: Continuity over a long period, and full recognition of all interests involved, For strength and security, nations need farsighted action programs in the conservation and development of resources.Such programs will necessarily have a large element of group action.Success will depend on motivating people, involving them in policymaking, and stimulating them to act together for the common good. Here the extension service has a unique opportunity. It can help individuals with their own problems of resource management. It can supply leadership and experienceand specialized knowledge for community and regional resource programs. It can also develop a wider appreciation of the economic and recreational values of natural resources. among all the men, women and young people it reaches in its other programs.4.Management on the Farm and in the RomeManagerial skill has been defined as \"the ability to make decisions that achieve goals in the most efficient manner.\"For most people, wants are consistently greater than canbe achieved immediately. This forces individuals to make numerous and frequent decisions on what resources to acquire and how to use them. This is a fluid period for all nations - in production, in the variety and kindA' goods and services available, and in occupational and population changes. People are involved in this changing situation. It vitally affects their business, their living,and the occupations open to them. Where change is rapid and opportunities for choices are many, management slays a correspondingly larger role. The sheer bulk of management factors to be considered by the people today demands that management be given full attention by extension workers at every level. Making decisions wisely is a skill which can be learned. It can be applied bythe individual, the family, the group, and the firm.It can help assure better individualincomes, higher levels of living. and a generally higher level of ability to make decisions and confidence to carry them out. 5.Family livingPrior to the beginning of the twentieth century some farm institutes held in the United States featured information on family living. The well-known Country Life Commission in 1908 called for programs to improve family living. Then in 1914, the Smith-Lever Actcharged the extension organization with the job of \"diffusing\" ...home economics and encouraging the application of the same...\" -26- Modern advances in technology and the rapid.Ly cnanging economy have had a strongimpact on family living and have resulted in requests for new kinds of assistance fromthe extension service. Family economics, home management, buying, human relations, foodand nutrition, clothing, housing, citizenship, health and safety, conservation, andproblems of low incomes are some of the major areas in which extension now conductsfamily living programs.Extension workers can use many resources to reach and influence numerous audiencesin this area during the years ahead. Historically much of extension family living workhas been done through homemaker's groups organized specifically for such purposes. Thesegroups will continue to function and to adjust to newer needs and programs. Specialhandling will be needed, however, for such special audiences as the beginning homemaker,the working wife and mother, young parents, and the elderly or retired person. To do such a compretensive job in an efficient way, extension workers will needto enlist the aid of volunteer leaders, the mass media, and other agencies and organizations. 6.Youth DevelopmentFour -H club work has been a successful method of working with young people formore than 50 years (in the U.S.A.). Priority has in the past been given to the needs offarm youth, but extension must interpret its responsibility as also applying to youngpeople in rural non-farm homes and in suburban or urban families. Today it is also becoming clear that if young people of all ages are to be servedby the same youth program, it (the program) must recognize that needs differ at differentdevelopmental stages. A boy or girl from 10 to 13 looks for knowledge and skills -projects and activities in which he can do or build or achieve.At 13 or 14, interestsbecome broader. Group activities are more important. Young people want to help plantheir own program and take some leadership in it.When formal schooling ends, another transition begins.Young people begin toseek information and guidance on careers, on college work, on marriage and on the otheradult problems they are beginning to encounter. The young married couple is concernedprimarily with establishing a home, a family, and an income.Extension must broadenits concept of youth work to make sure it offers all the service it is capable of givingto each of these four youth groups. It must also endeavor to make adults more permeableto problems of present youth and therefore willing to contribute personally and otherwiseto programs seeking their solution. 7.Leadership DevelopmentSeldom in history has leadership been more important than it is today.Because so many of the needs of modern life can only be met by group action, groups ofevery kind are assuming new significance. Yet no group can rise above the leadership atits disposal.Leaders are the catalyst for group action, the voice for group.expression, thetool through which the group considers and carries out its decisions.Almost everyonehas the potential for some leadership. Furthermore, leadership can be expressed or exerteain many ways, Democratic groups often have a very high ratio of leaders to \"followers\",and the traits of leadership are showing their usefulness at every level in such organizations. Finally, leadership can be developed. Extension work has long made a policy oftrying to give people the resources necessary for leadership, the opportunities to assumea leader's role, and the experiences by which they can build their own self-confidenceand earn the confidence of others. -27- The extension program has made a measurable contribution to the nation's fund of leadership.It can do much more. Those who develop leadership in the process of planning, developing, and carrying out extension educational programs have shown that they can also exert effective leadership in many other settings or situations. What more satisfying result can any educational program strive to achieve? 8.Community Improvement and Resource DevelopmentCommunities can be improved and their resources developed. This is the significant fac:; about extension community programs of the past, and it is the governing faith behind programs for the future. A small rural community will often have strong geographical unity, and every resident will share in many common problems and interests. A larger urban center will provide the setting in which families with widely varying interests will live and work. Yet both ncommunities\" will depend upon group action, on a community basis, to develop adequately their resources. Extension workers will find themselves working with three kinds of community resources:NATURAL - the land, water, climate, minerals, etc.HUMAN - the people and their attitudes, skills and talentsINSTITUTIONAL - the schools, churches, markets, government groups, and other organizations and services which fill community needs.In rendering its assistance, extension will serve many types of communities in a variety of projects. Yet its basic objective will always be the same - the development of people themselves, helping them to approach their potential in knowledge, abilities, skills, attitudes and appreciations. 9.Public Affairs Public affairs education is education for citizenship. Its scope is measured by the educational needs of intelligent citizens concerned with public issues at every level of government. From the earliest years of the extension service, rural people have looked to it for help on controversial public problems. The tempo of economic growth and change, however, have greatly increased the need to give such help. People traditionally desire freedom from governmental intervention.But they realize that economic and social growth and progress create complex new public problems that may demand more governmental inter- vention, not less. World conditions, too, are increasingly complex. Extension is feeling today, more urgently than ever before, the demands for unbiased and factual help in public affairs.No one expects the extension worker to try to tell people what their decision should be on a public policy issue.What he can do is to help people study the economic and social consequences of alternative courses of action.When extension teaches new technology it must also accept the responsibility to help society mako he adjustments that will assure genuine benefits from such technology. This is a form of help which responsible citizens need and appreciate.It offers a Challenge to which extension can and should respond vigorously. 28 Geographict Economic and Political Factors Influence the Organization of atension Services The nature of extension education requires the organization to be in intimatecontact with all segments of the rural population. Depending upon the scope of itsassigned responsibility and program, it may well also work closely with urban people.Such a dispersed clientele, especially in areas where communication is difficult or slow,is often reflected in widely varying levels of education, social organization, customsand economic development. Geographic factors exert the most obvious influence upon organization. Naturalbarriers, such as rivers without bridges and mountain ranges, separate settlements ofpeople thus dividing the country into regions, districts or communities with separateorganizational units for the conduct of extension work. Where such barriers have restrictedcommunication for centuries, as in some parts of India, people in adjoining areas mayspeak different languages and have different social organizations. The irrigated valleysof Peru separated by strips of desert require separate organization of local leadershipand services of separate units of the extension organization. Even more obvious is thedifference in extension organization and method required to serve nomadic desert tribesas compared with occupants of adjacent intensively farmed irrigated areas. Continuousor frequent movement of nomads over wide areas result in a variety of social, economicand other problems in organizing and conducting an educational program. Communicationwith these people is difficult, expensive and intermittent. Contact must be on an individualor small group basis. Roads are usually poor or nonexistent. Most nomads are illiterateso the written word is of little educational value. Few nomads have an opportunity forany formal education, let alone higher technical education. A field extension workerfrom a different background has difficulty in understanding their attitudes and in gettingthem to accept modern ideas and improved practices in agriculture and rural living. tittle success has been achieved. to date in organizing an effective extensionservice for nomadic peoples. Some effort has been made in Egypt and other countries toeliminate the problem by settling these people on irrigated lands but few people have yetbeen settled.The French government initiated a system of service centers in North Africabefore these countries achieved independence. Since the desert economy was based onlivestock, centers were established at watering places frequented by nomads.Veterinaryservices were first established followed by attempts to improve grazing practices andproduction of fodder for supplementary feeding.This was a pioneer effort aimed towardfitting the organization of agricultural services to the desert environment. Density or sparcity of population as a factor affecting extension organizationis not limited to desert areas. In densely populated areas of India, Egypt, Indonesiaand other countries, sheer numbers of people magnify the problems of social and economicchange.Individual contact of all these people by the field extension worker is virtuallyimpossible.In such situations the role of the extension worker becomes largely one oforganizing people for group action in their own behalf and the training of lay leaders indeveloping and carrying out educational and action programs. Size of a country as well as number of rural population affects the type ofextension organization required. As a voluntary educational system, extension work mustrelate to local situations and problems.It is essential that field extension staff shalllive in the community where they work.Technical support and supervisory staff must bereadily available to assist local personnel with technical and administrative matters.In a small country, such supporting staff may be located in the capital city or nearbyreaearch station. In larger countries, the service must be more decentralized with greaterlocal autonomy in the development and operation of the program. This is usually accomplishedby establishing regional provincial or district extension offices staffed with programleaders, technical specialists and supervisors with a considerable degree of autonomy. Itis essential in this system of organization to arrange for close communication betweenthe central administration and the several regional or district office in order to havecoordinated programa and policies. In Peru and some other countries, the daily use of twoway radio contributes greatly, to coordination and effective communication. -29- Climate can affect extension organization and program. In northern latitudes,farm operations are restricted during the cold winter months. This is a season when farmers have more time to read, plan and participate in community activities.The alertextension worker takes advantage of this opportunity for group activities including program planning, group discussions and various other educational events that would not be wellattended while farmers are working in their fields. The summer program, on the other hand may consist largely of farm contacts, field demonstrations and the like.Rainy and dry seasons may have a corresponding influence in tropical countries.School vacation periods often correspond with periods of intensive farm activity in rural areas. School teachers, especially those teaching agriculture and home economics,are sometimes employed as field extension workers during such periods. Others serve as lay leaders of rural youth group. In Switzerland, vocational agriculture teachers havemajor responsibility for extension programs while on vacation from their teaching duties.Although they do very effective educational work for short periods, this system does not provide for continuity of the extension program. To be most effective, extension programsrequire continuous direction by full time personnel throughout the year. Economic Factors - Much has been said and written about the needs of ruralcommunities in developing countries. These needs include basic education, sanitation,health facilities, nutrition education, better communication facilities and many others.These improvements must be included in any long rang, program of rural development. But the hard fact cannot be ignored that these improvements cost money as well as humaningenuity and effort. On a long-term basis, improved levels of living in rural communitiescan be achieved and maintained only through increased productivity and generation ofcapital.Public funds available from other sources can start a cycle of increased productivityand increased capital accumulation but the rural community cannot remain eternallydependent upon outside help. Countries vary in financial resources but few governmentshave sufficient resources to provide all the public institutions and services desired.This limitation is a very important factor to be considered in extension organization and administration. The basis of economic growth in most countries is its natural resources, usually agriculture. Therefore, the development of increasing social services is dependentto a high degree upon the improvement of agricultural productivity. This should be keptin mind by governments when allotting funds for agricultural extension services.Economic factors affect the internal organization of the extension service 8Bwell as its relationship with rural people and public and private institutions and services.Financial limitations force extension administrators to organize their services on anextensive rather than intensive basis. To the degree that this forces extension to workthrough and with organized groups and to train and use lay leaders, this is desirable.However, a basic cadre of field personnel and supporting staff is required to develop andcarry out an effective program, even with the most efficient use of personnel and otherresources.If funds are not sufficient to provide this minimum organization, the extensionadministrator. is faced with a decision as to how best to use his limited resources to achievesome impact upon rural communities. He has several alternatives. First he may spread hislimited resources of personnel over the entire country in the hope that the few individualscontacted will influence others to follow their example. This policy has proven ineffectiveas it has resulted in very little change in levels of production or living in the communityas a whole over a period of time. Contacts are too sparse and infrequent and too littleattention can be given by the field extension worker to the follow-up of practices demonstrated.A second alternative is to concentrate the expenditure of resources in the areasmost likely to show results; for example, the best agricultural areas or the areas ofgreatest density of population where more people can be contacted at less cost. Thispolicy usually results in greater increases in production and income for the area servedand can be justified when food production must be increased at all costs to avoid famine.This policy was followed in Greece following their civil war.However, in normal times,' -30- the extension service should have for its objective improvement of the well-being of allrural people.Very often the majority of rural people live on less productive land such asmountainous or hilly areas. A service confined to farm families on the more productiveland fails to accomplish this purpose and may lead to dissatisfaction and political unrest. A third alternative is to limit the scope of the educational program to a fewChanges in agricultural or living practices considered of highest priority. For example,increasing rice yields or improving milk quality. This policy has the advantage of apossibility of immediate impact with appreciable results. But few practices in themselvescan assure a higher level of living for the population. Increased rice production requiresmarkets at fair prices if income is to be increases.,Rice diets need protein supplementsto provide better nutrition. Sanitary milk production requires equipment an well as a priceincentive to encourage producers to improve theirproduct.Although it is well toconcentrate on high priority problems and projects,related problems can often slow downor prevent the accomplishment of expectedresults.In any case an organizational systemwhich provides only for improvement of one or two aspects of agriculture gives no assurancethat the increased income will result in better living in the community. It may be used tobuy luxuries while children die of nutritional diseases. Another organizational alternative has been followed with some success where funds andtrained personnel were too limited to allow staffing of a nation-wide organization in thebeginning.It is really a combination of intensive and extensive service. Adequately staffedand supported extension service units are established in a limited number of areas wheresentiment is favorable and there is good possibility of achieving substantial results. Aneducational program is developed with maxium involvement of local leaders and contributionof local resources. These units are useful as training centers for additional personnelas they become available and as laboratories for use in discovering effective methods andprocedures.With sucoess in accomplishing goals and satisfying the needs of the community,people of other areas become interested. Their interest is aroused further by establishingdemostration projects on a limited scale in these areas and showing these people how thoseof the original areas have progressed. Demand for extension services thus develops but isresponded to only on the basis of maxium contributions of the communities themselves. Pewgovernments can resist popular demand for extension services by large segments of the ruralpopulation, especially when the people themselves are willing to ahare in the costs. In thismanner there can be a healthy growth of the extension service based upon sound principlesof self-help and government assistance at minimum cost to the public* Type of farming has an important bearing upon extension organization. Types rangefrom shifting cultivation and subsistence farming through small holders, general farms,specialized farms and ranches, estate farming, cooperative farms, to corporate farms.Relationships between people and the extension service vary in each situation. The extensionadministrator and his staff have the task of organizing the service in such a manner as toprovide the best possible environment for progress through education. Subsistance farminginvolves activities of all family members, official and informal community leaders, religiousleaders, and possibly money lenders, buyers of products of the community and many others. Tothe extent that their services are available, schools and health services are involved. Itis the goal of extension organization to maximize cooperation among and with progressiveforces in the community and minimize friction with traditional elements. This can be donein at least two ways: first by providing for involvement of all affected interests in thedevelopment execution of programs and secondly by providing for research and training ofextension personnel in dealing with such divergent groups*Small holders and general farms involve many of the same relationship problemsas subsistence farms but in addition these rural families are involved in credit programs,cooperative societies, primary and secondary schools, marketing organizations and otherinstitutions and services. Extension's relation to these agencies become increasinglyimportant.Here it is desirable that responsibilities and functions of agencies be delineatedand basis of cooperation established at the national level. This may involve formalliaison arrangements and provision for cooperation of agency personnel on rural development - 31 - programs at the local level. Estate farming and corporate farming give rise to special problems in extension organization.Management of an estate is frequently in the hands of a hired manager whosegoal is to show maximum profit to the owners. He feels obliged to reduce costs of operation and often keeps wages at a minimum. How can an extension service serve the interests ofthe majority of rural people without opposing the estate manager? This problem has neverbeen completely solved but action has been taken in two directions.In some South American countries, farm managers have formed associations andhire their own highly trained technical specialists to advise them in farm operation with or without government subsidy. Since their enterprise is usually highly specialized, themanagers feel that the field personnel of the extension service are not well enough trained to solve their problems. The official extension service of the ministry of agriculture finds itself dealing mainly with small farmers. Workers on large estates receive little educationalassistance aside from widely scattered programs for women and youth. These programs deallargely with gardening, handcraft for supplemental income, family nutrition and child care.The basic economic problems of farm workers are rarely touched upon.A longer term approach to the educational needs of all the rural people is toinvolve land owners, managers, small farmers and hired laborers in consideration of theeconomic and social needs of the whole community; to show the owners and managers that itis in their own long-term interest to raise the level of living of the, entire community,and develop\u00b0educational programs combined with legislative and political action to achieve this goal.Agrarian reform is usually needed to make such programs effective. Unfortunately, up to this time little more than lip service has been paid to agrarian reform in many countries facing this problem. Availability and types of farm supply and marketing services affect extension organization.Modern and progressive agriculture requires such requisites of production, as improved seeds, fertilizers, tools, machinery and equipment, pesticides, herbicides and the like. Without markets for agricultural products at fairprices there is no incentive for production, except for locally consumed products. In most economically advanced countries requisites of production are supplied commercially, either through private enterprise or cooperative associations. Commercial agencies are highly competitive among themselves and with cooperative associations. This results in reasonable costs to the farmer. In addition, commercial firms and cooperativeassociations are furnishing increasing amounts of technical advice. Seed companies, dealers in fertilizers and farm machinery often employ highly trained field men to assist theircustomers in the proper use of their product and advise them on related problems. Vegetable and fruit canneries, sugar, coffee, tea and other processors of food and fibre products oftencontract with producers for certain grades and quantities of products.They also provide technically trained specialists who advise producers on details Of planting, fertilization,harvesting and other practices involved in the production of a desired quality of product. Although this system is commonly employed in economically advanced countries, production ofcoffee, tea, sugar, rubber, cotton and other export products has long been carried on under this system in former colonies of metropolitan powers.A third type of commercial advisoryassistance is provided by commercial farm management and consultant services, particularly to absentee landlords. The extension administrator must take into account the existence of such services in organizing and operating the official extension service.Resistance to the efforts of commercial extension advisors as infringement ofextension responsibilities has been a frequent reaction of extension personnel. They say that agents of commercial organizations are motivated only by profit for themselves andthat their advice may not be reliable. On the other hand, commercial representatives say that the advice of the extension agent is too general and does not take into account the detailed knowledge of specialized crop production which the commercial agent can supply. Then too, the commercial agent, having responsibility only for his customers, as opposed -32 to farmers in general, feels that he can provide more intensive service, Rural people need more technical help than most extension services can provide.Lay leaders with a minimum of technical knowledge and skill are few, especially in leas.economically advanced countries. The reservoir of technical knowledge and energy availablefrom commercial sources should be used to the greatest extent possible.Three elements areneeded to assure effective use of these services: (1) Confidence of farmers and extensionworkers in the reliability and good intensions of commercial advisors.(2)Cooperativeattitudes on the part of both commercial and extension agents, and (3)An official policyof mutual cooperation on programs contributing to rural and agricultural development. Confidence of farmers and extension workers alike in the reliability of advicefrom commercial agents will be increased if these agents are allowed to participate withextension agents in technical training conference where new research and advanced techniquesare discussed. When both parties have access to the same information there is less likelihoodof conflicting advice to farmers. Joint participation in extension training conferenceswill also contribute to the development of a desire for cooperation on both sides. Perhaps the most effective instrument for establishing active cooperation and goodwill is the involvement of commercial agents with other leaders in the planning of extensioneducational programs. These agents have much to contribute in their own field of activity,and as citizens of the community their active support of other projects can be most helpful.In supporting such activities they are building good will for their product. At this point a word_of caution is necessary. An extension agentmust show nofavoritism toward one company or one brand of a product. If one product has given betterresults than another he should confine his staments in this regard to established factsand let the buyer decide whioh is better for his use. The economic resources and progressive forces available from commercial sourcesshould not be resisted or ignored by extension personnel. Such agencies have been largelyresponsible for the rapid and widespread use fo hybrid seed, fertilizers, herbicide andinsecticide in the United States and other advanced countries. Many of these firms operateinternationally. Ministries of agriculture should take into account the potential contributionof these firms to agricultural development and establish a system for effective cooperation. National policy established in broad outline the organization of extension services.As previously stated, this policy statement or legislation should define the aims, objectivesand scope of activities of the extension service thus affecting internal organization. TheSmithLever Act of 1914 not only stated the purposes of Cooperative Extension Work in theUnited States but provided that the services should be administered by the states and thatdemostration agents should serve rural people in each county. But aside from extensionorganization other national policies affect extension work.If the proposition is accepted that the ultimate objective of extension servicesis continuing improvement in the wellbeing of rural people, then any national policy affectingthese people affects the extension service. Extension education is not an end in itself butone of many means of accomplishing this purpose.National food policy is of overriding importance to rural people in most countries.A very large share of extension responsibility is in this areas. The extension educationalprogramis expected to result in constantly increasing food production. National food policydetermines the favorable or unfavorable economic environment for the accomplishment of thispurpose.Government policy in respect to prices of agricultural products, is an importantelement of this environment. There must be an incentive before farmers will adopt practicesdesignedto increase production. This has been a serious handicap in many countries.Allocation of national resources is another area of utmost importance. One country in North -33- Africa, having capability of producing most of its food requirements ie presentlyimporting about onethird of its food supplies because national resources are funneled into industrial and military development while agriculture is handicapped by a lack offertilizer, machinery and equipment. Allocation of the use of foreign exchange, importand export restrictions, tax system, efficiency of transportation, land tenure system and many other conditions affect agricultural production and the effectiveness of extension education. Political factors are seldom mentioned in relation to extension education.Extension is designed to serve all the people, regardless of political affiliation, and for this reason extension workers should not become involved in partisan politics. Political stability is necessary for continuity of extension education programs.Education is a long- term activity and it suffers when interruptions are frequent and prolonged. Changes ingovernment administration, whether brought about through normal democratic processes or revolution, frequently result in complete changes in organization and personnel. In suchoases,. the extension service may, in effect, start afresh with inexperienced personnel, new policies and possible redirection of program. This may be good to the extent that the newadministration is more effective than the old but too often the main results are loss oftrained and experienced personnel, loss of confidence by the people in the ability ofextension to follow through on its commitments and loss of time in bringing about neededimprovements in production and rural living. Most economically advanced countries have greatly improved on this situation bypassing legislation establishing a continuing civil service and placing most governmentpersonnel under its jurisdiction. Employees are given tenure assuring job security withchanging political administrations. All employees except top policy officials and their assistants are included. Policy officials are excluded to allow the new administrationto put its own policies into effect according to its commitments upon assuming authority. Inclusion in a civil service system helps give continuity to extension programs and results in greatly improved morale of extension personnel. Civic organization and administration must be taken into account in organizingan extension service and conducting an educational program. Extension education is basedupon the assumption that rural people have the ability to act individually and collectively to develop and carry out programs for their own benefit.Authority for and experience in local selfgovernment greatly facilitates this process.For example, the authority to tax themselves to finance local institutions and programs allows communities to progress as fastas their resources permit without waiting upon the generosity of a benevolent central government.Furthermore, locally financed administration is often less costly and more efficient then central government administration because it is carried out under the watchful eyes of the tax payers. However, in many countries, people in local communitiesare subject to authorities appointed by the central government, have no public funds exceptthose allotted by that governmentr and have little knowledge of or experience in the operation of selfdetermined programs. This situation is common in a number of former colonies butexists also in countries ruled by small privileged minorities or dictatorial' groups. Nevertheless, it is the aim of most governments, if not the established fact, to develop anincreasing degree of participation of communities in local selfgovernment.Assisting rural people to develop and carry out programs for their own benefitis the very essence of extension education. Participation of local people in extensionprogram development and execution affords invaluable training in decision making and in the processes of effective local government. The experience of a district in Kenya before independece provides a vivid example. The Eqropean district agricultural officer wasresponsible for agricultural development consisting mainly of tea and coffee production. He had organized a large number of cooperative associations to process and market the product. However, in an effort to assure efficient operation of the association he made all of the decisions himself. The directors of the association approved all these decisions without -34 question.At about this time Great Britain announced that Kenya would be grantedindependence in the near future. The agricultural officer sudderk realized thatshould he leave the country the cooperative associations were likely to fail as theirdirectors had no experience in management of their association's business. He decidedto begin at once in turning over to the directors responsibility for all decisions. Herefused from that day to make these decisions himself. At first the directors werebewildered.They had always depended upon the agricultural officer to make their decisionsfor them.The business of the organizations came almost to a halt. Finally a few directorsbegan timidly to suggest action that should be taken. When the agricultural officer thoughtthe suggestions were good he encouraged them. When they were considered inappropriate heraised questions. Guadually, the directors became increasingly- active in discussingalternatives and suggesting action until they gained full control of their associations.At this stage the agricultural officer made this significant statement. \"When Kenya gainsherindependence there will be a cadre of more than 200 directors of cooperative associationsin this district with decision making experience who can provide civic leadership for localgovernment.\"This is a type of extension work that can make a significant contribution toeffective local government in many developing countries. The Place of Extension in the Organizational Structure of Government The place of extension in the organizational structure of government is a criticalfactor in determining its relationship with other governmental services and institutions.Three general types of organization may be identifies. The first and most common is placementof the extension service directly within the Ministry of Agriculture, although its directororadministrator may report to a superior at varying levels in the administrative structurein different countries. The Extension Service in the United States of America is acooperative service administered in each state by the official \"Land-Grant\" University andwith a memorandum of understanding defining relationships with the Department ofAgriculture.The Congress of the United States appropriates funds to the various states to defray a partof the costs of the service, provided the states submit acceptable annual plans of work andreports of accomplishment. AsmallFederalExtension Service, in the Department ofAgricultureadministers the allocation of funds, coordinates the program on a national scaleand provides a certain amount of technical leadership. The system in Scotland is alsoadministered by universities and financed largely by parliament. A third system is employed in Denmark and has been followed with variations insome other countries. Here local extension services are sponsored and directed by farmorganizations with re mbursement of much of the cost by the national government. Littleor no control is exercised by the national government.Each of the latter two systems is peculiarly adapted to the situation in which itwas established. The Cooperative Extension Service in the United States brings togetherin each state the administration of extension. research and university teaching underone administrative authority, the Land-Grant University. All three functions benefitfrom federal appropriation throughtheDepartment of Agriculture, thus a degree of coordinationcan be localized to fit conditions in each state and research findings of the state andnational research agencies are available to all state extension services on an equal basis.,A.possible weakness in this structure is difficulty in enforcing the execution of nationalpolicy.In fact, no enforcement is attempted. The national administration in theDepartment of Agriculture endeavors to get its policies carried out on their merits andthrough the strength of leadership of the national staff. Most officials and technicalspecialists of the Federal Extension Service have come up through the rankr of the Land-Grantliniversities-andhave.excellent,relationshps with-these institutions.- The sameis true of many other agencies of the Department of Agriculture. The farmer-controlledextension system in Denmark km a distinct advantage in being close to the people. Farmersconsider it \"their\" service, as it is. Much practical experimentation is also carried on - 35 by the farmers association thus bringing practical research and extension together on technical problems which continue to arise.A weakness of this system is a lack of coordination of the programs of the various associations, and a lack of effective relation- ship with national agricultural teaching and research intitutions.Since \"Land-Grant\" types of universities do not yet exist in most countries and since farm organizations are not usually qualified to administer extension and research programs. most governments find it logical to maintain their extension services. as c,-..f!ncies of their ministries of agriculture.* But where in the organizational structure of the Ministry of Agriculture should an extension service be placed? Several elements should be considered. Chief among these are (1) the role of the Extension Service as educational arm of the Ministry of Agriculture (if such is the policy), (2) involvement of the extension administrator in top policy formation, (3) two-way liaison with agricultural research agencies, and (4) whole- some working relations with all other agencies of the ministry concerned with agricultural and rural progress. The role of the extension service as the educational arm of the Ministry of Agriculture is particularly appropriate as the extension service, through its field organization, is in close touch with all rural people. Extension field personnel who have properly established themselves in the communities enjoy the confidence of the people they serve.They are in the best position to interpret research findings to the people and to explain national agricultural policies.However, the axtension service should not be expected or allowed to disseminate partisan political propaganda.Envolvement of the extension administrator in top. policy formation requires that his position be on a level parallel with other agencies whose directors are involved in policy consideration. Liaison with agricultural research suggests the need for close association of research and extension specialists concerned with the same subject field. In this connection it is most desirable that specialists in researchand extension have equivalent levels of technical training so they may meet as equals, each contributing to the solution of problems faced by farmers. Although each should have his well defined primary function and responsibility, cooperation in field extension activities and in the planning of research to solve practical problems should be encouraged. This can be done by including those functions in the job descriptions of both research and extension specialist.Here we must face the fact that at present research specialists usually have a higher level of technical training than extension specialists.On the other hand, extension specialists who work more with people are, or should be, better qualified in human relations. The latter is usually the more difficult task and requires broader training.This competence should be respected by the research specialist.Wholesome working relations with other agencies concerned with agricultural and rural progress may be achieved first by establishing the positions of their administrators on the same level, secondly by grouping related services to rural people under a single director - general, and finally recognizing the educational role of the extension service and requiring consultation with extension on educational aspects of other agency programs.For example aDepartment of Science and Education may include the Extension Service, Agricultural Library, and Agricultural Research Services.A department of Development and Conservation. may include a Forest Service, Soil ConservationServioel Rural Electrification and other similar programs. A third category may involve regulatory agencies. The number and arrangement of such departments will depend upon scopeof activity in the ministry program and the size of staff.*However, the Government of India is presently establishing a \"Land-Grant\" type of University in each state with United States' assistance. -36- The Relationship of Extension to Agricultural Teaching and the Technical Departmentsof the Ministry of AgricultureTeaching of Agriculture in schools and colleges, and agricultural researchand experimentation are probably the two fields of activity with closest relationshipto extension education. Obviously extension is dependent upon research for technicalinformation to be interpreted and applied in the solution of agricultural problems.EXtension personnel require technical training in agricultural science available onlyfrom agricultural echools and colleges. But the relationship goes deeper than this.A mutuality of interest does or should exist among practioners of all three functions. In most developing countries, few young people from the farms and villageshave the opportunity for secondary education qualifying them for matriculation in technicalschools and universities. Consequently, most candidates for jobs in extension, agriculturalteaching and the technical departments of ministries of agriculture lack rural background,common agricultural skills and understanding of rural people. All they know of suchmatters is what they have learned in school, But they in turn, become the teachers andtechnicians, further widening the gap between technical knowledge and its practical application on the farms and in the villages.At least two lines of action to remedy this situation are apparent. Both shouldbe taken concurrently. The first is to provide greater opportunity for rural youthto obtain higher education and the second is to relate higher agricultural education moreclosely to the job requirements of the graduate. Extension is more immediately concernedwith this latter approach. Training of extension personnel is discussed in detail inChapter 14.Relationships between extension and resident teaching need only be emphasizedat this point.Extension can give valuable assistance to faculties of agriculture in at leastthree areas;curriculum planning, course content, and practical field training, notto mention inductive methods of teaching.Present curricula tend to emphasize theoretical training in basic sciences andtechnical agriculture. These are important for the potential extension worker as well asfor agricultural technicians in other fields. But the extension worker needs somethingmore.His main concerns are rural people and their problems. This involves such thingsas training in human relations, methods of informal teaching, decision making and theapplication of technical information in solving problems. The technical training of extensionfield personnel must be broad in order that he may deal not only with production but withall of the economic and social problems encountered by the villager.Since many prospectiveextension workers have little practical experience, instruction should include specialemphasis on the common farm and home skills required for the application of modern farmingand homemaking techniques.Experienced extension personnel can not only assist faculties in developingeffective curricula and course content for prospective extension workers but can providesome of the practical field training required. It is common practice in many advancedcountries to assign advanced students in agriculture and home economics to jobs asapprentices or assistants to field extension workers during vacation periods. This notonly provides needed practical training but may arouse interest in extension work as acareer and desire to serve rural people.All technical departments of ministries of agriculture have contacts with thepublic and require the dissemination of information to rural people.This type ofactivity can be considered educational if it is.factual and is of interest to the peopleconcerned.Insect and disease control programs require the active cooperation of farmers - 37 - and villagers. Other ministry of agriculture activities such as collection of statistics, enforcement of quarantine regulation and surveys in preparation for irrigation and drainage projects require varying degrees of understanding and cooperation of rural people if they are to succeed. There is a natural tendency for directors of such programs and projects to proceed with little attention to the reaction of the people involved.This can result in suspicion, resentment and even the defeat of the project. Education is a key to acceptance and cooperation in projects which are beneficial and soundly conceived.It may be advisable to delay initiation of a project until people are convinced of its need.Extension workers are trained in presenting unbiased facts and in organizing support for programs acceptable to the people. Rural people are more likely to accept as valid information from an extension worker who lives and works among them than from a stranger.In one instance with which the writer is familiar, government veterinarians issued an order that all cattle in an area should be tuberculin tested and infected animals slaughtered.This was One step in an area program to eliminate tuberculosis in cattle as a human health hazard. A few farmers accepted the testing as a government order but others offered violent resistance. The program would fail if any animals in the area remained untested.The veterinarians then requested the help of the extension agent.The agent discussed the merits of the program with rural leaders and with their help arranged educational meetings with farmers in each locality. When the farmers learned that they would receive indemnity for any animals slaughtered and saw the long -term benefits of eradication of the disease, they not only agreed to the testing but arranged to have their animals confined and ready when the veterinarian arrived.Advance planning with the etension servicean smooth the operation of many activities of technical departments. We must emphasize advance planning. An extension agent plans his educational program well in advance of execution. If he knows he will be called upon to assist technical departments with educational aspects of their work he can include these activities in his program much more effectively.The director of the extension service can contribute to good working relations with technical departments by keeping in touch with their operations, checking periodically to see if there are projects planned where educational asistance is desired and relaying this information to this staff. Alternatively, this responsibility may be assigned to program leaders or specialists whose work is most closely related to the particular department.liaisonbetweenExperimental Stations and Extension Services LiClose and constant liaison between research and extension activities must be regarded as being of basic importance to agricultural programs.Failure to create such liaison can be seen to be a major factor in the failure of pilot activities to expand their results beyond their borders.It is perhaps most realistic to assume. that such liaison must first be achieved at a national level before very useful liaison can be expected at an inter country level.For the purpose of this paper greatest emphasis will be given to measures for strengthening the links between each national extension service and the experimental station and pilot demonstration project presently operating or to be started in each of the countries concerned. The exact form these links take in our projects can be of paramount importance for it is our example that may well influence the entire pattern of liaison between the government department or research and extension in the future. In the past the fact has frequently been overlooked that each experimental and pilot demonstration project started in a country serves as a demonstration in the institutional field as well as in the technical field. G.C. ClarkFAO Regional Agricultural Education and Extension Officer, Bangkok - 38 - Importance to Research - By establishing good liaison links with the extension service,an experiment station can make sure that it is investigating problems of immediate importanceto the farmer. This can go a long way to insure continued and adequate financial supportfrom the government.In addition, a close link with the extension service is necessary to insure that thepromising experimental results receive adequate field testing under normal farming condi-tions.In the present projects most of the field or local adaptability trials areconducted by project staff on the pilot demonstration land surrounding each experimentalstation.Even with this arrangement, the cooperation and assistance of the extensionservicelts necessary if field trials are also to be conducted on soils of different typesand under different circumstances than those found within the pilot project demonstrationarea.It perhaps goes without saying that the more the extension staff can be involved inthe final field testing of any recommended practice, the greater will be their interest inextending that practice to the farmers. The apparent failure of extension services tosuccessfully extend the results of many irrigation plot projects must surely be shared bythe research departments because of their failure to involve extension in the projects fromthe outset.Importance to Extension - An extension service needs close and continuous liaison withthe nation's experimental stations in order to keep its field staff up to date with latestrecommended practices. In addition, such liaison can go a long way to insure that allrecommendations have been adequately tested from the economic and social points of view,Both factors are of the greatest importance to an extension service if it is to earn andkeep a good reputation with the farmer. Furthermore, an extension service must have achannel through which the problems of the farmers, particularly those farmers distant froman experimental station, may be brought to the attention of the research workers. Finally,it is exceedingly difficult for an extension service to suddenly assume responsibility forthe multiplication of the results of a project in which it has not been involved and forwhich it has had little or no previous responsibility. Only through close liaison andinvolvement from the start will extension have adequately trained personnel and besufficiently well organized to expand the results beyond the pilot area to a significantnumber of farmers.Importance to the Farmer Perhaps it is not out of place to mention here that it isthe farmer who can benefit most from close and continuous liaison between research andextension.Conversely the farmers form that segment of the population which suffers mostwhen liaison is inadequate. Too frequently the problem is seen only in term of itsstilting effect on the experimental station or the extension service when in fact it isthe farmer who is being made to bear, once again, the cost of others' mistakes. Deliberate efforts need to be made from the start of a project to insure close andcontinuous liaison between research and extension. Unfortunately it does not \"just happen\"as a byproduct resulting from the efficient operation of a project. Definite organizationaland administrative arrangements need to be built into any project of this type. This maynot be no readily recognized at the start of a project, where because of its smallness insize, apparently adequate liaison can be achieved on a personal basis. While under ideal conditions of compatibility of staff, both national and international,such informal liaison may be easier, it is found to be inadequate when the project movesbeyond its pilot stage. In other words we need to devise from the first a system of closeliaison which is suitable for institutionalizing on a national and if possible an intercountry level. The following organizational and administrative measures may be taken to establishand strengthen close and continuous liaison: -39 Appointment of Extension Training Specialist - Perhaps one of the simplest yet most effective measures which can be taken to increase close and continuous liaison between the experimental and the extension aspects of a project is by establiahing a post for an extension training specialist. This expert and his counterpart should be attached to the national agricultural extension service but be located, at the project site.The job of the expert would be two-fold:First in cooperation with the project subject matter specialists to collect the proven practices and prepare simple manuals, bulletins, leaflets and other visual aids for use in in-service training of extension staff and for inducing farmers to adopt the new recommended practices.Second to organize systematic and periodic in-service training courses for all extension staff in how and what to extend to the farmers. An importan'.; part of his training program would be to teach the extension staff how to utilize the project for farmer training. Unless definite steps are taken in a project during its period of operation to actively involve the national extension service personnel, the results of the project are frequently not multiplied throughout the country and the project remains as an island' of development in a sea of need.Experience in many countries indicates that no other single post has such widespread and beneficial effect upon the medium and long-term success of a project of this nature.Anpointment of Subject Matter Extension Specialists - For countries having reached a stage of agricultural development where greater specialization amongst staff may be con- sidered desirable and where there is a need for giving special emphasis to certain crops or improved practices, the creation of extension specialists for specific subjects has proven to be a useful measure for strengthening liaison between research and extension.A subject matter extension specialist is responsible for keeping up to date on research development in his field of specialization, for the preparation of suitable training and extension materials on his subject and for training field extension staff in the latest techniques and recommended practices in his field of specialization. While administratively he should be part of the national extension service, he is best officed with the project research staff in order to facilitate the necessary close and continuous liaison. Periodic anhanpm ofInformatiall -There are several suitable methods for exchanging information.Experimental stations may want to take the initiative to organize periodic visits of extension staff to their stations. Such visits should be sell planned in order to tench the extension staff the latest in the various subject matter fields covered by an experimental station. Officers responsible for pilot demonstration projects should also request the extension services to bring in selected farmers to see the result demonstrations. Further, the wide distribution of an information news sheet to all extension personnel, in an appropriate language outlining recent happenings and result, achieved on a station, could also serve to strengthen liaison through increased under- standing.In addition such a publication can provide publicity material for distribution to national news agencies, and senior government officials. The task of producing and distributing this news sheet by an experiment station could be lessened and liaison with the extension service greatly strengthened if the news sheet could be produced.juintly with the extension service. In this case it would include news from both research and extension.An exchange of such information on an inter-country basis would also be useful provided it could be issued simultaneously in all languages involved.Summary and Conclusions - Both the desirability and the necessity for close and continous liaison between experimental staions and pilot demonstration projects on the one hand and national extension services on the other, needs to be fully recognized by govern ments and technical assistance agencies alike. It is the farmers who suffer most when inadequate liaison is established between research and extension.Suggested measures to promote the necessary liaison include: (1) Creation'of joint research and extension coordination committees; (2) Appointment of extension training specialists for each project; (3) Appointment of subject matter extension specialists; and - 40 - (4) Periodic exchange of information through organized study tours and distribution ofinformation news Sheets.Frequently, national extension services are poorly orgsnized and understaffed. Toby -pass them and set up separate but parallel extension units for each project serves onlyto further weaken their organization and make them that much less capable of successfullydisseminating the results of the projects following their completion. The initiative,therefore, to establish and strengthen a close and continuous liaison between research andextension may initially have to come from the experimental farm and pilot demonstrationprojects themselves, as they are most aware of its vital importance to their own ultimatesuccess.The Relationship of Extension to Rural Elementary and Secondary Teaching Two broad types of education are essential to economic development in agriculture aswell as in industry. These are general education, usullly conducted on a formal basisthrough schools, and technical and vocational training which may be acquired in a varietyof ways ranging from individual unsupervised study to highly specialized training inuniversities and colleges.Since a very large percentage of children in the less-developed countries receive noformal schooling and many others are limited to three to five years, great emphasis hasrecently been placed on the practical aspects of rural education. It is felt not onlythat elementary training in rural communities should involve examples taken from the every-day life of the student, but in addition, that he should be impressed with the dignity andimportance of agriculture and its potential opportunities as a life work. In someinstances, vocational training in the skills and knowledge such as gardening, simple shopwork and weaving, which the student can use in his own community, are emphasized almost tothe point of exclusion of more conventional courses. This approach has been criticizedby some eancators who charge that it does not train the pupil properly to assume hieresponsibilities as a citizen of the community, that it ties the pupil to his environmentand does not allow him to prepare adequately for higher education, thus closing the door tohis entry into other professions for which he might be better fitted temperamentally andintellectually. \"But extreme emphasis on practical education is not the point of thosewho have complained that rural schools have been essentially copies of urban schools.Their point is that by tending to neglect the importance of farming and good use of land,schooling has encouraged an undermining of agricultural efficiency in many countries.Moreover, when presented in an unrealistic way, formal instruction in rural schools hasoften been too short and not good enough to make the children literate. The rural childshould have as full and sound a basic education as the urban child, but it is contended thathe will acquire it most easily and pleasantly if the materials for his lessons are thefamiliar things of the country and farm. Each country school should feel that it is anintegral part of the rural community and that it has responsibility for, and a part to playin, agricultural progress.\" JThe importance of adequate education adapted to rural needs cannot be over-emphasizedin relation to agricultural development. The modern farmer must be able to understand theelements of many sciences in order to apply the information constantly being made availableby research workers to the solution of problems of production, processing and marketing.Basic elementary education iv essential also to the proper functioning of vocationalschools, extension or advisory services and other forms of rural adult training. Wherethe people are illiterate, those educational methods that involve the written word are notapplicable thus limiting the teacher or extension worker very largely to the spoken word andperecnal contacts, and eliminating the use of many mass methods of education and communi-cation.With the effectiveness of the extension worker thus limited, fewer farm familiescan be served per professional worker and the cost of the service is increased. 1/ Vocational Training in Agriculture, ILO, PP. 17 -18.. 41 In view of the shove, extension education is vitally affected by the extent and quality of elementary and secondary education in rural communities. Although formal instruction in schools is not a function of the field extension worker, cooperation between school teachers, local education authorities and the extension agent can be mutually beneficial. Ti's extension agent can supply teachers with simple but sound technical information related to local farm and home practice for inclusion in the course of study. Agficultural materials, such as leaflets, distributed to and discussed in schools find their way into the homes of students and may bring to the parents an awareness of opportunity for desirable change in farming or homemaking. Teachers are often the first rural leaders who are willing to assist the extension worker in introducing change.Rural youth programs such as 4H Club work often have their start in rural schools with the teacher serving as local leader.Schools often provide a nucleus for broad programs of rural development with-emphasis upon agriculture. At the national level, liaison between extension and school authorities is highly desirable. Their objectives are closely related and the establishment of a policy of cooperation can be highly bene ficial to both. Asricultural Extension in Relation to Other Rural Improvement ProgramsAs previously stated, extension education is only one, although an important one, of many community and agricultural services required for rural progress.Since each of these institutions and services has a role of its own to play it is highly important thatextension's relationship be complimentary rather than competitive. Education is essential to the effective operation of all rural improvement services and without these services extension education, in turn, is defeated in attaining its primary objective of improved living in rural areas. Cooperative Societies, usually considered an instrument of community action may also serve as an instrument of community organization for planning and implementing programs of extension education. Maly well intended extension programs have failed because resources required to carry them out were not available to the people* Such resources might include among others credit, machinery, improved seed, fertilizer, pesticides, market outlets, processing facilities etc. Where such requisites are not readily available at reasonable cost cost from commercial sources cooperative action provides the best solution. This is the most obvious contribution of cooperative societies to extension programs.But cooperative societies may also serve as an effective type of organization throughwhich rural people analyse their problems, decide what they want to do and carry out plans to accomplish objectives they themselves have adopted.This is extension program develop ment in its most practical form. Properly trained extension agents provide the professional leadership to guide this development and to coordinate the action of cooperative societies with the program of other agencies and community services.When entrusted with the possibilities of community action through cooperative societies, extension agents sometimes take too much responsibility for their operation and management. The members are usually happy to be relieved of this responsibility but this practice is selfdefeating. Not only does the extension agent find himself involved in a ftil time job and neglect his primary educational role but the members become passive and disinterested.The extension agent's task is to provide educational and organizational leadership that will make the cooperative society a selfgoverning, selfsustaining organization as quickly as possible.When it is operating effectively, the extension agents role is entirely advisory.Member education is a basic element ftr the success of cooperative societies. The extension agent can assist by bringing to the officers and members valuable technical,economic and organizational information. 42WEI Supervised Credit is a government service developed in recent years and designed tofinance rural families who cannot obtain cedit at reasonable cost from conventionalsources.Since few such families can give security in the way of land or property, loansare based upon a management program that will provide a living for the family and asurplus of income available to pay the interest and repay the principle over a period oftime.A supervisor employed by the government assists the family to plan their farmoperations and in the wise use of resources. He functions as both a financial and atechnical adviser to the family. Aside from his role as lender and collector of money,he performs a very personal type of extension education, much more intensive incharacter than can be performed by the extension agent. His objective is the same asthat of the extension worker but he works only with borrowers and has the capitalavailable to finance improved practices on the farm and improved living facilities tothe extent that the income of the family will permit. Informal education in betterfarming and living is a basic element in the successful use of supervised credit. Unlessfamily income can be increased and wisely used the loan may not be repaid and the familyis no better off than before. Experience in many countries attests to the success of thiscombination of credit And education.Few governments have the resources to provide supervised credit for all who need itand many producers are ineligible or' will not accept the required supervision. Theextension service can collaborate with the supervised credit agency to the advantage ofboth.First supervised credit provides a means of financing the improved practicesadvocated by the extension service. Secondly the extension service can guide the supervisor in recommending to his clients improved farming and living practices adapted to thefarming and living conditions of the area. Furthermore improved practices of the supervised credit clients can serve as demonstrations to convince other farmers of their value.Money management is a critical problem among rural people in all countries. Thecredit supervisor becomes an expert in this field and can assist the extension agents withmoney management problems.A variety of regulatory and administrative functions are performed by ministries ofagriculture.They include enforcement of quarantine regulation; inspection of seeds,fertilizers and nursery stock; eradication of pests, disease and preditory animals;collection of statistics; operation of marketing boards and many others. Farmers aresuspicious of activities of this nature as many of them have been punished when foundguilty of breaking the laws and regulations involved. An inspector is usually an objectof distrust and suspicion. For this reason an extension agent, whose success is basedupon the trust farmers place in him, should not be burdened with regulatory duties. Buthe does have an important role in connection therewith.Regulatory and administrative agencies perform services designed to benefit thepublic.Usually they are of long -term benefit to farm families. When rural peopleunderstand their purpose and potential benefit, they will ususally cooperate in theirenforcement.Extension personnel can help bring about this better understanding as a partof their educational program.Health Services are usually not a direct responsibility of extension service orministries of agriculture but they are of vital importance to rural people. A highpercentage of health problems are the result of improper nutrition, lack of sanitation andpoor health habits. Extension education can help serve all three of these problems. Thiscan be done by encouraging the production and consumption of foods needed in a balanceddiet, conducting campaigns for the construction of sanitary facilities on the farma and inrural communities, and by teaching better sanitary piaCtices in youth and homemaking clubs.A further contribution by extension is in helping communities organize to construct sells,water systems and sanitary facilities. -43- Veterinary services are provided through private practice in the United States and some other economically advanced countries but are a government service elsewhere. In many instances they are combined with extension work in animal husbandry and are conducted entirely separately from agricultural extension services. This frequently results in problems of coordination. Livestock production on the farm is so interdependent with crop production that education in both areas needs to btl coordinated. A broader concept of agri cultural extension including crop production, horticulturanimal husbandry and.related enterprises usually results in greater efficiency of operation and less friction. Under this system the central extension service provides support by employing specialists in each technical field and they in turn maintain liaison with their respective technical departments in the ministry of agriculture. Veterinariansare usually concerned chiefly with the control and treatment of animal disease and have little time for educational activity.Prevention of disease by environmental sanitation and proper care and feeding of animals is of equal importance. This is a proper function of the extension service.A further contribution of extension is the reporting of disease outbreaks to the proper authorities and in assisting veterinarians with educational phases of immunization campaigns.Community Development and atension Services are two official approaches to the task of rural development. Both have the same basic goal of better life and opportunity for mankind.They differ to some degree in philosophy, to a greater degree in form of organization, and especially in concentration of effort.Community development emphasizes group action in improving rural conditions. A high official of the Government of India stated that the welfare of the group superseded the welfare of any individual in their / community developmem piogram. On the other hand, extension education emphasizes decision making by the 'individual and uses cooperation and group action to accomplish what individuals cannot accomplish working alone. Community development is a more direct government approach working largely through official civic organization. EXtension education emphasizes the development and use of informal leadership in achieving rural progress.Community development emphasizes a concerted attack upon all elements of social and economic change.on the theory that progress can be achieved best through a multipurpose approach.Extension concentrates upon the development of agriculture as the economic foundation for rural progress and upon concurrent improvement in family living.Both approaches are employed in a number of countries, with friction sometimes developing.Thus working relationships become a matter of concern. In some countries community development is assigned the function of overall planning and coordination of activities in the various areas of health, agriculture, cottage industry, schools, trans portation and the like at the national or state level, and for organization for community action at the local village level. Health, agriculture, home economics, schools, cottage industry, cooperatives and other specialized institutions and agencies are expected to carry out programs conforming to the overall plan through social action processes insti gated by community development. Involvement of the executing agency representatives in the planning process is essential to their acceptance of responsibilities in executing such plans.Many failures can be traced to violation of this principle. A tendency of community development agents to carry out technical programs without the necessary technical competence can be equally disastrous. Where food production is critical, as in India and some other countries, governments have found it necessary to concentrate much of their effort and resources on food production even though community development is the official approach.This indicates the importance of agricultural extension, whether conducted in combination with community development or as the principle educational approach to rural development. In those systems where community development is to be the central coordinating agencyfor rural development, its location in the hierarchy of government determines to a con-siderabledegree its working relationships with technical and other agencies concerned withrural progress. Education, agriculture, health, labour, cottage industries, housing,irrigation and land development, transportation and many other sectors of government eachhave a contribution to make to rural development. Also each administrator is inclined tobe jealous of his authority over activities in his own area of responsibility. He isusually unwilling to accept the leadership of another administrator of his own or a lowerstatus.For these reasons, the central coordinating authority needs to be placed in theOffice of the administrative head of government.It is desirable for each technical agency of government to have the authority aniresponsibility for the development and execution of rural programs in its field and be heldaccountable for results achieved. Coordination of programs can be encouraged by mandatoryconsultation at all levels in the planning and at frequent intervals during the executionof programs.In the final analysis, organizational structure, although helpful in achieving goodworking relations, is not as important as the attitudes, competence and dedication ofpersonnel involved.Aerarien Reform and Extension Education 1/-Much has been said and more will be saidabout the need and importance of ways and means of bringing about agrarian reform. Agrarian reform is too often thought of ae land reform. Naturally, land is a basicingredient in any agricultural process. Unfortunately, too often land reform becomes an endin itself and not a means by which necessary changes are made. In fact, too many of us\"become so enthusiastically in love with the idea of land reform that we forget the past andfuture in trying to work out today's problems.The problems of redistribution of land and reforms necessary to make for maximumproduction and efficient use of land and labour have been with us throughout history.Oneof the major reasons for war has been that of acquiring more land and resources. Very fewnations in modern times have really solved the dilemma of living within man-made nationalboundaries as populations increase.Redistribution of land is only one of a series of reforms necessary to bring about abetter balance between man and the natural resources available. However, land and peopleare the most visible elements; therefore, it is easy to fall into the idea that what isneeded is a law and scheme to move people, re-allocate land by redividing and apportioningit.Immediately it becomes obvious that there is not enough land and too many people.Ofcourse this was the original problem, but in the pressure of time and with the miracle oflaws it was forgotten until the actual action of moving people started.At this point those responsible for making \"land reform\" a success became more con-cerned with executing the ideas rather than thinking of people. As the situation getsworse, leaders become frustrated and resort to the old adage that you cannot please allthe people and that most people do not know that is good for them anyway. This leads toactions by force and of course, eventually political and social changes are necessary to\"satisfy\" the people. Of such things revolutions are bornapolitidal schemes are developedand autocratic governments come into power.This has happened many times over and yet we have not found a better approach to agri-cultural reform. It is my opinion that most agrarian reform programs fail because notenough attention is given to the other most important ingredient in the agricultural pro-cesses:people.Oh, yes, the immediate reaction is that this is not true. Is not the 1/Joseph Di Franno, Extension Specialist, Food and Agriculture Organization of the UnitedNations, Rome, Ita]y. 45 whole idea to inproe the situation for the people, especially rural families? Is not ii is the m:,in foct.of the need and concern for agrarian reform? Of course it is. 3ut it is my contention that after we pass the initial stage of stating ;:hy we need reforms the people are forgotten in the pinning, ievelopnent and operation of the reform program.I think there is sufficient evidence to bear this out in the high percentage of failure.It is not my intenticn to propose reform plans.It is my intention to draw attention to the people ani how they can help in the problems that confront them as well as their political leaders. In fact, it is very obvious that before we can have agrarian reform it is necessary to have people reform. Or to say it another way, before we can bring about successful changes in agriculture we need to bring about changes in people. Professors would say it still another way:before we can bring about family and national welfare we must bring about economic, social and political changes. Of course, here again we get into a dilemma as to which one first, common sense dictates that we need changes in all aspects of human endeavour at the same time.But how do we accomplish this as the world becomes more complex with exploding population, diminishing natural resources, increasing political units and more rigid man made boundaries? One way is through science: the development of new means of production, better seeds and livestock, use of scientific techniques and skills, more attention to maintaining and conserving natural resources. Another 'way to attack the problem is through control of population: birth control and migration. Another 1.7:.7 is to redistribute the labour force by creating industrial machine to use labour to produce commodities needed by all and for developing an agricultural industry that produces more than it can use, therefore having food and fibre to trade for industrial products. Another way is to create international agreements and alliances for trade: in effect this is more than trade of material goods, but a way of bridging national boundaries that prohibit move.oent of people by exporting (trading) labour in one country for goods in another. But no matter what way, plan or approach is made, be it economic, social or political, they all involve people. And, unless a way is found to effectively involve the people, the results expected will only be temporary or will not be forthcoming.The business of involving people has and is the main responsibility and objective of extension services. This educational institution can and must play an important role in involving people in making \"reform\" programs work. It is their business to change people through educational means. If we accept the assumption that before you have economic, social, political or agrarian reforms we must have people's attitudes and opinion change, then education is an important and necessary element.Since the reform proem= deal directly with the adults, an educational organization and pro- am must be developed for them.Extension education is a process that has proven successful in meeting this challenge. In fact, in some areas of the world extension organizations are given a prominent place in developmental programs and projects. The prestige of extension in the United States is based upon the fact that it is recognized as being a contributing factor to rural reforms and agrarian successes.It is also a major means through which people are educated to the facts necessary to changing them so that they become interested to the point of involvement in the p?anning, development and executing of the economic, social, political and agrarian reforms. Thus we have a. partner ship of the masses of people working with their economic, social, political leaders to develop and execute national programs aimed at solving problems. This is done through educational processes. Extension is one of these processes. 46 Legislation nertaininp. to Agricultural Extension Services A legal basis for the extension service is essential in providing stability andcontinuity of the service. Such legal basis should be in the form of specific lawsenacted by thenational lawmaking body rather than vague references to this function inthe definition of responsibilities of the ministry of agriculture, or ministerial decreeswhich are subject to the whims of each succeeding administration. An extension servicehas little status or respect without a legal foundation. The law should define thepurpose, establish the method of operation, scope of responsibility and broad structureof the organization. In addition it should define the relationship of the service toother institutions and services and provide for continuing financing at a levelcommensurate with its responsibilities and scope of operations. The survey of legislation pertaining to extension work in 52 countries in 1962 1/indicated that about onefourth of the countries surveyed had no legal provision forextension work. Over onethird were operating under general legislation establishing theministry of agriculture and only 15 had specific laws or decrees providing a budget foroperation.Conclusions of this study suggested the inclusions of the following points as beingof major importance in any extension law: 1.Provide for educational programs for the whole family i.e. man,women and youth. 2.Provide for separation of edwational and training work from enforcementof regulatory acts such as plant and animal quarantine, seed, feed andfertilir,er quality inspection or distribution. 3.Provide for freedom from political involvement. 4.Provide for close affiliation and working relations with the researchprograms of the agricultural experiment stations and the teaching andtraining programs of the college of agriculture or agricultural institutes. 5.Provide for assurance or quarantine of financial support from year to yearand for the future. 6.Provide for regional or zonal organization geared to the needs of thevariour areas. 7.Provide for advisory and planning groups to adapt programs to needs of thepeople and existing conditions in the area. This also involves local andregional people in the extension programs and develops and trains local andregional leadership. 8.Provide for local and regional participation in financing local and regionalextension programs. Sound legislation and adequate financial support are essential in building any publicservice and in providing it with a dedicated and well trained corps of workers. Extensionservices are no exceptions. 1.1Legislation for establishing agricultural extension work in various countries.USDA/AID 1962. The extension law in any country nu =t fit the legal structure' ancivic and social organization of that country. Hence any recommendation of a model law is of doubtful value. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind, that the enactment of a law does not automatically establish an effective extension service.It merely provides a legal foundation upon which to build the structure. The method by which it is implemented is of even greater importance.Some Common Deficiencies in Extension OrganizationDeficiencies in the organization of agricultural extension service stem primarily from six sources. 1.Lack of general understanding and appreciation of the role of extension education in rural development. 2.Failure to establish a national policy as to the scope of extension service responsibility and program. 3.Lack of continuity of extension program due to political instability andattendant changes in agricultural policy, personnel and priorities in economic development. 4.Weaknesses in the organizational structure of government which inhibit the development of cooperation between agricultural extension and other government services and institutions. 5.Failure to provide an effective balance in the allocation of limitedresources among the necessary elements of rural development such as extension education, agricultural research, credit, agrarian reform and other elements of agriculture modernization.6.Failure to provide a proper balance between technical and educational competence in the staffing of the extension service. 48 Section II EXTENSION FROGRAYS Chapter 4 rkTEiSION PROGRAXS IN AGRICULTUM Program as used here is a statement of purposes and objectives of an organizationtogether with a description of the situation, statement of problems and proposed solutions.It defines clearly the scope of activity of the organization so that all pcple affectedwill understand its purposes and objectives and their part therein. Since exteaaion isessentially an educational activity, extension programs are educational in nature and employeducational methods. As previously stated, extension is concerned with changing the knowledge,attitudes and actions of rural people through educational means. This chapter deals withsuch changes in agricultural practice.Food and clothing are basic needs of civilized man. Agriculture by providingthese elements is basic to the economy of any country. With the exception of a few countrieswith rich mineral resources, most must depend upon agriculture not only as a source of foodand fibre for consumption by its own population but to generate foreign exchange and contribute to capital formation. Individually and as a comlunity, rural people must produce asurplus of food or fibre for sale to pay for educational, health and other services and forproducts and goods noi; produced locally which are required for an acceptable standard ofliving.Extension programs in agriculture are concerned with educational aspects of agricultural development and agricultural development involves man interrelated elements. AsMosher 1/ says, \"one of the main tasks is to find ways of farming that farmers of typicalability can use effectively if only they will learn a little more and develop somewhat betterskills.\"This is a task for agricultural research, extension and policy makers, workingtogether, to accomplish. Mosher states further \"For agricultural development to occur,the knowledge and skill of farmers must keep increasing and changing. As farmers adopt moreand more new methods, their ideas change. They develop a new and different attitude towardagriculture, toward the natural world that surrounds them, and toward themselves. Theirearly successes in increaang production increase their selfconfidence. Their increasingcontacts and transactions with merchants and- government agencies draw them into closeracquaintance with the world beyond their villazes... They increasingly become citizens, fullmembers of the nation.\" This ia a basic purpose of agricultural extension in its truestsense.Agriculture Involves Men, Women, Youth and VillagersAgriculture is still a family enterprise in most areas of the world. 4lomen Pndyouth not only perform much of the labor involved but help decide what shall be grown aadhow.Women Jo much of the marketing and purchasing for the farm and family. In moreadvanced societies, women often keep the records and have a voice in decisions involvingexpenditures.Needs and wants of the family have high priority in the use of the availablefunds, often coming ahead of production expenditures. In traditional societies fewchanges in farming practice can be made without the concurrence of the family and in somecases, the whole social group must concur. Young people are less conservative than theirelders and hence are more likely to experiment. With education they become successfulinnovators.Many improved farm practices are accepted and tested by young people throughyouth clubs and when proven successful they may be adopted by their elders. Some earlyexperiments with farmer training centers in Kenya failed to bring about the adoptionof the improved practices taught, becouse wives and children of the returning trainees ridiculed such newfangled ideas. But when women were later included in the training programthey adopted the new practices with considerable enthusiasm. Women are traditionallyresponsible for the health and nutrition of the families and training of the children. Peoplesuffering from illness, malnutrition and parasites are physically incapable of hard farmwork and are not receptive to new ideas. Better living for rural people is the ultimate goalof extension education. Improved agricultural production is the only available means ofachieving economic aspects of that goal. J Arthur T. Mosher Getting Agriculture Moving Agricultural Development Council,New YorkIntroduction p. 10. Not only the farm family but the rural community as a whole is concerned with and should be involved in agricultural development programs; first as a source of food and fibre, secondly as a means of employment of labor and finally becouse agricultural development requires group as well as individual action. Processing and marketing of agricultural products, supply of necessary requisites of production, education of children and many other functions all have a direct bearing on production and require joint effort. For these and many other reasons, extension programs in agriculture need to involve women, youth and the rural community. A national extension program in agriculture provides the framework within which regional and local programs are developed. It provides an analysis of the problems of agricultural development, describes the areas in which education is needed and defines the scope of responsibility of the extension service in this field. Such a program not only guides extension personnel in their activities but justifies the expenditure of public funds for this purpose.The Scope ofaLEIELEILDOEMELII1--10.Nine areas of responsibility of extension services were described in Chapter 3. The first four relate directly to agriculture.These areas are: (1) agricultural production (2) marketing, distribution and utilization of farm products; (3) conservation, wise use, and development of natural resources; and (4) management on the farm and in the home. An effective extension program in agriculture will establish goals in each of these areas with due consideration of priorities. Agricultural production* is often emphasized, to the exclusion of the other three areas mentioned, in, the programs of extension services which are in early stages of develop ment.Abundant food supplies have the highest priority with people and with government. \"Make two blades of grass grow where one grew before\" was a slogan of the Cooperative Extension Service of the United States during its formative years. People and nations who have expe rienced famine are especially conscious of the need to produce a surplus of food for use in years of low production. In developing countries with 50% to 70% of the population employed in agricultural production as compared to 10% to 20% in the economically advanced countries, food shortagesare a common occurrence. Those foods which are available are usually low in protein content and variety and do not provide a balanced diet for the populace. Rural per capita income is low as a result of low productivity. The broad objectives of agricultural production programs may well include:1.Selective increases in the production of those crops and animal products neededfor adequate nutrition of the populace and a surplus to the extent it can be profitably exported. 2.Increases in production of fibre crops to the extent needed for local consumption and export at a profit. 3.Increased efficiency of production thus reducing costs in money and human effortand releasing manpower for the development of domestic industry.4.Improved quality of agricultural products to meet the demands of local and export markets. 5.Reduction of losses dne to insects, disease and spoilage. * Agricultural production as used here includes crops and, livestock production, horticulture and inland fisheries. Farm forestry ad it affects rural income is also included. Educational needs of the farmer in relation to agricultural production includetraining in the practical application of all the natural sciences, the economics of productionand distribution, cooperation with his fellow producers, and skills in a multitude of improvedfarm practices. Agricultural extension has the task of helping farmers become aware of theproduction potential of their resources, bringing them technical knowledge and helping themapply it in the solution of problems and training them in related skills. Marketindistribution and utilization of farm roducts determine to a large extentwhether they are produced at a profit or at a loss of money or at least of human effort.A national pro gram for the marketing of agricultural products is first concerned that productsshall be produced of a kind, quality and in the quantity which the market (local, domesticand foreige) will absorb at the time they are needed. The local and domestic markets willabsorb only certain quantities of various agricultural products of acceptable quality.Superior quality products of certain kinds such as vegetables and fruits will sell in largerquantities and at higher prices. Products sold abroad are in competition as to price andquality with the products of other countries and must meet certain minimum grade requirementsas well as to pass inspection on arrival as to freedom from disease and spoilage. A producer in Egypt, contratteJ to deliver a certain quantity of fresh tomatoesof a certain grade to the European market on a specific date in the winter when fr-tomatoes were scarce and in demand. The producer first had to be sure he planted , varietyadapted to conditions in 71apt and of a quality rewired in his contract. Next he mustinvestigate transportation, to determine how he could get the tomatoes to Europe in goodcondition.Air transport proved to be most feasible. Then he must develop a time schedulefor preparing the land, starting the plants, growing them out, harvesting, packing andshipping in order that the product would be delivered on time, and start his plants accordingly.During the growing season he must cultivate, irrigate, spray to control insects and protectfrom depredation to assure the production of a high quality product. He must pick the tomatoesat the right stage of maturity, train his workers to handle the tomatoes carefully to preventbruising, grade them for size and uniform quality and peak them to withstand handling in ship-ment; and arrange transportation to assure delivery on schedule.Similar functions must beperformed to a greater or lesser degree with many agricultural products in order to realizethe greatest profit. The extent to which these functions are performed by the producer varieswith the product and with the sophistication of the marketing system but regardless of whoperforms them they affect the sale of the product and returns to the producer. In manycases marketing, processing and distributing functions can be performed more economicallyand effectively by a cooperative association in which the producer shares in the profits orsavings in addition to assuring efficient handling of his product. Educational needs of producers regarding marketing, distribution and utilization aremany and varied according to the product involved and the circumstances of the individual.Some of the more obvious include: 1.Information supplied periodically on the present and potential market demandfor products that can be produced in the area and seasons of greatest demand. 2.Information on high yielding varieties that will meet quality requirements. 3.Training in cultural practices that will assure high yields and a uniformlyhigh quality product. 4.Skills in harvesting and packing. 5.Quality control in the handling of the product. 6.Educational assistance in cooperative marketing and processing. 7.Attractive dieilay and packaging (in case the producer retails his product on the local market). 8.Price information during the marketing season.Conservation and Wise Use of resourcesis of national importance to every country. Its importance is not as apparent to the individual who is deeply involved in the immediate problem of providing a living for his family.Few poor and illiterate farmers are accustomed to thinking in terms of measures that will conserve natural resources for use 10 years later let alone for the use of future generations. Fvidence of exploitation and waste of natural resources is recorded througtaout written history and is present today in most countries. Parts of Northern Africa which were once described as the bread baaket of ancient Rome have since reverted to desert. The valleys of Peru are said to have once supported several times their present population. The New Englaad area of the United States when denuded of its forests soon lost its top soil through erosion, farms became unproductive and farm families had to move west to new lands. The recent population explosion emphasizes the importance of conservation and wise use of resources in order that constantly increasing numbers of people may be fed and clothed. Iiecanse conservation invelees the wise use of resources over tile, end requires joint action by large numbers of people, governmentshave found itnecessary to enact conservation laws and inaugurate conservation programs. Conservation involves the preservation and wise use of those resources necessary for maintaining an acceptable standard of living for the people.It includes such objectives as reduction or prevention of soil erosion; conservation of water and prevention of pollution; preservation of species of plants and animals threatened with extinction; maintenance and regeneration of forest resources; development of areas for hunting, fishing, camping and other recreational activities, and preservation of the natural beauty of primitive areas for the enjoyment of all future generations. Although government leadership, investment and action are necessary to the accomplishment of these objectives, cooperation of individual farmers and all citizens is equally important. Laws and regulations in regard to the conservation of resources can be enforced only to the extent that people appreciate their usefulness and accept them as being in their own best interests. Agricultural extension programs in this field are directed to: (1) informing people. of the value of and need for conservation, (2) assisting people tc use their own resources wisely so as to provide the best possible living for themselves and their descendants, and (3) motivating people to do their part in achieving national objectives. Management on the farm involves numerous and continuing decisions as to alternative uses of resources in an effort to maximize productivity and farm income. A farmer, at any given time has at his disposal a certain amount of land with certain characteristics, his labor and that of his family, and varying amounts of capital (money or credit) to use in exploiting his other resources. In modern agriculture each of these production requisites can usually be expanded or reduced. He may bay or rent more land or reduce his holdings. Be may employ more or less labor and he may intensify his operation by employing irrigation, double cropping, greater use of fertilizer by producing higher value crops or by processing his products rather than selling them unprocessed.These latter functions usually require greater investment of capital and labor. In primitive agriculture the alternatives may be limited for a variety of reasons such as limited land resources, unavailability of credit but to a very large extent because the farmer does not know of alternatives or how to use them.In some cases alternatives are available as a result of research and experimentation in crop and animal production. irrigation development may make possible the growing of new and profitable crops. A. new cheese factory may provide an expanded market for milk. A trade agreement with another country may provide a profitable market for certain fruits or vegetables The higher agriculture is developed the greater the number of alternatives faced by the farmer and the more managerial ability is required. The farmers decisions involve not only the use of available resources (funds) for agricultural development but their allocation between production and family living; between current operations and expansion of the production plant (more acres or livestock or development of irrigation for examples). The soundness of his decisions are usually related to the soundness and completness of the information on which they are based. Records of farm activities, yields of crops and livestock products,costs of production and profit or loss of each enterprise provide useful guides in makingdecisions.Educational requirements relative to farm management involve: (1) analysis ofresources available to the individual farmer and the community; (2) training in decisionmaking based upon available alternatives; (3) information on new alternatives developingas a result of research, changes in demand and new agricultural developments such asirrigation projects; assistance in keeping records; (5) assistance in analyzing recordsand using them as a guide in making decisions; and (6) money van agement, use of credit etc.Farm management is an essential element in the training of farmers on P,r1,-;r7-ftlenet,projects.Most such settlers have little if any experience in ---aaee ..ruingworked as laborers under daily sueereeion.National extension programs in agriculture can establish the broad areas of extensionresponsibility and activity which are of concern to the masses of rural people and contributeto the national welfare. They may also take into account national economic and agriculturalpolicy and assure that these policies are considered in the formation of localized extensionprograms.atensiol.ain Agriculture rtrastbeLocalized to the Region, the Count acid theCommunity\"We are inclined to overlook the fact that development not only happens to peoplebut that it happens to them one at a time.\" J Agricultural development takes place on atleast thousands and probably millions of farms in any given country. To be effective extensioneducation must meet the needs of these masses of people, facing a great variety of problems.Farms vary in size, in the basic character of the land, in soil fertility, in degree of erosionand adaptation to crops and farm enterprises. The types of farms that are appropriate forprimitive agriculture are not the types that are most productive when nodern methods areapplied.Varying soil types and climatic conditions require specially adapted crops andvarieties.Communal grazing of livestock gives rise to land management problems not facedby stockmen grazing their own land. Establishment of crop rotation and soil fertilitypractices must be preceded by land consolidation, establishment of property rights andenclosure of fields in order that the individual farmer will be able to control his eeterprisesand reap the benefits of improved practices. This leads to the logical conclusion thatextension programs must be developed to fit the local situation. Although situations, problemsand needs vary from farm to farm or village to village, people in a contiguous area have manyproblems in common.As indicated in Chapter 3, administrative units of the extension service need tobe established to serve areas with common interests and needs. Boundaries of political units,such as counties in the United States tend to cut across types of farming and problem areasand are not the best units for agricultural program development. But other factors than typeof farming are involved in the common interests and needs of people. Social and politicalfactors may be more influencial. Thus a compromise may be called for in setting up localadministrative units of the extension service. It then becomes an important function ofextension supervisors and subject matter specialists to coordinate programs between areasserved by different extension units.The important role of local extension programs cannot be over emphasized. Thisis where the extension service succeeds or fails in changing the practices and attitudes ofrural peoples. R.L.

Agriculture as an indusary eafiers in rana respects fa-on ether inaustries and professions.Since production processes in agriculture are growth processes, they are subject to many natural phenomena which ca nnct le cantrolled to the extent productionprocesses are controlled in a factory. Thay are affected la: tea7aerature, rainfall or lac of its wind damage, and many other factors a'a&.-2?.. waich lit tie, c4iia ue done.Soils and from field-to-a1,1. -7,aa aar7 in fertil:a7. in soil texture aal structure, in toncaraahy and as tillage 2'ACt;.:MS Animals vary in their capaties produ-ce meat. lk, e';;J do work as a result of hereditary and environmental factors. Farmers are first of all a product of their respective environments.They have learned to survive by following the farming practices taught them by their forebears.Farmers experiences reflects difference in land, sizes and types of enterprises and successes and failures in the past. Consequently their reactions to innovations will vary.Farm families vary in size, in proportion of sons and daughters, in the state of health of family members and in level of education. Farming is a business dependent upon markets, farm supplies, transportations.andother services which are available in varying degrees in each community.Because of these variables, programs for agricultural development must be tailoredto general conditions in the area, then to the specific farm and farmer.Practices whichare successful in one area or even on one farm must often be adjusted to be applied to another farm by another farmer. The time factor is important in agriculture. Crop production is seasonal. There is a limited time span when crops may be planted. Tillage must be done when soil and moisture conditions are favorable. Insect pests can best be controlled at certain stages of development. Thus individual crops require large impute of labor at certain seasons and none at others. Diversification of enterprises provides more efficient use of labor in addition to its other advantages.A single most profitable crop or enterprise may be less profitable than a combination making more complete use of land and labor.Farming requires a wider variety of skills than almost any other industry and utilizes more branches of science and kinds of technology.Furthermore technology is constantly changing.Agricultural programs must provide not only the training in basic skills and tech- nology of modern agriculture but must keep this knowledge up to date.Each change in practice calls for additional changes. Higher yielding hybrid seeds require more fertilizer and water to achieve their potential production. With irrigation and fertilization, closer plant spacings will result in higher yields. Where animal power is used, crops are spaced wide enough for the horses or oxen to walk between the rows. With mechanical cultivation the rows may be narrower.A new crop may be highly productive but have no value unless processing facilities and markets are provided.An extension program in agriculture must take into account all of the above and other variables.They affect priorities in the selection of goals and targets.They determine to a considerable extent the educational needs of farmers and villagers in relation to the goals selected and the teaching methods to be used.A local extension program in agriculture, to be most effective represents agreement among rural leaders, local extension workers and their supervisors and subject matter spedialist upon:(1)problems, needs and goals for agricultural development in the particular area? (2)farmer education required to solve problems involved in achieving selected goals, (3) the application of national agricultural policies to the area, and (4) method of coordination with the programs of other organizations and agencies with related functions and goals. Such a program describes the situation as it exists at a specific time and servesas a. benchmark against which to measure progress at a later date. Agreeme:- upon all proposals for a program is not to be expected. But thoroughdiscussion of all aspects of a situation reveals those aspects where united action is feasible.Participation of rural leaders is especially important. Their opinions and reactions to theopinions of others, indicate their understanding of problems and where the educational programshould begin.am214eLatat2aEars Deciding amMethods of extension program development are discussed in Chapter 10, but localextension programs in agriculture must take into account a number of important factorsincluding but not limited to the following: 1.Natural and physical resources of the area such as soil, climate and adaptationto specific types of crop and livestock nroAnp+i,, 2.Problems hindering effective exploitation of these resources, such as lowfertility, eroded soil, low yielding varieties and breeds of plants andanimas, insect and disease problems, shortage of rainfall at the timerequired, inefficient cultural and livestock production practices. 3.Technical information applicable in the solution of these problems and itsadaptation to local conditions. 4.Economic and social factors contributing to low productivity, such as landtenure system, available markets for products of the area and prices received,transportation facilities, levels of aM owortumities for education, thehealth situation and current programs for improvement. 5.Availability of such requisites of production as capital, credit, labortwaterfor irrigation, fertilizer, farm machinery and equipment, improved seed andbreeding stock. 6.Numbers of families involved and areas concerned with each problem or proposedproject. 7.Agricultural and economic policies and programs of the central government. 8.Financial, physical, technical and personnel resources of the extension service. 9.Present level of technical competence of farmers. 10.Experience of people in cooperative and self-help programs. 11.Wants and aspirations of the people as compared to their immediate and long-term needs as seen by the extension staff. 12.Experimental and research institutions available to help solve technicalproblems. 13.Opportunities available to farmers to improve productivity, reduce costs orincrease farm income. Determine Priorities An examination of the above-nenticeed factors by the extension staff in consulta- tion with community leaders will usually indicate certain eriorities. An FAO specialist was assigned the task of assisting the government of a1.eth-east Asian country to improve the quality of rice. His observations soon convinced his that the long delay between harvest and threshiei,; resulted in significant deterioration due to mold and insect damage. The delay ve- lted from a long period of waiting for the favorable winds employed in winnowing the paddy.The expert solved this problem by attaching a fan to the drive Shaft of an old tractor used for road grading, thus providing an artificial breeze across the threshing floor. It worked so well that he called in neighboring farmers to demonstrate this practice.Very quickly he had a pile of exceptionally clean bright paddy.He then asked the grower what he thought of the idea. The owner merely smiled and threw a handful of dirt into the pile of clean paddy. The surprised expert asked the grower why he did this. The grower explained that the government established a price for the rice which was allowed to contain a certain percentage of foreign matter. He wanted payment for that percentage. Before a clean rice program could be accepted by growers it needed to be preceded by the establishment of a price system based upon grade with a differential in price according to quality and purity.Priorities are also affected by the seriousness of the problem, the number of families involved, its importance to the general public and values and beliefs of rural people.Number of cattle are status symbol in some societies. This is a significant problem in dealing with areas of over-grazing where cattle numbers must be reduced. Any reduction in cattle numbers may require a prior change in beliefs and values of the people.Families in backward societies aeldom give high priority to a clean, safe milk supply until they learn that milk is a carrier of serious bacterial diseases. In this situation an educational program on health and sanitation may well precede a clean milk campaign. Focus &tension Programs where Results are most PromisingFocus is an essential element of agricultural extension programs. By focus we mean concentration of effort on one or a very limited number of projects until substantial progress is achieved. Often a single project, such as introduction of a new variety of wheat or rice, will require maximum effort and constitute the main focus of the extension program over a period of time. Too often, an extension worker will see so many different phases of production that can be improved, or so many small practices that are inefficient, that he dabbles with many and shows little progress in improved productivity of any agricultural enterprise, Rural people and agricultural policy officials see little benefit from his services. Both the individual extension worker and the extension service he represents acquire a reputation for futility. Dramatic results on a broad scale are especially important in developing countrieswith primitive agricultural practices. While farmers practicing a highly developed and specialized agriculture are pleased with a 5 % to 10 % improvement in already high yields,s4ch increases may not be recognized by illiterate farmers who must judge results by appearance rather than accurate records. On the other hand, dramatic increases are much easier to obtain from low basic yields. The dramatic results achieved with Mexican wheat varieties in Turkey, Tunisia, Pakistan, India end number of other countries attest to the value of focusing extension and other resources on a single project of r>7oven potential.A single project which profoundly affects agricultural production in a community, a region or in a country often requires the marshalling of many different resources. A wheat variety project starts with the research to develop varieties with desired characteristics. Demonstration and testing under varying conditions must prove its adaptation. Additionalfertilizer and irrigation may be necessary. Seed must be available and rarketing oust beprovided for.Insect and disease hazards must be anticipated and insecticides must beavailable at the tine needed together with the necessary equipment for their use. each a campaign requires concerted effort by many aeencies and institutions, butit also provides an opportunity to establish good working relationships among theseinstitutions and services. All can share the credit for success. Such extreme concentrationof effort on one crop or enterprise can be justified (1) when the project is of potentialimportance to large numbers of producers and to the economy of the country, (2) when thepracticability of the project has been demonstrated through research and testing under thevarying conditions existing in the area, and (3)when all the necessary resources forexecution of the project can be assured. Without these prerequisites the project is almostsure to fail.But such a spectacular breakthrough as a Mexican wheat or a high yielding dwarf ricedo not happen with any regularity nor are they adapted to all areas. It is the task of theextension worker to discover those changes in practice for his area which have the greatestpotential end concentrate his efforts accordingly. It may be in the area of insect ordisease control or improved supplies of forage for livestock during periods of drought.Many years ego, the Wiscounsin, USA, Extension Service concentrated on inducing dairymen tofeed a pound of grain for each three pounds of milk produced and achieved spectacularincreases i0 production. Today much more sophisticated feeding programs bring very satisfactory results which are less spectacular as a percentage gain in production. Agriculturalexperts estimate that maize yields in irrigated areas of North Africa can be doubled withmodern cultural and irrigation practices together with hybrid varieties responding toheavy application of fertilizer.Extension workers, collaborating with their colleagues in agricultural researchcan well establish those areas of agricultural development offering greatest promise. Coordinate the Extension Pro am inculture with Other Pro- ams Extension has an obligation to provide educational assistance to other agriculturaland rural services as mentioned in Chapter 3, but over and beyond the obligation, suchcooperation can be of distinct advantage to the extension program.$uparvised credit agencies, cooperative associations, private and governmentalagencies distributing fertilizer, insecticides, and improved seeds, purchasers and processorsof agricultural products, veterinary services, irrigation districts, pest control programsand many other institutions provide essential services of an operational nature requiredfor agricultUral development. Each of these bodies may have representatives in the comrunitypromoting ite product or service. However, no one of these institutions or cervices isconcerned with the total agricultural progress of the community.Extension on the otherhand is concerned with helping people use all available resources, including the abovementioned services, to improve agricultural production, increase family income and raisethe level of living in the community. There is a mutuality of interest which requirescoordination of efforts among all of these economic and social forces. But how best canthis coordination be achieved?First, as previously discussed, it is a responsibility of agricultural administraAonat the national level to establish a policy of coordination and so organize the einietry ofagriculture 40 to encourage cooperation in the execution of rural programs. But just asagricultural programs have their impact on the farms of the masses of rural people, so doescoordination of programs take effect at this point. It is here that efforts of all institutionsand services are focused and results achieved. Therefore, efforts of coordination at all higherlevels need to be focused on the local development program. As professional agriculturaleducational leader in the community, the extension agent has an obligation and an opportunity 57 - to influence coordination of all developmental agricultural activities.He is concerned with the total welfare of the people of his county or district. He is trained in social organization as well as agricultural technology and enjoys the confidence of farmers and officials alike. If he is a member of the staff of the district agricultural office, the head of that office may have official responsibility for coordination of all ministry programs in the area. In this case, the extension agent may serve as an informal leaderin coordinating programs but his task is none the less important.By involving all of the agricultural interest of the area in an extension program two purposes can be accomplished. First the resulting program can include the contribution of each of the institutions and services in accomplishing extension program objectives.Secondly, educational needs relative to credit, cooperatives, disease control, use offertilizers and improved seeds, in which other agricultural services are concerned canbe considered, in setting goals for the extension program.Nothing is more effectivein bringing about coordination at the local level than the participation of leading farmers where programs for their benefit are being planned. With farmers present in a meeting,government officials are constantly reminded that development programs will succeed or fail as a result of the actions of farm people; that improvement programs are designed in their behalf.The farmer expresses his judgement of the value and effectiveness of each agency by the manner in which he cooperates or fails to cooperate in each agency program. Chapter 5.58 EXTENSION PROGRAMS IN HOME ECONOMICS Agricultural Extension is FamilyLgso am Farming is an occupation that involves the whole family. The farmer, his wife andhis children share in the daily and seasonal round of caring for the animals, planting,cultivating, harvesting and marketing the crops. The responsibility of feeding the familyand protecting the health of the children concerns both the mother and the father, Farm activities are so interwoven with those of the home that if extension educationis to be effective- it must serve the entire family.. The boys and d.rls in the family notonly help with the work on the farm and in the home, they often influence their parents totry out improved practices they have learned in their extension club projects. Boys andgizle are the farms and homemakers of tomorrow. Innovations they learn will carry intoimprovements for the future. Home economics extension focuses on teaching women, and girls. \"If you educate aman, you educate an individual. If you educate a woman you educate a family.\" This oldproverb is true today. Any program aizled at changing patterns of activity in a rural societyneeds to take into consideration the woman's influence in the home, in the villEze and innational affairs. A woman's primary concern is her children, feeding them, caring for themand helping them to grow into healthy and responsible adults ready to take a place in society.She needs assistance from women who are trained to teach her how to batter feed her family,.how to care for her children, how to improve her house, how to make clothes for her family.She needs trained help in learning how to better manage her resources to improve the family'sliving.When women are not educated to the homemaking role, there is no progress towardbetter living.Because the rural woman's responsibilities encompass affairs of the home, the family,and the farm, the extension home economics worker who helps her must be trained to assistin these different areas of work. In addition to her training in home economics, she mustknow about agriculture and the improved farming practices recommended in her area. She needsto work closely with agriculturists. She can do this easiest if she is a component part ofthe Ministry of Agriculture. When she is a member of the agricUltural staff, she completesa team for a total farm, home and family approach toward improving agriculture and ruralliving,each of which is dependent on the other. The Role of the Rural Woman in A iculture and Economic Develo ment The woman's role in national development is often overlooked.Improved agriculturalproduction is basic to both economic and social development, and here the wives of farmershave great influence. A woman may not always attend a village meeting with her husband, buther influence goes with him. This influence can change a village. It is often the womanwho is first willing to try improved farming methods. Her interest and attitude, plus herlabor, help determine what the production will be on a farm. Back of every man is a womanwho helps him carry out improvements or hinders him in making changes because she doesn'tunderstand.In many countries the village woman has been the forgotten personlyet she may bethe key to the success or failure of agricultural programs. 1/ Helen A. Strow, Extension Specialist and Sue Taylor Murry, Extension Specialist, retired,Office of International Extension, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. - 59 - .A quick look at population figures shoes there are 36 million village women inAfrica alone.These women are important. In the past a housewife learned her homemakingskills from her mother. Each generation lived much as the preceding one.Now her job is bigger.Changing times make improved linking conditions possible and she wants them for the family.Never before have social and economic changes affecting the home and family hadsuch impact, from the smallest rural hamlet to the large city.To prepare families to meetthese changes, home economics programs are an integral part of development plans in mostcountries. Ac families move from subsistence farming to a cash economy, they increasingly becomeconsumers.As consumer goods become more plentiful and varied, women are faced with raging money and making choices. They thus influence the growth and expansion of industries dealing with food, clothing, housing, furnishings, household equipment, and other products used in the home.With continued education, women inoreasingly demand more and better consumer goods.Health, too, is an important factor in economic development.The woman in the home is responsible for the health and wellbeing of her family.She determines whether or not the family lives in a clean house and practices sanitation.Whether her babies live or.die depends upon the care she gives them. She plans and cooks the food to help her children grow strong.And she sees that they are taught to be honest and respect other people.Governments are beginning to recognize that helping the family and the home helps the nation.They recognize that good homes, happy families, and educated children are basic to a great nation. They are becoming aware that village women are helping to build a firmer base for their Country's progress. The rural woman's role in agricultural and overall development becomes of evengreater importance as we take a closer look at her responsibilities and influence on:Food Production and Use A serious food situation exists in the world today. Many countries already have more people than they can feed and populations are growing.By the year 2000 A.D. there will be twice as many people as there are now. Unless more food is grown and used more wisely, there will be even greater hunger. The problem is not only a lack of food but a lack of knowledge about nutrition.This means fled in the amount and kind needed to develop a strong healthy body and provide energy for work and play. The hunger and malnutrition problem in the world will be solved largely on the farm and in the home. The woman is responsible for selecting the kind offood the family eats and for preparing and serving the meals. She must know the healthfulway to feed her family if they are to be well and strong. Increasing food production is not enough to solve the food problem.Harvesting food crops at the right time and in the right way saves food and makes for better diets. Too often food crops such as tomatoes are picked either too green or too ripe and handledin such a way that they becomeiaruieed and rot quickly. Storage of food is another problem. Foodgrains such as rice or millet are often stored in the house, and although these may be thefamily's most prized possession, a large proportion is lost to insee's and rodents. Seeing that the food grain harvested reaches the mouths of the family (instead of a fourth of it going to feed rats and weevils) is the same as increasing the total crop harvested.Properly caring for perishable foods in the home to prevent waste also increases the family food supply.. Harvesting, storage and caring for food in the home is often handled largely by women. They need to learn how to prepare, cook and serve food in a may to prevent loss of ite nutritive value. Food habits are an important factor in being well fed. Forexample, in a corn or rice eating oountry, a new variety of these grains recommended by the 60 .Ministry of Agriculture because they give higher yields may not be acceptable for food bythe people.The extension home economist working with the women on cooking methods may bethe key to making this essential change from eating the old variety to accepting the new.Women must learn not only improved practices in producing food but they must also learn theimportance of food to health and how to feed their families for good rution. Health of th Fami_ly A strong healthy family is essential. The wife and mother in a rural home is thecustodian of the health of the family. Acute illness is a big problem and often a big e.cpenseto the family. But more often family members have chronic sicknesses such as malaria,dysentery, parasites, and malnutrition they have lived with all their lives. They do notknow what is the matter or that they can do something about it. All over the world peopleneed to understand what good health is and what they can do to have better health. The familyneeds to understand that what they eat, how they cook and wash dishes, the kind of water theydrink and whether or not they keep clean and live in a clean house and surroundings, have agreat influence on their health. They need to learn what sanitation has to do pith goodhealth.Many people thought to be lazy and shiftless actually are sick and do not have enoughenergy to work. Their thinking is dulled because they are in poor physical condition. Theydo not make productive citizens. Care of ChildrenParents the world over are interested in the wellbeing of their children. Almostevery phase of family living affects the child. Child care must be considered as an important part of a total program for improved living. :Jut large numbers of children die every year from causes that could be prevented bythe parents if they had been taught the healthful way to care for their children. Childcarebeginswith the mother when she is pregnant what she eats and how she care for herselfaffects her chances to have a healthy strong baby. She needs to know how to feed and carefor the infant, how and when to wean the child, and how to prcperly feed and care for thetoddler after weaning.The mortality rate in children between, the ages of two years and four or five isgreat in many areas.When the children are no longer given breast milklthey are often fed onlya diet of starchy gruel or pap with no protein and develops kwashiorkor or marasmus. Proteindeficiency in preschool children is one of the great nutrition problems with Which governments around the world are now concerned.Child care emphasizes good nutrition in relation to progress of the child in school.It includes children's needs and how to meet these needs from infancy through adolescence.Parents need to understand that to give their children better living, both the home and thecommunity must increasingly become healthful places to rear children. If there is not, properfood to eat, houses have no windows, if they are unsanitary, if they have no latrines, ifwater for the family is unsafe and scarce., if there are flies and mosquitoes everyAere, thechildren have little chance to grow healthy and strong. Management in 'lie Home Management in the how, is-as important as manageMent on the farm. A farmer needsto plan and organize his farm and his work. So it is with running a household. A woman mustthink about what jobs she has to do and how much time she can spend in the fields.She willneed to think of how much money she has to spend on her home and family and how she can usethe money wisely to get the most from it. She needs to know how to use her time and how toconserve her strength and energy for her most important jobs. She may feel she is veryeconomical and does not paste money. She may not realize that -taking care of hat she has -61 is one way to save money. In the wholearea of planning and managing her home she needs help. The extension home economist has such information and experience with which to assist her in all areas of management and consumer buying.The Scope of Home Economics Extension Home economics is concerned with the wide range of activities dealing rith home and family life today. Never before in history have the forces of social and economic change that affect these activities been so strong.They are at work in the smallest rural village and hamlet as well as it the large urban areas of every country around the world. To prepare families to meet these enanges, governments are increasingly recognizing the need for hoMe economics education. Home economics extension programs are becoming part of development plans in many countries. It is highly important, therefore, that the home economics extension program contribute to the country's national goals and to the goals of the ministry in which it is located. Such goals may include improvement of diets, better housing, better sanita tion, increased production, etc. Ministries of agriculture, for example, generally have goals or producing within the country most of the food people eat, plus sufficient export crops to support the economy of the country. Helping a family increase its rice production, along with a good garden and a healthy flock of chickens makes a contribution. Teaching them how to eat a balanced diet may help them t6 have the health and energy needed to increase cash crops for export. The home economics eyLtension program must be realistic. It must be planned to be within the ability and resources of staff to carry out. The program must be practical, dealing with recognized problems of the libme and family. It must propose solutions people can carry out. The chief focus of the'home economics extension program is upon the woman who has the triple role of homemaker, consumer and producer and whose activities include:Caring for and training childrenProducing, preserving and preparing food for the familyImproving the sanitary and physical environment of the home to protect the health and wellbeing of the family membersSelecting, making, caring for clothing and articles of household useManaging all;available resources including those provided through community servicesManaging and improving the homeFactors to Consider in Building a Strong Home EconometelFroaiiesE)DOrganization and Staffing The organizational structure for home economics etension within the extension service of the Ministry of Agriculture should be similar to that for agriculture, with home economics staff at each level: national, provincial, district and local to correspond to their agricultural counterparts. In this may there can be easy communication and coordina tion of work at each level. The same principles would apply if home economics is located in one of the other ministries. Often because of lack of funds or lack of trained women, home economics programs are set up with less staff than other programs in the ministry.Because home economics work is less well known and understood than agricultural work, it is often assumed there is not the need for as much personnel, and too often home economics programs are set up with so little staff that progress is hindered from the beginning. Because of the nature and scope of home economics work, more staff may be needed than in some of the other ministry programs. Whatever ministry she is in the home economics worker can function bestas a member of a team. She needs an agriculturalist at each level, with whom she works. In. working with the whole family, it is important that men and women work as a team.Even in 62 societies where men and women do not go to meetings together it is important for the homeeconomist to have easy access to agricultural information to help keep the village womeninformed on the newest recommended practices in agriculture. The home economics extension organization should parallel that of agriculture, withwomen counterparts at each level. However, one of the greatest problems in starting orexpanding a home economics extension program is lack of trained staff. It may be betterto concentrate work in a few selected provinces or areas to demonstrate what can be done witha smoothly running organization in a small area rather than scatter staff thinly over a largerarea and show little accomplishment. Staff will fall into three general categories: village level workers, subject matterspecialists, and supervisors, including a national leader of home economics, The National Leader of Home Economics Extension It is important in setting up a home economics extension program to select a womanas national leader. She will help recruit and train other workers; work with her counterparts in the other ministry programs to interpret home economics to other national leaders,and plan the operation of the new program. The national leader should be a qualified person with professional experience, eventhough such experience may not be in the field of home economics. Experience as a schoolprinciple, a community development or social worker, or a public health educator could beuseful.Her experience should have been in a position of responsibility and leadership.The national leader of home economics extension should function as a member of the extensiondirector's staff, and under his supervision and guidance. VillageLevel Workers The success or failure of the home economics extension program rests in the handsof the field workers. In recruiting village level workers, look for capable women who havefinished basic education and have gone into some other field. There will be some who havehad good work experience in other fields and who will find extension's method of. teachingpeople appealing.The person responsible for recruiting these women should talk with people in theministry of agriculture and other ministries as well as the professors at the universityand women leaders in other fields.Job descriptions and qualifications for each position should be written before therecruiting begins, Some things to consider are: 1. The home economics extension worker deals with families and learns many personalmatters.She must have a genuine interest in helping rural families, and holdinformation in confidence. 2. The village worker must be willing to live in the village. Often, selectingthem from villages and returning them after training to villages near their homeshas* proved successful.3. The worker must have a genuine respect for village people and be able to treatthem as equals. 4. Home economics extension workers must like to be with people and to teach in an unstructured situation, hie village worker should have only enough villages to work in at first so that she can show results. Sub'jeet Matter Specialists Village level workers are generalists. They cannot be proficient in all subject matter areas.They need the help of subject - matter specialista,who have sound knowledge in their own particular fields. Specialists study continually and keep up-to-date on new developments.They train the village worker to teach village women and girls. They prepare leaflets, bulletins, etc., in their subject matter area. The less training the village level workers have, the more they need a specialist to back them and the more materials she will have to prepare for their use.If the specialist is training college degree agents she may only prepare bulletins and train them broadly.If she is backstopping women with a 6th grade education, she may need to prepare posters, teaching aids, write :news releases and radio scripts for them md will train them for teaching specific lessons.Well rounded subject matter specialists are essential. Without sound subject matter in areas of family living such as nutrition, child care, home management, clothing, home improvement, etc., the best teaching methods are useless. Because of the general lack of home economics knowledge in many countries; these specialists may serve as the fountains of clear, sound knowledge in a desert of misinformation. A program can stagnate without subject specialists to pour in new knowledge as well as sort and select information for use in village homes. Specialists at the national level can often serve all parts of the country, although in some countries specialists also are placed in provincial or district offices. Supervisors Village workers with limited training need a supervisor to help them plan the program, organize work, and guide them in how to carry out a program to help village women and girls. Specialists sometimes help supervise village workers. Supervisors should be carefully selected and trained.They will represent the national leaders of home economics and also function as members of supervisory teams with their agricultural counterparts. Training Educational Background Many countries do not offer university training in home economics. Often women who receive such training will have had to get their training out of the country,This means when recruiting staff for home economics extension there will be few trained women to draw. upon.Generally there is competition with other home economics programs for staff. University decrees cannot be required for all extension staff, but those in national leadership positions profit by it and teachers in training institutions and subject matter specialists need as much home economics background as they can get. In the early years of development, degree level of training even for these may not be practical, but it should be planned and carried out as soon as it.is practical. 64 Pre -S.!/.viceIand e-Service Training Staff training needs to be a built-in feature anywhere, but in countries where staffmust be employed with little or no training in home economics subject matter, it needs to belonger and be provided before the worker is placed on the job. Regardless of prior trainingor experience, training for the particulaz job is a key to success. A person cannot do ajob without knowing what is expected or without specific training for that job. No workershould be placed in a village until she has had training. Trainins_Centert In many countries the extension service will have its own training center for newvillage workers, Training in some places lasts 9 months to a year and in others is as longas 2 years.To be most effective and make best use of staff, the training center needs tobe closely integrated with the work of the operating staff of extension service. Supervisorsand specialists should do some of the training for experience, to keep staff training in linewith the on-going program, and to make the transition from student to worker as smooth aspossible.A home economics extension training center is desirable where the workers may be inresidence 9 months to 2 years. They need basic training in all areas of home economics aswell as gardening, care of small animals and poultry and some knowledge of other agricultuealactivities the women are involved in. In addition, their course should include a parallelcourse in home economics extension and principles of working with people. Nearby villagescan be used for field experience so that practice and training can be coordinated. As soon as there are well qualified, experienced village workers, the new workersbe placed with them after their training center experience and before being placed in theirown villages.These trainer agents will also need training for this added responsibility.They should carry out the training program under close supervision of the provincial ordistrict supervisor.A training center provides continuous in-service training. All staff members, tokeep abreast and regardless of experience, need frequent short periods of in-service training. When a training center is not available, employment of new staff can be done at certaintimes'in order to conduct a training course at specified intervals, Logisticsrio carry on a successful home economics program support facilities and equipment areessential.These are:1. A satisfactory place for the village worker to live in the village, Which isapproved by the villagers.2. A place toserve as an office where villagers may come to her for advice. If anoffice cannot be arranged and she has a demonstration room or house, a table inone corner can serve this need. As a last resort a table set up under a tree oncertain days can serve as an office. 3. Acceptable means of transportation. In some countries a motor bike or bicycleis an approved vehicle for a woman to use. In others it is not. If it is not,some other mode will need to Leworked out..he cost of transportation shouldbe provided.For example, supplying her with a motor bike and a monthly stipendfor fuel. -65 4. A good home economics extension worker gives many demonstrations and uses visuals to make her teaching more effective. She will need an allowance in order to purchase supplies for demonstrations and visual aide. Methods Woman Like Women like to meet and learn something new in groups. The group which gathers when the village worker is teaching a lesson provides the same kind of social exchange women find pleasant at the river when they do their laundry together. They like to exchange ideas about the subject being taught and hear of successful experiences from neighbors. Generally they feel more comfortable with other women.They feel more free to speak than where men are present. Women like demonstrations, They like to see a process carried through its various steps.They like to help give the demonstration. Often in a village demonstration the women will take over a step such as stirring or beating as soon as they see how it is done, They like to be given responsibility and feel it is a compliment to be allowed to do it.Women like tours. They like to go to other homes and ses improvements such as a rearranged kitchen or new stove. They also like to show what they have done.Women like to have the village worker call on them.They like the personal attention she shows them by coming to their home, and often take the opportunity to discuss a problem they would not mention in a meeting. Women like to do work with their hands.Their days are filled with activities and they think in terms of activities. A,demonstration followed by all women repeating the process is usually well received. It is a good teaching method and is enjoyed by the women.Women like organizations. Someone has said there is no force greater than women's force once it is organized. Women's extension clubs have been a great influence in improving both rural and urban life. Rural homemakers' clubs are rapidly developing in many areas for women who want to come together to learn how to have better homes and a better living. These clubs provide a systematic way to teach women and can be very influential in getting things done.A coope rative spirit is developed through club work which teaches that \"we\", the women of the village are responsible citizens and that \"we\", working together as a group and with our husbands can provide for many of our own needs.When a group of people form an organization, they are beginning to recognize tee value of working together in an organized way to get what they want. An organized grote of responsible citizens can stir a whole village to action. Developing Leaders It is important to think in terms of helping village women develop their potential for leadership. To do this, one must help them grow step by step. The first thing may be to ask a woman who looks especially interested to help in some small way with a demonstration. Maybe at the next meeting.. she will be willing to come early and help arrange the benches for women to sit on, For a later meeting she may be willing to remind the other women to come to the demonstration. The most important single factor in developing leaders is the attitude of the village home economics worker. If she believes women can do leadership jobs, is willing for them to do some of the things she previously did, and will train them to do these jobs, she canhave leaders.It means that the worker who has previously taught the women new skills andenjoyed their appreciation now must find her satisfaction in seeing leaders do well. Theinexperienced worker or one who feels insecure because of limited training herself may bereluctant to give up the pleasure of the direct contact with the women. She is afraid oftenthat the women will lose confidence in her. In some countries groups of women are organizedand the village worker teaches each lesson herself. This limits her spread of influence tothe number of groups she can handle. When the women want to meet every week or two as theydo some places, the teaching is slowed to a pace that is incompatable with development needs. In the beginning, while leaders are being located or taken through the steps necessaryto get them ready to lead in teaching some of the skills, the village worker will have toteach the group each time she holds a meeting. But she should be trained to search forpotential leaders and to believe that the first step in expanding her program is through theuse of these leaders.Leaders should be carefully taught how to do each job they are asked to perform.They must experience success in each leadership activity and get satisfaction from it. Leaders must have recognition for the work they do. In each culture there will beacceptable ways of recognizing leaders. Some ways that are used in many places are: 1. Giving a simple and sincere expression of appreciation by the Village worker. 2. Seeking the advice of a leader lets her know that she is respected by theprofessional worker. 3. Sending the leader a letter of appreciation or giving her a printed certificateseeing she served as leader in a particular project. In extension one of the basic purposes is to develop people. Giving women opportunities to serve as leaders in the home economics extension program helps them grow in selfconfidence.It'is not imposing on a woman to ask her to be a leader. Rather it is givingher en opportunity. Determining Priorities When one begins a new program it seems that everything needs to be done immediately.This is obviously impossible in terms of resources such as staff, teaching materials andtime for training staff. It is necessary to set priorities and not attempt to cover everyphase of homemaking at once. In determining priorities, officials in the ministry should be involved. Theirobservations of needs are important and will be helpful later in maintaining support oncea course of action is determined. What are the agricultural needs? The family and healthneeds?This joint discussion of needs and priorities will help the agricultural staffrecognize family needs and how they are interwoven with agricultural production. The home economics staff should encourage the total staff to think of each phase ofprograms dealing with the family as of concern to all extension workers. For example, anutrition program is not just a home economics program.Women in agsicalture have much tocontribute in improving production of food for the family and helping farmers see the needto improve the nutrition of their families.In determining priorities, get as many facts as possible. Don't depend on hearsayor general impressions from casual visits to villages. The visits are essential co gainfirst hand knowledge but should be planned to collect facts in an orderly way. - 67 - In the beginning, the program should be limited in breadth in order to prepare the staff fully for the teaching job involved and in order to show results. If a program is too variei it is impossible to show specific improvement, and seeing results in important to the village people, the staff, and to officials who have supported and encouraged the program vFist priority should be given to solving home economics problems recognized by many people.These will probably be in nutrition or home sanitation.Once a large area such as nutrition is selected it will be advisable to narrow it in audience.For example, nutrition for infants and preschool children.This does not preclude the principle of beginning where people recognize a need. It may benecessary, for instance, to first teach the women how to use sewing machines if this is what they say they want to learn, then introduce the idea of raising better gardens. While teachinguse of sewing machines, there is time to discuss needs the women had not been aware of before. When priorities have been determined, the program needs to be written down on paper with long -time and immediate objectives clearly defined. Methods to be used to reach the objective and the means to be used to evaluate progress should also be written into the plan.To maintain interest in a home economics program it is necessary to be alert to changing needs. Often a new development in a vMage, or even tragedy, can give a new face to a program.Introduction of a new variety of rice into the community offers a chance to teach how toprepare it for babies and others in the family. It may providean opening to suggest an improvement in preparation that would have been difficult if everyone had continued to use the old rice. An epidemic associated with impure water may provide the opportunity to teach women how to have clean water for their families.It is also important to publicize results. This is important in the village as well as in the ministry and among other people of influence. Get important officials to go to villages andsee results. The Nome Economics Extensionlm.gram Needs SupzEI2LMany Different Pell!The extension homertaking program must be understood by both top government officials who provide the funds and by every family in the program. There are many people who do not understand thescope of a program dealing with the home and family. Some think homeecono mics involves only simple skills in cooking, sewing, laundry and house cleaning. Others think of it in terms of frills and fancy work.Influential people at the national level on down to the village level must understand and see the need for educating women and girls to become better mothers and homemakers. Support means more than just approval. When a national official takes part in a special homemaking event out in the village, he is more likely to give the program the kind of support it needs. The home economics extension program needs to be understood by religious, educational and business leaders at every level. Women in highpositions in both urban and rural areas will often give support and help exten sion homemaking programs if they become interested and are calledon for specific kinds of help. Coordinating Rome Economics Extension with other Agencies and OrganizationsThe problems and opportunities in rural areas are interwoven and inseparable. Programs concerned with them often overlap.Every country has many government and private agencies and organizations concerned with rural welfare and conducting family realted programs.For example the ministry of education is concerned with educating boys and girls in home economics subjects and may haveadult programs for parents. Extension rural youth club work should be closely coordinatedwith the school programs for boys and girls in home economics and agriculture. The ministryof health is concerned with improving health of families and communities. Farmer's associa-tions may have programs for wives of farmers who are members. Chapter 6. RURAL YOUTH EXTENSION PROGRAMS 1/ Throughout the world expectations are rising and people are clamouring forbetter standards of living. Rural youth work has been accepted as a way to introduce newideas into rural life and train leaders and citizens for the future. Rural youth work is educational.It aims at the total development of young people to prepare them for their role as useful citizens. Seventy -four countries have organized rural youth programs of this type. More than 364,000 clubs have a membership of nearly eight and three-quarter million young people.For a number of years scattered efforts in rural youth work were made bybusinesses, church missions, schools, and incUviduals. The most recent expansion has been directed by government agencies, principally agricultural. The philosophy, principles and procedures discussed here are for rural youthprograms directed by a central government through the Agricultural Ministry.They often apply to non-government sponsored programs as well. An effective rural youth program must consider the needs and interests of youth, the contribution of youth to the welfare of thefarm family, community, and country, and the development of skilful, intelligent,industrious, dependable, and responsible citizens. A successful rural youth program is valuable to the youth who participate, thefamilies involved, the community, and the country.Club members contribute to rural improvement and better living. Each project activity demonstrates improved practices to parents and neighbours. The introduction of improved seed, fertilizer, insect control, and food production and preservation through these projects, and their adoption by parentsand neighbours, has helped to speed rural development. In many countries rural youth work is an effective way to close the gap betweenwhat is known about agriculture and home economics and what farmers and housewives do. In this wary rural youth club members serve as messengers of the government. They spread the information farmers need to produce the food required, and thus improve health and family living for the entire country. Using adult volunteers in positions of leadership and on sponsoring committeeshelps to strengthen democratic adult 3eadership ia the. community.Philosophy of Rural Youth Work It is Educational Each project teaches skills and methods recommended by agricultural and homemaking technicians.Rural youth learn these new practices by actually using them in their home and farm project activities. The skills and improved methods they use and learn become a part of their life. The training rural youth club members receive aids their personal development.By taking responsibility for a definite farm or home enterprise, they develop dependability,responsibility, trustworthiness, and industry. They learn the dignity of labour.Participating in club meetings, serving as officers and chairmen of committees, appearingon programs, and competing in contests prepares them for action in a democratic society. Rural Youth Clubs Around the World - Federal Extension Service, U.S. Department ofAgriculture in Cooperation with the Agency for International Development U.S. Department of State. It is a Voluntary Program The program is open to any rural youth who meets the requirements for membership.There are no dues to be paid. There are no compulsory requirements for membership andparticipation. It is non-political, non-sectarian. It has no limitations as to race,creed, or colour. It is a Joint Endeavour by Government and People Established at the village or community level, the rural youth club is organizedand directed by local leaders and parents.The system is supervised by a professionalyouth leader who coordinates the organization and program of clubs with similar objectives.The local club is a place where members and youth leaders can develop plans, receivetechnical training, and function as part of a 4 ..c.ional program.BasicFsin a Rural Youth Pr. amm In most countries where rural youth work has been established, it is sponsored by thegovernment.In a few countries rural youth work is sponsored by non-government groups.Successful youth programs are being conducted under both systems and combinations of thetwo.Establishing Res When youth work is sponsored by the government, the responsibility should beplaced in a specific ministry or department by legislative act, Cabinet action, or decree.Such action should provide the financial, administrative, and technical support anddirection needed to assue successful promotion, organization, and supervisior% of theprogram. The legal responsibility for the rural youth program most logically rests in theministry or department of agriculture. Work vith rural youth is carried out in a ruralagricultural environment. Its principal objectives are to train youth in the everyday .activities of the total farm family, agricultural and homemaking techniques, and communitylife, and through them to contribute to the improvement of rural life. Thus, governmentagricultural agencies have a major contribution to make to the program. Rural youth work will be most effective when it is organized as an integral partof an agricultural extension-type program involving the whole family in rural improvement.Any attack on the problems of rural people can be promoted with greater impact when it isdone simultaneously with the farmer, his wife, and his children. Rural youth work is achance to get knowledge of improved methods and techniques out to the farm families whoneed it to get increased.or more efficient production, increased incomes, and improved livingstandards. The Rural youth Club What is a Club? A club is an organized group of young people, usually between 9 and 20 years ofage, under the guidance of extension workers and local volunteer leaders.Members electtheir own officers, plan and conduct club programs, hold regular meetings usually once amonth, and carry on worthwhile activities in farming, homemaking, community improvement,and other related areas. 71 Wa Club? The club brings members together with the trained local leader for technical training and instruction. Through a club the leader can contact more youth.Club meetings, programs, and activities afford a definite opportunity to train and developleaders in group action and democracy. Who can Belong? Requirements differ from country to country. To become a member of a ruralyouth club, an interested boy or girl agrees to comply with whatever requirements have been set up.The following have been used in a number of countries: Obtain parents' permission to belong to the club. Agree to complete the requirements in one or more farm or homeproject activities. Keep a record of the work done on forms supplied for that purpose.Attend and take part in club meetings. Exhibit something produced, made, or managed in connection with thepro jeot; Demonstrate some new method learned during the club year.Learn to judge -ales, products and exhibits for quality and workmanship.Be 9 to 20 years of age, (or any appropriate ages). Help other members whenever possible or needed.Take part in'all club activities and programs for the benefit of thevillage. ' prrunization for Administration and Su ervision The success of any worthwhile movement depends to a large extent on a trained,dedicated, and enthusiastic leader. Work with rural youth, likewise, must have a leader of vision, dedioation, and enthusiasm. The designated leader of the rural youth program should have a rural background. Where possible, he should be from the village and wantto serve rural people, and rural youth in particular. He should know the problems of people in rural areas and the needs and wants of rural youth. He needs actual experience in organizing and conducting a club before trying to teach others. He should not feel superior to the people he hopes to help, but be willing to work with his own hands to showthem how to perform farm and home tasks in an improved and modern way.A national leader would benefit from a chance to study and serve youthprograms in some other country if this is possible.A national youth leader must: 1.Outline the purpose, procedure, program, and organization ofrural youth clubs. 72 3.Select, train, assign, and supervise personnel at state orprovisional levels. 4.Cooperate with youth leaders at the state or provincial level in:Introducing the idea of youth work to village leaders andparents. C.anizing village youth councils to sponsor club activitiesalone or with existing community organizations.Recruiting members and helpin choose projects. Organizing village youth clubs selecting and trainingvillage adult leaders. 5.Coordinate rural youth program with adult work and cooperatewith staff in charge of adult work. 6.Administer the program. 7.Maintain records and reports, prepare budgets. 8.Measure progress through periodic evaluation. State or Provincial LeadershipTo achie-Je the full impact of a rural youth program in a country, the supervision:must be as close tc the actual operations as possible. While it is not necessary to havepersonnel in ever:-: state or province at the beginning, efficient leadership should belocated and trained in each area as the program progresses. One-leader is needed in eachstate or province. He will:Work with and under the national youth leader to help and supervisecounty or municipal youth leaders.Help train country or municipal pea,sonnel to organize and operatethe rural youth program.Help plan anti carry out special activities of interest to ruralyouth, such as exhibits, contests, tours, camps, and sponsorshipfor awards and recognition.Obtain records and reports on progress and development of the ruralyouth program in his region. County orLocating qualified and trained professional leadership at this level is mostessential in organizing and promoting the rural youth program. These leaders should havemany of the qualifications of the national rural youth leader.These workers actuallycontact parents, prospective members, and village leaders. Therefore, they must be trainednot only in agricultural and homemaking development and improvement, but also in how towork with people to gain their interest and cooperation. 73 Leadership at this level must:Keep informed on the aims, objectives, program, and methods of organizing and promoting the youth program.Know the economic conditions in each village and the needs andinterests of youth in the area.Tell leaders and parents about the rural youth program.Help local village leaders organize a village youth council or committee to sponsor the program alone or with existing organizations. Help leaders and officers plan programs for club meetings.Help determine community service projects for the members to uundertake. Teach members how to conduct meetings, select and judge exhibits, and put on demonstrations. Teach members pr,:per methods and practices for their projects.Select local volunteer leaders and teach them to help theirmembers carry out project requirements. Community or LeadershipThe most important link in the rural youth program is the local volunteer leader in each community or village. These leaders may be parents, school teachers, or religious leaders who live in the village and are in regular contact with the youth. In most countries they serve on a voluntary basis without pay.They direct the youth in their programs and activities and see that members carry out the instructions of the professional youth leader. Development of a National Youth Program Developing a national program that will effectively reach the rural youth of a country requires a great deal of imagination and planning. A plan that is effective in one country may not work well in another. Each country must plan its program to fit its own situation, culture, and needs. The first job in launchi?Ig a rural youth program is to determine what needs to be done, where to begin, the money and people needed, how to divide responsibility, and a timetable.The new program must begin on a small scale and expand with the increase in trained personnel and funds available. However, the initial planning should envisage a program of national scope. Goals must be set fa enough in the future to allow for sound growth and development.Study and Planning Phase The importance of taking time to find out what rural people want most cannot be over emphaE,zed. What people want may be entirely different from what national leaders think they need. The felt needs of rural people can be the most important considerations and best starting points in determining the direction and content of a rural youth program. When programs are based on needs the people become appreciative, cooperative, and enthusiastic about working with other villagers for improvement. 74 Study the socio-economic situation and standard of living of farming communitiesin different sections of the country. This will require visits to the various communitiesto get a clear picture of the situation.Try to determine the basic attitudes of farmers throughout the country.Note thedifferences in the progress being made in different areas, and observe farmers' attitudesabout changes in farming.Observe climatic and soil conditions in order to plan future farm youth clubprojects.All projects must be based upon members' needs and the projects' adaptability toarea conditions.Study ways to integrate the farm youth program into extension work with adults.Contact the various branches of the Ministries of Agriculture and Education to inform themof your plans and enlist support for the program.Seek out field extension staff who have worked with farm youth. Learn from theirexperiences.Strfly any former attempts to organize rural youth programs.Note the food habits of different sections of the country and observe dietaryproblems.Decide how youth clubs might help correct them.Study the needs of youth, farmers, and housewives,Review PrinciplesThe broad principles of rural youth work are the same in all countries.However,the specific programs, projects, organizational procedures, and supporting bulletins willdiffer since they must all be adapted to local conditions. Start the rural youth programwhere the people are. It should be related to their needs and interests and adapted totheir situation and culture.Most youth club activities should take place on or near the member's home andfarm.Parents should be encouraged to attend and help with the activities.The clubs must belong to the people. The membersmustregard the clubs astheirs and not as the property of the government or the sponsoring agency. Members shouldrun their own clubs. The clubs should become a part of the community and something ofwhich the community can be proud.Volunteer leaders are essential to a successful rural youth program. Thereleaders expand the work and help make it a people's program.Each member should undertake a specific task with his own hands.Re should havean interest in, a responsibility for, and perhaps ownership of a farm or home project. Theproject depends upon local conditions but the most common are growing vegetables, raisingpoultry, making a garment, and preparing food. Many others may be developed as needs andinterests arise.Projects, the heart of the rural youth program, lend themselves to \"learning bydoirip.They teach members improved farm and home practices and often influence parentsand others in the community to adopt new methods. Suggested project requirements arelisted on page 90.Developing PhaseIn this phase the objectives of the program are formulated. Administrativepolicies and procedures are established. A plan for organizing pilot clubs is developed.The above tasks are more effectively accomplished when those who have an interest in 75 developing a rural youth program are asked for advice.These advisors may be organized into a guiding committee and may be both government and non-government people. Such an advisory committee means more and acquires more status when members are appointed by ahigh government official such as the Minister of Agriculture.Printed material must be prepared to support the program.Such material includes project requirements and standards, leaflets on projects and records, leader guide::,promotional, organizatioeal, and subject matter leaflets as well as any other simpleprinted material that might help develop a sound program.Promotional leaflets explain the purposes of the youth movement in simple terms.Organizational leaflets tell field staff and volunteer leaders how to organize a youth club, help plan a program, make project visits, conduct a meeting, and give other essential information.Subject matter leaflets are written to help the member with his project.Staff training is an important task in this phase. Where the program is sponsored by an existing extension service field staff that is available to organize rural youth work, training is more easily accomplished. If the y:elth program is sponsored by an organization which has no staff, the national leader must train local leaders directly.He must also develop interest in rural youth work among the people in pilot villages and ask their help in finding leaders. Training in either case should include an understanding of objectives, policies,staff relationships, responsibilities of staff and lay personnelimethods of arousing interest in youth work, enlisting support of community leaderal'soliciting parental support, and securing leadership. A sample training _:ogramme is outlined on page 93.Organize Pilot Clubs The number of clubs first organized is not as important as the distribution. If possible, every region should have at least one club.Two or three would be preferable since failure of one club can mean the club idea fails. Close attention needs to be given to these pilot clubs since they are the field test of all the policies, principles, andprocedures developed thus far. It is said that \"nothing succeeds like success\".A successful pilot club in a community will lead to an expanded program. If pilot clubs fail it is usually years before any further attempt can be made to organize others.This developing phase of the program should last 12 to 18 montee depending on local situations. This allows enough time to thoroughly test all policien, 1,einciples, and procedures of the new movement.Committee Reviews Progress The advisory committee now needs to review progress of the developing phase and plan future development of the program. A continuing review is necessary to thoroughly adapt rural youth principles to local conditions.Plan to Train Local Leaders Considerable effort has already been spent to recruit local leaders for the clubs.It is important to train these leaders to do their job properly. Their constant support is essential to the long-term success of a farm youth program. A leader training program is described on page 96.Solicit Support from the Nation's LeadersEStablish the role of rural youth programs in national policy. Publicity can point out the accomplishments and value of rural youth programs. The Minister of Agriculture should take the lead and call the merits of the program to the attention of government leaders. National leaders quickly ;ecognize the need for a program that helps 76-- youth to appreciate agriculture. A simple reporting system integrated with the extensionservice's annual report will help.Expanding the ProgramTraining additional staff is a prerequisia. .-.43ansion.The goal is to reachmany thousands of rural youth instead of the few hundr :reached in the developing program.This can be done if the principles of extension rural youth programs have beea followed andadapted to local conditions. The program has been field tested and its role has beenestablished in government. Before the benefits of a rural youth program become a realityto the developing nation, much hard wt.,* remains to be done.The above steps are the majorones needed to develop a national rural youth program.As rural youth clubs become active throughout the country the benefits will befelt in many ways. Their impact will be felt first when the clubs are organized, and withincreasing intensity later as the members develop into mature citizens.The farm boys andgirls will put their boundless energies to practical tasks which create wealth.They willprovide the leadership to help their p3ople progress. People become proud of the achieve-ments of their local rural youth club.The unpaid volunteer leaders become better and more productive as a result of theirwork with farm youth clubs. They also improve their ability to lead and assume anincreasingly important role in their communities.Projects serve as an example for the club members' parents and neighbours.Conservative farmers and housewives feel that the improved methods will work as well f.orthem as they did for the youth and many adopt new and more productive methods. Field agricultural workers find that they gain much goodwill and confidence fromrural folks through their work with farm youth. They find their day-to-day work withfarmers, housewives, and parents easier because they have taken an interest in and helpedtheir children.Develop illeaninimes and Symbols sGreat organizatione and movements have and always have had their battle cry,colours, pledge, and march song. Such characteristics identify organizations, challengepeople to greater effort, and arouse their loyales. Examples of the emblem, pledge andmotto used in the United States are described on page 96.Rural youth clubs are usually known by the same name throughout an entirecountry.When a club is organized, it usually adopts the name of the youth program inthat country.The names vary from country to country. Most countries have adopted a namewhich refers to the fourfold development of youth-Health, Head, Heart, and Hands. This isexpressed as 4-D, 4-S, 4 -T, 4-F, 4-C, etc., depending on the words meaning these fourthings.OrPanizing the Clubkiroduce Idea to Villa Leaders One way to organize a i youth club ia A ,r,r%ge is to present the idea tothe village chief and as many otli,r leaders and parn possible.Another effective war'to start a club is to demonstrate a sim0e skill oripractice to the children andtheir parents. When they are interest the pareAtu if they would like their childrento learn more. If the program is suppori,:zi the cent/'al government, the village chiefmay already have been told about it.In this.case, he may gather other leaders and parentstogether so the professional youth leader can tell thew -77 the objectives of the club,the benefits to the youth,the benefits to the families and village,the responsibilities of the members, parentx., local leaders,and professional youth leaders, how to select and organize a sponsoring committee of 3 to 5 members to promote the program, Meet with Sponsoring Survey the social and economic conditions and needs of the youth and the village.Select projects which fit the needs of the families and are best suited to the abilities of the youth. Develop a plan for starting the projects and following them through to success.Meet with eligible youth and their parents to discuss the proposed program.Consider prospective adult club leaders.Recruit Members At this point, village leaders understand the rural youth program and know they are responsible for local leadership. Parents have been contacted. The idea has been established.-.ow bring the youth into the process.Present the purpose and program of the youth club.Explain what the club is, its value and who can join, and the requirements for membership. Explainmembers will work on projects, selectexhibits, keep records, an0 take part in activities.Explain what projects are and give members an opportunity to discuss suitable projects with their parents. Help them select one suited to their needs and ability. Help youth fill out applicaticrls for membership.Be sure they choose a.project and have the approval of their parents.Election of Officers &plain what officers are needed and what they do.President: Works with the leader to arrange for club meetingsand plan and promote the club program.Presides over all club meetings. Appoints committees when necessary. Follows parliamentary rules and order.Keeps up the interest of membera. 78 - Helps to plan and arrange for programs. - Works with local leader in planning and promotingthe club program. Vice-President: - Learns the duties of the president. - Presides in absence of president. - Helps to plan recreation activities. - Serves on program committee.- Helps club members with records. Secretary-Treasurer: - Keeps records of attendance and minutes of allmeetings.- Reads minutes of previous meeting. - Distributes any literature available. - Keeps records cf any money raised by the cliA. Explain how officers are elected, how to nominate, and how to vote. Supervise the election of officersDivide the members of the club into groups according to the projects they haveselected. Have each group elect a project captain and an adult project leader. These groupswill hold special -- meetings to discuss their particular project work, but will also be a partof the village youth club.The entire club may elect a local adult leader who will meet with the club andhelp them in all their activities. Sponsoring committees can be very helpful in findingadult local leaders.How to Conduct a MeetingA club meeting is held so members can learn how to improve project work, exchangeideas and experiences, learn to preside over meetings,take part in programs, learn newmethods, and develop team work and cooperation. Normally a meeting proceeds as follows: - The president calls the meeting to order.-All members stand and repeat the club pledge. - The secretary calls the roll. - The secretary reads the minutes of the previous meeting. - Unfinished business. The president asks for reports ofcommittees on nrograms, meetings, or special activities,and opens meeting to discussion of business continuedfrom the previous meeting.

It also enables lkeeaers to planand prepare in advance, and tells parents about events and dates so they can help members prepare. The plan lists what the club hopes to achieve, events and activitiesland the time, placer and program for all meetings. A minimum plan would include:Time and place of replier meetings. Meetings may be needed often untilofficers know their responsibilities and members understand how to conduct their projects. After that, one meeting each month may be enough.A program for each regular meeting. Show who takes part.Special activities for the year: . A club fair with exhibits of products made or grown by each memberwith awards list.. A judging contest. . A demonstration contest with each member d eonstrating some practicelearned. Projects A project is the farm or home activity a member chooses to do. He follows therecommendations of his local leader who works under the guidance of a professional youth leader. The entire club program is built around the project. It is the very heart and core of the rural youth movement. It cannot be overemphasized.Projects may be organized around almost any farm or home task or activity. Theycan include the feeding, care, and management of a pig, milk goat, lamb, dairy calf, poultry, or rabbits; cultivating a Tacit of vegetables, potatoes, corn, wheat, or other crop;improving one room in the home; preparing and serving meals; making clothing; making anyuseful article or handicraft; or improving health by removing health hazards. 2219PuccectTo help members learn eew ancl better 1,wre: of farming and homemaking.To show parents and neighbours the value of these practices. 80 To teeth youths to be dependable and responsible.To give youth an incentive to work and the feeling they are usefulmembers of their family and community.To give members the pride and satisfaction of ownership.To give youth the satisfaction of accomplishment,To give members a wholesome, useftl and profitable use fortheir time.To give members a way to participate in the youth club andenjoy the benefits of group programs and activities. Selection of ProjectsAlthough many activities may be projects, determine the major needs and interestsof several villages and limit the number of projects. Use those which teach definiteimproved practices.Select projects for each villsge after the youth leader has thoroughly studiedand discussed needs with local leaders, parents, and interested youth. The selection ofprojects;should be based on the need for improvement in the village;should be based on the youth's interest and ability to do the job;should help improve family health, sanitation, food supplyand housing;should be prastical in terms of cost and time needed;should challenge the best efforts of the members.Elements of a Successful ProjectWhenever possible, a boy or girl Should cwn or have fall responsibility for theanimal, the poultry, the garden, or the article made or produced.The member should do all woxle on the project.Members and parents must understand how the production, increase, articles made,or income from the project will be handled.Any income from the project Should go, in part at least, to the member. This willgive him satisfaction from his work. In some cases, it may be shared between parent andmember.Ishould be a fair business agreement, whether '-he member owns the project oronly has full responsibility for it.If a financial return is not possible, the member should be recognized for work welldone in esly appropriate manner within the limits of the parents, Keeping the egember interested in his pr.,,act should be the first consideration when project arrangements are discussed.SuccessfUl projeets are the result of coopersten among the xecfessional youth ader, local leaders, parts, and members.Which projects will be ae.able in each village should be determined by local leaders, parents, and the professeeial youth 'eader. The latter knows what help he can give.The member, the parents, and the -local /e :der should all be involved in selecting and planning- how to wary out a project.The source of supply fer materials needed for each pl'oject must be planned. Know who will supA,. the seed, fertilizer, insectie_let cloth, animal, or poultry required for each project. The professional youth leader should clearly explain the requirements for members so local leaders, parents, and members uAlerstand.troject ftemi4ernents These requirements are taken from 1,4e eaete which have been gathered by the Ministry of agriculture through research, and by trial and adaptation of results from ocher countries.They convey the message of improved farming and homemaking which the government has to offer farmers and village people for increasing production, increasing income, and improving rural living conditions. The project is the place for government agriculturalrepresentatives, the member, and his family to meet and exchange useful and helpful information. Every projee. selected for promotien in a village, or throughout the country, should have an outline of the recommended pratices which, if followed and carried out, will result -in improved production and qualflof product.Financing Projects Projects must be geared to local economies. In some areas conditions do not permit even the most meager outlay of funds for a new project. Yet the seed or animals must be improved to improve production. Following are possible ways of financing c.e initiating projects in a village, area, or country.i'irst, begin with what people have. That means select projects that fit their needs, and use the seed, poultry, or animale available. This still giveo a chance to teach principles of management, responsibility, and dependability.A local farmer may be able to supply members with project materials. A leader in poultry production can give nembers a start and be paid back from the increase.Local agricultural schools and missions may be a source of seed, animals, or poultry.They may be willing to start a chain program. In this ,:ase members do not pay for their start in a project, but pay back seed, poultry, or animals out of the first crop, hatch, or increase. This is used to start a new member's project.The ministry of agriculture's bureaux of agronomy., plant pe)duction, animal science, and others often have supplies of seeds, eggs; poultry, and livestodk. These are distributed by organizations such as the extension service to farmers and rural youth club members who will either pay the loan back from the increase of pass put of the increase on to another member or farmer. 82 Credit or Cooperative Organizations and AgenciesMany countries have different types of cooperatives, including credit cooperativeswhich supply loans for agricultural improvement. Among these are agricultural credit banks,commodity cooperatives, credit cooperatives, production credit associations, and others. While these arganizatiens exist primarily to make loans to farmers, many of themhave ..veloped plans for financing youth club projects. Such loans are made for theireducational value as well as to initiate new enterprises. routl, club members keep recordson expenses and income from their projects.Loans are considered as a part of their trainingprogramIlinking credit to production and record keeping.The following projects have been supported in the initial stages by cooperatives: PoultryWith their parents' approval, one cooperative loaned youth club membersenaath money to buy 100 baby chicks of an improved breed.Their applications wereaccompanied by agreements emphasizing the work to be done to prepare for thechicks, such as making a brooder and arranging for feed, and a plan to repay theloan by culling cockerels or producing pullets. Beef CalfAnother member, with his pal ate' approval, got a loan to buy a beefcalf by agreeing to provide pasture and leed and to sell the animal six monthslater at a youth club show or auction sale. He planned to pay his note from theproceeds of that sale.Dairy CalfAnother parent 'aimed a member's application for a loan to buy ahairy heifer.The member agreed to rroduce feed, pasture, and a cash crop.Heplanned to use the money earned fTae. he cash crop, selling the first offspring,and selling milk after the heif Atered production to pay off the note. Project RecordsKeeping records is important in the allaround development of the club member.Because of this,, records are required for project completion.Project records: Develop members' unierstanding.Prc.ide information for later reference. Sti'aulate members to improve themselves. Show others what has been done.Qualify for awards.Explaining the values of recordkeeping to new members is important. It shouldbe done early in the club meetings. This will avoid many incomplete projects. Records aaea very good way to persuade adults to follow good practices. Results achieved at homa arehard to ignore. Records are valuable also for publicie area and national results ofyouth work.The essentials of a od indivtLual project record include: simple inventory; go(b) list of costs and income; (o)profit and loss; (d) success and problems encountered;and (e) a brief narrative af project growth and development. A member completes his project when he fulfills the requirements and turns in hisstory and record book, filled out to the best of his ability. The leader's oignature onthe record book means that the club member has Completed his work to his and the leader'ssatisfaction. - 83 - Record-keeping is easier for some than for others. Hhcourage members to take pride in their records. This may be done by calling the record a junior business or partnership deal with parents. Point out the similarity to a businessman's books records.Neatness is important, but not essential. Younger members should use c- rather than a pen. Have aim; e record books for beginners zind more advanced records for older members, especially in lives o,:k projects. Keep reccTds functional. Do not permit the record to become an end product. It is only a way to develop well trained youth.As they learn, they keep a more complete record and take pride in it.*.Then it is necessary to close records before crops are harvested or animals are sold, help the elta, member estimate his yields by weighing or measuring fair samples. Help him calculate his total yield. This will give him the experience he needs and qualify his reports.psecial Activities Many special activities can be used in the youth program to attract and hold members' interest. Young people lore action, competition, achievement, and recognition. Some activities may be classed as teaching techniques and some as recreatiz:n, but all can be competitively geared to the developmental needs of youth. The following activities are educational, competitive and recreational. They develop talent, personality, and leadership.Method Demonstration A method demonstration is a way to show how to do something and explain what is done and why.A method demonetratiou may be given by an individual or by two people alternately presenting the materials and explaining what to do.A youth leader may use method demonstrations to teach at meetings. Members may also give method demonstrations. A contest can be held when several members give demonstra- tions and are scored on their presentation.How to c tline a demonstration: .StepsWhat to doEquipment, or material needed What to say How to score method demonstrations:The DemonstratorAppearance, voice, posture, mannerPresentationIntroductionScore25% 50% EquipmentCharts or modelsExpressionOrlerly steps in presentation ZIummaryZubjact maters84 255 Source of material, valid and correctKnowledge of subject as shown ,:ry answers to questions Judpinr EXhibits or ProductsJudging is comparing products or exhibits with an ideal standard.It is usedto teach knowledge of quality products, market standards, or breed and variety types. Steps in conducting a judging contest.Arrange 4 samples of something where they may easily be seen and compared. Place a letter, AE CDI by each sample or identify it some other way. Give each member a card with the same letters on it.Have members study each sample or exhibit and compare it with theirknowledge of the ideal product.Have members mark their placing by writing \"1\" on the'r cards by the letterthey think is first, \"2\" by the letter representing the sample placed second,etc.Grade the cards against the proper placing.The official judging is done by a person familiar with the ideal or standardof the item being judged. He then gives the official placinasand the reasonsfor them. PhlibitsAn exhibit is a representative sample of something a member has made, grown,produced, or managed as a youth club project displayed so others can see what he has done.Every member should be encouraged to present an exhibit. Members should because: It is aAng experience.It helps to raise the standard of type and quality of products. It shows the public what they are doing..It lets them compare their work with others. It recognizes their accomplishments.It advertises products that are available. 85 The requirements for exhibits in each commodity or type of product should be clearly understood. When several members' exhibits are being compared, the official judging of exhibits is done by someone who is familiar with the item being judged.Exhibits are judged against an ideal or standard described on a score card.In judging the exhibit the best item, product, or animal may be given first prize, the next best second prize, and so on to five or more placings. Another method is to group the items, products or animals as excellent, good, and fair or commendable with every member receiving recognition. A collection of individual exhibits may be arranged to form an attractive community or village club exhibit to publicize the work and achievement of the youth club members. Tours Taking club members to see the work of other members in a community helps stimulate the interest of both the member visited and the visitors. A member's work to ready his project for guests to observe is good for both the member and his parents.Members may observe the projects of other members in their own club, or one club may observe the work of a club in a neighbouring village.Recreation \"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" is an old saying. Youth club work, however, tries to develop joy in doing any task well, the spirit of a group trying \"to make the best better.\" Organized play has a part in every gathering of youth. Therefore, every club meeting should include at least one game led by a member or leader who has prepared for it in advance. Local Adult Leaders Importance of Leadershi The success of any youth program depends to a great degree upon its leadership at all levels. The local leader is an extremely important member of the rural youth organization. It is only through local leadership that a rural ,youth program may be made available to large numbers of boys and girls.Who is a Local Leader? A local leader is a person from the community who is selected tz' guide, teach, and advise the local rural youth club. The leader may be a parent, a teacher, Ar any other adult in the community who likes to work with boys and girls.Oualifications of leaders Too often the technical competence of a person is regarded as his most important, qualification as a leader. Far more important is the person's attitude toward young people.,Does he like boys and girls? Is he patient, tolerant, and sympathetic toward their shortcomings? Does he enjoy helping boys and girls, does he give praise when deserved,can he criticize constructively, does he give encouragement? Does he set a good example, is he accepted and respected in the -'illage? Does he have the confidence of parents, the community, and club members? A leader with the above qualifications will learn the technical things he needsto lead his club and will always be a few steps ahead of his club members. Even if hedoesn't know all the answers about their projects, the members will not care because oftheir fondness for him and respect for his leadership. How is the Local Leader Selected?The professional leader can invite or select a leader after consulting members ofthe community. This method is often used when a club is first organized. A local sponsoring committee or official can invite someone to be the leader afterconsulting the community. For example, parents in the community may have been consultedfirst.Club members can invite someone to be their leader.This method is perhaps mostsuccessful after the club has been organized and developed for a time. What Does the Local Leader Do? The 1957 Latin American Rural Youth Leaders' Workshop outlined some responsibilitiesof the local leader. A leader should:Visit members\u00b0 homes to get acquainted with them and their families. Help with the meetings and any other activities the club may organize.When not able to help, he must designate a substitute. Advise and instruct the members in the s?lection and proper developmentof their projects.Explain to parents what members must do and the purposes of the youth club. Distribute responsibility for club activities among the various members ofthe club.Work for good relations between the club and other community groups andinstitutions, such as the church, the schools, the parents, and organizedgroups.Recruit new members.Stimulate club participation in community activities. Cooperate with special national programs or campaigns. A project leader can help his members succeed by: Visiting members' homes and projects to encourage them and their parents. Attending members' regular meetings.Giving subject matter instruction and guidance. Holding a tour to observe the work of each member. Encouraging pride by placing signs identifying members' projects. Training Locp_l_LeP.ders Visits of the professional leader to the new leader provide a very direct kind oftraining.They are -specially useful when a new leader is beginning his work. However, suchvisits are limited by the time the professional leader has for such visits. They offer theadvantage of discussing a problem that is important at that time. If a new local leader visits clubs that are already functioning with a localleader, he can learn of procedures already tried both the successful and the unsuccessful.This method also provides the inspiration of talking with another leader. Local leaders can also be trained through bulletins, letters, radio announcements,etc. directed toward them. A leader training meeting is a very effective method when a number of leaders canbe brought together for training on a particular subject or method. The details of a leadertraining meeting held in Thailand are on page 97. Talks, lectures, and other teaching methods used in a general meeting to informpeople on such subjects as gardening or nutrition could be useful to rural youth clubleaders in their work with certain club projects. When such general meetings are held, therural youth leader should be invited to attend. Tours, exhibits, and displays can be used in an informal way. Posters or displaysmay be sent from club to club to emphasize some principles for the leaders to teach. Adisplay and an explanation can be set up in the office of a professional leader. Tours can provide a more direct type of training. On a tour of garden projects,the professional leader may give subject matter information, recognize work well done, andinspire the club members to better work. On a later garden tour the professional leadermay not be present, but the local leader will know what to do. When slides or films on a special subject such as home improvement are announcedin a community, the local rural youth club leader should be invited to attend.SorneGenejgalSufor Leader Training. Any method of leader training must meet the needs of the leaders. The trainingofficer or professional leader must understand the needs and problems of the leaders beingtrained.In other words he must be able to put himself \"into the shoes', of the leaders. It is better to do a few things well than to try to teach everything in onemeeting or demonstration. Any training must give the leaders additional information, skill, and confidencein themselves as they go back to teach and guide their clubs. Good leader training adds to the satisfaction a leader received from hisassociation with the rural youth program. It helps him continue to be a real key to thesuccess of the youth. Parents as LeadersParents are vitally important to the success of youth work. They: Help their children because they love them. Like to feel that they have an important role in the success el- theirchildren.Appreciate approval and recognition for their part in promoting youthwork. Like to attend youth activities. Invite them.Generally become enthusiastic for rural youth work when they know its programand accomplishments.Cooperate when they understand the'program. They need to know how they cancooperate.Ask them. Tra_ininF Professional Youth Workers No team can perform any better than its members. They need instruction and practice.People who work with rural youth programs must have certain personal qualities, plus specifiitraining and knowledge in dealing with youth and working with the technical problems facingfarm families.New rural youth personnel should like te work with young people, understand the needsand interests of youth, having a pleasing personality, be able to gain parents' confidence,and have graduated from at least a secondary school.Personnel recruited for rural youth work should have the best possible trainint; inagriculture, home economics, and the characteristics of rural youth. They should also havetraining in the field of humanities or rural sociology where possible.Before going on a job's, new worker should be given from one to two months' intensivetraining in the principles, philosophy, programs, organization, methods, and procedure ofthe rural youth program. Re should also se...ve as an apprentice to an experienced fieldworker for one to three months.After assignment to a special area, this worker should receive frequent and Closesupervision from an experienced and sympathetic supervisor who will listen to his problemswith patience and understanding and help him solve them. He should participate in monthlyconferences with coworkers in similar positions to exchange experiences and plan furtherprogram improvements.Evaluating a Rural Youth ProptamEverything a person does he immediately questions. He asks himself, \"How well did Ido? How can I improve if I do this again?\" Others appraise us too. This knowledge drivesus to constant improvement. This is evaluation.People responsible for directing a youth program need information to gauge progress ordetermine changes and emphasis. Records and reports supply some information, but there areother checks.See what is accomplished. Listen to what people say. Visit clubs andprojects, with leaders and parents. See what new products are on the market. Make a survey. Try the plan below for evaluation. Decide: 1.What you want to evaluate (what part of your program, activity, methods, etc.)2.What you want to find out. 3.What the objective is. What have you done to reach the objective?4.What evidence of its success or failure you will look for.5.From whom you will get this evidence. 6.How you will get ti'is evidence. 7.How you will analyze and use the information after you get it.Plag111721211AtagjairlS12191L tried and tested organizational plan for rural youth work in one country can seldom be effectively applied in another colultry.However, studying organizations in several countries often reveals ideas which can be adapted to meet existing situations.A rural youth program begins in the mind of a leader who can see ito influence upon and benefit to the rural youth of his country or community. It must have the approral of leading government officials if it is to continue and possibly expand.Since rural youth work centers around activities on the farm and in the home and rural village, the greatest technical assistance should come from the ministry of agriculture. Therefore, greatest benefit is usually obtained when the responsibility for directing the program is placed in the manistry ofagriculture. A rural youth program should be based upon the recognized needs of youth and their families.It will be more successful if the youth have a voice in planning their programs and activities. Youth around the world want: To play. To learn how to make a living. To feel important. To work and achieve. A well organized rural youth program that recognizes these desires can do much toward developing the individual. Projects and activities should:Fit the family's economic status.Fit the needs and ability of youthsimple for beginners, more advanced for older youth. Lend themselves to learn - try-do experiences.Stimulate the interest of and develop a sense of responsibility in young people. Concentrate on organizing and following through on a few clubs to insure achievementand success.Successful clubs can be used as examples to sprcad the program to neighboringvillages.The success of rural youth work in a village will depend to a very great extent uponadult interest and support. EStablishing village interest and support, and training localleaders is usually the biggest and most important task in developing a rural youth program.The leaders of a village need to understand the educational and developmental features ofthe: program.Once these village leaders realize the program's value to their youth, they arerev.dy to take some responsibility for the work. The wise professional leader uses these key village leaders. If he keeps them informedand stimulates their interest, they will do many things.These include recruiting youth ..leaders and organizing and sponsoring local youth club fairs, exhibits, village achievementprograms, visits to club members, demonstration contests, field days, picnics, recreationalactivities, athletic events, and other activities closely associated with the local culture. The successful promotion of a rural youth program depends upon the extent to whichleadership is selected, trained, and financially supported. Host youth club failures arebecause professional personnel do not perform efficiently or local leaders have not beenproperly shown their chrties. Youth clubs are most effective where the responsibility formaintaining the club rests with local leadership, but the responsibility and opportunity fortechnical training and instruction is accepted by the professional youth leader.lrojec't StandardsThe following are merely guides in establishing project requirements.They must beadapted to fit the culture and conditions of the country using them.Project requirementsshould offer a challenge, yet be within the member's ability to understand and achieve. Theyshould be simple for younger members and more advanced for experienced members. Field Crops(corn, wheat, rice) project members should: Prepare land for plantingt cultivate, control weeds and insects, fertilize, irrigate(where necessary)f and harvest according to instructions.

The following are characteristic of 4-H Clubs in the United States: The Emblem - The national emblem is a green four-leaf clover with a white \"H\" on eachlobe.These four \"E\"s represent the four-fold development of the Head, Heart, Hands andHealth.This insignia identifies a member of a 4 -H Club. The 4-H Club Fledge ist \"I pledge -My head to clearer thinking,My heart to greater loyalty,My hands to larger service, andMy health to better living,For my club, may community and my countrY.\" The 4-H motto is \"To Make the Best Better\". The aim is to begin with what the youngpeople have and improve it. This also applies to the member who attempts to grow inknowledge, leadership, character and citioenehip. The 4-H Club colors are green and white. Green represents nature's moat commoncolor and symbolizes life, growth and youth. White symbolizes purity.Local Leader TramSeveral countries have conducted excellAnt training courses for local volunteerleaders.They favor an extended initial training course of one week.In one year, Thailand held three training courses for local leaders for three weekseach.One hundred and twelve leaders were trained. -97- Thailand's LocalleadmIrainanglrogram The study of local volunteer rural youth leaders in Thailand's Yuwa Kasikorn\"clubs revealed that they wanted and needed help in: Subject matter Project requirements Developing a yearly club program Making an effective home project visit Teaching recreational skills Making simple visuals Teaching techniques Informing and working with people in the community Organizing and supervising clubs Helping members feel a part of the groupGiving boys and girls responsibili Actively involving all members Giving demonstrations Knowing the objectives andd philosophy of Yuwa Kasikorn work. The following observations were drawn from several local leader training meeting:Leaders felt that developing community and parent support is very important,but they seemed to lack confidence in their ability to develop this support.The leaders had very little confidence in their ability to make yearly clubprogram plans. Leaders had surprisingly limited knowledge of project requirements. Leaders felt that home economics should be included in the youth program.Leaders had very little confidence in their ability to make and use simplevisual aids or to teach recreational games to club members.They felt that they had gained more from training programs where visualsand demonstrations were used. These recommendations are based on Thailand's experience: Ask some leaders to help plan the program. Plan far enough ahead so the teacher can prepare thoroughly. Include fewer topics and allow enough time.

They are goals which reflectmy people's and my government's fight against poverty, ignorance and disease. The five major mals of the Kenya 4-K program are as follows: a.To teachuth improved methods of agriculture. To teach rural boys andgirls better fam.imi home_practices which will contribute towards betternutrition, health and a highei.-standard of living. Generally, these aresimple, but essential practices.1/ Manual for 4-K Local Leaders and Kenya 4-K Clubs by Agricultural Staff, Kenya Departmentof Agriculture. b.To teach youth to appreciate agriculture and the dignity of labor with respectfor agriculture as a profession. Farm youth learn that farming with improvedmethods is more than just digging the soil. It is a better way of life. c.To help youth to produce food for their families and for sale. Produce foodand fibre for home and market.

From theinception of our 4K program we have made a special effort to bring about achange in the habits of adult farmers through the 4K movement. To helpaccomplish this, we have emphasized the organization of 4K clubs to becommunity based rather han on a local school compound basis. When the farmerobserves his son or daughter using an improved practice on hie own farm, herelates it to himself and his situation. Often when the same farmer sees hischildren doing something at school he does not relate this to himself. Thuswe have emphasized that the local 4K club should be organized on a geographicalbasis.It has been observed many times in Kenya that adult farmers can and dolearn from their children's 4K activities.

Have We in extension acquired this ability? If not, why not? Is it because we only look upon our work as a job or a means to earn a salary? Certainly this is important but ghat about the reason for this job being a paid. one.If there is a price or salary it must be for a purpose. We come back full cycle than that the job of extension is toteach others.For our efforts we are getting paid. Yet if we are not teaching we are not earning our pay. Going through the motions, planning, holding meetings, giving lectures,etc. may take up most of our time but end in poor results.Teaching is more than just a job.It is also an art. Are we artists? Just as a painter may study use of colors andtechniques, he may spend much time planning what he wants to paint, he may spend his energies putting paint on canvas and yet he may not come up with a picture, he is satisfiedwith or others may enjoy. Is he an artist? Certainly not until he changes the canvasinto something of beauty or meaning is he recognized as a true artist. The same is true of teachers.They may work at the job but never become true educators. Fortunately the art of teaching can be acquired. Once the science of teaching is learned and sufficientpractice has taken place teaching can result in effective learning.This will not happen: 1. If the extension worker is not sincere in his desire to work with people. This is the \"canvas\" he must convert into meaningful action. He mustwant and like to work with people. Unlike a painter who works withabstract things, oils, brushes, canvases, the teacher works with humanbeings. 2. If he does not thoroughly understand what the individual's needs,motivations, desires and resources are, he mist work with somethingthe individual can be taught to accept and understand as importantto himself not only what the teacher believes is important. Itbecomes an action of both teacher and learner. Teaching is not aone-way action or an end in itself.3. If he considers education so important that he uses coercion toobtain his ends. This only defeats the very thing we are tryingto accomplish - to help people change themselves not 'force themto change as many have tried to do in the past. History is fullof such stories where leaders have tried to force upon individualswhat they thought was good for them through laws, edicts, punishmentand drasticmeans. 1/ Joseph Ed Franco - Extension Specialist, FAO Rome, Italy *Adult Education XVI, Number 1, Autumn. 1965. Editor's notes.Thurman White, page 2 -102 4. If he underrates his audience.Too often teachers and extensioneducators in particular, lose patience with their students. Someeven believe that it is a hopeless task to teach rural adults, orcertain classes in society. It certainly is a hopeless task becausewith this attitude the teaching exercises are doomed to failure.The truth is the right way has not been found or applied by theteachers.Thevery essence of education is to help people change;this can be done at any level, class, group or locale of theindividuals if the right attitude and methods can be found. 5. If he does not know the techniques, methods and skills of teaching.The teacher, in addition to having sincere interest, believes ineducation and believes that those he serves must know how to do thejob.He must learn the advantages and disadvantages of his methodsfor. specific purposes. A person who only has a desire but does notknow how to de the 2ch may be well liked but he will not help peoplelearn.Nor can he ever acquire the satisfaction of real accomplishment.6. If he does not know his subject matter. This is the purpose of histeachingto teach something! The changes of knowledge or skillshe wishes to bring about are the objectives. It is fundamental thata person know his subject matter. In the case of extension personnelwe would add, or know how to acquire the subject matter (throughspecialists).Thus if we are to become proficient as extensionists (teachers) we must: 1. Be sincere in our desire to be teachers. 2. Understand the desire, needs and interest of those with whomwe work.3. Believe in education but not so strongly we want to use force. 4. Not underrate those we wish to help. 5. Know the techniques, methods and skills of teaching. 6. Know the subject matter,Unless teachers are able to acquire these qualifications they will only be teachersin name but not deed. They will draw their salary and may have a professional title, butthey will not be educators. This applies to extension workers. They too must becomeeducators in the full sense of the word.Once they accomplish this ability they can jointhe group of successful teachers who are the artists of their profession. Teaching vs. LearningJoseph Di Franco 1/ All of us involved in teaching have accepted a responsibility that tampers withother people's lives. There are laws in every land that are supposed to protect peoplefrom interference from others. There are fines and punishments imposed whenever peopleare guilty of this kind of interference.Yet teachers are permitted to go on not onlytampering with adult lives but with the lives of children.Of course, it is assumedthat teachers interfere with lives with beneficial intent. Naturally we have acceptedthis role of the teacher asauseful role or there would be regulations against it. 1/ Joseph Di Franco Extension Specialist, FAO Rome, Italy -103- But do we as teaohers really understand our role as: (1) interfering, (2) as benefioiall (3) as a responsibility. In my case I must admit that I did not think this deeply although I have accepted the plaudits given the teaching profession. In most oases, I think teachers have considered teaching as a job which required a certain amount of effort necessary to justify the salary. The effort entailed: being on time, being in a certain place, carrying out the administrative details, making required reports and attending a minimum of social functions necessary to the position in the organization and community. Oh yea, there are also routine classes, assignments and activities necessary for completing the annual teaching program.But where was the \"learning\" process in all this. Did we \"learn\" people, as some old timers used to say or did we judge learning by the number of meetings we held, number of lectures we gave, number of chapters in a book or books we covered, number of days work completed, etc. Did we bring about change or did we assume change took place because we completed a program or projeot?I think it becomes very necessary that we start at the beginning and develop an awareness of our job as teachers to bring about beneficial change in people or as we put it \"help people learn.\" The process of learning has been stated in many ways but in each case it is implicit that the process takes place in the recipient or learner.Before a person learns he must: 1.Notice something. 2.Want something 3.Do something. 4.Get something.Expressed in other words we can say the steps in the learning process involve: 1.Awareness 2.Need 3.Action 4.SatisfactionGood teachers take these steps into account. The formula is not a precise one, however, nor is every teaching situation exactly alike.But regardless of the time, place or people involved, learning does not take place unless the \"learner\" experience these phases. Extension agents or teachers working wit!, adults have the same problems. They must work harder at the job of teaching because ...tey operate under a process of education that is not compulsory but involves voluntary students or participants. In extension the objective is to bring about change in an individual, meaning in most cases that before the new skill, practice or idea is accepted an old one must be discarded. Thus the emphasis on motivation of the individual to act must be convincing.But once the individual is convinced, he will act. It is at this stage that many agents claim success.We must admit that this is what extension is striving for. Unfortunately too many stop at this stage. Unless the individual receives satisfaction as a result of his actions, success cannot be claimed.The individual will reject the new and regress to the old idea, skill or practice. 104 In other words teaching may have taken place but learning has not. Successfulteaching depends upon the individual makinga \"permanent\" change. The teacher cannot restupon the fact that he has presented knowledge, he must prepare the \"learners\" so that theynotice, want, act and are satisfied.There are two definite roles for the teacher: 1.To prepare the \"learner\", and 2.Present knowledge.Too often teachers fail to do one or the other well enough. Failure in teachingcan always be traced to the failure of the teachers to take the \"student\" into account orthey failed to be sure of their facts (knowledge).Extension agents have a greater responsibility in the teaching process becausethey must live with their \"students\". The agents future is dependent upon the success ofthe people who have learned, not in how well the agents may feel they have taught.Extension educators need to study and become skilled in the art of teaching. Theart of preparing people so they can learn and the art of presenting knowledge that peoplecan learn.They must not, however, become so concerned in the art of teaching that theylose right of the ultimate objective which is: 'that people make desirable changes \"learn\"something. Chapter 7.- 105 - EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IN EXTENSION 1J Extension education is essentially a process of communication--communication ofideas and skills between and among people. It includes the transfer of technical informer- tion from its source to the farmer or villager, but it is more than that. Technical know- ledge is of no use unless it is accepted as authentic, is adapted to the needs of the villager and is put to use.Furthermore, the villager may not understand the information and need to ask questions. He may have special problems for which the extension worker must find answers. He may require more information. Therefore, an exchange of ideas back and forth between teacher (extension worker) and learner (farmer) is essential.Ability to communicate determines to a verj- ladle degree the success or failure of an extension worker. He has technical information from research and other sources. It is his responsibility to establish effective communication with the people he serves so they use this information to continually improve their agriculture and rural life.Let us examine this process of communication as it is used in extension teaching.The Teaching Situatior E/ The teaching situation is the actual coming together of the extension worker and people whom he serves. It can be an informal meeting like a farm and home visit, or office visit when the farmer comes to see the extension worker. It can be a demonstration by the worker or a local leader. It can be a village meeting where the extension worker shows a film then gives his own talk and answers questions.-In short, a teaching situation may develop wherever the extension worker is. The worker should always remember he is or can be a most important element of a teaching situation.He can not get away from teaching situations because he is first and foremost a teachcr, a teacher who brings extension education to adults.When I first began in extension, I replaced a man who was retiring after 33 years as an extension worker. Betold me, \"Never let the people down. They expect you to be their agricultural teacher wherever you are.At any kind of agricultural demonstration or meeting, at picnics or any kind of social or official gathering, you are an educator first and a citizen second. Don't forget that!\" The teaching situation is the opportunity for the extension worker to teach, but it just does not happen by itself. Creating an effective situation is mallav up to the worker`He whole program will stay on papaer or in his mind and will never materialize unless he makes it come alive. He does this by setting up teaching situations, hundreds of them.Each one is designed to move one extension objective or a definite part of one into reality.1/ Edited by Lyman J. Noordhoff, Extension Specialist, Office of International Extension, Federal Extension Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture Washington D.C.2/ Communication in Extension as Developed for Western Nigeria - Western Nigeria Ministryof Agriculture and Natural Resources p 3. Sender Receiver(formersender) Figure 7-1MessagePurposeContentTreatment \"Noise\"- 106 - Message Channel<This is Feedback Message Sender(former receiver) The communication process (S-M-C-R) consists of four essential elements: (1) Senderor communicator of ideas or information, (2) Message to be transmitted, (3) Channel ormeans of communication and (4) Receiver of information or audience.When an extension worker talks with one farmer, the extension worker may start theconversation;. therefore he is the sender, what he says is the message, the spoken word isthe channel and the farmer is the receiver. When the farmer replies the roles are temporilyreversed.The farmer is the sender and the extension worker becomes the receiver.Farmer'sresponse is called feedback.The Communicator A TeacherThe communicator (sender) is the originator of the communication. We as extensionworkers must take the initiative to establish communication with rural people and keep itfunctioning.Hence each of us is the communicator during much of the communication process.The communicator requires credibility. He needs to be believed and to have the confidenceof his audience. An extension worker can improve his credibility by learning to communicateeffectively.A good communicator 2../ 1.Knows his audience, its wants and needs; knows his message, its contentand how to present it; knows effective channels of communication to reachhis audience with his message; and knows his owl abilities and limitations 1/ Lyman J. Noordhoff - FES, USDA, Washington, D. C. Adapted from Sander's \"CooperatiYc.Extension Service. Prentice-Hall 1966 p. 532/ Communication in Extension as Developed for Western Nigeria - Western Nigeria Ministryof Agriculture and Natural Resources P.4 -107 2.Is interested in his audience and its welfare, and how his messagecan help; is interested in improving his skills in communication 3.Prepares his messages carefully, using appropriate materials anddevices to elicit interest and insure a successful reception ofthe messages 4.Speaks clearly 5.Uses words and language the people will understand 6.Realizes that mutual understanding between teaoher and learner --a common bond -- is mostly the teacher's responsibility 7.Is aware of the limits of time; does not try to unload the wholeburden of any topic at one time; chooses only those parts mostappropriate for the particular teaching situation; does not keeplearners too long at one time (boredom sets in sooner than you think).Of course the opposite of a good communicator is a poor one. He ...- Fails to bring messages really useful and appropriate to learners- Fails to give the complete story gni relate it to the learner's problems- Forgets that time and energy are needed to absorb and \"think over\" new ideas- Keeps on talking while others are not listening- Fails to develop credibility - Fails to know and understand the values, customs, prejudices and beliefs ofthe learners - Fails to start where the learners are in knowledge, skills, interest and need.The Messages Weas extension teachers, have important information and ideas which we hope our audience will receive and interpret exactly as intended. Often this is not the cameolueto incomplete information, poor presentation or other reasons. To help avoid thesedifficulties we need to consider our purpose, the content of the message, and how we presentit.. Our purpose or objective should be clearly in mind. What change in behaviour do we want to bring about? It can be a change in knowledge, attitude, skill or in what weexpect the audience to do. The content of the message should be relevent to the reoeiver.That is, it should be something of interest to him. It must be related to something he understands, feelsor thinks; something he can accept. The treatment of the message does much to make it acceptable and understandable to the receiver.It should be logically organized and in terms he or she understands.Furthermore, it should conform to acoepted social standards. Treatment can make a messageinteresting or dull and boring. - 108 - Channels of CommunicationExtension of teaching methods are channels of communication with the people served.These methods may be classified as visual, spoken or written. (Some are combined methods,like movies).Each has its advantages and disadvantages.\"Seeing is believing\" is an axiom of extension education. Picture writing is anancient form of communication, Pictures, charts, diagrams, exhibits and posters performvital communication functions in the most advanced societies. Visual and oral methodsare about the only methods for extension workers to serve illiterate peoples. Method andresult demonstrations were so useful in early extension work in the United States that thelocal extension worker was called a \"demonstration agent\".Spoken methods include individual contacts such as farm and home visits, officecalls, meeting of all kinds, radio and television and telephone calls. Except for radioand television, they allow two-way communication, a big advantage. Lack of understandingcan be detected and cleared up on the spot. Not only words but gestures and expressionsof both speaker and listener contribute to clear communication.But there are also disadvantages and obstacles to be overcome. Since an oralmessage is not recorded, the receiver may remember it differently than the sender meant it.Where precise instructions are only spoken, the - receiver has no way to refer back to whatwas said.Only a limited number of people can be contacted face -to -face in a day.This makesmoat oral communication expensive. Language can be a problem. Where extension worker andvillager opeai: different languages, spoken communication requires a third person as inter-preter.This is awkward and slow and may distort the message. Even when both extensionworker and villager speak the same language, words have different meanings and can bemisinterpreted. Fortunately, through repetition and questioning, those misunderstandingsoan often be detected and corrected.Radio has enabled millions of villagers to receive information of all kinds,especially since the introduction of inexpensive, transistor models. Radio and televisionare used extensively in extension education in both advanced and developing countries.These are fast, and inexpensive methods of disseminating information. Disadvantages arethat communication is only one-way, information cannot be adapted to local conditions andthe extension worker competes with many other communicators for attention and responseof the audience.In spite of its problems, a ken communication when au..lemerted with visualaids is a basic method of extension work with illiterate societies.Written communication is indispensable in day-to-day operation of any organization,including extension service. Technical information and instructions must be distributedto the staff.Records and reports must be prepared, kept available for use and submittedto superiors.The pUtlic must be kept informed of activities and accomplishments.Written communication has greater status and carries more authority than oralcommunications. Letters, bulletins, circulars, news stories, annoncements of events andmagazine articles contribute to extension education in literate societies. They providea low-cost method to disseminate information'to large numbers of people. But again thisis mostly one-way communication. Few people will change their methods of farming orhomemaking only because they read about it. However, when interestingly prepared, suchinformation will attract the readers attention and may stimulate him to seek more information.Among illiterate people, written information is of value to the extent that the few whocan read pass on information to others. - 109 - The effective extension worker will adapt his teaching methods to the subject, tothe communication skills of his audience and to the facilities available. Usually he will use two or more channels of communication in the same presentation.The Receiver or Audience 1/The audienceare thosewhom the communicator wishes to receive, understand and use the idea. If the audience is to make progress, the extension teacher somehow helps them to change -- change their knowledge, attitude or behaviour. If no change takes place there has been no communication --noioess.Communication has taken place if the cultivators learn facts about the new wheat knowledge); or if some of them begin: to feel the new wheat may offer some advantage (attitude); or if some decide to try it(behavior).The significant thing to remember is this while people in general are rather similar, they also differ in thousands of waysnearly all the result of past experience. Often some of these differences block communication. Differences in education mean different abilities to understand difficult concepts and technical language. For this reason communication often fails because the communicator uses language too hard for his audience to understand. An extension worker cannot expect much progress in getting his people to build sanitary latriness or to control flies and mosquitoes if they have not first learned the germ concept and the relationship between micro-organism and disease. Good extension teaching, therefore, requires a thorough study of audience. This means their abilities, backgrounds, interests and previous accomplishments. The more we know about the audience. the better job of teaching; we can do.Furthermore our knowledge of the groups with whom we work will help us plan our approach to them and select the best methods to use.An extension adviser was assigned the job of working with villlagers in a remote province. Arriving unannounced, he found no one in sight. People suspected any stranger, so his faced a real problem. He had to make contact with the village elders before he could get anything done. The adviser leant casually to an open owe and started drawing figures in the dust with a small stick. Youngsters soon appeared. As a small group gathered, he graduallyovercame their shyness by entertaining them with little tricks and games.Before long most of the children had gathered around him, enjoying themselves thoroughly.Gradually some of the parents edged in cautiously. After watching the action for a time, they too began to smile. This way the extension worker made contact with adult villagers through the children. By understanding his audience and by the use of simple visuals which they could understand, this extension worker was able to communicate effectively in what otherwise might have been a difficult situation. A communication theorist would call the villagers' suspicion of strangers \"noise\". Noise in this sense ishinthatjt____veroeseaeefromttinthroutotheintendedaudience.Noise may be fear, prejudice, inability to grasp the idea or any of many possible barriers. 1/ Using Visuals in Agriculture' Extension Programs - United States InternationalCooperation Administration pp 71-12,15, 16-18. - 110 - The point is that good communicators anticipate and try to prevent noise if theycan.And they are ready with means of overcoming barriers in case they arise.Communication failure also may occur when the idea being communicated seemscontrary to accepted local customs and beliefs. This too is noise. Recognizing thisdanger beforehand and planning alternate approaches to the problem is an essential partof successful communication.The attitude the sender conveys to his audience often affects the transmission ofthe idea.If the communicator seems to his audience well informed, sincere and respectfulof those to whom he is speaking, he is more likely to succeed in transmitting his idea thanis the person who seems poorly informed, disinterested, insincere or disrespectful of hisaudience.To those who would go out and work effectively with people, let it be clear thatthere is no basic competition among the methods or channels of communication. The challengeis that of makin: meanin clear and of : =ttin: ideas accepted. To this end you will needto use all of the methods of communication readily at hand and improvise others as you goalong.It is a question of getting the proper combination of channels for the job at hand.You will find visual materials and methods to be a major help instead of anincidental one. With their help and an understanding of the communication process, you willget the job done.How and WhyAdults LearnStated simply, learning is that kind of activity by a person which causes him tobe different in some way afterward. And because of his action, he: - /Ads to or changes his previous information or knowledge; - Does some task or operation differently than before; or - Changes his attitude or point-of-view about something. How does a farmer learn new facts, improved farming practices? How do his lone-established attitudes or ways of feeling become changed?Let us use the father, Ahmed, as an example. At wheat threshing time, Ahmed hearsthat his cousin in another village has threshed out the largest yield of wheat he has evergrown.It was a much greater yield than Ahmed himself received that season.A few days later he visited his cousin to see his wheat. It looked like very goodWheat.It was a different variety than previously was grown in any of the villages in thatregion.The landlord had given his cousin the seed; he had also given seed of this newvariety to several other, farmers in hia cousin's village. Nearly all of them had harvestedmore wheat than they had for many years.Some farmers in his cousin's village had planted the same wheat as formerly and hadharvested about the same yields as usual. Ahmed learned.He learned that there can be abig difference in what varieties (new knowledge); he also learned that sometimes it pays totry new ideas (change in attitude).Learning starts from an interest in something or a felt need for something.The learner does things--becomes active so he can satisfy his interest or need. Ahmed's son feels a need to learn to use the sickle skilfully, not because he enjoysharvesting the grain, but to be like other boys of his age. He also feels a duty--the need 111 to help his father with his work. Also, Ahmed wanted to see and then plant the new wheat (he was interested) because it will produce a larger crop and add to his small income. He needs every bit of extra money he can earn for his family. It also gives him satisfaction to produce good wheat and to know that his neighbors think highlyof him.Successful extension workers always begin their work with farmers by finding and using these ittereste and felt needs. Through gaining satisfaction in these, farmers develop confidence in themselves and in the extension worker and will seek his advice in other problems. New learning is built upon previous experience. Previous learning or experience serves to stimulate new learning. This is especially true if the previous experience was satisfying and vivid. Ahmad's son learned to use the sickle quickly because he had watched his father harvesting wheat so many times.This is association--that is building new learning upon previous experience. It is the fundamental principle of all learning. The extension worker uses it in almost everything he does.He begins to work with the farmer as he is.He learns how the farmer thinks, what are his attitudes, customs, fears, inhibitions, habits, his skills.Each of us is a product of many previous learnings, experiences, attitudes, fears, customs and laws imposed by others. A skillful extension worker knows and uses some of the natural, human tendencies related to learning. Man has a tendency:To seek and enjoy the presence of othersTo seek and enjoy the approval of others and avoid their disapprovalTo be aggressive or selfassertive. This explains how some individuals rise from the group to become leaders. Those less aggressive will follow good leadershipTo be ruled by his emotions, such as liking and disliking others, joy,sorrow, fear, pride, envy.To be visualmindedthat is, he is especially receptive to things seen as compared with things heardVillage farmers very likely will respond to teaching methods in accord with those tendencies.They will tend to reject or resent methods which conflict with these tendencies.Farmers who learn from a good extension teacher will remember. The successful worker uses several techniques to help people remember.Some of these are: 1.Be sure people are deeply interested in what they are learning.This means that they must really want to learn and are ready to change. 2.Be sure they understand very clearly each step of the learning and the relation of each part to the whole. 3.Use words that are simple and familiar. Use as few wordy; as possible.Once they are spoken, words are gone forever. 4.Supplement talking with clear demonstrations and with illustrations from the learner's experience. Use vivid images, interesting eyehole.It has been proved that people learn better and remember longer what they have seen than what they have heard. - 112 - 56If poseible,.learn by doing. Have each person actually do theSkill to be learned several times. Watch each learner carefullyand correct his mistakes at once. We learn errors as well ascorrect things. 6.Teach information or skills as near as possible to the time itcan be used.Example:teach insect control just before thetime when insects will appear. 7.Be sure that each person uses the information or skill to hisown benefit.If it does not benefit him, help him understand why.Steps in LearningConsciously or unconsciously, every person goes through certain mental steps beforechanging his ideas or practices. The wise extension worker understands this process andfits his teaching into the present thinking of his audience. Psychologists vary in the waythey divide this process into stages, but essentially it is more or less continuous progressin thinking and changing attitude toward the subject. These steps overlap and form acontinuum cf mental growth concerning the idea.Every person goes through five clearly defined stages while adopting a new idea orpractice.These are awareness, interest, evaluation, trial and adoption. Together thesomake up the adoption process. Three other mental processes also take place during thesestages.These are desire, conviction and satisfaction. Steps in Adoption Process 1/USE!Trial Eva luation Interest Awareness Figure 7-2Each step in adoption process depends on preceding steps being completed. Yet toooften extension workers recommend practices \"too far ahead\" of rural people. We urge themto ux anew rice variety, but actually they are only interested in it. They do not under-stand and we fail to teach, because our message is too advanced. Try always to first learnwhat stage of adoption process your people are in. Then send information related to thatstage, or only one step higher. That way, you will communicate at their level. 1/Lyman J. Noordhoff, Extension Specialist, Office of International Extension,Federal Extension Service, U.S Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. Awareness of a new idea or practice is the first stage in learning to use it. A villager may see a neighbor's new variety of wheat or rice that looks better than his own.A housewife may hear for the first time that she may use dried milk in the diet. Often the first stage of an extension educational program is to inform people that there is a new variety of grain or new form of milk.If the new idea or practice affects the villager, he or she may become interested in getting more information. Is the new wheat as good as it appears to be? Will it actually yield more than the old variety? How can dried r.lk be used? This step is also the beginning of evaluation which will continue until the new practice is finally adopted or discarded as impractical or undesirable.If the additional information is favorable, a desire for the advantages of the new practice takes shape but the villager is cautious.He knows what to expect from the old variety of wheat under varying conditions. But he does not know how the new variety will withstand drouth or wind storms. Therefore, he sows his own small, trial plot of the new wheat or watches several neighbors try it on their fields with soils and growing conditions like his own. He watches it grow and compares it with commonly grown varieties. At harvest time he examines the grain, estimates yield and again evaluates results.He may also inquire as to marketability of the new wheat.Possibly the miller finds the new wheat has different milling qualities than the old variety.Assuming all factors are favorable, the villager becomes convinced he should grow the new variety and he plants it the nextyear.He has adopted this practice. But he may still be somewhat concerned last some weaknesses appear in the new variety. If it continues to do well he has satisfaction with his decision to change to the new variety. Otherwise, he may change back tc the old variety and no permanent change in his actions or attitude has taken place. May negative as well as positive influences affect each person's decisions to change his attitudes and actions. Fear of change, fear of the unknown is a basic influence. What will this new idea do to me? Fear is overcome by familiarity. Facts are an antidote or cure to fear of the unknown. A farmer may hear rumors and opinions for and against a new variety of rice, but f he sees it grown, sees the yield computed, eats the rice and likes it, his doubts are dispelled. Change results from personal decisions and these are affected by beliefs, emotions, customs, tradition and many other values, as well as knowledge. When facts are not available, decisions must be based on traditional values.This seldom produces economic and social progress.As extension workers, our task is to bring new facts (technical information) to people and help them use these facts to make important decisions.Motivation of Rural People A motive is something that prompts a person to act in a certain way.It is an incentive.We in extension education must persuade or motivate people to want technical knowledge, to use it and to adopt a progressive attitude toward change.Commercial advertising and propaganda also try to motivate people, but through different means and objectives. Advertising and propaganda may restrict their use of technical information and other facts to favor the product or idea they are promoting. In extreme cases they will depart from the facts in trying to further their own interests.Education rerealentatiunonofallfacts pertinent to the decision to accept or reject the idea or practice.De arture from the best available information cannot be tolerated. Advertising and propaganda have the self-interests of the advertiser or propagandist as their objective. Education is entirely in the interest of the. recipient-the farmer or villager. 114- Commercial advertising in United States has long been one important source of farminformation.Much of it is educational since it supplements and repeats extension teaching.Thus both private companies and government education benefit. New ideas move into usefaster.However, a small minority of advertisers sometimee present biased, misleadinginformation.This hurts rural people and the company itself, because sooner or laterpeople will discover this and atop buying their goods. To the extent that advertisersconfine themselves to the facts and present the facts in perspective, their activitiesmay be considered education and contribute to social and economic development. Life may be thought of as a continuing effort to satisfy a series of rising needs,from survival to fulfilling our greatest ambitions or attaining the \"good life\". Survival may be considered the basic need of man. Food, shelter and protectionfrom harm are essential to life itself. But when a person is mell-fedlcomfortable and safefrom attack, he feels a new need for assurance that he can survive in the future. Willhe have enough to eat tomorrow, next week, next year? Will he be protected in case ofstorm or drouth? Will he be safe to continue to produce or procure his necessities? Thisis security,the second basic need. If he lives in a modern society, job security, savingsand life and health insurance help satisfy this need. Gros pL3.221Amat is a third basic need. Not only does one feel a need for \"belonging\"to his group, tribe, church or organization, but his acceptance by the group contributesto his own security and even to survival. The family takes care of its members who are ill.During food shortage, the community may take joint action to secure needed supplies. Somechurch groups take pride in caring for their own unfortunate members rather than relyingupon government to do so.A member of a group likes to be recognized for his achievement and his contributionto the welfare of his group. He likes also to have a voice in group decisions and belooked to for advice in his own field of competence. This is recognition, a fourth needof people in any society.And finally when these fou.7 needs are satisfied, a person needs to feel he has beensuccessful.This is fulfilment. Then he or she has achir;ved the greatest potential as a..Jrmer or homemaker, and as a citizen.A wise extension worker will study his community and its people, try to determinewhich kindof needs they consider to be moat important and base his approach accordingly.Too often foreign technicians try to appeal to a persons loyalty and public spirit When theperson is worried about the present and future food supply for his family. People in theseconditions are less interested in becoming volunteer leaders aiding extension programs thanthey are in their day-to-day living. them:Many factors motivate people to accept new ideas and practices, Here are some of1/Psychological factors New experienceRecognitionJob securityMore leisure timeBetter life for childrenGreater efficiencyEmergency needs 7/Communication in Extension as Developed for Western Nigeria - Western NigeriaMinistry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. pp 9-10 114(a) Sociological factors Higher social statusGreater prestigeRole expectancySociabilityHobbies Economic factors FelmAation for childrenMore consumer goods (for more comfort, also for more prestige)Better homesHigher level of livingMore earning powerBetter occupational efficiencySatisfaction of learning One set of skills, when learned, will help motivateadults to tackle more difficult Skills The Diffusion Process Diffusion is the process whereby information and improved practices spread fromtheir originating sources to thousands of ultimate users and adopters. In the case ofagriculture, it is the process by which new farm practices or ideas are communicated frogsouroes of origin, usually scientists, to farmers. A major difference between the diffusion process and the adoption process is that diffusion occurs between persons while adoption is an individual matter. An understandingof both processes is important to a ohange agent. I/ United States farmers say they receive information from several main sources.These include friends and neighbors, government agencies (including extension workers), dealers and salesmen of farm supplies and mass media (newspapers, farm magazines, radio and television).These are findings from rural sociology studies. 2,/In these studies mass media rank highest in providing awareness and arousinginterest in a new practice, closely followed by friends and neighbors.Governmentagencies rank third and dealers and 'talesman fourth. At evaluation,, trial and adoptionstages, friends and neighbors rank first and government agencies second.The highranking of friends and neighbors emphasizes the value of volunteer leaders in introducing a new practice. Remember, though, that mass media and friends and neighbors became aware of new facts somewhere. Their source most likely was the Experiment Station or Extension Service.

Rural sociology research casts doubt as to how fully they apply toa developing nation with much less mass media. One study / in Mexico proposes that thisgeneralization be tested: \"Farmers first hear about new ideas through channels ofcommunication most accessible to them and Which include new ideas in their message.\"Also, other reglearon will soon report diffusion studies in Brazil, Nigeria and India. 1/ Myren, Delbert T. - Rural Communications Weea as a Determinant of Diffusion ofInformation about Improved Farming Fractioes in Mexico. Paper read at RuralSociological Society annual meeting, August, 1962, Washington D.C.Dr. Mren is Information Specialist, Rockefeller Foundation Agricultural Programme,Mexico. 115 Extension eervices in each country may find it advantageous to make studies todetermine where villagers learn about new practices, whet arouses their interest, andwhat convinces them they should adopt specific changes, The U.S. regional study shows also that all persons in an area do not adopt newpractices immediately nor at the same time. Instead, practices spread gradually amongfamilies.This is true everywhere. Reactions of farmers were arranged in five categoriesaccording to time and speed of reaction. (Figure 7-3) Time of adoptionLATEADOFTERS16% Figure 7- 3Distribution of farmers among the five categories according totime of adoption. From \"Adopters of New Farm Ideas\"Characteristics of Adopters These were characteristics of the five group of adopters:The Innovator isthefirst in his group or community to bring it or adopt a new idea or practice. Innovators are few, especially in societies bound by tradition.They have larger than average holdings, greater wealth, better education and a venturesome spirit.They are willing to experiment and risk failure on the chance of substantialpersonal gain. The Early AdoZer is quick to use the value of a new practice in his communityand will try it if he feels it has a fair chance of success.Re is usually younger thanaverage, has higher education, is socially active and reads more than later adopters.The Early Majority are of average age, experience and education, highly respectnd in their communities and adopt a practice only after they are convinced of, its value,The Late laiority make up a large block of farmers of the community. They aremore conservative, are less wealthy and adopt a practice only when it is generally accepted by the community. The Late Adopters, are characterized by their conservatism, are older then average and seldom take any risks. It behoves the extension worker to know his farmers and their attitudes toward, change.This knowledge should be applied in planning programs to reach specific categoriesof farmers, in deciding which exteasion teaching methods to use at different stages ofprogram development and in euleoting and training leaders. -116 Studies have shown that the innovator especially may not be the best leader. Heis too far advanced to enjoy the confidence of most farmers. Most often the early adopteris the natural community leader. People learn from demonstrations on his farm. This ismore true in progressive communities and with younger people where quick acceptance isvalued.In communities slower to change, the early majority, or even lee majority adopters,often have more influence in diffusing new ideas, especially among older people. Grouv DynamicsExtension education is concerned with chaging the knowledge, attitudes and practicesof large numbers of rural people. But to do so effectively it must take into account notonly the wants, desires and wishes of individuals, but also how they act and react as groups. Each person chooses whether to adopt or reject a new idea or farming practice,but this choice is the result of interplay of many forces both within and outside the individual.His experience, education, traditions, mental capability and many other internal influencesaffect his decisions and choices. But there are many goals he cannot attain alone.Education for his children, medical services, improved roads, better markets, flood controland irrigation projects are a few examples. These require group action. The individual isalso influenced in his decisions by the attitudes of others in his group or community, andhe in turn influences them. In traditional societies this influence is so strong thatfew will act in opposition to the socially accepted standards of the group, even in theirown personal activities. Any mass education movement like extension must be carried largely through groupsand their formal or informal leaders to the masses of rural people who are the final target.Group action programs not only multiply the effectiveness of professional extension workers,but are the only means to bring about largescale change.Therefore, extension workers needat least some appreciation and understanding of group action processes. According to Beal, Bohlen and Raudabaugh 1/1 groups, like individuals, developwants and desires, some of which that establish as goals.In their effort to achieve thosegoals they select certain tachniquez. They add, however, that while the individual chooseshis goals and adopts techniques largely on his own dectuion, group choices are a productof many forces forces within individual members, between individual members and inresponse-to external pressures.Three basic parts of the group process are the group, goals and techniques. Theirouxis made up of individual members, each different from every other member. Each hasspecial interests, drives, motivations, expectations and hopes. He has definite values,attitudes, feelings, habits and beliefs. Each person also brings to the group certainnegative forces such as his premonitions, fears and frustrations. He may also haveulterior motives such as personal gain or a desire to play a role in the group for whichhe may or may not be fitted.Each person reacts individually, with each other and with the group as a whole.These lines of force are called internal dynamics of group behaviour. Other forces Alsooperate on the group from outside. They make up external dynamics of group behavior.Every group is influenced by social pressures of the community as to what is acceptableand unacceptable. Other \"outside\" groups also exert pressures on group members.Thecommunity and other groups expect certain behavior from the group in question. 2/ Adapted from George Beal, Joe M. Bohlen and J. Neil RaudabaughLeadership andDynamic Group Action, Iowa State University Press, Ames, Iowa, USA p. 39 -117- Second, each group has Rosa, purposes or objectives.Otherwise it would not exist.Sometimes the goals are vague and only implied, but if a group is to be productive it must have specific goals adopted and understood by group members. In a democratic situation goals are chosen by the members as the result of dynamic internaland external influences, Third, smenlp technictua is a predesigned pattern for human interaction, as compared with random behavior. An effective technique motivates and activates both internal and external dynamics so that the forces are better integrated and directed toward the goals of the group.Some better known techniques are discussions, forums, role - playing, dialogue, interviews and committee hearings. The group, goals and techniques are all governed by the value system--things thatmembers feelto be important. Values determine which persons form the group, what goals they adopt and what methods or techniques they use to attain their goals. People join groups for many different reasons. Some join to enhance their status; some for the opportunity to help others; some to escape boredom; and some because their friends and neighbors belong.Because of this variety of reasons for joining, you can understand why groups often find ithard to agree upon goals, objectives and methods of attaining their goals. To become a leader or productive group member, you must understand why people act as they :Co and try to bring about a common basis of agreement on goals and techniques.Productive group action requires that members take part actively in adopting goals.,deciding on techniques and in carrying out programs agreed upon. There are many blocks or obstacles to tall participation. A group works actively for goals like his own, but a person may not know of this grump. If he knows of it, he may disapprove of their means to attain their seals.He may feel insecure in the group, not fully accepted. Be may feel inferior because of lower social status, lack of education or other reasons. He may not be sureof what the group expects of its members. Member:: need to examine themselves and try tocope with their blocks and frustrations as well as to understand these same problems of others. Kan continually tries to adjust to his obstacles.These are among his more common adjustments: Aggression - strikes back blindly when his ideas are not accepted by the group.Compensation- no longer takes part in discussions, but still helps in other ways.Rationalisation - denies to himself that he ever wanted the thing he had workedfor.It was not important anyway.Identification Associates with others he considers more euccessful than himself.Idealization - Over-evaluates his own attainment, ability, worth or importance.Considers his contribution more valuable than the group judges it.DisplacementBlames someone else when the person he idealizes, does not live up to his expectations. Projection . Blames someone ales for his own failures.Conversion - Transfers energy into some physical symptom or complaint. Becomesill when unsuccessful in his relations with others in the group. Regression - Retreats from a complex problem to a simpler one. When dealing withlarge groups he may wish the group were smaller. - 118 - Negativism - Disagrees with all further proposals or alternatives. Fantasy - Day dreaming. Imagines the situation were different. Yost adjustments are complex and any event may frustrate someone. Leaders mayF.:v.;: members understand their frustrations and the adjustments they make. Adjustments may be useful as well as destructive. For example rationalizationused as an escape from the reality of embarrassing social situations. If usedleegently, adjustment can help a person escape from blocks, thus allowing him tot seed with constructive activities. Thus group formation and participation include individual motivation, blocks ande,,Lueteents.In this complex process a group of people with a wide variety of individualgeelsvalues, skills and blocks to gro.ap participation mold themselves into a productivegroup.Each group is unique, but certain essentials must be present before a group willbe formed.\"If individuals are to be formed into a group, common interests must beestabliehed.There must emerge the belief that the group formed represents the potentialuf eeleilling those interests.\"Internal Dynamics of GroupsEach individual brings his elm characteristics of the group.These include hisinterests, abilities, desires and wishes as well as his blocks and frustrations and hisadjustments to them. These forces contribute to the dynamics of the group.Certain otherforces develop as a result of interaction between individuals. The summation, integrationand resolution of all these forces have been labeled the internal dynamics of the group.Dynamics means the energies and forces derived both from individuals and from their inter-action with each other, and the summation and resolution of these forces into active asopposed to static behavior.Many forces combine to make up the internal dynamics of groups. Among them are: Atmosphere - The prevailing mood, tone or feeling that permeates the group.Physical surroundings; friendly atmosphere or one of fear, uspicion; authoritarian leadershipor shared leadership. Bother leaders and members are responsible for creating anatmosphere ender which group members may work together best.All group members shouldhave a basic belief in the value of the individual, sincere belief in the dignity of manand an honest respect for each man's point of view.Communication Patterns - Many problems arise from inability of leaders or groupmembers to communicate with other group members. Words, gestures and expressions are oftenmisunderstood.In heterogeneous groups it is particularly important that each group membermakes sure he is communicating with all other group members. The mast productive groups havea more adequate communication network than those that are less productive. Particitetica- This involves more than overt expression through speech or action.Attitudes, gestures and manners also enter in. How many members take part? What is thepattern?When one person speaks, is he followed by several others?Is the pattern leadercentered or distributed throughout the group?Individual and group participation are related to the opportunities provided formembers to take part. Attending meetings, serving as offioer or on committees, washingdishes and writing news stories are also participation. The more a member particikateetthemore favorable are his attitudes toward the group and the greater his feeling of concernfor identity with the group. Those members who participate the most are those who under-stand the basic purposes and functions of the group, have clearly in mind the group'sexpectations of its members and feel secure in taking part as a member.They also feelsatisfied from theie participation. - 119 - Grate, Standards - This means the level of performance expected of group members.Standards include member conduct, participation in activities and successful work completion.Stamdards become the groups expectation of members and officers. Standards should be realistic and understood by all. Deviation is frowned upon and groups have ways to secure obedience.In most cases higher group standards are set when the entire group helps set them. Standards should be enforced consistently, not easily with one person and rigidly with another.In general, the closer the person comes to living up to all group standards, the higher will be his group status and his sense of satisfaction toward the group.Social Controls - Every group secures conformity to expectations of its members through social controls. They include various rewards and recognition like election to office, certain status and friendly attitude of the group.Punishments include rejection by the group and taking away privileges. Social controls should apply equally to all, as much as possible. The effectiveness of controls upon members is directly related to the importance assigned by the member to maintainil membership and status in the group.Identity or \"We feeling\" - Identity implies a common bond, a sympathy and a strongfeeling of being united. Bach member feels a common concern for what happens to otherpersons of the group, and to the group as a whole. Identity is largely emotional. It is important to know that a member tatty identify on one basis, but not another. He may agree with the fundamental purpose but not with the group as a whole, and vice-versa. Peoplemay identify with more than one group whose goals are in conflict. This may cause reduced participation. General Role Definition - The general expectation of group members or sub-group'srole within the group should be well-defined ard understood by all.Functional Roles of G ?oup Members - Different group members may play many roles:initiator-contributor, information seeker, opinion giver, elaborator, summarizer,coordinator-interpreter, orienter, disagreer, evaluator, critic, procedural technician, recorder or others. Group Building_ and Maintenance Roles - Some examples are harmonizer, compromiser,gate-keeper or expediter, standard-setter or ego ideal, group observer and communicator or follower. Individual Roles - These are usually attempts by group members to satisfy individual needs irrelevant to the group. They includes Aggressor- expresses disapproval of values, acts, feelings of othersilocker - disagrees with every proposalRecognition seeker - calls attention to himselfSelf-confessor- expresses his personal feelingsPlayboy - makes display of his lack of involvementDominator - tries to assert authoritySpecial interest pleader - cloaks his own prejudices in pleas for specialgroups.Human Relations Skills - These refer to the ability to work with and get along with people.Persons in each group possess human relation skills, in varying degrees. ThebAsio understandings and skills needed for good human relations can be learned and communicated. Eaterogeneiti-RomoKeneity (Difference-Likemess) - We need to recognize that allgroups have some degree of heterogeneity. We need to learn to understand these differencesand how they may be harmonized for greatest group productivity.We tend to group ourselveson the basis of similarities. Eastover, within these relatively homogeneous groups thereare many differences. Group members working together over time tend to becomes more alike ininterest, objectives and satisfactions.Group Size - Size is particularly important in deciding what group techniques touse under certain conditions to accomplish specific goals. Large size may limit the amountand quality of communication that can take place among individual group members. As sizeincreases, groups show a greater tendency to adopt more formal procedures. And largergroups usually find it harder to coordinate group activities.Efficient size varies withthe taak, time available, maturity of the group or amount of follow-up action wanted.Experience shows that committees of 3, 4, 5 or 7 persons are more efficient, while disc-aagiongroups of 12 produce effective communication.2ralL1MMW31-- 4Svalustido is present in all groups.It may be systematic oraccidentainaiiiiiiuncoascious. We evaluate three types of performance - our own,others and the group as a whole. We evaluate other groups and they evaluate us. Systematic,rational evaluation has great potential to lead each member and the entire group to greaterproductivity. Leaders who evaluate more thoroughly their own and their group's work areoften rated most effective. It would seem highly desirable for groups to set up someformal methods so they can evaluate periodically group Emcees as well as group program. The External Dynamics of GroupExternal forces also affect all group activities. Among them are community values,community expectations, institutional values, parent group affiliations and control,intergroup competition, prestige and status. These external forces affect every group -its member motivation, goals, methods and on-going activities.These external forces arereflected largely through the beliefs, feelings and actions of members. The community develops expectations of various groups. Certain groups withcertain kinds of members are expected to perform enetific functions for specific categoriesof people.Expectations of a given group may be based upon tradition, past performance, socialstatus of membership and leadership, publicly stated purposes and public image of theorganization and its organizational affiliation. Forces may also originate from non-members,other groups or institutions in the community such as schools, churches or businesses.These external forces may be judged restrictive or expansive. The Social Action ProcessCertain essential oteps have been identified as a guide for aff'oting change. 1/Attention to these steps can greatly expedite the introduction and diffusion of new andimproved practices in rural communities. They includes 1.Initiation 2,Legitimation 3.Diffusion 4.Organization and planning for action 5.Conducting the program 6.EvaluationMarlys Richert - A Study of Factors for Consideration in Xembership Feleotion ofCounty Extension Program Committees.

He is the initiator and may be the local extension worker, a specialist, a progressive farmer or almost anyone.The extension worker is a professional intiator of new and improved practices. He discusses his idea, problem about which something should be done, or improved practice with a few other people. Together they pewiew and revise the idea and accept it as their own.Each of these 1pie in turn thiemse this idea with a few others each of whom may contribute PurthAr A401on tine problem.Legitimate, refers to getting wkovalthe idea by the power structure. The local extension worker mgy discuss it with a specialist or his supervisor, especially additional resources are necessary to carry it out. But more important, he must discuss his idea with persons in the community who may affect acceptance or rejection of the idea by the masses of rural people. This discussion again may lead to revision of the idea and again the legitimdzere may accept the revised idea as their own.Once he gains approval of the power structure, the extension worker and the people with whom he has discussed the ideas, using the diffusion process encourage people of the community to take up the idea or practice.Again, discussion with influential people may result in some revision and adaptation to the situation. Support of influential persons in the social system is especially important at this stage. ....E.,...___JzOr.nisatioidPlazining implies that Ft group of people be brought together to explore alternatives, determine objective and plan action. They will examine situational information, determine the scope of activity, and assign responsibility. Even in conducting the Program adjustments in plans will occur.eation upon completion points the way to required follow-an. The director-general of agriculture in a Latin American country became enthused with the philosophy of extension education while attending an early FAO training center.Upon return to his country he resigned as director-general and arranged to be appointed national director of extension. BA went to his home community and proceeded to develop an extension program including crop improvement demonstration', youth clubs and community development projects.The program was so successful that the people arranged a fiesta to celebrate their accomplishments and to honor the extension director. The sinister of agriculture was invited.Re expected the people to give him the treatment befitting a dignitary and to then present their requests for help from the central government. Ruch to his surprise there was none of this. They showed his the products t'iey had raised; children demonstrated what they had learned in the youth clubs, and expressed great appreciation to the director of extension. The minister became alarmed. He returned to the capital and demanded the resignation of the director whom he thought was building himself up to take the minister's place.The director had followed the steps in the sonial action process with one exception. He had not legitimized the program with the minister. Furthermore he had conducted the program in his own name rather than as a project of the ministry of agriculture. Chapter 8.- 122 - CMDITIONS AFFECTING EXTENSION TEADEING In Chapter 3, we discussed a number of factors to take into account in organisingan extension service. Many cthese factors also affect the choice of methods to be usedin extension education programs. Among the more important are the social structures inrural communities, rural leaderehipteconomic factors and civic and community organisation. During the past two decades, most of the less developed countries have beentrying to speed up their rates of economic developmelMtamlsocial change, often with thehelp of international organizations and the more fortunate countries. This assistancehas come in two forms - economics assistance in the form of loans and grants and technicalassistance in the form of advisers in a variety of fields. Although such assistance wasquiteeffective in Europe following World War II, results in developing countries ofAsia, AfriOa and Latin America have not come up to expectations. Much of this disappoint-ment can be attributed to differences in social structure between developing countries andthe more advanced nations which provided much of the economic and technical assistance.Social factors often outweigh economic factors when a drastric change in production prac-tice is involved. Egyptian villagers resisted the introduction of new high yielding wheatvarieties because the straw was shorter, less nsefUl in waving mats and there appearedto be lees of it for use in feeding their animals.The attitude of Hindus toward cattleslaughter is a well known block to agricultural development in parts of India. The attitude of individuals toward change and the influence on this attitude ofthe various groups in the social structure is perhaps the most important element for con-sideration by extension workers. A knowledge of the social structure of the oommnnity,the values of each group and class and methods of promoting group action are essentialtools of the successful extension worker. Sooll and Cultural Pactmra in Ration JWhat people do by tradition is mainly determined by the organization of the so-ciety and its culture. Let us now consider some of the terms that we use when talkingabout people end their way of life.Society.This is the term used to describe a group ef people who have lived andworked together long enough to get themselves organized and to think of themselves as asocial unit.Society has a structure, that is to say, a patterned arrangement of relation-ships between the people of that society.The structure or Organization of a society is the way in which the society isorganised into families, clans, tribes, communities, clubs, etc. People change, they areborn,grow up and die, but the organization remains. Culture is what we call the way of life of the society, the leer people behave.Culture is the product of people in a society or group; the ideas, attitudes, rules andhabitwhich peopleRevolve to help them in their conduct of life.Progressive agriculture involves the farmer in making deoisions for himself aboutwhich crops to grow, how to grow them, how best to use the land, labor and money. By per-suading farmers to adopt progressive agricultural mothods, extension workers encouragefarmers to make decisions for themselves on farming matters whioh have in the past beenstrongly influenced by the traditioneand habits of the society. D. J. Bradfield - Guide to Extension Training. FAO, Rome, Italy pp. 95 - ill. - 123 - For example, a farmer may arrange with neighbors to exchange his scattered gar- dens so as to consolidate them in one holding which he can farm more efficiently. Be deci- des to have his holding farm -- planned.He decides to grow more or different food and cashcrops, to buy and use fertilizers and ox-plows,to move his horse and cattle sheds from the village to his holding. The farmer may have saved money which he had buried under the floor of his house. maybe he was going to use it to buy more cattle, to pay lobola (bride payment)to enable hie son to marry, to buy a bicytle, a Raise mill or a lorry. He may now decide to e--ed some of it on improving his farming by buying plows, fertilizers, wire for fencing or possibly to payy labor to stump his farm. If he has not got enough money he may seek a loan to buy these things. These are all steps toward progressive farming. They are changes from the tradi- tional way of doing things, when the farmer merely did what his neighbors did. But the decisions he makes do not affect him alone. They also affect his family and the community in which he lives. The farmer may want his sons to help him plow. His wife and daughters may have to learn to handle an unfamiliar crop.The whole family may have to work harder and in different ways to establish the farm. Because he is changing from the accepted traditional pattern of farming and litiglother villagers may be suspicious or even hostile. His decision to exchange gar-dens with neighbors disturbs the pattern of village gardens.The headman or whoever tra-ditionally allocates land may oppose the changes.If the gardens were originally given to the farmer's wife, her family may be unhappy at the change. Above all, the changes represent a break with the traditional way of doing things and are a threat to the exis- ting social relationships. Therefore members of the society who value the traditional ways above all else will be opposed to the farmer whose success is due to adopting progrea- sive ways of farming. His success appears to them to threaten their influence over other village people. The opposition may be too much for the farmer.He may value the goodwill of his neighbors too much to risk their disapproval. While wanting to change he fears the criti-cisms which will result from the change. He still wants to belong to village society andto keep the good opinion of his neighbors and relations.For this reason, the change from traditional to progressive agriculture is usually made gradually. When the family and com- munit have seen the advantage of a new method they may be less opposed to the next step.Because the farmer is making a break with tradition he wants to be sure that he is doing is sound and safe. He is exchanging the known results of traditional ways of farming for the unknown of the new methods. He may agree that the results of traditionalways of farming are not good enough but will the results of the new methods be any better? He wonders if he will be able to carry out the new methods, will they not be too difficult or too expensive for him? What will happen to himself and his family if the new methods fail or he is unable to carry them out? Who will help him if they fail mod he has nothing to eat and no money? At least in the past the old ways gave him some money and some food and his family and neighbors would help him if he needed anything.For these reasons the extension worker should: 1.Study the social organisation and the culture of the people with whom he works. 2.Identity himself with their aims and ways of life.3.Know their customs and traditions. 4.Understand the valves of the society, that is, the things that peopleconsider most important and hereby gain the confidence of the peoplewith whom he works so that they will be encouraged with his supportto take the risks that change involves.We will now consider briefly some of the principles of social structure and cul-ture affecting extension work. This is far from being a complete study. The referencebooks and papers listed at the back of the book may be related to your own experience andthose with Whom yen work. Social. Structure It isimportant to understand the structure of the society with which oneis working, to know who does what in the village and, in particular, to know who mikes thedecisions.Who are the people of real influence who deal with the allocation of land?Many mistakes have been made in extension work through lack of knowledge of village socialstructure or through ignoring its existence.What are the factors causing the division of people into groups and societies? Sex division.Traditionally some jobs are carried out by men and some by women.Each sex has customary duties in village life and agriculture. If you plan to introducea new crop or a new extension approach which is likely to change existing customs thenyou must fully understand thew: customs before you can sucoesfully change them. Religious and ceremonial groups. Members of certain religious groups have commonloyalties and attitudes. \"(bile Wamjulu\" is an example of a ceremonial group which hasvery considerable influence among Chewa people in Malawi. Division based on age. The society has respect for the experience and wisdomof elders, at leant in matters of a traditional nature. People who have grown up toge-ther have common interests and experiences. Young people have different interests andattitudes from those of older people. These groups can be referred to as age groups:each group may differ from the others in attitudes, values and aims in life.Grouping on the basis of common residence. This grouping can consist of (a)small units:family, homesteads or hamlets of a few houses grouped together and splitoff from the main village, and (b) village under a headman which may or may not compriseseveral hamlzte. The fact of living close together forces people to cooperate and deve-lop similar attitudes to common problems. If they fail to cooperate anidisa,gree on commonproblems the group may split and factions separate to form a new homestead or hamlet. Kinship groups. These are groups of closely related people. The basicfamilyunit is father, mother and Children, but this unit is made part of a larger group by bondsof blood and marriage. We are concerned with this larger unit which is known as a kinshipgroup.The bonds which tend to make members conform to group behavior, attitudes and res-ponsibilities are *ailed kinship ties. It is important to know the head of the group as he usually makes decisions bind-ing on its members. Members of kinship groups have a traditional responsability to helpeach other.These responsibilities are at once a help and a hindrance to the group By helping the aged, the sick and the unfortunate members of the group they seekto avoid or reduoe the effects of serious misfortunes. For example, elder brothers helppay school fees for younger brothers or nenhews, bu' in doing so may put themselves in adifficult finanoial position or may even go short of good food for themselves and theirfamilies in order to meet their responsibilities. 125 Systems of Succession and InheritanceMatrilineal.Among many people ofMalawit for example, descent is matrilineal, that isa man speaks of his home village as the place where his mother and mother's bro thers were born. In chiefs'families it is typical to find the ancestors remembered for as long as thirteen generations on the mother's side but for only two on tile father's side. Succession is also matrilineal. The office of chief usually passes to the oldest sister's sons and if there are no sons to the children of the sister's daughters.Inheritance of possessions does not follow the same pattern. They are usually divided between the dead man's brothers and sisters and his wife. As it is usual for the women to own the land, there is no ohange in ownership until the wife dies. Then the land is divided among the children. When a man marries he often goes to live in his wife's village. He may neglect his own children (by her in favor of supporting his sister's children in his home village wherehe will take most of the money he earns.He knows that if his marriage breaks up he will leave his wife's village and go back to his home or marry into another village. He is unlikely to want to improve his wife's land and make it into a proper farm, bocause he feels that if his marriage breaks up he will lose the farm and the benefit of the improvements he has made on it. He also knows that his sister's 'children, whom he regards as more important to him than his own1 cannot inherit that land.Under this system there is little incentive for a man to develop a proper farm. More effort might be made to teach women to become better farmers and improve their land.Cattle are usually owned by the head of the family or kinship group in the name of the group, that is, they are a family possession. When the head of the group dies the next senior brother succeeds. If there are no brothers, or the brothers are not thought suitable by the family, the responsibilities of the head of the group may pass to the elder son of the dead man's sister, as with a ohieftainehip. Sometimes a chieftainship may pass to a brother if there is no nephew, or if the nephew is unsuitable. A very powerful brother may sometimes seise a chieftainship over the righful successor and per suade the society or group to accept him. These systems are not static. Some people, particularly those of more advanced education, are beginning to reject matrilineal inheritance and insist that their own sons inherit.Such people usually at* for land, either from a headman of a village with land available or in a resettlement area, so that they oan build a farm and homestead which will pass to the wife and children on the death of the father.The Government of Malawi has reoently passed a law introduced by Dr. Band% then Prime Minister, Kamusn's Mbumba Protection Ordinance, which directly affects inheri tance.The law seeks to protect wives and children from the operation of traditionalpatterns of inheritance which might result in the wife and ohildren becoming destitute on the death of the husband, by reason of possessions and money being taken by the relatives of the deceaaed. This law affects only the inheritance of freehold or leasehold land, and does not affect the inheritance of land which continues to be governed by traditional law and custom. Succession to positions of family head, village head or chieftainship is similarly not affected by this lawThe traditional inheritance systems of an area should be known to extension workers.Although the new law supersedes some of them, it is inevitable that in certain oases the relatives of the deceased try to apply the traditional system, thus leading to disputes which may affect extension work. -126- petrilinealNgoni people follow this system, descent, succession and inheritancebeing through the father's side of the family. Inheritance is passed from father to son.Following past conquest the Ngoni imposed this system on the Tumbuka and some Chewa peoplewith whom the Ngoni intermarried, but most people in Malawi follow matrilineal systems. These systems of inheritance and succession may seem complicated to the newextension worker unfamiliar with an area to which he has recently been posted. The sys-tem operating with the various families and groups in his area should, however, be knownto him.In some districts people of different ethnic groups may be intermingled. It isnecessary to understand the differences in these aspects of their social structure andculture in order to be able to work successfully with all of them.If the extension pro-gram ignores the facts of succession and inheritance in the personal relationships of thepeople their confidence will not be gained and there will be great difficulty in carryingout the program.Other groupings There are, of course, many other ty-ss of groupings. Forexamrle, cattle owners in a society will have certain interests in common on matterse7Pfeaz their cattlo. TL 4'niture of a SocietyWe have seen that the culture of a society is the way tu which people live,their customs, traditions, methods of cultivation and so on.The culture of a society islearned by each individual member of the society. Children are not born with knowledgeof!le culture of the society; they learn by seeing how older children and adults behave.Later, older members of their family or kinship group teach them about the customs andtraditions of the group ana the society. Later still, they may be initiated more fullyinto the society at ceremonies where they are taught by older pople traditional habitsand customs and their role in the society. As the individual grows older, experience helps.him to understand more fully the behavior pattern of his society and may also teach himhow he can replace some of the traditional forms of behavior with new patterns. Culture is not an accidental collection of customs and habit.It has been evol-ved by the people to help them in their conduct of life.Each aspect of the culture of asociety has a definitive purpose and function, and is therefore related to all the otheraspects of its culture. This is important to remember when planning extension programs.Changes in one aspect of culture may have an effect on other aspects of that culture. Ifchanges in one aspect of culture are introduced, and these are likely to have an unaccep-table effect on other aspects, then a program has little chance of success.This is onereason why local leaders and farm people should help in planning the program. They willknow whether or not the changes proposed will be acceptable to the society. People think that the techniques and methods of cultivation practiced by theirsociety are ideal. This is a problem weface when teaching improved methods of growingmaize in Malay% for example. Few people willingly accept advice on.better methods ofgrowing maize as they regard this as a traditional crop, and the methods they use as beingright because they are customary. They have always grown maize this way, why change? For similar reasons, it is not easy to teach better methods of oultr3r'keepingto village people who have kept chickens in the traditional way. It is also interestingto note that it is easier to teach more advanced systems of livestock husbandry such asstall-feeding to those who have not previously owned cattle than to those who have. - 127 - Cultures Change. Cultures are never completely static; they can and do change. The apeed at which change takes place depends largely on the contact people have withother cultures and new ideas and the ability of individuals withinthe society to ini tiate and accept change. The extension worker's task can be described as helping to speed up the culture change in terms of better farming methods.In time, new ideas or methods, once they are accepted by the society, gradually come to be regarded as customary. In most parts of Malawi the traditional way of agricul- ture was to interplant maize with beans and other crops on mounds (matutu). But now many people have grown orops in pure stand and on ridges for so long that they have almost forgotten the old way. Growing crops in the new way has become customary and so to absorbed into the culture and traditions of the society. When cash crops such as Turkish tobacco are introduced, they are usually right otside the experience and therefore the customs of the society. There is no traditional way of growing these new crops. If people are willing to accept the idea of growing a new crop they are.willing to learn the new practices associated with it.After some years they become accustomed to the crop and methods of growing it and these methods become part of the society's culture. Because the crop has become part of the traditional way of doing things, it be- comes less easy to introduce improvements in methods of cultivation.Therefore extension workers introducing anew crop should aim from the start to teach the most advanced methods practicable of growing the crop. It may become more difficult later on to improve when people have become accustomed to the crop.\"Wehave grown it successfully this way in the past why should we change ?\" they may say. Turkish tobacco was introduced in the Mzimba district of Malawi as a new cash crop in 1956.Farmers who agreed to try out the new crop had no tobacco-growing tradi-tion or experience to guide them. They relied completely on extension personnel to teach them.Thus they accepted the need to use fertilizer on seedbeds and in..the field. Contrastthis with the situation of village growers of other tobaccos, such as the dark-fired type. Because people have become accustomed to growing tobacco over 30 years without fertilizerit has been difficult to persuade them to use it.However, recent intensive and widespread demonstration programs showing the benefit of using fertilizer have.now resulted in a much greater demand. However, although it was easier to teach advanced methods when introducing this crop, it was not easy to persuade people to grow Turkish tobacco. Until very recently comparatively few people in Mzimba and elsewhere were growing this cropvalthough many have seen that other farmers have made a lot of money from it. The reason may well be that people feared that growing Turkish tobacoo would affect their lives in ways which they were not prepared to accept. The farmer and his family have to learn new Skills.The crop oompetes for his time and labor at a season when he is busy with other crops. He may fear that if he spends a lot of time growing Turkish tobacco he will be unable to produce sufficient quantities of food for himself and his family. Again, there is increasing interestihthis crop and farmers are now convinced that it is worthwhile to grow. We can draw the conclusion that while there may be resistance to change, carefully planned extension work can overcome resistance to a new crop or farming method.Factors Promotingamel We should understand that there are many factors promoting change and make use of thii knowledge in planning extension work. 128 InnovatorsIn every society there are some individuals who are more ready thanothers to accept new ways of life. They have a certain influence on their society but itis slight:in fact, if ohange depended only upon these people the pace might be slow.People in traditional societies are often suspicious and jealous of those who are eager tochange. However, as the society comes to accept the idea of change the innovator may ceaseto be regarded with suspicion and gain a growing influence. In fact, social change is oftenled by a few unusual and outstanding individuals. Contact with other cultures Contact with other societies is an important forcefor culture change. For example, in the past trade contacts between Malawi and Arabs introduoed woven cloth to the country and Islam to the Yao people. The \"bslowoka\" whocrossed the lake from Tanganyika introduceiironsmelting and iron hoes to the TUmbukapeople.The more contact there is with other societies the greater is the rate of culturechange.Extension workers are introducing new, scientific ways of farming evolved in technologically advanced societies. Everyone who leaves his own society to travel for studyor to work emong people of another society brings back ideas which may change his own wayof life and be adopted by other people in his society. The more people in a society areexposed to new ideas the more likely it is that change may be accepted by the society as awhole. Communications Roads bring changes to a rural society. Travel is easier andmore people can visit other places andlearn about more progressive ways of doing things.Traders establish shops and the goods in them may act as incentives to induce people toproduce more from their farms in order to buy these new things. The provision of roadsin rural areas has been proved to have a profound effect on rural societies, acceleratingthe rate of eca Mile and social progress. Newspapers and radio also bring rural people in remote parts into contact withthe outside world. People in rural communities who have radio sets or who read newspapersare usually influential and can spread to their neighbors the knowledge or ideas they gain. Other factors Many other factors which promote change have been mentioned inthe previous chapter. Education may also be a means of exposing the youth of one societyto the ideas, values and way of life of another. Political and economic factors may promote change.For instance, the society may want new or improved schools because of thevalue people set on education to secure a better way of life for their children. Thedistrict oouncil may decide to levy an education rate or tax to raise funds to provide theimprovements the people want. Thus the indiridual member of the society has to find extramoney for these improvements. This again is a fe4tor which will tend to promote change,for people will need to earn more in order to pay more for what they want. Usually new methods which can give the farmer a quick economic return are morelikely to be accepted than those where he will have to wait for a longtime to see thebenefit.They are also more likely to be aooepted than ideas which are good but do notappear to result in the farmer earning money. Vegetables are good to eat and help toimprove the farm family's health. Bit few farmers will grow them unless they can makemoney by selling them. However, in time, they may try eating the vegetables they fail tosell and gradually they may become accustomed to growing them for food as well as for sale. - 129 - Extension and other rural development work - Extension workers and personnel of otLei rural development organizations are agents of change, bring1:3g new ideas to the community, as we have seen in the previous chapter.Agricultural extension, therefore, as one of the many factors promoting Change, seeks to accelerate the pace of change and to guide it in ways that are agriculturally, socially and economically sound, and culturally acoeptable to the people. Barriers to Change Culture-based barriers TraditionMost rural societies look upon new methods with indifference and sometimes with suspicion. Respect for elders often results in the attitude that the old ways are best. People fear the unknown and untried, they also fear to incur criticism for doing something different from the rest of the society. The motive of extension workers and others seeking to promote change is often misunderstood. Village people may think that the extension worker is introducing changes to benefit himself.Belief in their own culture - Members of all societies believe that their way of life is best.\"These new methods of farming may be all right for other people but they are no good for us.\" This attitude results in people being reluctant to try something new.\"How can it be better than our way?\"We know what is best for us.\"Pride and dignity - People may be too proud to practice ways of farming that may result in others looking down on them.For example, they may be too proud to carry cattle manure to the fields. Many young people leaving school look down on farming although some successful farmers earn more than most government employees and school teachers.Relative values - Certain improved varieties of maize have been shown to yield much better than local maize. However, some have not been used by farmers because they do not keep so well in store (nkhokwe) or the color or taste of nsima made from them is not acceptable. Rural people may value taste, appearance or some other factors more than the yield or cash return of a different variety of a crop.Unforeseen difficulties . In tha northern region of Malwi early rotations recom- mended to farmers did not include millet. Farmers wanted to grow millet to make beer and so fulfill social obligations; hence progressive planned farming did not begin to be accep- ted on any scale until less rigid methods were devised. In the Lunzu/Lirangwe (Kuntaja) land use scheme, the rotations were devised to increase economic crop production and it was assumed that villagers wanted to be successful farmers. Many of the mer. worked by day in Blantyre and preferred certain aspects of town life to village life.They retained their village gardens merely to produce maize, which could be grown easily by their wives, as a form of social insurance against possible unemployment and to provide a cheap food supply.However, the methods recommended meant that the men would have tp work more on the land and it is thought that they resented the inroads into their limited leisure time and the inferred aim to wean them back from town to village life.Extension programs aiming to introduce new methods should take into account the effect on the whole society and its culture and not merely the technical result of the methods recommended. 130 Customary body positions People in the north of Maui use longhandled hoes andwork nearly upright whereas those in the center and south use shorthandled hoes and bendto work with them. New methods or tools may require differente body positions. The needto learn new positions may slow down acceptance of the new ideas. Social Barriers to ChangeApsnitesibilittea of the indiviNel Individuals within a society or a kinshipgroup have responsibilities which they are expected to carry out. People who avoid suchresponsibilities anger other members of the society. A man may find that as his incomeinoreases so his obligations to his society or family increase. The more money he earns,the more help his kinsmen will expect from him. This can be a very mious barrier to changeiftheindividual sees little advantage in improving his position when he does not benefit much from the improvement himself. However, he may overcome this by concealing hiswealth, by distributing his cattle among friends to look after, by burying money or bankingit so that he can tell his kinsmen that he has no money to help them.This may result ina farmer being reluctant to carry out visible improvements to his farm such as fencing,buying farm implements and other things which would indicate to his kinsmen that he iswealthier than he says.Traditional oeremonies Ceremonies such as weddings, funerals and enthronementof chiefs can take up so much of the farmer's time that he is unable to work his farm tothe maximum efficiency. He is, therefore, unlikely to adopt new methods which, while theymight increase his income, mean that he has to devote more time to working his farm, andless time to ceremonial social obligations. Social structure Extension workers should understand the structure of the society with which they work so as to be able to recognize and use the influential peoplewho are most likely to be able to persuade the society to accept change. A village may split into two or more factions because of quarrels between familyheads.When working with these factions it is necessary not to favor one or the other.If a new idea is accepted by one faction it may be rejected by the other simply becausethe first has accepted it. Always find out who is an authority in a village. It may beone individual or a number of people. Sometimes a whole family may participate in makingvillage or group decisions. Elected officials, chiefs or headmen, are not necessarily theonly leaders, or people of most influence. It is necessary to recognize and work throughsuch official leaders but there may be other people who have no offioial positions yet whohave an influence within the group and who should be consulted. Progress in agriculture usually necessitates persuading individual farmers to tryout new methods. But individuals like to assooiate themselves with a group; they feel saferwithotherPeople who have common interests or some other link with thaw. We recognizethis fact when giving a demonstration or holding a meeting for a group of farmers who areinterested in the new methods we offer. After the meeting the farmer returns to his familyand the group of people who live in the same hamlet or village. While he may agree at themeeting that the newjeethod is a good idea, he may find difficulty in persuading the othermembers of his family group that the changes he wants to make are in the best interests ofthat group.Because this group is the one that he has to live with dey by day theiropposition may very well outweigh the personal, advantages to him of trying out the newmethods.Sometimes, however, the farmer may agree at the meeting or demonstration that aoartain method is good beoause he wishes to conform with other members of that group intheir acceptance of the new idea. He may be releotant or embarrassed to admit that hedoes not understand the new idea or to admit that it is good when he is part of this group.If it is important to the success of the extension program that the particular farmer be -131- convinced, it will be necessary to follow up the demonstration or meeting with an indivi- dual visit to the farmer concerned and to discuss the new idea in relation to his own farm and the problem he sees in trying to apply this new method.Psychological Bazieree Attitude toward government personnel - People sometimes regard government personnel as tax collectors or policemen. Extension workers should not be involved in the collection of money for taxes or repayments of loans, or with prosecuting people. The extension worker's job is to teach people about better farming and better living, and suoh regulatory unpopular tasks will reduce his effectiveness as a teacher.Attitude toward gifts - People often think of gifts as things of little or no value, otherwise why would anyone give them away? They may think that agift is given with the purpose of gaining something in return.Many people in the past were suspiciousof the bonuses paid to vaster .farmers who had their farms planned and followed the recoa- mendations of agricultural personnel. \"Why should the Department of Agriculture pay people for farming in a cel,tain way?\" they would ask. \"Surely it must be because they want to take the land from these farmers.\" If you are trying to introduce the idea of a farmer's club in your area it is better if the club building is built by the farwera themselves rather than by government people using government money. Such a building is more valued by the people and they look upon it as their own.Many expensive social center: have been built in African countries and elsewhere which the people do not value as much as a simple building they have put up themselves. If they do not value the building or the project as their own, they will not be interested in it or support it.When tree seedlings or plants are sold at it small charge they will often be better cared for than if they are given away free.When planning extension programs or activities which involve the possibility of people regarding assistance unfavorably, discuss plans with local leaders in advanceto obtain their opinion. Communications Problems Language - When teaching better farming methods in villages, simple language should be used and terms employed that the local village people underlitaal and use themselves.Pictures - Very often sophisticated visual aids are not easily undestood by village people.Films, slides and symbols on handouts or posters can be confUeng to people Who are not accustomed to them. Village people uho are not accustomed to learning from films may not see a continuing, logical story in a film, but only a succession of odd scenes.When visual aids are used they should be explained and related to local experience common to the people in the group. Learning _problems - A method which is simple for the teacher who has mastered it may be very difficult for the learner even to begin to understand. We should be aware of the limitations of experience of the people whom we are trying to teach, and then plan our teaching programs accordingly. 132 Often new ideas and methods are taught by people who have not completely masteredthem.The learner will soon find out that the teacher does not know his subject and willlose confidence in him. Whlu planning to teach some new farming method, the subjectmatter should be reviewed in detail so that it is fully understood.If difficulty is experienced in communicating some idea to the society, it may bebecause the nature of the society, its way of life, and the differences in experiencebetween members of the society and the extension worker are not fully recognized. Whenplanning extension work, therefore, it is essential to give as much attention to the humanfactors involved as to the technical aspects of the program. Civic StructureCivic structure, as used here, alludes to the official governmental organizationfrom the central government down to the village or township. As previously mentioned underCentral Authority, an extension worker cannot afford to ignore people in authority at anylevel.Whether elected through democratic processes or appointed by higher authority, theyconstitute a powerful influence for or against the adoption of innovations. The wiseextension worker will endeavor to secure their support, or at least their acquiescence inthe early stages of the introduction of a new practice.But the extension worker must be conscious of another factor related to thepolitical or civil structure. Extension education, as practiced in the economicallyadvanced countries, is based upon the concept of democratic action and accomplishes itsgoals largely through self help. It originated in countries having highly developea localsalfgovernments. Rural people traditionally elected their own local officials, leviedlocal taxes to finance local institutions, such as schools, and settled their differencesin courts presided over by judges electod by the people themselves. Local organizationscarried on programs of community improvement including the establishment of libraries,hospitals, churches and other institutions.Rural people in many of the developing countries have neither the experience indemocratic processes nor a civic structure enabling them to develop, finance and carry outimprovement programs independent of contra authority. Thus, the philosophy of extensionis a new concept requiring the adoption of new values and the use of new social skills onthe part of the villagers. In other words, the whole extension education concept is aninnovation requiring ohanges in knowledge, skills and attitudes. These changes may beslow and difficult to accomplish and require patience and understanding on the part of thechange agent.However, in spite of the problems involved, extvasion education provides a veryuseful technique in training villagers to accept 1,esponni'oility for their own welfare andgain experience in the democratic processes which the governments of many newly developingcountries are attempting to introduce. Local leaders trained and experienced throughextension programs oar_ later provide essential civic and political leadership.amBsdexIdentiiandErilistiLealEducat14ndActionProgan'amsMany occasions arise during the course of a year when extension agents and otherprofessional workers are called upon to name or help select persons to serve on committees,attend educational conferences or meetings, or to help in mime other way with this or thatprogram.When to invite and how to gain one's acceptance and further involvement areChallenging questions indeed. Probably you have faced such questions with varying degreesof success. 3.1 E.J.

Department )f Agriculture. - 133 - Our purpose here is to present a few ideas that might help you to do so easier and with more effective results. A variety of studies and writings on leadership and social organization in recent years provide helpful leads. First of all, it is essential to consider the nature of leadership itself.Appreciate What Leadership Is Leadership, in essence, is simply influencing the attitudes and actions of one or more persons, leading toward the achievement of some purpose or goal.This is generally accomplished through various ways.For example, imparting knowledge, giving advice or suggestions, expressing a belief or opinion, making decisions on behalf of groups, providing assistance, exercising power, lending approval or support, also by example or demonstration.Most leadership positions call for some degree of decision making, may call for knowledge and skills about particular programs and group operations; some call for power or even authority. All leadership positions require having a real ooncern for others on the part of the leader, consciously or unconsoiously, if one is to really function as a truly effective leader; otherwise, one would not have followers.For leadership requires followerehip, based upon service to and support from people.Most important of all, leadership is more than having been born with favorable characteristics, such as appearance, voice, personality and ambition. These characteristics may aid a person in developing leadership ability, but this ability is acquired as a result of training and experience rather than as a result of being born with certain attributes. If people have the desire to lead they can learn to be leaders. Some will not be as effective as others, even after considerable effort.Leadership generally arises out of social situations of some kind that happen to call for particular leadership at given times for specific purposes, sometimes even crises; it arises out of the need for leadership.It is usually based upon some degree of previous accomplishment in the eyes of the group or one's followers who grant leadership or acquiesoe to one's assuming it. Thus, leadership refleots a relationship between people or between a person and group members. It is something earned. It is bestowed for, without having been given permission or support by the people concerned, it does not exist. A leader is only one who has followers or influence among people, based upon their 'judgement about his accomplishment, nature and potentiality, and the needs of the particular leadership job at hand.For a person to merely think he is a leader is not enough. Nor is it exiough for a professional worker to think a person is a leader without adequately considering whether or not he has any followers or leadership relationship with the group or people under concern. Leadership distribution follows relationships. Research bears out that leaders are generally rather widely distributed and vary in scope of influence according to the group relationships and concerns of the people in given social situations. Communities themselves, large or small, are networks of relationships or social systems. Within these systems various types and patterns of leadership usually function and can be identified. People of given population segmentslor social systems generally, are beat reached through leadership of their own people.However, in many cases, their interest-in a given subject and your rapport with them may first have to be developed. - 134 - Leadership development is increase in the involvement of people, increase intheir ability to carry out responsibilities or otherwise function in given Isadore:hip roles,and increase in their own personal growth as a result of their greater participation orinvolvement.Always the factor of maturity and growth must be considered by professionalworkers as they work with people in programs. Very few leaders start out at the top of theladder.People grow in leadership through experience and training. One form of growthis advancement in kind of positions held.A good technique of leadership development is to provide opportunities for peopleto serve at the bottom of the ladder in beginning ways or as help OA special occasions;in other words, to start them up the ladder and see to it that they are given recognitionand encouragement. They become a reservoir from which to draw when filling other positionslater.Keep rosters of people who have been involved in programs to help you think ofnames when such needs arise. LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT IS GROWTH Recognizedcounty leader Place of a demonstration Member of a localstanding committee Assistant 4 -Hproject leader Provided sometransportationOfficer of county orarea development committee President of acounty organization One of \"doers\" in acounty program Served on aspecial committee Took partin a meeting Helped oncewith refreshments Growth in kinds of activity or roles of the individualas one moves up the ladder. Figure 8-1 - 135 - Leaders also grow in their ability to do better in given leadership positions; not all need to be \"promoted\" for development to take place.People grow in personality development, too, as they have opportunities to function as leaders. Besides performing a particular task or leadership function, one gains in knowledge, interest, aspiration and satisfaction. Thus, leadership development, made possible through expanding opportunities to become involved, is .'4 human resource development. Frequently it is best to avoid referring to persons as \"leaders\", or of using the term \"leadership\" when working with given persons or groups. One reason for this is that most good leaders prefer to be humble and not known by such a weighty title. For many, the term implies something they do not think they are or want to be; they prefer to be known by the particular position they are in at a given time, such as president, secretary,committee man or counsellor, rather than as a \"leader\", a term which to them tends to implytoo much \"front\", \"authoritative\" or \"top\" position. Another reason why professional workers should avoid over-use of the term \"leader\" and \"leadership\" is that such terms may weaken the relationship between a leader and his group, which gives rise to his leadership in the first place,People generally do not think of Mr. Blank as a \"leader\", but only as an officer, active participant, or as a person whose opinions they respect. k.Think about Levels and Types of Leaderehip First let us point up what may be called \"levels of leadership \", as suggested by the work of John Mitchell of Ohio State Extension Service.Research indicates that these levels tend or may be expected to be found in almost every local community, certainly every county. Generally, they are also found even within an organization, especially large ones. The tom \"power structure\" represents people who have influence, plus decision- making position, plus authority to carry out decisions,But it is especially helpful in leadership recruitment and later involvement to think of more specific types of leadership than these levels - types classified on the basis of ways in which one provides influence or functions as a leader. This encourages recruitment in relation to given position or role, for different roles and responsibilities have different requirements or call for different types of leadership.Here are several general types of leadership, classified according to general function and role or form of actions (1) participating positional leadership, which would include the positions of leadership in organizations, public and private, common in our society;(2) community leadership, which is influence of community-wide extent relevant to oommunity-wide concerns; (3) informal, indirect leadership that one may exercise \"behind the scenes\"; and (4) the counsellor-adviser type of leadership, in which a leader is not of the group but helping it as a volunteer. Close to this might be paid sub-professional aid working with low income families. These general types are elaborated and subdivided into more specific and commonly understood types below. Any given person may be serving in one, two or several of these capacities or roles at the same time. - 136 - \"Organisational leadership - This refers to the official positions in organization-the duties of the president, secretary, committee men,and the like. Many people are foundtoday in positions of such leadership, especially in view of our increasingly more complexoommunity life. Not all persons can readily serve in organizational leadership positions,but usually more can than do. Adequate training and assistance should be provided forsuch leaders. Subject leadership is also a common type in extension education. It refers to'providing or teaching given subject matter, or where one is staked to help in a given programbecause of the particular knowledge or skills that he hee to offer. For example, the personWho is asked to serve as a 4,la livestock project leader or a camp crafts leader, or a songleader in an organization, or the chairman of the audit committee, or the person who isasked to present a special lesson or study before a home extension unit or civio organi-zation - each is asked because of some speoial knowledge or skill that he can contribute. Action leadership refers to heading up or helping with work relating to theimplementation of a given activity, project, or group action for getting some specificgoal accomplished. Sometimes these people are known as \"doers\", \"Workers\", or \"action\"leaders, because they are willing to help with specific teaks but may not care to be inorganizational or subject teaching positions. Opinion leadership. This refers to the judgment that one exercises about givenwabjects, programs, ideas or points of view. Persons having email leadership generallyhave a lot to do with molding local projects or programs. Opinion leadership generallycomes from persons whose opinions or judgment is well regarded by at least some part ofthe local population. One exercising such leadership also may be an offioer holder insome organization or a teaching leader in some program, but not necessarily, r perhaps notin the area for which he is exercising opinion leadership. Legitimation leadership is found in every community and it is a very importantrole.It refers to the approval given by relevant power structure in relation to givenspecific proposals. Persona from among local government officials, bankers, businessmen, persons ofrelative wealth, and clergymen generally lend legitimation leadership. A subject leaderalso may.provids legitimation leadership in regard to certain specifics of a given proposal.Newspaper editors are opinion leaders but often also provide general legitimation leader-ship. It is safe to Bey that every community, large or small, has one or more personsin it with whom certain program proposals should be checked before going too far too soon.Often it is this approval or disapproval that will cause a project to succeed or failfrom the start. Such leaders are found in county and regiontl communities in regard toconcerns of area significance, while other legitimation leaders occupy a similar positionin primarily the local community, neighborhood or town for matters of these scopes. Initiating leadership., the beginning of ideas. In almost every group cm communityare one or more persons known to be the \"idea\" people, the ones who come up with proposalsfor new policies, programs, or solutions to particular problems. While in other cases theinitiating leadership may seem to be a product of the group itself. In any event the ini-tiating leadership generally becomes involved in group action of some kind, affirmativeor negative. Decision leadership is self-explanatory. Decision making is a crucial process,for at many points in the course of the aooial action of a given project, a decision aboutsomething has to be made, usually either by an official, some delegated leader, or bygroup vote.But generally the supporting opinion and legitimation already should havebeen developed by the time this point is reached in the decision making. -137- Persona in various leadership roles are involved in making decisions all alongthe way; they are the ones who pound out final answers and give their eye or nay tomatters under consideration. Decision makers in this sense frequently are found in orga-nizational and public official positions, where making decisions is part of the responsi-bilities of their offices. Decision making is closely related to opinion leadership and legitimation but isnot exactly the same ae these. Each tends to also contain a certain degree of power;that is, persons possessing or functioning in opinion and legitimation leadership rolesmay possess decision making position and power authority related to the decisions. Public official leadership refers to governmental office holders. These especiallyhavecertainresponsibilities to the community. They have influence and power, bestowedby the community. Local governmental leaders generally do not initiate new policies or programs butfollow the people - they oonaider and acoept or reject proposals which other leadershipadvocates.This is why the other forms of citizen leadership mentioned, some of which maybe found in development committees, planning commissions and civic organizations, are sovery important; for here is often where the initiation, legitimation and early organizationof needed projects takes place, which constitute the eaeential early steps in communitydevelopment. Advisory or counselor leadership ie the assistance provided by a person outsidethe immediate group as an advisor* For examples, the 4-H club adult leaders or the churchyouth group counselors. Advisory or counselor leaders often may have certain knowledgeor interests and be teaching such object matter, but their specific role is that ofproviding advice, suggestions, and indirect leadership, to individual membera and to thegroup rather than that of the above types; this is the uniquenese of the counselor typeof Leadership. Ccncentratcdvs...dispereed leadership - Frequently the same people are providingmost of these different types of leadership, at different points or stages in given socialaction. In fact, these different leadership functions or roles also may be found beingperformed by one person, or by two or more persons; or it may be centered in a family, orin an organisation which locally may \"head\" the power structure of the community. Undoubtedlyyou maybe able to name one or more communities where the \"power structure\" leadership -the opinion, legitimation and decision making roles - tend to center in one or two personswho were perhaps in official positions, or in one or two families, or perhaps in someorganization or group. Not infrequently cases also arise Where decisions greatly affecting the communityperhaps are made by someone living outside the local community in the county seat town orlarger city where may be located the headquarters of a company which operates some localindustry. General vs. specialized leadership - Used in a general sense, \"decision maker\"and \"power structure\" tend to refer to community-wide or general leadership, and embodyopinion leadership as well as the final decision making in some given projects or socialactions. - 138 - Mention already has been made of: (1)special-interest leadership, and (2)oommunity or general leadership. Some persons may be found in both, but there is ques-tion as to whether a person deeply concerned with some special interest can generallylend effeotive leadership to community-wide conoerns; this seems to take a differenttype of person - one who has a total community viewpoint and welfare of the people atheart. General community-wide or overall leadership is in contrast to special interestor specific subject leadership, such els being a lender in the agricultural or businessor recreation or educational and welfare phase of community life. Even withinthesethere may be specialized leadership. Reoent researches by rural sociologists tend to show that in small communities,a more or less \"general\" community leadership does exist and can be quite easily identi-fied, but that as size of community increases in the studies, the leadership or powerstructure tends to become more diffuse and it is difficult ti identify the general communityleader or leaders, indeed if there are any. It is important then, to be concerned withspecialized leadership, but always having the role of general community leadership in mind.It may be found sometimes residing in the public official leadership or in the localnewspaper. In view of all this, the selection of leadership to involve in area or regionalprogram developments becomes a crucial matter which in most cases deserves careful thoughtbefore proceeding. However, area leaders have beep suocessfully identified using the same\"reputational\" teohnique for identifying local community leadership, which is describedlater. Persons known by others as community leaders generally are also known asthinkers, analysts and people of good judgment. A community leader is not necessarily aninnovator, nor is he usually the best farmer or other careereman. The foremost criterionis influence - followers:hip. Plenty of evidence exists which indicates that social groups do have their in-fluential leaders within them.This is true of all types c,f communities and levels ofliving or population seenents. However, in many cases much of such leadership may bequite informally expressed or exercised and is often found in neighbor groups. Studies ofvisiting patterns and of who persons go to see for given kinds of help have highlightedsuch leadership. The concepts \"decision maker\" and \"power structure\" have become increasinglypopular in some social ecience circles during recent years. Power is an element ofleadership functioning in many cases, but power is not by any means the 4hole of leader-ship.Simple influenoe and devoted assistance to given Programs or ideas beoause ofpersonal oonoern for given goals or compassion for human or community welfare, are alsomein components of the leadership influence exerted by many people to whom we refer as\"leaders\". In this section we have tried to analyze \" leadership\" by breaking it down intoseveral types according to basic function or process, in order to give a bit clearer des-cription-ef all the leadership that comes to play in a community.flaur seJimte1%ements in Kind All of the above types of leadership emphasize the'need for giving thought inrecruitment to the responsibilities and expectation of given involvement or leaders wanted,then to the kinds of persons who oan provide the types of leadership needed. A key ques-tion always must be: For what purpose are you wanting to recruit leaders or to help - 139 - communities recruit leader!? Some suggestions are briefly mentioned for a few examples of leaders generally recruited in extension-related programs.For public affaimjiattritua - generally invite thinkers; persons who can lendobjective analysis above special interests; persons who can lend opinion, decision, andlegitimation leadership; persons who would fall into the classification of \"community or general\" leadership. Don't invite organization officials simply because they are in such positions.Don't invite persons simply because they can spare the time to attend a dis-trict workshop and will give you a carload to go.Keep purpose in mind, the kind offollowup that you want from them. For ,i-H_adultleaders - Here the leadership function is primarily of thecounsel-type, and involves a number of specific responsibilities. 4-H adult leaders must have specific knowledge or skills; also like to work with young people and have patience.Fnceurage leader recruitment by club members and parents themselves; make local 4-H worka community responsibility, not just \"extension's program\". Do not invite a person to be a 4-H organization or project leader simply becausehe !s a general community leaderor mainly proves opinion and legitimation leadership; and certainly not because he or she is the best livestock farmer or cake-maker. Especially avoid selecting leaders on the basis that \"the busy people make the best leaders\". This simply compounds the leadership development problem; it puts too much emphasis on \"extension's program\" instead of 4-H being the \"community's program\". A major value of extension education is that it provides opportunities for involvement of other people than those already busy; which helps them start up the ladder of greaterparticipation. For county or area develorern,committees - first of all, it would seem that mostof the people in these groups should be thinkers and have community viewpoint. Never invite,a person to such a committee simply because he is a good farmer, or because he isan officer in a given organization and will represent it. The least important element to have in development committees is organization representation as such, for this frequentlytends to .build decisiveness into the committee from the beginning. But this does not rule out the possibilities that from time to time or in a particular situation it may beespecially desirable to have the involvement by name of a given organization or institution.Analytical thinking will be the main job; therefore, encourage the selection ofpersons who can do this with the total community in mind. Consider the social systems of the county or area - the different localities or:171$.1unities and the social profile - for these ai'e What you should be mainly wanting to have represented. Start small with recognised general community leaders, and involve others as needed, temporarily for special purposes if not permanently. Organizational people will become included, but not simply for this reason.For commodity planning committees and demonstrations. Here it is safe to assume that the main type of leadership to be concerned with is subject matter interest and know.- ledge.However, thinkers are in many cases to be desired over size of businesi andexcellence; much depends upon the purposes of the committee or one's expected roles ingiven project activity.t_orderristrationanacesoffleldtr as a means of teaching others orgetting spread of given practicesi the first criterion for selection must be the amount of influence one seems to have within the community or particular segment of porulationone is hoping to reach. For without this influence, no amount of excellence on the part 140 of the demonstration will motivate very much spread among the people. People are generallybest reached through leaders of their own status group or level. This is why special caremust be taken in selecting places for demonstrations end teaching points, when attemptingto work with low income families, ethnic groups or others of significantly different socialalignment.Sometimes a person having leadership influence may not be ready to serve as acommodity committeeman or demon krator. In such cases it is far better to take the timeto make them ready, through perhaps several months of individual work with him, than to goahead with some other person who is ready but has little or no followership or influenceamong the particular families you want to reach.This also raises the question as to whether a pere .could be selected for aleadership position, such as for a development or project commsttee, who is known to benegative or antagonistic to the purposes at hand, just in order to have \"better representation\", in the hope that he can \"become convinced or developed\"? The general ansser tosuch a question is No; why purposely stack the cards against success at the start whensuccess may be difficult at best. But a little later, Yes; after personal contactsperhaps have created favorable interest or positive motivation. After all, constructivecritics are highly useful. All in all, the answer to the whole question depends much uponthe overall situation.galaSygtegetic ProcedureLeaders are usually well chosen but sometimes mistakes are made and projectsfail because tee selection method was not approved by the group or inadequate leaderswereselectea,In leadership selection, it is usually desirable if some group expressioncan be secured. This gives the selectee. leadership a feeling of confidence that they havesupport.The group also feels that their resources are being used and that they haveleaders who understand their needs red proUems and will conform to their norms. People are generally somewhat reluctant to accept as leaders people from outsidetheir social structure. Designation of leadership by some outside official is not generally an effective method to secure competent acceptable leadership. A number of models or theoretical concepts for identifying leaders have beendeveloped and tested by social science researches and experimental studies of recentyears.Each requires the getting of specific data, but by practical, easily manageableways.Five of these models or methods are briefly described here. 1.The reputational method. The name should make this method eelfexplanatory;it means the persons who have a loisal reputation for being actual or potential leadersof given types. The method involves asking a- or 4 persons to serve as judges (say banker,school superintendent, and clergyman) to each name the 5 or 6 persons in the communitywho they consider to be most interested in the subject, program or leader role underconsideration. This may be done for a county or larger area as a whole, or for severallocal places within it in order to make up a sizeable list.Then the names obtained are sorted by frequency mentioned, and those of highfrequency are accepted as possible selectees. From this list a final list may be drawnconsidering certain known other data about the nominees or situation that it may benecessary to consider. In some studies the first list itself is the surveyed with thesame questions, to boil down the number further. 141 This method is usually used for identifying persons to serve on general community development committees. But it also may be adapted to selecting persons for work with 4H clubs or in other leadership roles, by simply varying the type of questions asked.For general development committees, the judges would be asked to name Who they consider to be most interested in the general welfare of the community; persons who wouldmost likely give effective leadership to community development type endeavors; persons who are considered by the people as having community viewpoint and whom in the judge'sopinion the people Would favor for heading up communitytype projects.Caution has to be taken to make sure that in trying to identify genera communityleadership,thejudges are not thrown off balance by the increasing specialization of leadership today. Certain persons may have a high reputation in some regard but not beinterested in or able to provide the general community leadership you may be wanting to identify. Some recent work by rural sociologists in Ohio and Iowa with area resourcedevelopment specialists, verifies both the practicality and the validity of this reputational method. 2.The decisionmakinggtracer method. First you select certain \"actions\" toanalyze, then you trace down what happened or Who did What, in order to identify thepersons who made or led in making the miAn decisions relative to the events or action selected.This method is believed by some social scientists to have much promise; it is easy to do and gets at actual leadership rather than identifying on the basis of impression and estimate.However, it is limited in use by the fact that it may be difficult to find an adequate \"action\" to trace down. 3.The formal position incumbent method, which simply means that you pick persons who are in selected organizations and public official positions. This method does give a rather complete picture of the current organizational leadership structure of a community at any given time, but most of the persons still may not be able to provide thetype of leadership you may be wanting for given purposes.Certain questions also have tc be decided;What period or time span is to be used for the persons in some of the offices will change from time to time. Also as mentioned before, organizational leaders generallyhave tbtir own groups first at heart; therefore, much leader training abolt their-LAW roleas general community leaders must be provided. 4.The social participation method. In thisIlthod one attempts to determineWho are the most active people in the community in +ems of participation in existingorganizations, on the assumption that these are or would be potential leaders in thecommunity.Simple surveys can be constructed which measure people's membership inorganizations, attendance, office holding, and the like. This method of identifyingwould require-more or less a complete survey of the community or a careful study of the membership of all the organizations tc bt included. 5.The informal oontact method. Through surveys and observations of visitingpatterns and asking who people go to see for idoas or help in emergencies, persons can beidentified who seem to have the respect of the neighborhood or group.This is an especiallyusefulmethodof identifying actual or potential leaders among low income familieswhere there is little other organized participation to go by.Still other methods probably could be devised to identify the \"true\" currentleadership of a populatiOn$ as a glide for appointing or electing persons for givenleadership positions co- roles. But the important point of this disoussion is that one -142- should be systematic about leadership selection, and that the 5 methods briefly describedrepresent systematic or deliberate approaches which help to provide more solid basis,consistency, and accuracy, than simply pulling names \"out of the blue\" based only onlimited acquaintance.Each of the 5 methods is easy to operate, and once you have used one or two ofthem, you will have a long lint which can serve as a reservoir from which to draw personsfor given programs. Such a list will undoubtedly include numerous persons whom you hadnever thought of before. By endeavoring to involve and develop them you will be greatlyincreasing the leadership base of extension education and community development in yourcounty or areal as well as contributing to the development of people themselves, which isextension's primary objective.Enlistment Calls For TactRecruitment of leaders involves far more than identification. Next comesenlistment or getting the persons identified to serve. Raving started persons up theladder by involving thee in one particular occasion or activity is a basic step. Pinpointprospects.Think about the person and his situation; anticipate his objections and havesome answers ready.Then ciecide on who should do the asking or inviting. Oftentimes it is moreeffective for someone other than a professional agency worker to do so, or at least tomake the first approach; then this can be followed by an approach by the professionalworker.Or perhaps just the opposite may be the most desirable in some other case. At any rate plan on more than one approach. Also, do not push for a YES or NOanswer on the first try, especially when enlisting persons for important positions. Givea person time to think about the matter; it is only fair to do so, for you must appreciatehis situation. The extra time allowed also conveys a sense of importanoe about the job;also a feeling that you really want him.Always explain the importance of the job when enlisting persons into greaterparticipation or leadership, and briefly outline responsibilities or the things he is todo.Emphasize the worthwhileness of the program and satisfactions of service in workingfor such goals. People like to be part of a useful and going concern. Certainly don'tpick persons just to attend some meeting for the record's sake; have follow-up educationalpurpose in mind and try to identify and enlist persons accordingly. Keep in mind thepreviously described types of leaderships.Aim to begin enlistment of a leaders by personal contact; telephone calls andletters simply do not afford ample opportunities for explanation or to convey importanceof the job and your sincerity.Group selection is by far the greatest motivating force for enlistment - that is,having been selected through some form of group decision or expression of desire andsupport on the part of the group. Such enlistment establishes a relationship of leaderresponsibility to the group and group support to the leader, which is far strongerthan merely agreeing to do something for somebody personally. Q course the, purpose fOr which a leader is being selected sometimes necessitatesagent selection, but the more that you can build some kind of group involvement in the.process, the better it will be. This even might be simply disoussing with two or threepersons or a relevant committee the question of who should be invited to attend the givenmeeting, for example - \"What kind of a person should go, what do we want then to doafterward, and What suggestions do you have\"? - 143 - Of course, in launching work with new limited audiences, such as with familiesof low income, individual work with 2 or 3 families here and there ie the first step.Based on the rapport and motivation thus developed, the next step is small group workinvolving a few families in one of more group type projects or activities. Move to moreformal organization only as necessary to achieve goals outlined. People are developed -leadership is developed- as they learn from expanding experiences, opportunitites andresponsibilities. Finally, make use of leaders invited imo programs. As soon as possible openopportunitites for them to nerve or contribute. Provide them guidance, training andassistance.Then give them recognition - words of commendation and encouragement. A basic guideeheet to help make plans for training leaders follows, with blankform filled out as an example. This guide in blank form has becalm widely used as a teaching tool for use instaff training, and also as a planning tool in oouaties. It emphasizes and applies theidea that training 'should be geared to the specific responsibilities ant: needs of thespecific leaders being trained. It may be first taught by putting on chalkboard in blankform.In many cases it is duplicated in blank form for use as worksheets in trainingsessions, or for actual use as a planning tool.

However, a basic requirement in this is to bridge the gap in communications between the people with the problems and the agencies who have programs for dealing with them. Area and county extension agents in the Charleston Area of West Virginia (U.S.A.) set about to do this through aseries of community improvement workshops. We had found that two factors generally stand in the way of effective community problem solving. One is _hat the people are not aware of services and programs available, or at least do not make the first move to contact them. The other stumbl'ig block to action is that agencies do not really know the feeling and needs of the people.Community OEsenization FormedThe first step in this pilot effort was to develop some sense of community spirit, organization and unified effort, as a basis for increasing communication to and from the people.This could only come about after intensive work with individual families and special groups on home and personal problems.We had done this during the last couple of years in several small communities, from which has resulted considerable success in developing rapport, awareneeses, changed family practices and new attitudes. The next step naturally was community effort on community needs.To launch this, visite were made with many of the families, during which timediscussion centered around neighborhood conditions and the problems which many of the familieP seemed to have in common, sum\\ as education, jobs, insurance, health, housing and public services. Then, two or tire meetings were held in each of the places, purposely to further discuss community-wide conditions and concerns as community groups.Besides the ideas on problems and projects that come out of this activity, leadership began to emerge; also a sense of ,ommunity responsibility, goals and motivation. The idea of forming an organization was approved and officers elected.The visits and meetings also establlEd in the minds of the people a broader image of the work of the extension agents, who 11,f to that time had been working with them largely on individual family matters. Community Inprovement Workshops a KeyExtension agents suggested during the meetings the ider of joint agency-citizenproblem-solving action, Which led to having community improvement workshops. These were 3-hour meetings of citizens and agency representativns. They were preceded by preparation in the form of study by citizen self-survey committees.A community improvement committee of 7 or 8 people was formed in each of these small communites.Committee members chose specific problem areas on which to wor and conducted studies of such areas as roads, utilities, health, education, welfare and recreation. The committees contacted other local residents in order to involve them in identifying problems, and they met weekly with the area extension. agent for guidance and co4sultation. After six weeks of thoughtful analysis of community needs, the committees prepared Community Problem Reports. The reports were developed from both written and tape recorded findings of the committees. 1./ Thomas E. Woodall and E.J.

These included the State Road and Public ServiceCommissions, Health and Welfare Department, Board of Education, Soil Conservation ServiceFarmers Home Administration, Employment Security, Vocational Rehabilitation, and theCommunity Action Agency of the Economic Opportunity.The format for the workshops was informal and simply structured, in order toencourage maximum participation. An agenda of five steps was used. (1) Community leadersopened the sessions, with the area extension agent also making brief introductory remarks.(2) Each agency representative then made short statements concerning his agency and theproblems of people as communities. (3) The Community Improvement Committee then discussedits findings in the form of a report to the agencies and local people present.Next, (4) came a planning session, which proved to be the highlight of the entireworkshops.This was the meeting of agency representatives and respective committees,seated at conference tables, to discuss respective problems and proposals. Then, workingtogether, they focused upon tie development of plans and program to solve the identifiedproblems.Following the planning period, (5) another general session was held, duringwhich the Community Improvement Committee and agency people summarized the problemsdiscussed, the volutions arrived at, and plans called for continued close contact betweencitizens and a cies through further meetings in the communities as planned programswere carried oaMany Improvements UnderwayBoth citizens and agencies were enthusiastic about the accomplishments of theworkshops and the tangible achievements since made. In one community plans were developedfor a community water system through the cooperation of the Farmers Home Administration.Work on obtaining natural gas service is now nearly completed. Road recommendations wereinmediately surveyed by State road officials, and work has now begun on them. HealthDepartment officials agreed to obtain a permit for the community to dump garbage and trashat officially designated locations within the county. They also are advising leaders onhow to deal with a large body of stagnant backwater which serves as a breeding ground formosquitoes.The idea of erecting a traffic signal at the dangerous local railroad crossingis being studied by road :and railroad people.In another community natural gas and water system services are now assured becauseof joint plans arrived at by the citizens Farmers Home Administration,Public ServiceCommission and the gas company officials. Road. Commission crews are busy carrying outreoommendations by the oommittee. This already has resulted in improved garbage collectionand school bus service to the community. Adult basic education olasses have been establishedcooperatively by the community's Education Committee and the local Board of Education, after27 local citizens indicated their desire for further education.Inadequate recreational programs have been a problem in this area for years.However, Recreation Committee members were able to develop plans, in cooperation with theBoard of Edacation's Recreation Supervisor, for both day and evening recreation forchildren and adults.The plans include transportation of children to a swimming pool for weekly swimminglessons under the supervision of competent instructors. k Bcy Scout Troop was formed, whena parsonin a leadership education course saw the need and possibilities, and volunteered - 147 - to be Scout Master. The Health Committee vanted more work done and,. for one thing, satup an afternoon cancer clinic at which 6' women of the community's 87 families attended the first session. PartnersIn Community Progress But the implications of this effort go far beyond the tangible improvements that have or will result from the workshops. Agency representatives were brought face to face with the true situations of communities, which enabled them to focus resources on problems and develop feasible solutions on a much more valid and realistic basis thanotherwise.The presence of several agencies in the community at the same time permittedmuch more comprenhensive and unified approaches to problem situations than is possible when agencies are involved independently. The aiscussion of problems aid plans in the workshops represented an approac3.1entirely from the perspective of the people themselves. All too often cormmtnity develop- ment efforts attempt to superimpose expert or profesirlonal judgment upon the community, generally with emphasis on promoting particular eolutions instead of solving problems.The extension agents who were involved in this method see it as a solution tothe alienation and conditions that the people of the inarticulate and relatively isolatedrural communities of Appalachia have had to live with for far too long. They believe it also demonstrates that people in such communities can and will become interested in doingsomething about their prob3ems, if given adequate leadership from outside.Factors such as Land Tenure Credit S stems etc. that influence Extension DevelopmentOther factors such as land tenure and credit systems influence extension teaching Erven J. Long deecribed three categories of institutional impediments to rural progress, those which inhib!: the play of incentives, those which inhibit the capabilities of rural people, and those which inhibit the development and utilisation of science and technology. All impediments to rural prog. as are of vital concern to Vle extension service. In most instances, it is outside the province of extension to change existing institutions. But the influence of these institutions must be taken into account in planning and conductingextension educational programs. Institvtions which inhibit the of incentives 3./ Ina4itutions typical of an under-developed country inhibit the play of incentives in encouraging individual initia- tive - incentives to work hard, to save, to invest, to innovate, to take risks, to acquire skills.Pointed as they are toward the survival of the species, these institutions place the emphasis on stability and security for the group rather than rewards for innovations to the individual. This emphasis is not achieved by any single institution, but by an inter-looked system of institutions which work in concert to achieve this one general result. Land tenure institntions are, olassioally, considered to be at the heart of this basic problem in many of the underdeveloped countries. Labor is so plentiful, and off-farmjob opportunities so limited, that ownership of land carries with it almost complete control over the lives of the landless. If the tenant chooses to work a little harder, or invest some of his savings in his farm, he must share heavily with his landlord the fruits of his extra labour. This, if he is lucky, if he has some economic or politioal bargaining power.\"'tore often than not, and given a little time, the Lando rear finds ware' of absorbing virtually all the extra production for himself. Thus he learns not to smile, lest the landlordraise his rent. As the Eastern proverb has it \"A smile on the face of a tenant speaks ofthe stupidity of hie landlord\". Erven 3. Long - Institutional Factors Lifting Progress in the Less - ,Developed Countries,Agency for International Development 12/29/1963 no 4-8. T h e r e are, however, other institutions which aork with equal effect to deadenthe play of incentives. The credit system often holds farmers in total bondage to themoney lenders, sometimes for money borrowed by long dead anoe6tors t1 the indebted farmers.Interest rates often run 100% or higher per year. Illiterate ailiagers frequertly haveto rely on the money lender's calculations, which are not always made with scrupuloushonesty.Worse still, very little of the credit serves the useful purpose of makingfarmer more productive. Mostdevelopingsocieties accord high esteem to ceremcoita;in some countries over half the money borrowed by farm families is spent on wedding's;funerals and the like. And of that which is spent for so called \"production\" purpose,rather little really finds its way into improved farming, so that the credit does nothingbut keep the farmer irx debt. A study with which the writer was associated in India indi-cated that not more than 5 to 10 per cent of the short term investment - what econcaistscall \"variable capital\" was used in a way that increased the farmer's productivity, andhence his total income. This heavy burden of indebtedness for unproductive creditobviously discourages the farmer from making productive investments, or any kind ofinnovation which requires even a little capital, by soaking up his potential savings andcutting off possibilities for additional borrowing.The pricing and marketing system, or lack thereof, also destroy the play of in-centives for the farmer to work, to invest, or to innovate. Mostdevelopingcountrieshave only rudimentary pricing and marketing systems. Prices for identical products oftenvary widely from village to nearby village. They vary even more widely from village tocity, and more widely still from time to time. Farmerscommonly do not know of higherprices in other nearby areas or more distant cities. If they do knows they often cannottake advantage of higher prices elsewhere, as they are bound by prior understandings,socially more compelling than contracts, to sell to the money lender in whose debt theyare.And their resources are far too meager - even if they had storage facilities - toawait the higher prices which will come when today's production gluts give way to tomorrow'sfamine.Thus the entire marketing and pricing system works against inducing proper invest-ments at and proceding planting time, as the promise of future gain beckons only weaklyand from great distance through the fog of uncertainty which enshreade the typical fa mer'sprice expectations. The problem is not, in most countries, so much of prices being 4604low or of marketing margins being too high; it is primarily that of the farmer's uncer aintyof what the prices will be and, ospecially, of whom will get the higher prices - he, thelandlord, or the money lender.The type of social organization - the greater family or the tribe - alsoprofoundly affects the play of incentives. Americans take for granted a concept offamily organization which applies powerful leverage upon the primary faailo head to striveon behalf of himself, and his wife and children. This is not, however, the norm in thedeveloping countries. Rewards for unusual effort do not normallj go to the man whomakes it - even though he receives the money in the first instance - but to an elder orchieftain who distributes it through a tangled skein of family or tribal relations. Indeed,extreme sooial censure is brought to boar on anyone who holds for himself any appreciableportion of the rewards for his own extra effort. True enough, in some sooietiee theindividual appears to be motivated to work for the greater family or tribe rather than forhimself or his immediate family; but this motivation is probably more apparent than real.In any event, the entire greater family or tribal structure places emphasis upon theindividual having oarefully assigned responsibilities to the larger group, disoouragingany imaginative deviation from these responsibilities. For deviation by the individualinvites only censure from the group if he fails, and rewards for others if he succeeds. The problem of risk - taking must be given special attention. Not only all of theinstitutions discuseed above, but also the very nature of his economic sitte ion disooura.ges the farmer from taking the rialto inherent in innovation. \"Nothing ventured, nothinggained\", is a true edage of the human enterprise - but a dangerous prinoiple for the farmerinadeveloping country. Living as he does at the very margin subsistence, what he - 149 ventures is different in kind from What he might hope to jaiThe difference between 50 and zero is much greater than that between 50 and 100 - if 50 is the minimum necessary to survival.And although the greater family or tribe shields the invidual from losses caused?cumetances accepted as beyond his control, it does not -r_orelly do so for losses caby his playing with new therefore unsanctioned ideaThus, the greater family or tribal organization of society is, in most developing countries, probably the mov potent single inhibitor of the play of those incen- tives necessary for inducing progress. Institutional Factors inhibit the Develo eet of Capabilities of Rural PealeAs stated earlier, development appears to depend primarily upon the development of human resources and capabilities. We are concerned at this point with a factor affect- ing the development of human capabilities - namely, the opportunity for individuals to acquire meaningful experience while they are young trough to try new ideas and to learn from this experience. Our society deliberately provides children with opportunities for developing self reliance, to prepare them for their self -determining roles as young adults. This is not true in most developing countries; deciefeaking is restricted to family elders long after the offspring have reached full adult;-ood. Even such decision as when to marry, what vocation to follow, how to spend their earnings, etc., are made for, not by, the young and even the middle-aged adult. Also, in our rural society the family farm system of agriculture develops entrepreneurial and management eking, by requiring every farmer to think and act for himself, rewaring him for his good judgements, penalizin,,: him for his mistakes. Most other systems of land tenure do not provide this built-in devi-e of self-education. This may well be a fatal weakness, in the long-run, of the collective or cooperative farm, or ether mode' f.Irms of group tenure.They may be responsive in the Short-un to the introduction of new knowledge and technology, but they so limit the numbers of people who acquire managerial and entrepeneuri.-1 skills that, in time, they become rigid and sterile of new development potential.Institutional Factors which Inhibit the Develo and Utilization Science snd Technology. The extension and service institutions carry science and teeanology to farmers.In great part, as in our ewn country, this function, as well as research and education, mast be carried out in the so-called \"public sector\". This is important when we reoognize that, in developingcountries such as we have described, government has been largely evolved fer the purpose of maintaining order and collecting revenue.Although this is most apparent a oolonial system, it is inherent even in a politically independent oountry to the extent that it has purified static rather than dynamic ends. As such countries begin actively to pursue progress as a central goal of policy, an entirely new role is demanded of government and of public service. Rural development, as distinct from the maintenanoeof order in rural areas, requires not only that public officials have technical rather than merely administrative competence, it requires that they assume a servant rather than a master eelationsihip to the farm people with whom they work. This is a difficult transitionto makelespecially since in these societies the deepest cultural values are inherent in status relationships. But a democratically oriented, progressive agriculture appears to require a complex system of government services to farmers - research service, extension service, credit service, marketing service, price supporting service, etc.And althgh names of these functions can be changed, the fundamental service relationship between the public agent and the individual farmer is probably essential to development. At ',east, this ie our hypothesis. As any other system based upon authority rather than upon enlisting the informed self-interest of the farmer, it has never appeared to :cork well anywhere.111/ Erventl. Long - Institutional Factors Limiting Progress in the Less- Developed Countries, Agency for International Development 12/29/63 - 150 - Institutions of formal education and research which have been developed duringthe essentially static past of the typical underdeveloped country must also make profoundadaptations in their new roles as participants in the development process. We list belowsome of the more basic Changes which will commonly be required.In research, a change of attitude as to its basic purpose is required, anchoringit solidly in the development needs of the country's agriculture, rather than as an end initself.This requires more than a recitation of the right words. It must lead tocareful emir'', in selection of research problems. For the numbers of problems arelegion, and the research resources and competencies extremely limited. ;election ofproblems for research must be based on criteria such as relative importance to development,probability that research may find a solution, probable usability of the solution byand probable cost of the research.For research to participate in agricultural development there must be new administrative and scientific alignments, a breaking down of barriers which separate relatedscientific discip1L, in order to meet the requirements of the problems needing solution.In most of such countries new, effective research on animal production, for example, isalmost impossible because of the administrative and scientific separation of animal husbandryfrom crop production. Similar barriers, almost as high and inpenetrable, separate soilsfrom crop production, forestry from soil conservation and economics from almost everything relevant to farming.The LAW orientation of research toward development objectives will require muchcloser relationship with extension and educational efforts. And, especially, extensionefforts must be anchored much more in such processes as exist or can be stimulatul throughwhich farm groups cam make their wishes known. Much too commonly, research findings areShot out at farmers from the research bastions, -:-.hrough a administrativebureaucracy called \"Agricultural Extension\" or \"Communi'.- moreeffective means of farmer participation and indeed -troll which is the real heart of ourextension system, must be evolved if research and Aion are to become truly at one withthe agricultural development process.The agricultural colleges will also undergo substantial change as they adaptt:,emselves to develivmertary roles. The subject matter of courses will be based uponlocal research are experienoe, rather than material from foreign sources. Teaching methodswill adjust to emphasize the creative use of science to achieve specific mral developmentobjectives, rather than upon rote memory or scientific principles unrelated to practice.Examination and other otIldent appraisal devices will be modified to identify potentialagriculturaldevelopment capabilities of students. Chapter 9. EXTENSION TEACHING METHOnS The essential function of the extension worker is to create situations in which others develop education lly. Learning is an active r'ocess on -fte part of the learner. Unless he becomes intere ted to the point of putting fc-rth mental and physical effort to learn, nothing is accomplished. It is the task of the extension worker to: \"(1) provide ocople with an opportunity to learn, and (2) stimulate mental and physical activity that pa-oduw,,3 the desired learning.\" J,Effective extension methods satisfy these criteria.People learn best in different wa7s;some by listening, some by seeing, some by doing and still others througt discussion. Studies have shown that the more different extension teaching methods are used, the more people change their practice. The more exposures per individual to a new practice the more likely the person will find his preferred method of learning. Different extension teaching methods are most effective in varying situations and at different stages of the adoption process.All people do not learn at the same speed, some may be at the stage of trying t new practice and want to know the details of how to do it when others are barely aware of the practice or just becoming interested. For these reasons use of a variety of teaching methods is most effective.As indicated in Chapioar 7, extension methods: may be classified in three groups on the basis of the number of people they are designed to reach. These are: (1) individual methods, (2) group methods, and (3) mass methods. Individual Methods Learning is an individual process.Although extension agents must use group and mass methods to reach large numbers of people and to stimulate joint action in planning and carrying out projects of common interest, personal contacts serve many essential purposes. The personal influence of the extension worker is a vital force in securing cooperation and participation in extension activities and adoption of improved practices on the farm and in the home. People will listen to the advice and suggestions of an extension worker whom they feel they know, like, and whose knowledge they respect.Integrity on the part of the extension worker is indispensable. If you do not know the answer to a question, don't bluff but tell the villager you will find out and let him know. Then be sure to do it. Farm and home visits are essential elements of extension education.They provide a means of personal communication between the farm family and the extension worker in an environment where they can thscuse matters of common interest in privacy and without the distractions and interruptions commonly experienced in group extension activities.Farm and home visits serve the following useful purposes:-To acquaint extension worker with the farmer and farm family-To answer specific '.requests for help-To gain first hand knowledge of problems faced by the farmer or villager11..11=11/J. Paul. Leagans, Professor of Extension EducationCornell University, Ithaca, New York.USA. To ex-plain a recommended practiceifollow up and observe the resui-s of recommended practicesTo plan an activity such as a dern:nstration, or a meetingTothe farmer or villager to participate in a planned activityTo discl.ca policies and programsTo recruit, train cr encourage a local volunteer leader.Careful and adequate preparation is the key to a viccessful visit as with all extensionmethods.Visits are expensive in terms of time and transportation. When an extensionworker must walk or ride a bicycle many kilometers to visit a farm or a home, he willconsider very carefully the purpose of his visit and ccine several visits in a singletrip if possible. He should plan his visits just as carefully when traveling by automobile.Preparation for a visit will include a review of all the known facts about the farm,the farmer and the family, specifi,, information concerning the problem, purpose or activityinvolved and materials such as leaflets and samples that may be left with the farmer. The approach you use often determines the success of your visit. The attitude ofthe farmer affects the length of the visit. If he is very busy, come quickly to thepoint and end the interview as soon as the main purpose is accomplished. If he wantsto take more time and show you his fields or livestock, fit in with his desires to theextent your time permits.In making the visit, be conscious of your role as an extension tea.cher. Tot- areexpected to provide sound technical information and relate it directly to the farm andthe farmer through informal discussion of his crops, livestock, or living situation.Allow the farmer or farmer's wife to do much of the talking but guide the conversationinto constructive channels. In addition to the planned purpose of the visit it mayprovide an opportunity to arouse the interest of the family in other features of theextension program. A visit planned to investigate an insect outbreak may 1...vovide anopportunity to invite teenage boys and girls to join a youth club, or the mother to attenda food preparation demonstration.Follow local customs in accepting hospitality. If visitors are expected to drinktea with their host, then drink tea but be ..areful not to acquire a reputation as one whospends all his time drinking tea.End the visit tactfully when your mission is accomplished by inviting the farmerto visit your office or suggestinc that you will return at a later date with more information or to check progress.Be cautious about discussing a farmer's situation with other farmers and do notbecome a carrier of gossip. Success in the use of recommended practices may be publicizedto encourage others of their value but publicity on financial success may make the farmera target of requests for gifts or loans from relatives, friends or unscrupulous acquaintanow.

A few chairs, a bulletin rack with up to date informa- tional material and neat display relating to current extension activities will contribute to this purpose. A clean noat office is attractive and encourages both extension staff and visitors to keep it clean. Some visitors are shy and find it difficult to tell you the real purpose of their visit.Try to put him at ease with friendly conversation alai ask questions to help him clarify his problem or request. Satisfy his purpose to the best of your ability and terminate the interview without letting it drift into a long aimless visit. This can be done tactfully by asking if there are any other matters with which you can help.A care- ful record of office calls pr rides a basis for follow-up activity and may serve as one measure of public participation in extension activities.Telephone calls serve a purpose similar to office calls. Although face to face contact is missing they have the advantage that they.may be initiated by either the farmer or the extension worker. They &re useful in soliciting and giving specific information such as treatment of a known disease, control of infestations of pests, variety of tomatoes to plant or to request a bulletin or circular.They provide a means of follow-up and evaluation of the effectiveness of radio or television broadcasts. People will call the extension office to request a certain new bulletin or circular mentioned in the radio announcement. Extension offices in highly developed services sometimes find it- necessary to employ special telephone numbers and taped recordings to answer the flood of inquiries after especially interesting programs or announcements. UnfortunLely, many countries do not have efficient telephone service in rural areas and this method of extension teaching is of limited application.Personal letters are useful in answering requests for information, as follow-up after visits and office calls and in contacting local volunteer leaders.Studies in the United States indicate that letters are not considered an important source of information by farmers, and used alone do not change many practices. But a request from a farmer for information indicates genuine interest and should be answered promptly and courteously. The use of letters as a teaching method is quite limited in countries lacking an efficient postal servioe or where many rural residents are illiterate. But they are an important and sometimes the only means of internal communication in an extension service.Be careful that the information you give is simple, understandable and completewithout being wordy or including unnecessary information. Put yourself in the shoes ofthe person to whom you are writing. Remember, the words you put on paper are all he hasto go by in determining your meaning.Informal contacts provide many opportunities for effective extension work. Everyexperienced extension worker has had people stop him on the street or in the villageto ask a question. Often, seeing the extension worker will remind the villager of aproblem about which he would like technical advice. Market days, picnics, holidaycelebrations and religious events bring people together. Where people gather, they talkabout current problems in farming and rural life. By attending such events, the extensionworker will become better acquainted with his people, learn of their wants, needs andproblems and be able to impart information on an informal basis.An FAO rice processing expert was greeted with suspirlion when he visited a processing'plant.Be noticed some workers resacking some rice from .-roken bags. They were havingtrouble tying the bags securely. The expert picked up a pieoe of twine and fastened afull bag using a 'miller's knot'. He then shook the bag to show that it was secure.Immediately, the workers demanded that he show them how to tie the new knot. Be did sowhile the plant manger looked on. Seeing that the expert had a useful Skill, the plantmanager invited the expert to his office where he was able to accomplish his mission. Aneffective extension worker is Skillful in using informal teaching situations to gain theconfidence of his people and to teach usefUl improved practices. -155- Group MethodsGroup methods include general meetings, method demonstrations, result deMonstrations,meetings at result demonstrations, farm walks or tours, field days or farmer days at agri-cultural experiment stations, :abort courses of instruction, farmer training centers,farmers, rural youth and homemakers clubs and group projects.Group methods are especially effective in moving people from the interest stage to the trial stage of learning. When the reaction of the group is favorable, the majority ofmembers may proceed to the adoption stage.Group extension methods, effectively arranged and conducted take full advantage ofthe external and internal forces of group dynamics. People react to the extension workerand to the ideae expressed by other members of the group. Properly stimulated anddirected, these forces oan lead to changes in practice by large numbers of people.Meetinge are one of the oldest and most important methods of extension teaching.Properly arranged and conducted they rank high in ratio of practices adopted in relation to cost as compared with other methods. The success of meetings as a teaching devicedepends largely upon how they are viewed by the audience. Is it their meeting or the extension worker's meeting? Many meetings are planned by the extension worker tc get across a particular idea or practice.Sometimes what seems like a good meeting results in little change in action or attitude by the people who attend. This may be because the extension worker istrying to get people to adopt a practice before they are ready.Perhaps they are hardlyaware that the new practice exists, or have not had enough time to evaluate it in terms of their own situations. Effective meetings are oriented to the current thinking andrecognized needs of the people.Kelsey and Hearne identify five general types of meetings involved in extensionwork. 1.Organization meetings include board of directors meetings, youth clubs, home-makers clubs, executive committees and many others. Organizations usually ezet periodi- oally and follow an agenda. Their purpose is to take action and get business done but they do provide an opportunity to develop leadership and training in social action processes.Much can be done to improve the quality of organization meetings.Many are considered dull and draggy.- 2.Planning meetings requires preparation of a large amount of situation material. Much of this must be done by professional extension workers who should resist a natural tendency to dominate the meeting. Giving leaders a part in preparing situational materialhelps to counteract this tendency. Few rural leaders are interested in attending a planning meeting merely for the sake of planning. Their interest can be aroused in specific problems and objectives. For this and other reasons, extension workers need tomake a special effort to assure attendance of the right people. A formal invitation orrequest to attend a planning meeting is not usually suffioient. Personal contact by an extension worker or another leader with discussion of problems and needs to be considered is much more effective in building interest and in assuring attendance by representative leaders. . 3.Training meetings are an essential element in developing and using rural leaders in extension. They are limited to selected individuals who have accepted responsibilities as leaders and need help in doing the job. The program oontent is usually narrow in scope and specific with' direct application to the job. Extension workers should take care not to try to cram too much information and advice into a single training meeting but allow time for discussion and practice. Each meeting may well be one of a series for the same people conducted over a period of time.1/ Kelsey and Hearne - Cooperative E.-tension Work, pages 406-408. . 156 4.Special interest meetings are arranged to serve the educational needs of groupswith common interests such as gardening, fishing, dairying, home management, or sewing.They may be held singly or in series over a period of time. Since attendance is voluntary,everyone who attends is presumed to be interested in the subject, and the subject matterleader can move along faster than he could in a mixed group. Questions and discussionare more spontaneous and lively.5.Community meetings, as the name suggests, are for all the people in the community,men, women, young people, with all the varied interests of the community. Some people comeout of curiosity or for entertainment; others have more serious interests. Although specialinterest meetings have largely replaced community meetings in this age of specialization,they still have their place. Women and children are interested and involved in many farmactivities.It is equally important that men be interested in the improvement of theirhome life and in the educational activities of their children.The following guidelines will make meetings more useful and effective.Plan the meeting with representatives of the people for whom it is held. If noorganization exists to sponsor the meeting, call together a committee of representatives.Discuss with them the type of program you have in mind and get their reaction. In somecases the committee will give their approval as a courtesy to the extension worker. Perhapsyou can judge their interest by the enthusiasm of their response. If they disapprove yoursuggestion, the whole matter should be dropped.When the typo of meeting has been approved, get agreement on purposes and means ofachieving each purpose. Consider various alternatives and get the committee to decide.Do they want a speaker or a discussion, or a combination of both? Who should be invited?Where should the meeting be held? Who will make the arrangements? As each decision ismade, clarify the responsibility of each member and make a record. If possible, arrangefor one of the committee to preside over the meeting and divide other responsibilitiesamong other members. In this manner all will share in the success of the meeting and feelresponsible for any shortcomings. It is better to have leaders conduct the meeting, eventhough they may not do it smoothly and efficiently, than for the extension worker to takeit over and assume full responsibility. The program may flow more smoothly but it becomesthe extension worker's meeting rather than the peoples:Publicize general meetings well in advance. Publicity should announce the subjectof the meeting, time and place it is to be held, who is invited to attend. Build upinterest by indicating the need for the meeting and the purpose it is intended to accomplish.Further publicity may indicate who is to appear on the program and the qualifications ofspeakers as well as the names of committee members responsible for the program and arrangements.Announcements in newspapers, radio announcements and posters are effective mediawhere available. Welldesigned wall posters are also effective reminders. In somesocieties, the mayor or head man will see that people know about the meeting and areexpected to attend if he is involved in the planning.Consider these factors in planning meetings:1.Size of the audience Large audiences can receive information but participationis reduced and they have difficulty in making decisions.2.Character of the audience Some audiences are incapable of participationthrough lack of experience, education, or for other reasons. 3.Paoilities available If rooms are available, large audiences may be brokendown into small committees or discussion groups for decisions or to increaseparticipation. Otherwise, participation may be limited to those on the platform. 4.Make audience as comfortable as possible. This involves such matters asseating arrangements, heating or cooling of the room, lighting and ventilation. 5.Timedo not fill the program too full. Active people can seldom sit still formore than an hour at a time and few meetings should last longer than one andonehalf hours. Provide for an intermission in longer meetings. 6.Do not allow unrelated announcements and unscheduled speakers to prolong theprogram and distract the audience. 157 Programs may be arranged in different ways to suit the purpose intended and the audience.The size and character of the audience, the facilities and time available determine the type of program.Small audiences allow for maximum audience participation. With large audiences, the program may be limited to speakers or a speaker and panel. A panel of local people can help relate the presentation of the speaker to local conditions and problems. Smaller meetings may be conducted with speakers followed by open discussion, or as general discussion only. Keep introductions of speake.s short. Merely tell his name, his subject and how he is qualified to speak on the subject assigned.Do not give a lengthy account of his education or tell what a fine speaker he is.The audience will decide that for themselves.Sties of methods of presenting subject matter at meetings establish these interesting facts. =i-The lecture-only method was weakest of five methods studied.-The holding of a discussion or conference type meetings increased the number of people influenced to adopt improved practice by 21% over lectures.-Use of local leaders in meetings influenced the adoption of seven more practices per hundred farmers exposed than did the conference or'discuseion method and was 1.28 times as effective as tha straight lecture method.-Use of charts increased the effectiveness of lectures by 44 and film strips by 55%. Demonstrations =y When you teach by demonstration, you show someone how to do a new job; or you show him how to do an old job better.The strength of the demonstration lies in its obviousness - its appeal to logic and reason.It is there before your eyes.It works better than the old method.Its use would bring improvement. Extension uses two types of demonstrations - method and result.Method demonstration is the oldest form of teaching. Men taught their children how to hunt; how to cultivate; how to survive, through forms of the method demonstration long before writing and probably even before language itself developed. 'earning by this process seems almost instinctive. In the jungle the tiger kitten learns to hunt by following and playfully mimicking the stalking tigress.In the method demonstration, we show how to do a job step by step, like building a latrine, treating seed, planting seed in lines or using a mechanical duster to control insects.Your demonstration will be more successful if you will follow these steps:1.Decide exactly what you want to accomplish with the demonstration. Test these objectives against such factors as whether or not the practice really is important; whether or not people can afford to follow it; whether or not supplies and equipment are available in sufficient quantities to permit its widespread use.2.Gather all of the information you can find about the practice. Thoroughly familiarize yourself with the subject matter and, if possible, with the research results. 1.1Kelsey and Hearne - Cooperative Extension Work pp. 412 - 413.2/ Using Visuals in Agricultural Extension Programs - ESC-561 International Cooperation Administration and Federal Extension Service, U.S. Dept. of Agric.pp. 23-25. - 158 - 3.Talk over the problem with a few village leaders. Ask them to help you planthe demonstration. This is an important stepp, because it establishes yourliaison with the village; secures leader approval of the project; provides landand other essentials for the demonstration; is an actual teaching opportunitysince the leaders are certain to learn more about the practice as they discussit and help plan the demonstration. It is also helpful because this methodinvolves more persons in the demonstration which encourages wide-spreaddiscussion of the project. 4.Gather all of the materials you will need. These should include everythingthe farmer will need in order to apply the practice on his farm. 5.Plan your presentation step by step. Include introductory and gummary portions. 6.Whenever possible, rehearse the presentation two or three times - until, you arethoroughly familiar with the steps and know exactly what you want to say or doat each step of the action. 7.When the people are gathered to watch the demonstration explain what you aregoing to do;why it is important for them to learn the new method; ask, forpersons in the audience to help you with different teaks. 8.Go through the demonstration. Explain it step by step. Pause to answer questionsfrom the audience. Repeat difficult steps. 9.Check the effectiveness of your instruction by having members of the audiencedo one or more of the steps. In an ideal situation each person would have anopportunity to practice each of the steps in sequence until the skill is thoroughlylearned. 10.Summarize the importance of the practice, the steps, the supplies and equipmentneeded.Distribute illustrated folders or other literature showing the stepby step procedure. In the method demonstration,, actual materials, equipment and people are the best visualto use.Often the method demonstration paves the way for the result demonstration and in suchcases both should be considered as parts separated, by time only. An example would be amethod demonstration of fertilizer placement to bt followed by a result demonstration asthe crop matures.\"The result demonstration\", in the words of the principal of the Himayatsagar ExtensionTraining C---7WCe;aientrenealad in central India, e18 one which shows after a period oftime what happened after a practice is adopted. As an example, compost is put on acertain field. Good seed potatoes are planted and cared for. In the next field, nocompost is used and poor seed potatoes are used. At harvest time the potatoes are dugin each field at the same time. The villagers, have watched all during the planting,growing and harvesting season. They see how much better results are from using betterpractices.This is a result demonstration.\"Comparison is the essential ingredient in the result demonstration. Whether it isa comparison between compost and no compost; good seed and poor seed; fertilizer and nofertilizer;dusting for insects and no dusting - the results are there for all to seeand judge. - 159 - Advantages of the result demonstration, according to the Himayatsagar principal, are these:- Furnishes local proof of the desirability of adopting a recommended practice.- Is an effective method for introducing a new subject.- Appeals to the eye and reaches the 'show-me' individual.- Provides a good source of information for meetings, news items, pictures, radio talks. - Furnishes cost data and other basic information.- A high percentage of people will understand.-Aids in developing local leadership.- Establishes confidence in the extension worker and in extension wozk.As in the case of the method demonstration, there are certain steps to follow that will make your result demonstration more successful:1. Decide exactly what you want to acco,plish.2. Gather all of the information you can find about the practice.3. Talk over the problem with the village leaders and ask them to help planthe demonstration and recommend demonstrators..4. Develop a complete plan of work, showing each raquired step and indicating who will do what. 5. Select demonstration sites that are centrally located and near a road so people can get there easily.6. Visit the demonstrators and make sure they are thoroughly familiar with the details of the plan, such as new cultural methods, new harvest techniques,record keeping and measurement of results.7. Ask village leaders to encourage villagers to be prebent for the start of the demonstration.8. Visit the demonstration plots often and hold meetings and tours there as the demonstration progresses. Have the farmer tell the story.9. Keep records and compare the results with local practices.10. Refer to the demonstrations in meetings held elsewhere. Write about them for newspapers and magazines. Talk about them on radio.11. Plan follow --up demonstrations if necessary. --160- Tours and field trips 1/aremethods of extension teaching which appeal to man's desireto 'go places and see things'. The 'things' to be seen may range from results on smalldemonstration or test plots to extensive application of new methods on actual farms.In general, the tour or field trip includes more than one stop - the exact numberdepending on what the extension worker hopes to accomplish. The field trip for cultivatorsinterested in line sowing obviously will be different from the field trip of governmentofficials interested in observing rural progress.It might be helpful to think of the tour members as individual cameras, being exposedto several different subjects or to several different angles of the same subject duringthe course of a day. The exposures are made in a planned sequence and when the individualreturns from the tour he has an orderly picture story of the subject permanently recordedin his mind.Like method and result demonstrations which the tour may or may not include, thisextension method offers farmers the opportunity to see for themselves concrete evidenceof the value of ii4roved practices.The following suggestions will help you plan and hold a successful tour or field trip. 1.Decide exactly what you wish to accomplish. This will be determined by the touraudience, their interests, levels of understanding and your evaluation oftheir needs. 2.Work out a detailed plan for the tour well in advance. This should includesequence of subjects to be studied, sites to be visited, a time schedule forthe stops which permits plenty of opportunity for questions and discussion,tour guides and hosts, special audio-visual equipment if needed, transportationif needed and other details. 3.Go through a rehearsal or 'dry run' of the entire program well in advance.This will aid you in determining if you have budgeted enough time at thedifferent stops and especially in seeing if you have too many stops scheduled.It also will give you a chance to scout the route to see if there are obstacleseither to walking or to vehicle traffic. 4.On the day of the tour, keep the party together and keep them moving brisklyfrom point to point. Nothing kills interest faster than stragglers. Makethe party as comfortable as possible, taking advantage of shade for tour stopsand providing plenty of drinking water. If the tour is longer than just a fewhours, your plan should include providing the party with a generous serving ofappetizing food. In general, smaller groups are preferred to larger groups. This is because smallergroups permit more thorough discussion and are not as difficult to control and move about.The maximum number of persons any one tour leader should attempt to manage is 100.Small portable loudspeakers can be a tremendous aid in keeping the attention of thegroup, increasing the amount of information imparted to them and in controlling them.Explanations usually are more effective when made by the demonstrator-farmer or by farmersusing the practices being studied. The extension worker should be prepared however toprovide technical, background, or interpretive information that may be necessary. JUsing Visuals in Agricultural Extension Program - ESC-561 International CooperationAdministration and Federal Extension Service, U.S. Dept. of Agric. pp. 25 -26. - 161 - Demonstrations and tours may seem time consueing and in some instances costly, but they present the case in such a clear and obvious way that the audience can hardly miss the message.Considering their heavy educatienal impact on each individual, they may actually be among the most efficient and economical methods of teaching you can use.Group discussion J Discussion is the process by which two or more persons pool thel- knowledge and feelings, and through mutual agreement clarify the issues under consideration. The leader of the discussion group serves as a master of ceremonies rather than as a resource person.Re should see that everyone has a chance to be heard, keep the topics moving in an orderly way, and discourage persons who seem determined to dominate, including himself.There are several distinct types of group discussion meetings. The newest idea is called a 'brain trust' in which questions are posed and the participating 'brains' express their opinions and views. Actually this is quite similar to panel and symposium discussions. T:e panel is usually a rather informal discussion by several 'experts' to consider a major tlpic, while a symposium is characterized by having several speakers, each of whom gives a rather detailed and usually prepared presentation of his views. Sometimes the symposium speakers are given a chance to answer one or more of the others in a form of rebuttal.&tension Schools - Schools are designed to give the participants knowledge and skill in some specific line of subject matter such as irrigation methods, dress making or gardening.Schools involve intensive training over a specific period of time, each as one to four days. They may require pre-enrollment and an obligation to attend all sessions.Schools offer an opportunity for presentation of much information in a short time to a select group of people with special interest in the subject. They must be well organized with specific teaching objectives and employ teaching methods which will hold the interest of participants. Demonstrations, discussions and the use of visuals add much to their effectiveness. Periodic and terminal evaluations help to keep the program realistic and provide guidance in conducting future schools. Farmer Training Center - Farmer training centers have been used effectively in a number of developing countries to train farmers and their wives in concepts and practices of eloderu agriculture and home making.Centers in Kenya and Uganda consisted of dormitories for from 20 to 100 people, dining and laundry facilities and a farm varying from 50 to 400 acres, complete with equipment and livestock.Courses were attended by both men and women and lasted from two days to four weeks depending upon the subject involved.The primary object of a center is to show those who attend how farming can be carried out at a profit, to instill in farmers a desire to convert their own farms into profitable enterprises, and to teach them some of the skills involved. In addition a large number of intensive short courses are held to give selected groups of farmers and farm women training in such areas as coffee production, tea production, clean milk production and the use of home produced foods in the diet. Men and women are trained separately, although often in the same subjects, because of problems arising from the presence of younger children and for other reasons.Both theoretical and practical training are included in the program. Leadership training appears to be the most effective role of farmer training centers. To fulfill this role, training center programs must be integrated with estension programs to the extent that: 1/ S.K. Taiwo Williams and John K.

We speak so frequently that we getcareless in what we say an4 how we say it. The following suggestions will help youbecome a better speaker; 1/ 1.Rave something to say of interest to the audience, direct your talk to thoseinterests, not your own, find out in advance what kind of audience you areto speak to and what they want to know. 2.Rave a series of specific points to follow. Tell the audience in advance whatyou are going to do. This lets them know where you are in your talk, and whenthe end is to come. 3.Think through in advance what you want the group to go away with from yourmeeting.Be sure that what you have to tell them will benefit them. 4.Don't apologize for your shortcomings and limitations. They will find themout soon enough. Don't belittle the introduction you were given by thechairman or local leader who introduced you. He probably got the factsabout your background from you. 5.Talk 'to' the audiencs, not 'at' them. Look them 3.11 the e.:6, not out thewindow or at the ceiling. 6.Be confident that you can do a good job. This necessitates proper and carefulpreparation.Don't worry about being nervous as it is usual with speakersand is a necessary part of the process of looking and speaking our best. 7.Speak naturally in a loud clear voice, but don't shout. Don't use a lot ofunnatural gestures, they will probably look foolish and pointless to theaudience.Just be yourself. 8.Observe the faces of people in your audience to indicate interest, approval,disapproval, lack of interest, and drowsiness. People's facial expressionsare the best guide for the speaker to guage success, semi-success, orfailure in his talks. 9.Illustrate your talk with as many personal examples as possible, but don'tbe a gossip, and don't overdo yourself as an example. 10.Never memorize a speech. It is only a little better to read it, as it ismore boring.It is preferable to use small cards in the hand axtd referto them to refresh your memory. If it is possible, it will add a great dealto your talk if you use slides or flip-charts. These show you as well as S.K. Taiwo Williams and John N. Penley - Communication in extension ae Developedfor Western Nigeria Kinistry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Governmentof Western Nigeria pp. 29 - 31. -163- your audience what you are talking about. They will serve. as your outline.Never use a single sheet of thin paper for your notes.It will crinkle and rustle and add to your nervousness. 11.Rehearse or go over the talk to yourself. 12.Try to relax the group at first. Some extension workers can do this withstories or interesting anecdotes. Be careful with these as it is the rare person who can deliver a story successfully. Nothing is less humourous than asupposedly funny story poorly told; it will generally fall flat. Personally, I accentuate what we're going to cover in the time allotted to my talk as a way of relaxing the group, and make sure that everyone can sea and hear.If some persons are standing in the rear and there are seats in front, askthem to occupy them. After this relaxing act, the whole audience rill generally settle down ready for the talk.13.Don't talk down to an audience. People are smarter than we give them credit for.At least they're emart-enough to want to hear us speak.14.Dress appropriately for the occasion. Don't be a dandy out in the field, anddon't come dressed for the field at a meeting with the tribal or village council.15.Never play down a member of the audience, you do yourself more damage than theone you're trying to hurt. This is especially important to remember when questions Are being asked. Try to be courteous when someone asks a question you have just finished answering. Try not to get angry or provoked, or if you do, try not to show it.16.If you prefer to have questions at the end rather than during your talk, letthe audience know about it. They will not interrupt you and can be thinkingof questions they will want to ask at the end.It can be embarrassingto a speaker to ask for questions and not get any.Repeating your invitation only makes you look weaker. I prefer to ask, \"Now, who has the firstquestion?\"Usually several hands will go up, and with them the interest ofthe audience. In big gatherings or where time may not permit questions,you may suggest that people come afterward and you'd be happy to speak with them.17.In asking the audience a question, ask it first to the whole group. Thiscauses everyone to listen and start thinking about it. If you ask a questionto one person, everyone Will be more interested to see how he gets off the hookthan what the question is about. 18.Stop the questions before they ran down or get to wandering. Xy favorite way is to say, \"There is time for just one more question,\" which allows me to close the discussion. 19.Try to be as brief as possible without actually leaving out valuable points.Better to stop while the audience's interest is high than to keep on untilthey're restless and bored.20.Be careful with the summary at the end of your talk.Try to hit only the majortopics discussed, not a complete review. If you bore the audience with a longdetailed Rummer'', taking 7 to 8 minutes to outline what you said in the previoushoary your audience will wonder why you took the hour. - 164 - 21.Hand out any printed or cyclostyledNothing is more distracting than tothe papers you just gave them whiledo neea to give out materials, stopcopy to everyone, then have them gowhich you passed it out. Then askyour talk.materials at the end of your talk.have your audience rustling and readingyou're trying to talk to them. If youyour talk and concentrate on getting athrough it or to a specific point forthem to put the paper away and resume 22.Avoid distracting mannerisms. Don't fidget. Don't fumble with keys, orcoins, or keep tossing a piece of chalk up and down in your hand. Thesethings annoy people and detract from what you are telling them. 23.Be enthusiastic. Your enthusiasm will generate enthusiasm in the audience. 24.Take every opportunity to speak. Practice makes perfection. Mass Methods1/ Personal and group methods can not reach everyone who wants and needs information.So mass methods - radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, exhibits and printed materials -are used to reach large numbers of people quickly.These methods are particularly useful in making large number of people aware of newideas and practices or alerting them to sudden emergencies. While the amount of detailedinformation is limited that can be transmitted through mass media, they will serve animportant and valuable function in stimulating farmers' interest in new ideas. Once madeaware or stimulated through mass media, farmers will seek additional information fromneighbors, friends, extension workers and progressive farmers in the area. Posters - A poster is a sheet of paper or cardboard with an illustration and usuallya fe4-inrig; words. It is designed to catch the attention of the passerby, impress onhim a fact or an idea and stimulate him to support an idea, get more information or takesome kind of action.People do not walk around studying pot; ars. They look at posters the same way asthey look at other objects - trees, birds, 'ilousetil cows, other persons. Usually a briefglance is as much as the average person gives an ordinary object - long enough only toidentify itsIf something about the object catches his attention or stimulates hisinterest, the passerby will look at it longer. The deeign and use of posters as visualsin extension teaching are based on this principle.Since a single glance may be all your poster will get, the message must be simple andclear.Details and wordy sentences have no place. Here are a few suggestions that willhelp you design more effective posters. 1.Decide exactly who your eadience is. Decide exactly what you want to tellthem.Decide what you want them to do. 2.Put down on a cheat of paper words and rough pictures that express your messagesimply and clearly. 3.Try to put your message into a few words - a concise, striking slogan.Visualize or put into picture form the most important central idea in the message. 1/ Using Visuals in Agricultural Extension Programs - EC -561 International CooperationAdministration and Federal Extension Service, U.S. Dept. of Agric. pp. 20, 44 - 46. - 165 - Remember that words and picture must be seen in a glance and must stimulate response by the viewer. 4.Rough out your poster in smell scale - 1/8 or 1/4 actual size. If you have available the services of an artist, he can produce an excellent finished poster from your original rough sketch.Other suggestions for attractive effective posters are these. Use plain, bold lettering and lines. Use color to attract attention and for contrast. Remember however that too many colors add confusion. Allow plenty of space. Do not crowd letters, words or illustrations. Pouters should supplement - not replace - other communication methods. They are often used to !spearhead' or introduce a campaign.Or they may be used to reinforce an educational effort after it has been launched. In general, the greater the number of posters used in an area, the greater the impact - up to a certain point. Discretion and good taste will suggest the number to use.Most people find it annoying to be bombarded at every turn by the same poster message.Over-use of pesters defeats their purpose and may actually turn people against the idea you want them to accept.Posters mey be produced in quantity by letterpress, by offset printing or by silk screen.Where only a small number are required, they may be produced by the individual himself, by an artist or by other persons each as school children.Posters are put up on walls of buildings, fences, trees, poled, bulletin boards, store windows, trucks and automobiles and other places where they are likely to be seen by people passing by. Lithilits_anZ,IlLuLysli- Exhibits and displays have some of the same characteristics as posters, covered in the preceding section. The main differences are that exhibits and displays usually are larger and more detailed.As with the poster, the job of the exhibit or display is to catch the attention of the passerby, impress on him a fact or an idea, stimulate his interest in the subjectmatter presented and possibly urge him to take some sort of action. Differing from a poster however, the exhibit is larger, may have three dimensions and most important - imparts more detaile information than is possible with a poster.Because of their larger size and becanse they usually are placed in the market place or other areas where people move slowly, exhibits and displays attract and hold attention for longer periods than posters. Even so, the periods are not long. The viewing time will depend on whether the exhibit is in an open area or in a separate enclosed room.Viewing time may be as short as one minute or as long as ten minutes. On the average, one should aim at telling the complete story in about three minutes. This means that whatever you can do to increase the attention-getting power of your exhibit, increase its attractiveness and personal appeal and keep its content simple and clear, the greater are the chances that the viewer will receive and understand your message.Again, es is true of all other visuals, planning is the first step in preparing exhibits and displays. Decide who the audience is, what the message is, what you want the audience to do. Answering these questions will help you plan the scope of the exhibit, the appeal to use and the content. 1/ Using Visuals in Agricultural Extension Programs . ESC- 561 International CooperationAdministration and Federal &tension Service, U.S. Dept. of Agric. pp. 46 - 48. -166- The most effective exhibits are built around a single idea with a minimum of supportinginformation.In a few simple words and pictures, tell farmers that a new seed variety isbetter and why that's all.Make a miniature of your exhibit from paper or cardboard.This will help you see how it will look in full scale. Experiment with colors and design.Get an artist to help you plan the arrangement if one is available.To attract attention and get people to stop and look at your exhibit, include somethingthat will catch the eye. This might be a live object such as a sheep in an exhibit aboutsheep.Or it might be color, movement, light or any number of things you can think of byusing your imagination.One could try to define the 'something' that causes persons to stop and look for moredetailed information. This 'something' must produce a 'mental shock'. Once the personstops moving in front of an exhibit he (or she) is susceptible to the rest of the messageor'messages in the exhibit. Incidentally a walking person passes by an exhibit in aboutthe same number of seconds as there are lineal feet in front of the booth.In otherwords if the booth is ten feet (3 meters) wide in front, a person has about ten secondsto comprehend the message intended. Thus it is obvious that one's attention must beattracted in a very short time.In your exhibit, make the central idea stand out. The lesson taught must be clearat once.A combination of real objects, models or illustrative material plus a boldsign usually will get the point across. Include appeal t1'- *till identify the subject matter with the viewer's own interests,experiences, needs. Mdto$ your exhibit say: \"Here is something for YOU; here is ananswer to YOUR problem; here is how YOU can make more money with YOUR dairy herd.\"Once you have attraoted the viewer's attention, interested him in the central ideaand convinced him that the idea is important to him, you still have the job of presentingthe supporting information usually the 'why' or the 'how',Use 'before' and 'after' photographs with captions; use actual objects; contrastsold vs. new, etc. use models, drawings, actual demonstrations; use projected visuals,specimens.Use whatever you can find or devise to tell the story concisely, clearly andconvincingly.Here are some general suggestions that will help you prepare more effective exhibitsand displays: 1.Clutter is the worst enemy of an exhibit. The fewcr elements in your exhibitor display, the better. 2.Keep written material to a minimum. Use only enough captions and signs to tellthe story.Vary the size, style and color of signs and lettering to createinterest and direct attention to the center of interest. 3.Use a color scheme of not more than two or three colors with neutral shadesfor backgrounds and spots of intense color for emphasis. 4.Place the center of interest near eye level. This is approximately five feet.Things above seven feet or below three feet won't be seen as well as they wouldbe closer to eye level.By securing the cooperation of villagers in producing a few basic items of visualequipment to be kept permanently in the village, extension workers can constantly usegood visual teaching methods, yet save themselves the difficult work of carrying heavyequipment about. -167- Newspapers provide a valuable channel for transmission of educational informationwhere they exist and where rural people receive and re'' even among illiteratepeople there aro usually a few who can read and ps,- ag bits of information to their friends. Newspapers print news and news consists of W.ad interest to their readers.Newspaper space is valuable and limited. Your news item must compete for attention withother items as well as advertizing and the editor is the sole judge of its news value.All material for the press should be factual, well written and intelligently planned. Otherwise it will probably be discarded by the editor. A good rule is to find out whatthe editor wants and give it to him the way he wants it. The ingredients of a news story are who?what? where? when? and sometimes why? These ingredients should becovered in the first sentence or two and elaborated in later paragraphs.Then, if theeditor feels he must out off the item for lack of apace the main facts are there.Most editors prefer items of one double -apace typewritten page or less.Editors like stories of individual accomplishment. Use names of local people butbe careful not to reveal personal information that would embarrass them.As a rule,editors like news items that tell what people do. But some local papers have specialcolumns for timely information and material such as how to spray fruit trees; recommended varieties of garden vegetables etc. Write simply, using short sentences and paragraphs that are easy to read. Rememberthat you must catch the reader's attention in the first sentence or he is unlikely to read further.The succeeding facts should be put down in the order of their importance. The ABC's of good writing are accuracy, brevity and clarity. In general, try to personalize the news and appeal to the desires of people to improveincomes, homes and the community. If you tell the facts to a reporter and he writes the story, give him the general facts and let him ask quesime for the amount of detail he wants.Don't bore with minor details unless he asks for them. If the story he writes is inaccurate, perhaps you failed to give him the correct information. Don't complain to his superior if you want futurepublicity but discuss it with the reporter at the first opportunity.Wall Newspapers are similar in size and appearance to posters. They are differentin that wail newspapers usually attempt to communicate more than one fact or, idea. They also have more illustrations and written material. Wall newspapers have been used for a considerable time in rural areas to communicate news of political and social interest. Because they are basically pictorial, drawingsand/or photographs are their trademark. The text is as brief and vivid as possible.Agricultural extension services in many countries have adapted the wall newspaperto educational programs and it has become one of the most effective extension teachingtools.It is used not only to communicate news of extension activities but also to reportresults of research and to recommend new practices. A typical extension wall newspapermight therefore contain pictures and text; - Announcing the appointment of a new livestock specialist.- Giving a progress report on a current fertilizer oampaign. 2.1Using Visuals in Agricultural Extension Programs - ES0-561InternationalCooperation Administration and Federal Extension Service, U.S. Dept. of Agri\u00b0.P. 49. - 168 - - Urging the use of vaccine to prevent fowl cholera in poultry flocks. - Reporting the results of experiments with new grain varieties. In most countries where wall newspapers are used in extension programs, they areproduced in quantity by a central office and distributed by mail or through the extensionorganization. Some wall newspapers are printed by letter-press. Offset duplicatorsoffer greater flexibility in permitting the paper to be.printed in local languages ordialects.Drawings and color are easily included with offset duplication. Distribution varies according to the requirements of each country. Mailings may bemade directly to village headmen, school teachers, mayors or other leaders. Localextension workers may deliver or even post papers in villages he visits.Walls of buildings at busy intersections are excellent places to post the papers.They may also be posted on village bulletin boards, in reading centers, at schools, insidepublic buildings and many other places. Folders, Leaflets and Pamphlets 2 - Simple folders, leaflets and pamphlets can beused in many ways in extension programs. They may be used singly for example, to explainthe advantages of testing soil. They may be used in series of broader subjects likeswine raising, with separate leaflets on feeding, housing and breeding. They may be usedas reminders of when to plant crops or what chemicals to use to control different insects. Folders, leaflets and pamphlets may be used in coordination with other visuals inlong-range campaigns. Because of their low cost, they can be given away at meetings andfairs and offered on radio programs. They are useful to supplement larger publicationswhen new information is available and when reprinting the whole publication is not practical. Besides the advantages of low cost and short preparation time, folders, leaflets andpamphlets take less time to get their message across. Their smaller size makes itnecessary for the author to eliminate non-essentials from his message.When preparing these materials, keep your audience constantly in mind. Write withwords people understand. Write about things that interest people. Change your methodof presentation as you write to young people, farmers, women. Eliminate difficultscientific and technical terms.The importanoe of illustrations cannot be over-emphasized. Even where literacy isnot a problem, people interpret words differently because of differences in past experience. Almost every extension service over - estimates the ability of its audience to reada printed message and understand it clearly.Almost every extension service over-estimatesthe extent to which people will be attracted to and read a printed message.Illustrations reduce the risk of misunderstandings; help make your message clear andmore attractive; increase learning.Good layout arranges material in a logical, easy-to-follow manner and makes itattractive to the reader. 1/ Using Visuals in Agricultural tension Programs - ESC -561 International CooperationAdministration and Federal Extension Service, U.S. Dept. of Agric. pp. 55 56. - 169 - Realistic illustrations usually are the most effective in extension work, although humorous drawings have a definite place. Use 'humor carefully so as not to offend anyone.Good pictures make any publication easier to understand and more interesting to read.Crop unnecessary details out of photos. Keep drawing simple.Folders generally have more appeal when a color of ink is used other than black. Choose colors that are legible as well as appropriate dark green ink for pastures, dark brown for soils. Two or more colors can be used if the extra cost is justified. Colored papers can also be used for in Sting effects and are available at small extra cost. Attractive, effective publicat .be prepared on spirit duplicators, mimeographmachines, offset duplicators or letterpress. It is not difficult to train an artist to produce illustrations, headings or even copy in local dialect for each of these methods of printing. Recognize that the cover of illustrated literature has a function differing from the pages within. The cover shouldbeattractive, colorful and impelling. The audience should feel an urge to look inside. A bulletin that never reaches the hands can't possibly reach the brain where judgments and decisions are made. FactSheets2-1are 'boiled down' treatments of subject matter. They usually cover a sinig175Trand often they are limited to a single page.Most fact sheets are illustrated with drawings or photographs or both. The illustrations are used to show details, steps in a process or to otherwise make theinformation clearer and more understandable. One of the important uses for fact sheets is to provide current subject matter to field workers.Field workers frequently complain that needed technical information is slow.in reaching them. Much agricultural information is put up in technical bulletins and other lengthy publioations. These take considerable time to process and distribute. On the other hand, the essential facts can be put down and combined with drawingsand/or photographs to make an effective capsule summary which can be reproduced quickly and inexpensivelyinfact sheet form. This puts current information into the hands of local extension workers enabling them to give better service to farm families.Extension administrators who are concerned with the problem of speeding up intrarstaff communication of subject matter should study the advantages offered by fact sheets. Projected Visuals =/ motion pictures, slides, film stripsandother formshave much appeal and are among the most effective of the visual teaching aids. It is well to remember that they have important limitations as well as advantages.The main advantages of each type of projected visual are discussed in the sections that follow.In general, the disadvantages or limitations are similar special equipment is required both to produce and show the visuals.This equipment tends to be relatively expensive.Some sort of power is required to operate the projectors. Transportation, maintenance and storage of equipment and materials require special consideration. 1/ Using Visuals in AgricUltural Extension Programs ESC-561International Cooperation Administration and Federal Extension Service, U.S. Dept. of Agric. p. 56 and pp. 62 - 65. -170 If these limitations do not present a problem in your situation, you will do wellto make as much use as possible of projected visuals in your extension program.Motion pictures am really not 'motion' pictures at all. They are a series of stillpictures on a long strip of film:, Each picture is flashed momentarily on the screenand the rapid succession of stiles pictures each of which shows the subject in a slightlydifferent position gives an illusion of movement. The main thing to realize is thatmotion pictures can be tremendously effective in helping you do a job of teaching.Films have the potential to create powerful emotions and urges. This means thatselected and used properly, they can i'Ansify the interest of your audience in thesubject you are teaching. :ellent also for showing the steps necessary indoing a task or for show._ action. They can reproduce events long since past. They can record a demonstration thatcan be given over and over again to many different people in many different places.They can slow or accelerate motion for better analysis of action and growth. They canmagnify action on a screen that normally would be too small to be seen easily or clearlyby an individual or group. They can condense or stretch time.Many other strong points for using motion pictures could be mentioned but the reasonsalready given are among the most important and help explain why films are a potent teachingtool.For motivating an audience, for appealing to the emotions, for a clear conciseportrayal of action, few media approach the motion picture. It portrays reality. The size of film most commonly used for educational motion pictures is 16 mm. All16 mm. films are not alike however. Those made for viewing silently or with comments bya leader are made with sprocket holes on both sides of the film.Films made by professional laboratories-to which sound is added have sprocket holesonly on one side of the film. You should not attempt to project sound film on a silentprojector therefore because the teeth of the drive mechanism will punch holes in thesound track. Another difference is that silent films are made to operate at 16 frames per secondor somewhat slower than sound film which runs at 24 frames per second. If a silent filmis run at the speed for sound, a decided increase in the speed of action will take place.In selecting a film to use in a given teaching Situation, you must exercise the samejudgment you would in selecting other teaching aids and materials. In addition to yourobjective, you must consider the previous experience of the audience along with suchconsiderations as age, education, interests and customs. A film should be used only as a teaching aid. Leaders frequently make the mistakeof showing a film without preparing the audience or following up. Because movies sometimes cover too much ground or include too much detail, considering the experience of theaudience, viewers often fail to understand ideas presented. To do the best kind of a job, the leader first must be thoroughly familiar with thesubject he plans to teach. He must know exactly how the film supports the ideas he wantsto get across. Before he shows the film, he should explain the lesson, tell why it isimportant and stimulate viewers to look for certain things in the film. When thisprocedure is followed, the end of the film is the signal for the beginning of a livelydiscussion and question period.A successful film showing depends on looking after a number of details. You willneed an adequate power supply that matches the requirements of the projector. This meanschecking on details such as extension cords and electrical connections. Some means shouldbe available to darken the room without cutting off ventilation. Spare projection lampsshould be on hand. -171 Before the audience arrives, the machine should be set up, threaded with film, focused on the screen and tested. The projector should be high enough to project over the heads of. the audience and the screen high enough from the floor for all to easily see the bottom of the picture. A good .qe is 4 feet (1.2 m.) from the floor to the bottom of the screen. Lantern Slides The lantern slide is one of the most popular and versatile visuals in extension educaiion. Reasons for the popularity of lantern slides are:They can be made by the individual worker at low cost.They can be made either in natural color or in black and white.Both Vie slides and the projection equipment are relatively light and can be easily transported. Slide sequences can be readily changed to keep them timely and localized.Slide sequences can be changed in length to fit local needs.Slides have these limitations: They do not show action. They normally require 'live' narration unless synchronized with a tape recorder.They require close cooperation with a projectionist throughout the presentationif the speaker desires to be in front of his audience. The most popular type of lantern slide in use today is made on 35 mm film. When color film is used, a direct color positive transparency is the result.Some types of this film can be homeprocessed. Others require commercial processing. When commercially processed, the film is cut into individual pictures and placed in cardboard or glass mounts ready for projecting. These are called 2\" x 2\" slides since the mounts are 2 inches square. Radio is one of the fastest, most powerful and in many countries the only way ofcommunicating with the masses of rural people. It reaches people of all cultural levelswho understand the language of transmission. Research has shown that people believe what they hear. Mass media, including radio, rank at the top in the awareness and interest stages of learning.Radio is most effective when people are just becoming aware of the idea.Although useful, it is not as effective at the evaluation, trial and adoption stages.Having people's friends and neighbors appear on tha radio increases radio's influence inthese latter stages of learning. If there is a choice, the early adopters or informalleaders should be interviewed rather than innovators.Good interviews must be planned. Talk over the interview with the person before you go on the air. Start the program by introducing your guest, 'tell where he is from and his purpose for being on the program. Tell him to talk in terms of his personal experienceusing the personal pronouns like \"I\", \"My\" and \"We\".An advantage of radio programs is that they can be done almost anywhere through the use of a tape recorder. Doing them in the home or on the farm gives them greater authenticity. -172 Radio is useful in reporting spot news, such as announcement of meetings; for warningsabout insect outbreaks, and especially as a part of campaigns. Extension workers maysupply stations with spot announcements to be taped and repeated at intervals during theday.Longer programs should be either presented in person or taped for use on scheduledprograms.Listening habits may vary according to the society involved. Studies of listeninghabits will tell the extension worker when his listeners are likely to be men and whenwomen and at what hours they listen most. Take these faclors into account when planningyour program.Scripts prepared in the central extension office can contain valuable technicalmaterial and are time savers for the local extension worker but he needs to localize andpersonalize them. Relating them to the experience of local people helps. Advertize your programs in advance by telling the subject of the next program andwhom you will interview.Not all extension information is good radio material. It should generally haveappeal to a wide range of the listening audience. Details on how to do a practice arenot suited to radio communication. But most important, the broadcast should contributeto the planned extension program. Start the program with a statement that arouses the listeners attention. The firstten seconds are the most important. Then follow through with a well organized, smoothflowing presentation, repeating the key points again at the end. Few people remember asingle statement of a fact. Television adds a second dimension to radio broadcasting thus increasing the scope ofmethods available to the extension worker. He can demonstrate as well as talk. TheHome Economist can demonstrate 'how to make a dress'. The agricultural extension agentcan present useful method demonstrations as well as show a whole serizs of result demonstrations through pictures thus emphasizing difference over time. All types of visual aidssuch as charts, graphs, live objects, chalk boards can be used to increase teachingeffectiveness. Television programs require meticulous preparation. Every piece of equipment mustbe in place and the dialogue must be well thought out.Organization is an essential ingredient of a television program. It is a sequenceof related words and pictures that make up the story and is called a 'run down sheet' oftwo columns, one headed 'video' for pictures, the other 'audio' an outline of what isto be said.The run down sheet is not a script but an outline to guide the televisioncrew as well as the performers. Start with easy to present programs with the action in one place. Then test outyour ability to perform more involved sequences as you gain experience. The basic rules are simple. Move deliberately to allow the camera to follow.Operate within a small area. Hold material steadily on target for camera viewing. Avoidthe use of complicated demonstration material. Time your presentation before going tothe studio to make sure the program fits into the allotted time. Have some extra pointsready to present in case the material runs short. Color combinations and light contrasts are important. Your television engineer cantell you what combinations are best. Follow his advice. 173 In spite of the relatively high cost of receiving sets, tea vision occupies an increasingly important role in developing countries.Many governments have installed sets in each village so villagers can receive official broadcasts. Extension administrators have only to convince authorities of the value of educational broadcasts to open up this useful channel of communication and education to the masses of people. Educational Campaigns in Extension WorkEvery family in one Iranian village grew at least a few pistachio trees. Each year, soon after the nuts formed on the trees, insects attacked and most or the nuts dried up. The yield was low, yet this was an important source of income to the villagers. The poup4, watched this happen each year with concern and disappointment. The difference between a good crop and a poor one meant having enough to eat all year or empty stomachs part of the time. The agricultural advisors knew that one spraying each year would control the insects, so they used an educational campaign to bring this about. They knew that success for one year might leave some farmers saying that it just happened to be a good year.They decided the campaign must last through two growing seasons.Extension advisors and specialists planned the campaign carefully. They kept Ministry of Agriculture officials informed on all developments. They discussed plans with the chief of the village, the religious leader, and other leaders. When it was time to start the campaign everyone was ready. The Governor came and talked to the people about spraying the trees.Extension advisors held many meetings to explain the value of spraying, to show the insects, and explain the procedure for controlling them. They visited farmers individually to be sure they understood. They put posters everywhere as constant reminders.The Ministry of Agriculture made the spray available at low cost. Men were trained to handle the simple spray equipment.Each farmer was to leave one or two trees unsprayed so he could compare results. When the time was right the trees were sprayed. The nuts did not dry up as in other years and at harvest time the people picked a good crop.The extension advisors held followup meetings after the spraying and after harvest because people still had questions. They also had to make plans for the next year. During the second year, there was no letup in meetings, farm visits, posters and exhibits. Agents still concentrated on the one practice spraying.But after two seasons of bumper crops, the people were convinced of the value of spraying their pistachio trees.This is an example of the way a good educational campaign is run.Let's examine some of the elements that made this and other campaigns work well. What is en Educational Cam ai?An educational campaign is a wellorganized plan for bringing about widespread adoption of a particular practice. It is a continued teaching effort concentrated into a set period of time. The central idea a better practice is kept before the people constantly during that time. People are shown repeatedly that this is a solution to a problem. 1/ Helen A.Strow . Educational Campaigns in Extension WorkOIE 24 Federal Extension Service, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture in cooperation with the Agency for International Development, Washington, D.C. pp. 610. -3.74 The more often people are exposed to a new idea, the more likely they are to adopt it.Campaigns use this principle. In a campaign, people have their attention focused on anew practice through may methods. They become interested because they see remindersoften;This dramatizes the problem. When the campaign works well and people accept the practice, you, the extension worker,can leave that practice to them and concentrate your efforts on teachinfr, othAr practices. How should you use a Campaign? Not all problems are adapted to the use of a campaign. To decide which problem toselect for the campaign treatment, consider these points: To be successful, a campaign mustBe directed toward the solution of a problem the people recognize. Deal with a problem important to a large mumber of people.Offer a solution that the people can and sill accept. Emphasize one idea ut a time. A campaign must be directed toward the solution of aLproblem the people recognize People must first feel the need for a Change. A campaign directs their attentiontoward solutions to problems they already recognise. The government of Jamaica, for instance, conducted a 'better rice' campaign whenfarmers became aware that they could not grmw enough rice to feed their families and havesome to sell. The campaigns introduced a AVOWvariety of rice that solved the problem.The farmers could accept this solution.A campaign to build smokeless stoves started in one village because women complainedthat their eyes hurt from the smoke of the mid threestone cooking arrangement. A childwho fell into one of these open stoves and use badly burned dramatized the need for asafer cooking arrangement. The women recognized a problem to be solved. The problem to be solved by tour camRsile must be one that is important to alarge number of people. To justify the time aad,effort you put into a campaign, onlyimportant prdSlems should be considered. Because a campaign is an intenae effort, fora limited time, and uses a variety of methods, it =aches many people. It would notbe the beat use of your time to concentrate such effort on a small audience.In an antimalaria program, for instance, where all the houses in an area must besprayed with DDT, all the people must be reached. In the pistachio campaign most ofthe village families owned trees, so that most had to be reached. The ractioe to be recommended in the cam must be one that the -0,le can andwill acoept. 'ough the peop e may risco:. ze a problem t., is important to many othem, they may not be able to carry out the practice you know would be the most effective.The recommended practice Should fit into the facilities the people have, be in keepingwith their ability, and be in harmony with their culture. For example do not recommendspreading of fertilizer by machinery when machinery is not available in the area. -175 - A successful campaign can emphasize only one idea at a time. Most people learn only one thing at a time. A well-planned campaign does not present too much for them to learn. Thus, it does not demand too much change in their habits all at once. In the pistachio campaign, for instance, only one practice was recori-dad .... to spray the trees at the proper time.It could have confused the people if ,ther practices, such as fertilizing, had been recommended at the same time.With only one idea at a time, the learner will have time to try the new practices and experience success. One campaign at a time is enough for the extension worker too.It takes a great deal af your time and effort to plan and carry out a campaign. A good 04e may take your zontinual supervision for several months. Planning In any campaign, you first plan, then carry out the campaign, then evaluate the results. Planning a good campaigm takes time, but saves time later on. Careful planning helps inamre success. Local leaders should be involved in the planning. You should:1.Analyze the situation 2.Select the practice to promote 3.Set objectives 4.Plan for evaluation 5.Decide how to involve people 6.Schedule events 7.Arrange for equipment and supplies Ansaize the situation before you start a campaign, know the facts about the practice to be 36:aged. Know exactly to whom you will direct the campaign. To get these facts, make a survey. This may mean visiting farms or homes, observing, and discussing with the people. Get names ofo le who need the new ractice. Opinions can be incorrect. For instance, a county extens on agent estimate tt 90 of the dairy bulls in his county were purebred. He did not think a campaign was necessary. Be made a farm survey, however, that showed only 20% were purebred. In another case the main emphasis in a nutrition program was to be placed on fruits and, vegetables. A survey showed these were not lacking in the diet of the average adult but that there was great need for milk. Seleot the_practice to promote - After a careful study, you may find many things need to bie-done.However, you must select one practice to be given priority in the campaign.A campaign teaches practices rather than principles. These practices represent the Jammers to needs felt by a large number of people. As an agriculturel advisor visits farmers he may see their need to improve care of poultry or use a better variety of rice seed. The home economics advisor may want to help nominee build smokeless stoves, improve floors, or plant gardens. Your survey will show what people are interested in. This will point to the practice to select for your edmmastdcoal campaign. - 176 - Set Objectives - Once you decide that a practice warrants a campaign, establish clear-cut objectives. Decide exactly what change you expect to be made and who is to make thechange.For example, in the pistachio campaign the objectives were for all pistachiogrowers in the area to: 1.Learn why spraying is necessary for production of pistachio nuts 2.Learn how to spray pistachio trees 3.Spray trees Plan for Evaluation - As you plan the campaign, also plan how you will evaluate itin terms of the objectives you set. Plan regular times and specific methods for checkingon progress.EValuation should be a continuous process. The main job of evaluation,however, comes after the campaign has ended. EVen then the results may not show. Itoften takes time to change practices. Evaluation helps you judge how well a campaignworked but it also can yield information that will help in conducting future campaigns. Decide how to involve people In planning, list all the different kinds of peoplewho should be-informed and involved in your campaign, and plan what their part will be.The people concerned must be involved all the way - in the planning, in the activities ofthe campaign, in evaluating results, and in publicizing success.Ministry officials need to be involved so that they understand fully, so they lendsupport, and provide financial assistance if needed.Leaders in the community, such as religious leaders and tkibal chiefs, must beincluded.In the pistachio campaign, all the people who might lend support, or hinder progress,or have personal concern in the campaign were involved from the first. Schedule EVents - Write down a plan of events b6fore you start the campaign. Sucha plan should: 1.Be detailed and specific. 2.Give you a calendar and work chart which helps you systematize work. 3.Assure continuity of teaching effort. 4.Bring in appropriate leaders and technicians at the right time. In a town in Venezuelay the people decided to carry on a 'clean-up' campaign. Thiswas their first community project. They selected leaders and organized committees tocarry out the campaign. The leaders divided the town into sections and each leadercalled on every family in his block to explain what they could do. The school was involvedand the children made trash cans. The church and the merchants contributed their share.Everyone raked and piled up the trash in their yards. The Central Committee securedtrucks for one day to collect the trash. It was truly a community project. In planning the campaign the Central Committee with the aid of the extension workerdeveloped the plan and schedule of activities for the 'clean-up campaign' as follows: -177- First Week. Second Week Third Week Fourth Week Meeting General meetingto launchcampaignMeeting of leadersto discuss cansin strategicplaces Arrange for equipment or supplies - The change recommended in the campaign may callfor seeds, fertilizer, or other supplies or equipment not regularly available in thecommunity.If this be the case be sure an adequate supply of all needed materials ison hand.You might, for example, arrange to bring seeds in from outside and plan asystem for distributing them. Conducting the Campaign Launohing1our campaiink - Open your campaign by doing something dramatic thatfocuses attention on the problem. Yon might hold a large meeting, inviting everyoneinterested.Perhaps you could have a prominent person take part in the program. Thepistachio campaign was launched by the Governor. In other campaigns the Governor orchief has proclaimed a 'National Health Month', a 'Rural Youth Week', or 'Dairy Day'.Involve any news media people you can. If radio is available, invite radioannouncers to participate. If newspapers reach the community, be sure to includereporters and photographers. Help these people arrange for special photographs and newsstories throughout the campaign. - 178 - You've started your campaign dramatically. Now you must keep the attention of thepeople focused on the recommended practices continuously. This is the place to use yourimagination and devise unusual and interesting approaches. Meetings - You will use meetings of all kinds to carry the message.Some meetingsmay center around the reasons for making the change; others may demonstrate how to makethe change.Your message regarding the new practice may be injected into meetings heldfor other purposes, too. Farm and Home visits - You will need to call on the people involved in the campaignto encourage them to judge their progress or to discover the things that interfere withtheir making the change and assist them. But you need not make all the visits yourself;you can train leaders to make many of these visits. Tours - can show the results after a few people have tried the new method.Othersmay be interested in trying the practice when they see for themselves that it works.Tours were used in 'better homes' campaigns in Uganda. On these tours, not only thehomes that had made the greatest improvement were visited but also those that had made only a small beginning. Demonstrations Before you start a campaign you may have to prove to people thatthe recommended practice will work. Demonstrations oan do this.In a state in India where wheat is grown, it was decided to introduce commercialfertilizer to increase production. Test plots were established all over the state todemonstrate this practice. It was only after the agricultural advisors were fullyconfident that people accepted the practice that they launched a campaign. Publicity - EXbibits are a good way to show the value of the recommended practice.You can put exhibits in fairs and agricultural shows. Some exhibits can be displayedin markets and moved to different villages for the village market day.Many kinds of contests have been used to arouse interest. In the Uganda 'betterhomes' campaigns a contest was the climax. The house-holder making greatest improvementswon a prize, such as a lamp or bag of fertilizer. Essay contests, poster contests, or slogan contests can draw attention to the campaignand its objectives. Signs for homes using the recommended practice have helped. In one malaria campaign,the houses that were sprayed with DDT were plainly identified by special marking.Ina 4-H membership drive, each new member may get a sign to put on his home.Posters remind the people of the practice being recommended. In the clean upcampaign in Jamaica, a poster was designed showing a parade and the title 'join the bigclean-up march'. Wall newspapers were used during a rat campaign in India with great success. Noteveryone in the village was able to read the newspaper, but all wanted to know what it said.Those who could read, read it to the others. Radio and television can help too, if the villages have receiving sets. -179- End the Cam_paigr Dramatically Set a definite time to end the campaign. Feature the final day so the people can share the satimfaction of completing the project. This is a good time to report results to the people. This day, like the starting day, is a time to invite an important person. Dinners, picnics, or rallies will encourage all the people who took part in the campaign to come and rejoice in its success. This is an occasion to recognize community leaders for their work. Evaluate Results Before trying to evaluate the results of a campAgn, review the objectives and considtxt- What is to be measured? - What changes were expected in knowledge, attitudes, and skills?- What evidences can be noted that the changes were made?- Who is carrying out the practice recommended in the campaign?You can use a variety of means to collect information for evaluation from the people, each as personal interviews on farm and home visits, a show of hands,at meetinge, and through use of a questionnaire. Try to determine not only the number of families who adopted the recommended practice, but which campaign methods were most influential. Ask the leaders and members of the campaign committee for their opinions on the effectiveness of the campaign and for suggestions for improving future campaigns. Getting information, suggestions, and opinions from a variety of people will reveal flaws in planning and in carrying out the campaign that you can avoid in future campaigns.Evaluation will be going on throughout a well-planned campaign, but final evaluation is necessary to provide adequate guides for future programs.A careful evaluation will show exactly how many people made the change recommended. It will provide the facts for reporting to the people. It will also show what yuu should emphasize in future programs. Chapter 10.- 180 - EXTENSION PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT Extension program development is a continuous series of processes which includesplanning a program, preparing a plan of work and teaching plan, taking action to carry outthe plans and determining and reporting accomplishments. It is an intensive and broadeffort on the part of the extension service to assist the people of a county (or extensiondistrict) to analyze their major problems and to build an educational program directedtoward the improvement of agriculture and family end community living.Program develop-ment is both an educational process and an attempt to do a thorough and systematic jobof longer-range programing with the people./ Some AssuLmtions in Extension araignThe act of creating extension programs, regardless of their form, rests on a numberof important assumptions. 1.That prevailing conditions of living and ways of making a living are not whatthey ought to be and that something different can and should prevail. 2.That it is possible to select, organize and administer certain resources oftechnology, personnel, teaching methods and physical facilities to help people achievemore desirable ways of living, and of making a living. 3.That people need the guidance of professional leaders possessing the knowledgeand skills necessary to help them learn to solve their problems. 4.That change is necessary, that change is a pre-requisite to progress and thatthe status quo must be rejected, or at least modified, in favor of new ways of thinkingand doing. 5.That people will continue their present ways of thinking and doing until theyhave new experienoes that cause them to reject present modes of behavior and adopt new ones. 6.That to cause people to accept new modes of thinking and acting requires greaterincentives to adopt recommended practices than are offered by continuing with present ones. 7.That progress is made only when someone has ideas about a better way and has theskill, courage and opportunity to try them out. 8.That progress requires change, but all change does not necessarily result inprogress.It is change in specific, predetermined and desirable directions that resultsin progress. 9.That the most effective teaching and learning results from choice, not chance;from an intent to teach. and learn under the most desirable conditions that can be created.

Some Characteristics of EXtension Programs Just as a school has its curriculum through which it accomplishes certain specificeducational objectives, an extension service requires a definite and constructive programif it is to make its maximum contribution to rural progress. But an effective extensionprogram differs considerably from a echoed curriculum. 1.It is practical and fills a need recognized by the people it is designed to serve.No compulsion is involved in its acceptance. 2.It is flexible to meet ever-changing conditions. It is comprehensive to meetthe wide variety of needs of all rural groups. 3.It is well conceived to make a continuing contribution io rural devlopment. Itconsiders not only the immediate needs of the population but looks to the %..ture. A programconceived only to meet immediate problems and emergencies frequently results in wastedeffort because of changing conditions. Probably every extension advisor has in mind certain objectives he hopes to achieve.He may consider these his program, but unless these objectives are known and accepted astheirs by the people he serves and with whom he works, he is working alone. Unless suchobjectives are defined, and recorded, and unless a program of action is developed, lookingtoward the accomplishment of these objectives, there is little progressive action fromyear to year or when changes in staff of the service occur. The purpose of this chapter is to outline some basic principles anti ,rocedures ofextension program planning that have been developed through many years of study. Anextension program, as treated in this chapter, may be defined as a statement of objectivesof an extension service, based upon an analysis of the existing situation and the needs ofthe people in the area involved. It includes a listing of problems that must be solvedin accomplishing these objectives and of the proposed solutions .&tension programs are implemented through plans of work in which broad objectivesare broken down into specific jobs, with goals established for accomplishment througheducational activities carried on over a definite period of time. Aa an example, anobjective of a local extension service may be to increase the local supply of milk andother dairy products to meet minimum nutritional requirements. The plan of work for agiven year may include as a goal the establishment of an artificial insemination centerwith a given number of milk producers making effective use of its services. The accomplish-ment of this goal will require educational activities on the need for more milk, profitto be expected by producers through greater production, dairy management practices whichare necessary in connection with such services, and principles of administrative managementof artificial insemination centers. Working relationships will also need to be establishedwith other agencies concerned with the problem. &tension program planning is a continuing process. Changing economic and socialconditions, and new problems which are constantly arising, make Changes necessary inemphasis although not in basic objectives. It is this constant change in agriculturaland rural social conditions that makes a program of basic objectives so essential.Without it the extension worker is led into a maze of emergency activities and littleprogress is achieved. - 182 - Principles of Program Planning A number of basic principles of extension program planning have been established in workshops on this subject. Let us examine these principles in some detail. 1.Base program planning upon careful analysis of factual situations. All of therelevant and available facts bearing upon the land, the people, the homes, the customs,the communities, the organizations, the institutions and the agencies operating in thearea should be taken into consideration. Examine these facts in relation to the objectivesof the organization. The results of previous plans should'be summarized and appraised.Sources of factual material include research work applicable to the area, and problemsunder consideration; census reports; reports of planning commissions; surveys and studiesof local conditions and the experience.of participants in the planning process.Assemblethis material by problems or subjects, and in a form facilitating the inclusion of additionalinformation as it becomes available. 2.Selectroblems for action which concern reco ized needs.Not all problemscan be attacked at once. It is important that those of most urgent concern, and widespreadinterest be given first consideration. To be effective, extension work must begin withthe interests of the rural family and work toward consideration of other problems of equalimportance which may not be recognized in the beginning. Complete factual informationhelps determine priority of problems. 3.Make the program comprehensive including problems of interest to all members ofthe rural family and to different socio-economic groups. The scope of extension programsvaries in different countries. Work with young farmers and with farm women has beendescribed previously. The interest and cooperation of farm workers and tenants is equallyimportant.Unless extension contributes to the welfare of these groups it can not befully effective in raising the level of living of the community. It has been the policyin some countries to cater for the needs of the more progressive farmers in the hope thatothers would follow their example. Small farmers have special problems, however, whichmake it difficult for them to adopt the same practices as their neighbors who have greaterresources.Special adaptation is often needed to make certain practices applicable tothe conditions of a small farm. 4.Keep the program flexible to meet long-term situations, short-term changes andspecial emergencies. Long-term projects, such as soil conservation and improvement ofnutrition, are essential to rural progress, but these need to be combined with projectsmeeting more immediate needs of the population or interest will lag. Always make allowancefor emergencies such as drought and floods, which require immediate action if sufferingis to be minimized. Without flexibility the program may not in fact meet the needs ofthe people. 5.Make the pEaram educational and direct it toward brin about im rovement inthe abilitoftwine to solve their own roblems, individually and co lectively. Theprogram planning process is itself education Participation of rural people in gather-ing and analyzing fact, selecting problems for attention, assisting in carrying out agreedupon action and in evaluating results, develops their ability to meet new problems as theyarise.It puts them in contact with sources of information, and increases their abilityto utilize the service of agencies working on their behalf.6.Use democratic methods in developing the extension program, by arrangingparticipation of lay people, the extension staff and others who can contribute. It isthe function of the local extension officer to bring to bear on rural problems the bestinformation and judgement available. This will include factual information on localconditions, technical information from research agencies, recommendations of agriculturalscientists relative to specific problems, the guidance of extension supervisors who canbring the experience of other areas, and final1,6 but most important, the judgment of localpeople who have knowledge of local customs and needs. It is often said that local people 183 do not recognize many of their basic needs. This may be true but it is then the responsibility of extension workers to carry on an informational program that will acquaint them withthe facts of the situation and bring about a realization of the need. Until this is donelittle can be accomplished toward improvement of the situation. 7.Orient roy ams to the existin technicaleconomic and social level of the eo leof the area.Too often an attempt is made to bring people in a single step from primitiveto modern techniques in agriculture, when their education, experience and economicresources will not permit such a rapid'change. People are largely a product of theirexperience and cannot make such abrupt changes. It is therefore important to understandthelevel of education, their customs, skill and their existing beliefs, as a basis foran extension program. The situation is similar to that in more formal education, whereelementary and secondary education are the necessary prerequisites to university training.Even where people are literate and capable of understanding improved agricultural techniques,they may not have the physical or financial resources necessary for modern agriculturalpractice.Programs should be planned to utilize only those resources available to thepeople of the area. 8.Clearly defined objectives at all levels in terms that people will understand.According to Paul Leagans 1/1 if there is to be progress and not mere evolution in thedevelopment of people, the objectives of extension services must be clearly determinedand periodically reviewed in the light of progress and changed conditions. A goodobjective in extension is one that will provide possible direction for large numbers ofpeople to move some distance. Extension must help people define the directions in whichthey want and need to go, then provide assistance to them in traveling in those directions. 9.Extension programs should be carried on by well trained personnel, effect]ysupervised.There is no substitute for technical training of extension workers. Thelevel of such training should be such that the worker will command the respect of themost advanced farmers, and enable him to deal intelligently with all ordinary problemswhich he encounters in the area. However, no one person can be an expert in alltechnical, economic and social fields. He should therefore have the support and assistanceof extension workers with specialized training in various fields. Such specialists canassist in the diagnosis of problems, interpretation and adaptation of research information,development of programs in their specific fields, and in the inservice training of localextension workers.In order to acquire and maintain the confidence of rural people, the extension workermust also have wide practical skill. As one extension worker in an underdevelopedcountry has said, ho must be able to do the tasks of an ordinary cultivator and to do themwell. A third type of training which is essential, is training in extension methods. Howto organize and conduct meetings and demonstrations effectively; how to prepare educationalexhibits;how to speak effectively and gain the interest and cooperation of rural people;efficient management of an extension office, and many other techniques are required. 10.Use organization as a tool to accomplish objective. There are many formal andinformal groups in every community. It is the job of the extension worker to find andutilize these groups whose objectives are in line with ,those of the extension service.Working alone, an extension worker can influence a relatively small number of people toadopt improved practices but by enlisting the cooperation of existing groups the results 1./J. Paul Leagans Extension Objectives USDA Extension Service - 184 - of his effort can be multiplied. It is often necessary to organize new groups to carryout certain phases of the extension program such as youth work; dairy herd improvement,etc.In planning new organizations, cars must be taken to avoid conflict or duplicationwith groups already active or interested in this activity. 11.Good program building provides for evaluation of results. Any attempt atevaluation is dependent upon careful definition of objectives. It is therefore importantwhen planning a program, to state objectives clearly and in terms that can be measured orevaluated.Records should be provided which will show achievement in terms of theseobjectives.Many social objectives of extension work are somewhat intangible but ifclearly stated in terms cf desired action of people, results can be appraised periodically. 12.Make maximum use of volunt: leadershiin thelanninas well as in theexecution of extension programs. Aside from the great contribution they can make toprogram planning through their knowledge of local problems and conditions, local peopleneed to take major responsibility for the program's operation if it is to be most effective.It is understandable that people in general have greatest interest in those programs whichthey themselves have had apart in planning. It is important that rural leaders shallnot only be consulted regarding extension plans, but shall help decide what projects willbe undertaken and how they will be operated. 13.Make sure that the grogram is achievable considering such factors as personnel,finances, time and facilities. A common weakness of extension programs is that theyinclude attempts to solve too many problems at once without making a significant contribution to any of them. Exercise care to select a few important problems for attention inany one year, including some which give pramise of immediate satisfaction to the peopleinvolved.At the same time make a beginning on more basic problems requiring a longerperiod for completion, but which are also recognized as being important. Such problemsmust be carefully selected, and those phases attacked in the beginning which will clearthe way for greater effort in the future. Goals set for accomplishment in a given periodof time should be practical and achievable to avoid discouragement of those who participatein the program. Approaches in Extension Program Planning Group planning of extension programs assumes that the people involved have commonproblems, interests and aspirations. Planning is broken down from national to state,to county and to local units to provide consideration of the specific interests of groupswith related values, needs and interests. Within the county, or other unit of localextension service administration, the extension worker must decide upon the most effectivegroupings of people for program development and execution and the corresponding form theprogram shall take.Three general categories of approach may ba used: (1)development of the programby communities or neighborhoods; (2)program development by commodities or projects;and (3)a combination of the two. Community development of programs involves consideration of all elements of the -situation, establishment of priorities and adoption of goals satisfactory to all elementsof the population. It will normally involve the agricultural enterprises deemed mostimportant, improvement of homes, youth training and community development. This approachworks well in general farming &Teas with some uniformity of needs and interests. In suchsituations it provides an excellent method of developing community cooperation not onlyin the planning but the execution of programs. 185 The commodity or project approach brings together for planning all those in the county or area who are interested in a specific crop, livestock enterprise,weed control,educational activity(such as youth work, nutrition, or health education) in planning and executing a program in that field. They may live in different areas, belong to different social classes and not be well acquainted but have a common interest in this specific commodity or project.This type of organization for planning appeals to specialized farmers such as coffee growers, dairymen and specialized fruit and vegetable producers. They may have little interest in all of the other crops grown in the area.In most counties, both situations exist in varying degree.Hence the extension worker needs to use both approaches in planning his program.He will work with communitygroups in planning those parts of the program dealing with problems of general interest, and to learn of the groups with more specialized needs. He will then arrange forrepresentatives of these special interests to meet, possibly on a countywide basis, to plan specific activities. This can often be accomplished by establishing a set of committees on specific problems or activities such as coffee production, weed control,dairying, irrigation, gardening, rural youth work, home improvement, nutrition etc. These committees may then report to a county program committee which is responsible forcoordinating and approving committee proposals and combining them into a county program.At this point a word of caution is in order. The extension worker who isinexperienced in program development should keep his procedures simple in the beginning to avoid confusion and frustration. With experience he can elaborate his proceduresto make them more effective in accomplishing programing objectives. Proam Planning and Execution Principles of program planning and execution are of no value unless they are adopted and applied.The extension worker must, therefore, develop a practical procedure assuring adb(xence to accepted principles. Such a procedure may be very simple in the beginning and elaborated as more people become involved in an expanding program. In any case, since program development is a continuing and repetitive process, the procedure may best be considered as a cycle involving seven essential steps. These steps are repeated in each cycle, taking intoconsideration changes that have resulted from action in the intervening period. 2.1 &tension Development Around the World Guideline for Building Extension Organizationand Programs.Federal &tension Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture incooperation with Agency for International Development, U.S. Department of State. The following is an idealized chart of steps in program planning arranged chronologically.Some of the procedures or steps may appear more idealistic than practicable.However, the whole process involves a logical sequence of operations. r=ner\"Program4 ProgramPlanningProcess Organizationfor Planning Figure 10-1 1' Execution ofPlan of Work Appraisal ofAccomplishment! In actual practice these steps frequently overlap, that is the knowledge of thesituation is further developed in each succeeding step. Also, an extension worker mayhave to proceed without certain situation information which would be most useful in decidingon a program. Nevertheless, effecttve extension workers Observe these steps. Situation and Analysis (1)* All subsequent steps are dependent upon the situation.In fact, the whole purpose of extension education is to permanently change selectedelements of the situationfarm income, family nutrition, rural leadership, and land use,for example.Those involved in planning the local extension educational program need thebest possible understanding of the situation in respect to the following elements: 1.Agricultural resources and current farming patterns and practices. 2.Economic factorscredit, markets, price structure. 1.Local culture family system, needs, values and desires. 4.Sociopolitical system--formal and informal systems of government. 5.People& abilities and individual resources their skills, understanding,and intellectual development. 6.National development programs and goals. * (1) This an& succeeding numbers (2) through (7) refer to numbered steps in theprogram cycle. 187 7.Channels of communication through which people obtain information,exchange ideas and make group decisions, and 8.Other governmental and nongovernmental development programs whichare active in the community, and the role of extension education inrelation thereto. Professional extension leaders at state and/or national levels require a broadunderstanding of all the above elements in national perspective. More detailedknowledge is required of such elements as: 1.National development programs and goa\"31 2.Facilities for training extension workers, 3.Present and potential resources available for use in extension education, 4.Potential needs for extension education in relation to economicand social development programs and goals, and 5.Sources of technical information and advice within and outside the cquntrY. Organization for planning (2) Effective organization provides a means of involvingpeople in the program planning process. Involvement of people is a basic element ofextension education. Participation helps to arouse interest, and those helping todetermine a program will usually do all they can to make it succeed. Involvement of people also results in better programs. Successful programs take into account localknowledge, habits, materials, and experience, in addition to the technical subject matter.Extension education may have an influence on many other institutions and organizationssuch as religious groups, :schools, research agencies, and social organizations and services.Close liaison with these groups at all stages of extension program developmentand implementation encourages cooperation and reduces friction.Extension education in a community, province, or country will eventually affect verylarge numbers of organizations, groups, and individuals. Not all of them can be involved from the beginning. A problem, therefore, is to determine whom to involve in the programplanning process, and by what means. The following steps are suggested as a general guide:1.Identify and counsel with: a.Existing leaders --both formal and informal,b.Cooperators in previous extension or related rural programs if any, andc.Individual citizens having useful knowledge, understanding,or interest. 2.Consult with other professional workers in agriculture and home economics such as:a.Formal or informal planning committees, b.Tribal councils and other official bodies, c.Commercial and cooperative organizations, and d.Administrators of programs in related fields. 18.8 226z,..4........6.2._____Poellz-id-,-trocess (3) The ideal program planning process includes a sequenceof steps cArried out in consultation with the groups and individuals mentioned in thepreceding ection. It is necessary to: 1.IdeStifwants and needs. Rural people axe ready to undertake programswhich theY be ieve wiirsatisfy their wants, although they may not be aware ofall theif basic needs. For example, they may want a higher price for the ricethle3r produce, not knowing that it is possible through use of better varietiesatld cultural practices to obtain much greater yields and a fair profit atelstillg Prices.Consultation with specialists and other technically trained people will pointup the more basic needs and ways of satisfying these needs. It is the job ofthe extension worker to bring this technical information to the attention ofpeople to change their minds as to what they want, and provide a basisfor a sounder program more acceptable to the people. 2.Determine relative im ortance of various reco zed needsand decide onThis must be done in consultation with the people whose co-opeatIon is required in conducting the program. 3.Idshtifthe .roblems involved in satie the needs given high priority. 4.RatLIBiepossible solutions of roblems or alternative courses of action.Solb.tion0 may come out of the experience of the people themselves or they maybe suggIsted by the extension agent or specialist.5. wee04 objectives. This is a joint function of extension workers andtare Xa people involved. In order to be of value, objectives must: a.identify needs and wants, b.specify the specific behavior changes to be sought, c.identify the people involved, indicate the changes to be made andthe subject matter to be used, deSelect those objectives that are practical in terms of staff, materials,and other available resources, and e.!Ott the test of most of the following criteria:. Is the proposed change at the top or near the top in the recognizeddesires or needs of the people?. Is it a change that is important to many?kill local leadership give full support?. If carried out as recommended, is it certain to work?. nave \"off-the-farm\" hurdles to success been cared for?. Is it practical and simple enough for people to adopt and carry out? . Is it practical and possible for professional staff to give adequateguidance? - 189 - - Can it be used as a teaching medium for others? - Can the program, where carried out, be used as an example of whatextension can do? - Are the results readily observable and able to be accomplishedwithin a relatively short time? f.Prepare statements of the objectives:- For the persons or groups that were involved in determining the program,- Tc incorporate into the written program, and- For use in informing interested and concerned persons and groups. Theillanned program (4) A planned program should be recorded in written form andcopies made available to all cooperating groups. This is necessary to avoid latermisunderstanding as to what was agreed and to serve as a criterion for measurement ofachievement.A good written program will normally contain: 1.The names of persons who planned the program and the procedure followed, 2.A situation statement of needs, interests, and identified problems, 3.Statement of agreed objectives, and 4.Provision for coordination with other groups, agencies, and organizations. Plan of work (5) The plan of work is a primary tool of the extension worker whichhe prepares for his own use as an aid in attaining the objectives of the program. A plan indicates specific action to be taken, by whom, when, and where, and what accomplish- ments are expected. It includes a list of the required resources and how they are to be procured.The following are some guiding principles which may prove helpful in preparing and using a plan of work: 1.It is based on the planned program and includes the extension methods and other means to achieve the stated objectives. 2.The plan of work should be revised as needed to reflect progress and changesin goals and objectives. 3.It should include necessary procedures to accomplish program objectives,establish calendars of activity, and designate responsibilities. 4.The total extension job specified ir the plan must be practical in terms ofstaff, time, and other available resources. 5.The annual plan of work should be realistic in terms of possible accomplishments --- these to be limited to a few improved practices which can be observed readily by the people and the extension workers. 6.It should incorporate appropriate evaluation procedures to appraise changes in the people reached. -190- Execution of the plan of work (6) Program action is the \"heart\" of the extensioneducation process. It is here that people learn improved: skills, gain knowledge, and areled to change their attitudes.The first requirement for successful rrogram action is sound technical knowledge onthe part of the extension worker. For example, he should know the kind and amount offertilizer most effective in rice production. The second is the use of extension teachingmethods suited to the subject matter and to the people involved. For exar.ple, the resultdemonstration is effective in showing illiterate farmers how they may use fertilizer toincrease rice yields.The value of advance planning of each program activity cannot be over estimated.This includes making sure that all people involved know their responsibilities and howto carry them out, advance preparation of teaching aids, checking on supplies and equipmentto assure their availability well in advance of the time they are needed, and special effortsto make each activity a useful learning experience for all participants.It is usually easy to find a few individuals in a community who will change theirpractice under close supervision and guidance of the extension worker. The real test ofan extension program is the extent to which improved practices, skills, and attitudes areadopted by the masses of rural people.The great challenge to extension educators under these circumstances is to find anddevelop channels of communications to reach the masses of rural people with a practicaleducational program, and-to do it within the resources available for this purpose.Reports from a cross-section of countries provide examples of widespread adoption ofcertain improved practices in limited areas. Carefully prepared case studies should showthe factors responsible for success under existing conditions. Such studies should provideuseful information in planning and applying these practices on a nationwide basis and inother countries with similar situations. Much more study is needed to determine theprocesses through which people of varying cultures receive new knowledge and are influencedto change practices and attitudes. Auraisal of accomplishment (7) Periodic evaluation in terms of objectives of theprogram provides a basis for continuous improvement. Plans for evaluation need to beincluded in the plan of work. This may involve an accurate description of the situationexisting at a given time, a record of changes proposed and accomplished, and the periodicdescription of the situation as it changes with time. Educational methods may also beevaluated to determine their individual and collective influence in inducing change. Theresults of such evaluations are useful only as they are used in planning future programs. Use of Objectives in Extension Program Planning 1./An analysis of the situation in the process of extension programing will bring outthe facts and problems which need to be looked into by the extension worker engaged inimproving the standard of living of rural people. Objectives help him to do this moreefficiently.Kelsey and Hearne 2/ define objectival; as \"expressions of the ends toward which ourefforts are directed\" in other words, an objective in extension is a direction of movementor a statement of some predetermined action or product to be reached through educationalprocesses.

Kelsey and Cannon C. Hearne - Cooperative Extension Work - Ithaca,New York,Comstock Publishing Associates 1955. -191- Raudabaugh y clarifies this further by saying \"objectives are the criteria bywhich content is outlined, materials selected, teaching procedures and learning experience developed, and progress toward accomplishment, and accomplishment are evaluated.\" An analysis of the situation in the extension program process will bring out certain facts and problems which need to be looked into by the extension worker engaged in an action program for improving the standard of living of rural people.Let us now assume that the extension worker is concerned with the improvement of the standard of cocoa beans produced by cocoa farmers in X Division, with a -Asti to getting a better income from their plantings. This might be known as the clean cocoa bean campaign which MANN has been staging during the last two or three years. Objectives may be considered at three levels:Fundamental objectives- To develop Nigeria- To develop Western Nigeria- To develop agriculture - To help farmers lead a more satisfying rural life.These are the all inclusive objectives of society, that is, the development of theindividual, of communities, of society itself, and of the country. The fundamental (teaching) objective is to teach people how to determine their own problemst help themacquire knowledge about the problems, and motivate them to the extent that they will want to do something about the problems.General objectives These objectives are the bases of our long term program aims, to bring new ideas,new techniques, new knowledge; all leasing to better crops, better homes, betterhealth, and better citizenship. We try to make people more efficient, improveincome, and better the standards of living.Specific objectives This is -4tere people's needs are brought into focus one at a time, where teachingsituations are set up, and where extension teaching takes place.Each specific objective should have three aspects:1.A particular group of people 2.A particular subject matter area 3.A definite change in behaviour Let us continue our example of clean cocoa beans and see what changes in the cocoafarmers must come about, if the objective is to be achieved. These educational objectives must be considered: 11.141.1111...,..........,1/ J. Neil Raudabaugh Goals and Objectives pp. 18-21 of Evaluation in Extension. Washington D.C.

On the other hand general administrative structures and procedures mustbe adjusted to the country's needs and resources and the social and economic conditionsunder wh-lch the extension service is to be operated. These special conditions set thepattern over and above standard administrative procedures in operating the extension program.The administration of the extension service calls for certain specific considerationsand adjustments because the nature of extension differs quite distinctly from that of anyother public service. Extension programs reach rural people through educational processes,a unique framework within which the extension service is to operate.It is important that all officials concerned with programs of rural developmenthave a clear understanding of the nature, scope and methods of operation of extensionservices.These include not only those directly responsible for extension administrationbut policy officials in the ministry of agriculture, directors of technical services andleaders of other organizations and services concerned with rural progress. Administratorsof national development programs are usually weak in drawing a distinction between extensionwork, the enforcement of regulatory measures and the provision of direct services to thepeople.It is difficult for these officials, in planning for agricultural development,to,integrate education with other parts of the program. The period required by officials andleaders of developing countries to understand the importance of extension and of theintegrated approach can be sustantially reduced if it can be started, as recommended by theFood and Agricultural Organization in pilot zones.An additional problem in extension administration arises from the fact that inseveral countries extension operates at present as a part of previously existing agriculturalservices, and legislation setting up extension services fails to define its essentialfeature.There are very few countries in which legislation spells out such vital mattersas the scope and objectives of the extension organization, its structure and relationshipwith research and other ministry services, the post of extension director, and provision forfinancing extension activities. As a result of 'his institutionally vague situation it isdifficult for the administrator to operate a unified extension program and to preventextension personnel from being assigned regulatory and service type work or from actuallybeing transferred to other services.When the extension service is newly established and many essential elements arestill undeveloped, the administration is confronted with many problems arising in the day-to-day operation of the program. Some of these problems are extremely difficult to settleand often may threaten the very existence of the service. Many of these situations andproblems cannot be anticipated in advance and dealt with by established rules and proceduresbut call for new non-programmed decisions - problems, for instanoe, which may arise fromthe assignment of the functions of an extension subject matter specialist to a technicianserving in a technical division of the ministry or in a research institution, or the over-lapping of functions of field workers responsible to separate services. If the particular 1/Basil C. Moussoures former Director of the Extension Service, klinistry ofAgriculture, Greece - 201 - problem is of such a nature that the decision reached establishes a desirable precedent then it may become a standard procedure in handling similar situations. That is it becomes for the extension administration a programed decision. It is through such a process that the administration of a newly established service develops its particular policies and procedures.When the extension service has been well established within the framework of the ministry of agriculture, the program is operated mostly through standard procedures and very few non-programed decisions have to be made, even though the service continues to broaden its scope, restate its objectives from time to time, and adjust its organization in order to meet the evolving needs of the farming population.In the administration process we can also distinguish two other types of decisions: organization decisions, which can always be delegated and the personal ones which ordinarily cannot be delegated to others. The extent to which organization decisions, as made in the central administration, are delegated to regional and field services determine the degree the extension program is decentralized. In the decision making process, the extension administration needs to have a set of guiding principles with which its decisions should be in keeping.Violation of such guiding principles will result frequently in perplexing situations.At the same time it is important to have a degree of flexibility in implementing the extension program. Thus programmed decisions should allow ample room for judgement and evaluation of factors involved in particular situations.In formulating policies and procedures and in making major decisions, extension administrators should evaluate fact and alternative in the light of long-term objectives of the program and the interests and needs of the people. Extension administrators should therefore keep asking themselves every time they are to make a major decision such questions as the following: - Does the envisaged policy safeguard the educational character of the program?- Does it promote better liaison and coordination with research and other ministry services, institutions and agencies serving agriculture?- Does it foster understanding, cooperation, initiative and leadership along the line among extension personnel? - Will the policy or procedure to be adopted help to decentralize and meet more effectively the particular needs of farm people?Qualifications and Functions of Extension PersonnelThe qualafications and functions of personnel serving in the various posts of the ministry of agriculture and assigned extension responsibilities, depend to a great extent on the organizational structure of extension in each country.Where extension as a public service is in its first stage of development, and the eduoational functions are not clearly distinguished from those of enforcing regulations and providing services to the people, extension activities are sometimes carried on by field personnel together with. other duties.In some cases ministries have gone to the extreme of assigning to the same field worker all responsibilities for research, extension, regulatory and service-type work in each major agriculture field. In still others, a bureau of extension is set up in the ministry while technical divisions continue to be responsible for extension work in their respective fields. Under such organizational patterns the extension program is fragmented, functions may overlap and often contradictory advise is giVen to the farmer while the extension bureau is restricted to the dissemination of information through publications, radio broadcasts, agricultural exhibits and other mass media. - 202 - Irrespective of the stage of development of the extension organization and theextent to Which functions have been defined at all levels, extension workers can beclassified is three broad categories: (1) local extension workers in direct contact withfarm people:(2) those who backstop local workers, supervise the program, providetechnical hell' and advise in subject matter fields as well as on extension methodology:and (3) those Whose Main functions are administrative. A more detailed functional classification of extension personnel as today understood,would require treeing vertical lines of executive authority between those having administrativeresponsibilities Prom the top to the lowest echelons in the field. Horizontal lines ofliaison and cooperation would also exist on each level. These would' connect non-executiveinterrelated shd specialized functions like those of supervisors, subject matter specialistsand information officers;Whet/ the extension organization has evolved from sections in technical servicesto an independent extension service with a unified program, it will have bureaux withspecialized fsepooeihilities, such as agriculture, youth training, home economics, agri-cultural inforMstion and extension personnel training. Then the lines of executiveauthority ruafrom the director to the heads of bureaux, to the directors of regional agri-cultural serf/lees said from them to chiefs of extension sections and/or to regional extensionsupervisors in cage regulatory and service-type functions have been clearly distinguishedfrom extension. tinder these assumptions the attached chart was drawn to illustrate thelines of administrative and non-executive authority. This organizational pattern, foundin many developing countries, is well adapted to existing conditions.It provides fora reasonable division of labor and the grouping of functions in keeping with the needs ofthe program.It eetablishodirect lines of authority between the extension administratorand the field personnel.In easethe extension organization is incorporated in a general administrativepattern of regional services breaking into smaller units - usually counties - the extensionprogram on tlie couatry level may be assigned to one agricultural officer and village levelworkers under his supervision. It may be better under most circumstance to let the countyagricultural office deal with regulatory and service-type work while the extension programis the respdaSibility of local extension agents under the supervision of the chief ofextension.in the regional service. In this case extension workers maintain liaison andcooperation \"th country agricultural offices. This type of organization is preferablesince lines of administrative authority and supervision are kept short and direct. After this brief discussion on how lines of authority may run within an extensionservice we Will describe the functions and qualifications of various categories of extensionpersonnel.* *Editors note% In adapting the above described organization pattern and accompaningorganization chart to a specific country one should keep in mind the need for the extensionadministrator to maintain control of his staff. For example, the extension subject matterspecialist oft be looated in a technical department but should be administratively responsibleto the director of extension. At the same time the specialist may look to his technicaldepartment for guidance on technical matters.

Villagest1 Field Workers IMMEMNIMM. - 204 - Qualifications and Functions of the Extension DirectorThe extension director is responsible to the director general and the secretaryor minister of agriculture for administration of the extension service and the operationof its program. In those countries which have adopted the merit system as part of asystem of public administration, ministry of agriculture positions, including extension,are classified. Civil Service regulations contain a description of each position and spellout standard procedures to be followed in recruiting, appointing and promoting personnel.In such situations, the appointment of the extension direotor is done through standardprocedures and is a matter of making the proper selection from among those having therequired qualifications.Extension Director's Qualification - An agricultural officer with rural background,a university degree and several years of experience in agricultural fields should beappointed to the post of director of extension. Furthermore, the position should haveproper rank and prestige in the hierarchy of the civil service. This qualification isespecially important when the extension service is newly established and needs to obtainthe recognition of other divisions end services in the ministry. It is highly desirable thatthe agricultural officer appointed to the post of director should have training in extensionprinciples and methodology and that at least part of his experience comes from actualextension work. With the scarcity of university trained men in developing countries,extension often starts with field workers with secondary or elementary agricultural training.In such cases it is highly desirable to appoint to the post of extension director a senioragricultural officer who has led in the development of extension, has faith in the cause andhas the best possible training, field experience and personal qualifications.Apart from training and experience in agriculture, the extension director musthave executive abilities.He must make decisions, manage the service and personnel, andsee to it that his staff is trained to make the right decisions. The extension director isconstantly in contact with people in the organization he leads, in the ministry and inrural areas.He, therefore, must be able to understand human nature and be respected bypeople.The director must always have a positive attitude in discussing problems with hissuperiors and his sub-ordinates, as well as with the public. He must have a highly developedspirit of cooperation and understanding, a basic principle of extension which he himselfmust practice. Last but not least the extension director must be able to inspire hisco-workers and farm leaders and constantly instill in them a sense of duty and responsibilityto rural people.Favorable personal characteristics of extension workers at all levels includevision, ability to plan, initiative, resourcefulness, integrity, faith, courage, judgement,perseverance, tact and power of expression. The extension director should have them to ahigh degree if he is to successfully lead the service and accomplish his mission.The Functions of the Extension Director like those of all administrators are thoseof planning, control and supervision, personnel management, office management, integration,coordination and human relations. These functions are exercised not only by the directorof the organization but through delegated authority, by heads of bureaux, chiefs of regionalextension services and all those down the line who have executive responsibilities ofwhatever degree. This involves the direction and control of all executive action and aunity of command which is the main responsibility of the top administrator of any organization.This in turn involves a continuous effort to maintain effective communication (reports,meetings with the staff, circulars, memoranda etc.) and conscious and purposeful cooperationamong staff members all along the line. Effective cooperation is a key element in thesurvival and development of any organization.Many of the functions of the extension director involve the making of decisionsthat relate to maintaining and developing the service and operating the program. He mustcontinually strive to broaden the scope, improve the structure and achieve a unifiedextension service meeting the needs of farm people; to plan a program well integrated withother rural programs; and to assure the necessary funds, personnel and other resources for - 205 - the operation of the program. Many of the functions of the extension director deal with the supervision and development of extension personnel and the coordination of functions of staff members. Still others involve in- service training, evaluation studies and maintaining proper relationships with other services and agencies, and keeping political leaders, officials, farmers and the public at large well informed of major objectives, program operations and work accomplished by the extension service. To exercise effectively all his functions as summarized above, particularly control and supervision, the extension director cannot rely only upon reports of staff members, supervisors and regional officers. Nor can he rely upon directives and memoranda setting up policies and procedures for the operation of the program. These are necessary and part of the administrative machinery but the director needs also to be in direct contact in the field with extension workers, farm leaders and field officers of other services. He must have a clear picture of the situation and form his own opinion as regards farmers'problems, progress made and difficul- ties arising in the operation of the extension program.The study of a problem, on the spot, by the director and his staff and his direct contact with people and officialsinvolved, helps him arrive at the best possible solution and to straighten out misunderstandings and difficulties which otherwise might not only impede the operation of the program but could develop into more serious situations. Qualifications and Functions of Extension SupervisorsSupervision* is today recognized as a key factor in developing extension workers capable of leading farm people in agricultural and rural improvement programs. This factor is especially important for the continuous professional growth of extension personnel.Both quantitative and qualitative deficiencies of extension supervision constitute major obstacles to extension development. In the first place it should be stressed that supervisory functions are not clearly distinguished from administrative functions and the functions of the extension subject matter specialists.This is understandable in that the concepts of supervision and on-the-job training are new as is the extension approach itself.Traditionally, agricultural services have, like other public services, used inspectors to check on the personnel, work accomplished, and whether public funds are spent in conformity with government regulations. Follow -up of programs, individual guidance, encouragement and on-the-job training of field workers are functions which distinguish todays supervision from formal inspection. In the second place the training of extension workers on the job is extremely important because in most countries extension starts with workers Mith inadequate training and with no real preparation for this kind of job, An equally important responsibility of supervisors, especially When extension is in an early stags of development, is \"to educate\" officials and leaders in order that they understand the aims and objectives of the extension program. Supervision of extension workers, to be effective, must be free from administrative responsibilities which are time consuming and distracting and often make it difficult for Supervisors to maintain friendly relations with the workers. Futhermore supervision like the administration of the program, should be decentralized as much as possible. Whatever the structure of the organization, extension supervisors to_most effectively carry on their functions, should be placed in the field in contact with the workers they supervise. It is a good practice to place them in strategic centers where they may move freely in the area assigned to them. It is generally best to place supervisors on the regional level together with subject matter specialists where they can moat effectively supervise the development of the program in the region and provide on- the -jab training of county extension chiefs as well as field workers. This system has given excellent results in certain countries where a few highly qualified supervisors have raised the professional standards of the extension personnel in a short time. Individual guidance, encouragement and on-the-job advice constitute important aspects of supervision and should be regarded as an essential part of the in-service training program. *See page 224 for criteria for Extension Supervision - 206 - Qualifications ,of Extension Supervisors - Extension supervisors should have, apartfrom an agricultural college degree and a farming background, special training in extensioneducation.Field experience in extension should be regarded as a prerequisite. This meansthat supervisors must come out of the ranks of the extension service. This requirement isdifficult to meet when the Atension program is in its initial stages and in developingcountries where there is a scarcity of college trained men. In this situation, the extensiondirector may well select a few young college graduates as potential supervisors and futureextension leaders. These men can be placed for a two year period in the field to doextension work and then be given the opportunity for post-graduate training with theunderstanding that after completing their training they will be placed in supervisory posts.Such an arrangement will not only provide the required field experience but equallyimportant it will help prevent men trained in extension from being transferred to otherministry posts.Qualifications and Functions of Extension Subject Matter specialistsThe fundamental role extension subject matter specialists can play in an extensionorganization emanates from the following considerations. First extension education is notcarried on in a 178.0011T4but in actual life situations and to achieve its aims and objectivesthe extension service has to meet effectively the needs of farm people. Secondly the fieldextension worker is by necessity a generalist and with the best possible training andexperiencehe cannot long keep abreast of and interpret the findings of agriculturalresearch and technological progress in the present era of specialization. Very often newmethods have been tried successfully by farmers in a neighboring region or country undersimilar Agri- economic conditions. To be applied they need to be adjusted to local conditions.Thirdly agricultural research workers need to be in touch with actual farming situationsand problems in order to plan and ocnduct research programs useful in agriculturaldevelopment.Therefore, the first function of subject matter specialists is to bridge the gapbetween science, farm practice and administration and provide two-way flow of informationbetween research and extension. In developing countries, under most organizational patterns,the link of extension with agricultural research is very weak because research is isolatedand liaison and cooperation between research end extension field workers are left to theirown initiative.The second equally important function of extension subject matter specialists isto backstop and provide on-the-job training to extension workers. They need to be keptabreast of findings of agricultural research and deal constantly with new situations andproblems.This is of major importance to new extension services, which usually have tostart with field workers having insufficient technical training and preparation for thejob.For these reasons the functions of the extension subject matter specialist shouldbe clearly distinguished from research and regulatory duties and administratively thesespeoialists should be part of the extension organization. This latter requirement is soimportant that if not properly understood by agricultural administrators, the resultsachieved by extension specialists may be very disappointing.In discharging their functions extension subject matter specialists have thefollowing specific duties and responsibilities: 1.Be in contact with research institutions and maintain friendly relationswith research workers in their respective fields in order to be well posted on researchprOgrams and the findings of these institutions. 2.Be familiar with current bibliography and scientific developments at homeand their application in their respective fields abroad. 3.Be in contact with technical divisions in the ministry of agriculture,other specialized agencies and commodity organizations, and be well informed on theirpolicies and programs in order to assure that proper coordination is achieved at all levels. -207- 4.Study present status and trends in the particular production field on the national level and by regions, determine deficiencies, interpret available information and develop concrete recommendations as to: (a) actions that need to be taken bygovernment services and agenoies(b) problems that need further investigation by research institutions, (c) new methods and improvements to be introduced and promoted through the extension service, and (d) proposed objectives for the extension program in his particular field of specialization by regions and for the country as a whole. 5.Represent extension in bodies planning for the development of the particular commodity agricultural field and make sure that farners interests are considered and protected. 6.Participate in the planning of the extension program on the national level and assist regional services to set up priorities and objectives for regional and district programs. 7.Move freely in the field, according to their plane of work and upon request of the extension administration, to study problems brought up by field workers, attend and participate in field activities, and train extension workers in planning and conductingdemonstrations, meetings and other extension activites, using information, teaching materials and aids best suited to the particular subject. 8.Prepare bulletins, circulars, instruction sheets and other material to be used by extension workers and farm people. 9.C000perate and assist visual aids specialists in the preparation of slides, film strips, films, posters, exhibits and other teaching aide. 10.Cooperate with agricultural information officers in preparing press releases, news stories, articles and farm broadoaste. 11.Prepare and keep up to date, reports of work accomplished for use by the extension administration, regional servioss, research institutions, other agencies, services and farmers organizations directly involved or interested in the development of the particular agricultural field. 12.Participate in evaluation studies and surveys conducted by supervisors, extension specialists in other fields, research workers and others.Extension subject matter specialists Should be agricultural college graduates with specialized training in a recognized agricultural institution.A farm background and experience in their field of specialization obtained prior to their specialized training are very important qualifications. Very often in developing countries with a scarcity of college trained men, the functions of extension subject matter specialist are assigned to agricultural officers who are gruaduates of middle agricultural schools and have had special training abroad and considerable experience in their particular field. In other instances, college graduates are assigned the duties of extension specialists with little or no formal specialized training in the particular field but on the merits of their experience and service in a research institution or agricultural station or in a ministry service or laboratory. Such appointees with insufficient special training, if experienced and equipped with the proper personal qualifications often develop in a short time into very effective subject matter specialists. An important qualification for extension subject matter specialists is - as already mentioned for supervisors - to have actual experience in extension work. This condition being difficult to meet in developing countries where the extension services are new, it is often necessary to train prospective extension specialists through an arrangement similar to the one previously described for extension supervisors. -208- Qualifications, Functions and Terms of Reference of Local Extension Workers The local extension worker is the most important single element in achieving theaims and objectives of the extension organization. In keeping with extension principles,the functions of the extension worker are those of a teacher, trainer and leader. Tofulfill his mission, the extension worker must teach and train farm people to adopt newideas, better practices, new Skills, a progressive frame of mind, and lead them to higherincomes and living standards. In performing this role, the extension worker becomes the\"catalyzer\" who mobilizes the human resouras through self-help and cooperation and drawsfarm people, services and agencies operating in the rural areas into a \"total program\" ofrural development.The educational functions, as mentioned previously, are easily confused with otherresponsibilities, particularly in countries where extension starts with administrative,regulatory and service-type personnel. This constitutes a serious handicap. A seconddifficulty is that local extension workers must live in the area they are to serve, inorder to be in contact with farm people and develop the proper working relations. Onaccount of present differences in living standards between urban centers and villages,agricultural officers, even those with only secondary school training, often are unwillingto live and work in villages. A third difficulty arises from the fact that agriculturalofficers carrying administrative and regulatory functions sometimes look down on thepeasant, develop a bureaucratic frame of mind and do not have the inclination to work withpeople as required in extension. In view of these difficulties, when the extensionprogram starts and extension functions are separated from administrative and service-typefunctions, it is not a good practice to select and use former agricultural officers aslocal extension workers. It is usually better to start with newly recruited field workersWho have the desirable qualifications and are capable of meeting the exigencies of the job. The specific duites and terms of reference of extension workers as conceived todaycan be summarized as follows: 1.Live in the area assigned to them in order to develop friendly workingrelations with farm people and be considered by them as \"one of their own\", 2.Freely move and regularly visit villages, farms and installations in theirarea according to their schedules, plans of work and the needs of the people. 3.Be in contact and cooperate with farmers, cooperative and community leaders,local dealers in farm products, agents of farm equipment and supply firms, managers ofprocessing plants, leaders of farm organizations and officials of agricultural institutions,services and agencies operating programs in the district. 4.Prepare extension programs and annual plans of work with the help of ruralleaders, extension supervisors and subject- matter specialists. 5.Participate in committees, councils and bodies responsible for the planningand implementation of agricultural development programs in their areas 6.Plan and conduct educational activities such as demonstrations, meetings,surveys, field days and study tours, evening classes and workshops for farm youth andadults, and organize agricultural exhibits, campaigns and special projects involving farmpeople. 7.Impart information to farmers, leaders and others on government policies andprograms affecting agriculture and new technologies through circular letters, articles inmagazinew and. the local press, reports, broadcasts and other mass communication media. -209 8.Bring to the attention of the extension administration problems and situations requiring study and action. Report on extension activities and accomplishments through progress and special reports, personal letters and through contacts with district extension chiefs, supervisors and subject matter specialists.A farm background combined with desirable personal qualifications and basic training in agriculture are the main qualifications extension field workers should have in order to work effectively with farm people. The priority of ferm background, personal traits and leadership abilities over technical training is based on the idea that the workers approach to the farmer, particularly when extension starts, is more important than technical knowledge. Understanding the peasant and the village society in which he lives is a vital prerequisite for communicating with them.Also, programs for the preservice training of field workers in agricultural schools and colleges can always be adjusted to meet their needs and deficiencies in technical training can be corrected through inservice training.Additional qualifications for prospective extension field workers which can be acquired as part of their preservice training include: (1) farm skills and experience in practical agriculture, (2) willingness to work with their hands, and (3) a degree of maturity and desire to help farm people improve their conditions.To recruit field workers who meet these requirements is not en easy matter in developing countries. Few farm boys and girls attend secondary schools and can continue their training in intermediate agricultural schools and colleges. Then too, training in these institutions may not be properly adjusted to needs for trained manpower in the agri cultural sector. This is a very crucial problem which retards extension development in new countries. Because of the scarcity of agriculturalytrained men in developing countries and the difficulty of working in the rural areas it seems that at present and for many years to come; extension services will have to recruit field workers from among graduates of intermediate level agricultural schools, However, the graduates of these institutions are often stuffed with generalities, have incomplete agricultural training and aspire to white collar jobs. This situation is due to three main deficiencies: (1) present entrance requirements and procedures in selecting students, (2) insufficiency both in number and quality of teaching staff and the lack of training facilities, and (3) the prevailing idea that agricultural training at this level can be similar to college training but with a much simpler content. In view of these deficiencies and until secondary education spreads in the rural areas, extension services should set standards of educational qualifications in keeping with the present situation and rely upon comprehensive programs of induction training beforeplacing new recruits in the field. Extension services very often must employ part time or full time technicians to teach special skills to farm youth and adults.These may include farm mechanical carpenters,electricians, farm products processing technicians and other such skilled workers. Extension field workers may not have the competence or the time to teach such necessary skills. These technicians are usually locally recruited to conduct schools and teach evening courses in the repair and maintenance of farm equipment and farm buildinge, carpentry and concrete work and other special skills which technological development makes necessary for farm people to have. These technicians should know the skills they are to teach as well as thetechnical information farmers require in order to master the skills taught.Technicians to be used for training farm people should haveaproper standing in the community and maturity to command the respect of the trainees. Last but not least thpr trainers should have the inherent abilities ofgood teacherseven though they have had very little schooling. -210- Extension field workers should be on watch for such qualified technicians and usethem according to the needs of their programs. The training of technicians should beofspecial concern to extension services. Special short courses may be organized from timeto time by regional extension services to train technicians to be used as needs arise. Thespecific objectives of this training will determine the length and content.of the coursesand the equipment and methods to be used in conducting them.IAaisorziandCoorationofertionsContriEExtisionwitlbutitoRuralDeveloentLiaison and cooperation with agricultural research and educational institutions, andother government and semi-government organizations in rural development have already beenemphasized as major responsibilities of the extension organization. Our purpose here isto draw attention to the fact that extension should also recognize the important role itcan play in rural development and in atoll local bodies and rural groups as communitycouncils, farm cooperatives, farmers' associations interested in the promotion of acommodity, and other rural organizations with similar objectives. The need to deal moreeffectively with social and economic problems provides the incentive for people to organizethemselves into groups having common interests and objectives. People, therefore, shouldnot only be able to understand their problems and be willing to cooperate, but must knowhow to organize themselves and properly run their organizations. To this is closelyrelated the development of enlightened leadership which is a major responsibility ofextension.New and improved practices can be promoted much faster and more effectivelythrough the organized effort of farm people, once the new techniques have been proveneconomically sound and have gone beyond the demonstration stage. Improved seeds,fertilizers, Chemicals and modern equipment services can be supplied by cooperatives.Artificial insemination services can be provided by breeders' associations. Oommumityimprovement projects in which local clubs or groups are interested can be promoted incooperation with community councils through well-integrated and balanced immunity develop-ment programs. This affords an opportunity to integrate extension projects and activitiesinto the rural development programs. Extension workers must strive toward strengtheningand coordinating the activities of all groups to the mutual advantage of the peopleconcerned.Pertinent information and facts provided by extension will help members ofsuch groups understand their problems and make wise decisions in solving them. Thispolicy should be particularly emphasized when conflicting interests and controversies arisein a community. The extension worker should stand by the facts and not associate himselfwith either side of a controversy. When conflicts arise between farmers' organizationsand private interests, it is well to remember that both sides have an equally importantrole to play in improving local conditions.Opposition to plans for strengthening the extension organization and making it moreeffective may be encountered from high ranking executives within ministries of agricultureand other public organizations because of conflicting interests. Adjustments andcompromises have therefore to be made. It is a challenge to the extension leaders toobtain the support of rural groups and political leaders strong enough to overcome opposinginterests and ensure the survival and development of the organization. Extension Personnel ManagementThe human element is a key factor in the effective operation of public services.Public administration places great emphasis upon standards and procedures concerning theclassification of posts' salary scales, recruitment, staffing, efficiency ratings,promotion, training, discipline, hours of work, vacations, health and medioal care,sePration procedures, pensions and other conditions governing the employment of civilservants.In the extension serviceon educational organization aiming at changing thebehavior of rural people, the importance of the human factor cannot be over-emphasized.The realization of the aims and objectives of extension depends to a very high degree uponthe quality of extension personnel and the interest, zeal flot spirit with whioh theydisoharge their duties. This means that employment and working conditions for extension - 211 - workers should be such as to create an atmosphere conducive to self-realization and satisfaction in working with farm people, and cause them to look upon their jobs as life careers.When there is a personnel officer or division in the ministry of agriculture which is responsible for the uniform application of regulations, standards and procedures, the extension administration is responsible for matters concerning extension personnel. It must cooperate with the personnel service of the ministry in order that decisions made in the framework of public administration standards and procedures do not hamper the development of the extension program but, on the contrary, help the extension administration to maintain good relations with its personnel, make them part of the system and keep their morale hieh..The role of personnel services in the past has been restrictive, in uniformly enforcing civil service laws and regulations rather than in adopting a positive and cooperative approach towards recognizing individual differences and needs among employees and applying rules and procedures in the management of personnel in such a way as to promote employee cooperation and hence increase their efficiency. To counteract this situation there is now a tendency to let every organization deal with its own personnel administration. In a fully grown extension service employing a large number of workers, all personnel matters may be more effectively administered through a special extension personnel office. The duties of such an office would rather complement than overlap those cf the personnel division of the ministry and, by creating an atmosphere of under- standing and cooperation with this division, would help in making wise decisions in personnel management. On the other haus-, being closer in ideclogy and action to the extension staff who operate the program, this office can more easily convince the staff that extension personnel problems have also to be looked upon within the context of civil service rules and procedures. In any case, the extension administration should accept full responsibility for any decision taken with regard to the management of its personnel.All personnel matters and particularly those of recruitment, placement, transfers, efficiency ratings, promotions and training should be considered in the light of the needs of the program, after objectively appraising the competence, integrity, loyalty, personal characteristics and needs of extension workers. Each decision should protect the service as well as the prestige of the workers and satisfy their particular needs as much as possible, thus keeping high their morale and confidence in the administration. Uniformity in policy aed equity in handling extension personnel matters are, therefore, essential and afford a way to limit political and outside interference, and dissatisfaction and rivalry among the personnel. In extension, as in any public service, personnel management is affected by several factors within the organization and by a wide range of influences from without. They all affect the behavior of staff members and workers.Thus the organization encounters not only individual resistance but quite often group resistance to its influences. The extent to which such resistance will be overcome depends a lot upon the uniformity in policy and the skill with which procedures in managing personnel are applied. In general, the more extension perer'nnel are responsive to their leaders, believe in extension philosophy and aims and have confidence in the administration, the easier it will be for administration to smooth out differences and maintain a unified organization. Interest in extension work and pride in the organization, to the extent that personnel identify themselves with the aims and objectives of extension, are the two important attributes which an extension administration should strive to develop among its personnel.Frequent group cennultations with chiefs of bureaux, supervisors and extension specialists afford the director with an opportunity not only to correctly appraise situa- tions in relation to personnel matters but also to develop among the staff a democratic and cooperative spirit. Group consultations also build morale and permit the group to Share credit for decisions taken. Stating objections in advance prevents decisional whioh are difficult to change or withdraw, from endangering the prestige of the adminis- tration.Because of their importance in extension personnel management, recruitment, placement, transfers and promotions are briefly taken up in the following paragraphs. 212 \"The basis of a sound public service and of the public service career is the wayin Which personnel enters the service.\" J When the various ?oats within the service areclassified and the merit system in selecting and appointing civil servants has been adopted,the recruitment as well as the placement, transfer and promotion of the various categoriesof extension personnel are much facilitated. Competitive examinations and/or seniorityin obtaining the agricultural school or college diploma, age limit, physical fitness, basiceduce ion, farm background and other requirements for admission to the service, are usuallystipulated by civil service laws and procedures. Their application is the responsibilityof the ministry personnel office. Extension administration must cooperate with thepersonnel office and make sure that related procedures are properly interpreted and applied.Recruitment programs are much more efficient if they are the joint responsibility of theministry personnel office and of extension administration. They must be drawn up withconsideration of the number of posts ',Mich are vacant, extension service plans, and needsfor additional personnel, the number and kind of candidates to be attracted, the number ofsecondary school and nniversitylevel agricultural graduates looking for employmentlexistingemployment opportunities for such agricultural graduates in farming, related occupationsand other competing government, semigovernment and private organizations, as well asexisting inducements for entering the extension service. Among these, the most importantto consider are the particular exigencies of the extension job itself, working conditions inextension, salary scales and opportunities for advancement in a career in the ministryservice.These latter are related, other things being equal, to the proportion of thefield posts in which extension personnel will start their careers, to the number of posts ofchief of bureau, supervisor and nitansion subject matter specialist as well as the numberof similarly classified posts in other ministry services, such as posts of junior researchworker and director of service, to Which eventually all extension workers should haveaccess after serving a certain number of years in the field. A commendable practice,partioularly in new countries, would require all agricultural officers entering the ministryservice, inoluding research institutions, to start as extension field workers and after atleast three years of service in the field to be eligible for promotion and placement inother extension posts as well as other agricultural services and institutions. Such apolicy would not only make it possible to treat all junior agriculturists entering theministry services on equal terms, but, more important, give them an opportunity to getfirst hand understanding of farm people's problems and their points of view. Furthermore,this policy uniformly applied will help the administration to cut down the prevailingtendency of young appointees to start their careers from the regional and central serviceslocated in cities instead of from the villages. The correction of this situation could beone of the most important contributions extension could make in building more effectiveagricultural services in the newly developing countries.In extension, as in any other active organization, a process of selection constantlytakes place among personnel, and is due to various interacting factors, some of them foundwithin and some others without the organization. For example, an extension field workermight after one year of work decide to resign because he has found a better paying job ina nearby town where his wife prefers to live, another may ask to be transferred to anotherjob in the ministry which better suits his temperament, while a third ewe is aspiring tobe appointed to a supervisory post and is studying a foreign language in order to be eligiblefor special training abroad. The problem which the extension administration constantlyencounters is how to guide SP(' facilitate this selective process in order that the righttype of personlhaving the desirable qualifications and meeting the standards set up fora particular position, can be eligible and placed in that position. Placement, transfers,selection and promotion therefore, together with counselling and training, are the means atthe disposal of the administration to facilitate and guide the selection of personnel to suitits goals.This obviously cannot be done symtomatioally and with routine prncedures4 It hasto be done in the framework of a properly conceived plan for personnel development. Such a .11 Training and Administration of Personnel in the Public Service.United Nations Report ST/TAA/m/10, p. 29. 213 plan requires making projections of the expanding needsof the program in the variouscategories of personnel for a number of years ahead and in raising its professional standards in line with the broadening scope of the extension programs.Examples include the creation of a number of positions of chiefs of extension bureaux in regional services as a result of separation of supervisory and administrative functions on the regional level, or an increase in the number of posts of extension supervisors and subject matter specialists to cover aew fields like farm management. The training abroad of well selected workers as specialists for newly initiated soil conservation or nutrition programs are examples of objectives to be achieved with personnel ;'..evelopment plans. It is difficult to conduct extension personnel development programs in some developing countries because of weaknesses in administration, division of interest and the antagonism of other divisions and services. This is especially true with regard to the filling of posts of extension supervisor and specialist with specially trained extension workers.Very often they are transferred to other services and agencies. Special problems also arise in providing opportunities for advancement to local extenison workers who in developing countries are graduates of intermediate agriculturalschools and do not have access to higher posts for which a college degreS is required. This problem requires special attention if the morale of this category of extension worker is to be kept high. It is a good policy, apart from promotion to higher grades and salary scales on the merits of achievement, to provide local extension workers with opportunities to advance in the ministry cadres, after successfully completing certain training requirements. For instance, senior, well selected local extension workers can be appointed as chiefs of extension districts or assistants to chiefs of extension in regional services.The behavior of each worker is controllable within rather narrow limits and is subject to a wide range sf influences lying outside the organization. This means that adjustments and changes in the plans for personnel development will inevitably have to take place in view of urgent and properly justified individual needs, problems which sometimes arise from a clash of personalities, for reasons of discipline, in order to protect the prestige of the service and of the worker himself. Quite often compromises will have to be made in planning, transferring and selecting personnel for training and promotion on account of nstside Utf3S1176 :And sersonel factors involved. In handling difficult personnel problems, the extension directnr and his staff should take a long term view as regards the needs of the service for well qualified personnel and should, to the extent possible, objectively judge each case on its merits.Transfers to posts of the same category and level are desirable insofar as they help to provide opportunities to the workers to broaden their experiences but need to be done carefully to avoid disrupting the work. This applies particularly to field workers who must not lose the momentum gained in developing personal contacts and good working relations with farm people in their areas. Transfers to higher posts which are linked with promotions are of course inevitable and should be done in keeping with personnel development plans.Placement and transfers of personnel in positions withinregional services can be decentralized.Authority may be delegated to regional directors of Agricultural servioss to place and transfer extension field workers according to the needs of the program after consultation with regional supervisors. Such a policy will relieve the central administration from a burden, but it should be kept in mind that regional officers are more subject to outside pressure than the oentral administration. For this reason key extension personnel should always be placed and transferred by the oentral administration.Evaluation of the efficiency of extension personnel in discharging their duties and responsibilities is a prerequisite of sound management. Since evaluation should be based on work accomplished and concrete achievement itis closely related to the evaluation of extensionprograms.When rules and procedures for the evaluation of the efficiency of civil servants and their promotion in grade are uniformly applied to all services through personnel offices, it is the responsibility of the extension administrator to make sure that 214 efficiency evaluation reports, efficiency ratings and other pr cedures are properlyinterpreted and anlied, particularly when used as a basis for the promotion and advancementofworkers.In this connection it should not be forgotten that the value of efficiencyevaluation reports and ratings is relative since many of the factors on which evaluationis based are subjeotive and reflect the set of values the person who writes the reportis looking for, even though an effort is being made to apply identical criteria injudging the efficiency of each category of personnel. For this reason it should be stressedagain how important it is for the extension director to form his own opinion throughday today personal contacts, visits in the field with staff members and particularlythe directors, chiefs of bureaux, of regional services and supervisors. He will then beable to appraise on their merits their opinions and judgments in evaluating the efficiencyof the field workers. In conclusion, it should be emphasized that the extension administration shouldrecognize its limitations in exercising authority in handling personnel matters. Therefore,provision of leadership, cooperation and guidance at all levels should be the policy inpersonnel management, rather than controls and authocratic ricisions which are not at allin keeping with extension's philosophy,Office ManagementIn business organizations as well as in public services central emphasis is placed on therole played by office work. Administrative decisions and the proper operation of the primaryactivities of any organization depend upon communication of information within and outsidethe organization. Effectiveness in.serving the administration at a reasonable cost inrelation to the service rendered is the most important consideration in office management.In extension as in any other public service the organizational pattern determinesthe officeunits and their level. If for example the central extension organization branohes intobureaux of agricultural extension, home economics, youth extension work, personnel trainingand so on, respective office units are set up to perform the work required by these bureaux.Thus it should be clear that offioe work is not a function but a process or a group ofprocesses for carrying out and facilitating the work of functional units of the service. Itis in this respeot only that office work can justify its existence. This means that whilethe extension bureau in the central extension services needs sufficient administrative andclerical staff to properly operate the program, a regional supervisor requires only secretarial help to the extent his advisory and training functions demand, while a local extensionfield worker may not even need a secretary. Furthermore we must remember that officeactivities should be performed in the administrative units needing them and should beintegrated as completely as possible with the main functions and activities they are to serve..Therefore every extension officer who has administrative funotions such as chief of bureauis an office manager and has to devote part of his time to managing the office phase of hiswork. Improving and simplifying office prooedures and keeping red tape to a minimum is animportant objeotive of extension administration. However, it is vitally important that theoffioe of each unit be adequately staffed. This requires that the total office work to bedone is broken down into clearly defined tasks. A common error in determining requirementsfor staff and clerical positions in extension organizations is to underestimate the amountof office work required by its various units. Consequently, they are understaffed bothin number and quality of technical and clerical personnel. Thus a crippled organization iscreated from the beginning.Another common error is to have technical personnel share theservices of the same secretary or clerk. Consequently office work is eericntsly hamperedand extension staff members spend much of their time doing routine work to the detriment oftheir main functions. Typing pools and duplicating machines can be used advantageously byseveral office units provided the work of the personnel engaged in these activities isproperly supervised. 215 Effective office precedures save the time of the extension add clerical staff inpreparing letters, memoranda, forms, reports and other documents for internal and external communication, in recording, in assembling and processing facts and information, in filing and record keeping. Each office unit chief should be on the alert to improve the efficiency of office work and to eliminate unnecessary paper work. Each bureau chief should establish reporting system for his staff members that is clear and well understood. Clear reporting relationships also help motivate clerical staff and build interest in their day by day work. Many tasks in office work become routine and can be effectively and easily completed if the proper procedures are adoptel! and understood. In general it is preferable that the staff of each office unit carries on its own work and keeps its own files with the exception of duplicatory, and handling incoming and outgoing mail. These are usually centralized to Letter serve the entire organization. The location of the buildieg where the eentral extension service is housed ordinarily does not create any special problems for the director of extension since the service is usually located in the ministry of agriculture building.The cases of the bureau of extension and of supervisors on the regional level are similar because they are also part of a regional agricultural service. But ie some cases when the extension service is newly established, there is not enough space in ttt ministry building and special quarters hnve to be provided. In such instances the extension administrator must make some decisie with regard to the office building, its location and layout. The major factors to be considered in relation to off'fce building, space and location should be facilitation of working processes, provision employees comfort and health, accessibility to employees and the general public, distance from the ministry of agriculture, flexibility needed for the future growth of the service and costs in proportion values gained and within the limits set up by the administration. The same factors apply to the regional agricultural services including extension bureaux, except that the accessibility of the office to the public and particularly to farm people is much more important. This is even more important with regard to the location of the district and county extension offices.Planning the layout of offices and the rational utilization of the total floor space in the building should follow the organizational pattern.The chief of each bureau and his assistants should be located in private rooms with an adjacent room fbr clerical staff. In this way each office unit will be separately located to carry on its own work.There is presently a trend, in business organizations to adopt the layout of large open areas for office operations and place supervisors and chiefs of services together with the staff. When some degree of privacy is needed for administrators simple partitions are used thus saving considerable office space. The use of this kind of layout for public services which like extension do not serve the public on their premises but in the field does not present any advantages.It is preferable to adopt the private office layout, at least for the extension staff and chiefs of bureaux. They will then be better able to concentrate on their work and have the necessary privacy in conferring with staff members. Typing pools, duplicating machines and the handling of mail need to be arranged with ample space for each employee and the layout of desks and equipment in all office rooms should be designed in relation to lighting, ventilation and the movement of personnel.A large conference room, preferably adjacent to the director's office, is an essential element of office layout. Staff and other meetings can be held in such a room and it also can be used as an exhibit room.Meetings with visiting groups and other officials will often need to be held at the organizations headquarters. It is difficult to say to what extent the quality of office equipment increases the efficiency of employees. However, machines have revolutionized office work and have made clerical tasks easier, faster and less costly.The use of well selected office furniture,equipment and machines adds a lot to the atmosphere and may serve as an incentive instimulating office personnel to do better work and increase their efficiency. It is therefore quite important that central and regional extension offices should be adequately furnished and equipped. with desks, chairs, filing cabinets, shelves, tables and other items as well as with the necessary typewriters, duplicating, adding and calculating machines. However because certain office machines are very expensive it is necessary before buying them to be sure that the work cannot be done as effectively by some simpler means. - 216 - Transportation presents special problems for the extension organization becauseunlike other public service personnel, extension workers must travel and move freelyin rural areas in order to discharge their duties effectively. This holds true for allcategories of extension personnel including the director of the service, but more so forthe local extension workers, Who must visit villages, farmsteads, fields, orchards,processing plants and other places in carrying on the activities of the program. Adequatetransport is therefore a prerequisite for effectively using extension manpower and reachingfarm people.In a country where there is a good system of country roads and all rural centersand farmsteads are accessible by car, transportation is less of a problem because extensionworkers can use public transportation as well as their own private cars and be reimbursedby the service on a kilometer basis. This arrangement is adopted in most advanced countrieswhere there are good country roads and practically all government employees have their ownvehicles.In less developed regions, however, the problem of transportation for extensionpersonnel is much more complicated and presents certain aspects which are often thedetermining factors in establishing extension dietrintst in grouping villages to be servedby extension workers and in selecting the center where he will be located.In densely populated rural areas where villages are very close and the distancesthe extension worker has to travel every day to reach farm people are very short, localextension workers may walk or use a bicycle. When there are long distances to travel andWhere many of the villages are inaccessable by car, particularly in wintertime or rainyseasons, extension workers can travel by bus or car only to villages located on main roadsand have to visit most of the other villages in their district on foot or by horse carriage.To encourage frequent visits to rural areas, some newly established extension serviceshave equipped regional and county extension centers with government vehicles and drivers.Apart from the many difficulties which arise in maintaining these vehicles in operation andoperating automobile pools effectively, the greatest disadvantage is that it requiresextension workers to reside in urban centers out of their districts, far away from thevillages and the people they serve. However this scheme has definite advantages inproviding transport to agricultural officers conducting field rat and locust campaigns, indistributing seeds and fertilizers and carrying on certain other action programs. Anothersolution which has been tried in some developing countries is to allocate cars - usuallyjeeps or land rovers - to individual workers and make them responsible for driving andmaintaining these cars in good order. This scheme even though calling for a substantialinvestment on the part of the extension service meets the needs of extension workers muchmore effectively and at a much lower cost than the previous one. This kind of arrangement.can be considered as a step towards the solution of the transportation problem and untilgovernment services can adopt the policy of allowing employees to use private cars, possiblyencouraging them to purchase their own cars through a loan scheme. With the steady improve-ment of road systems in developing countries, extension administrators should direct theirefforts towards such rational solutions of the transportation problem.EX:tension services and particularly extension workers responsible for carrying onthe program in the field need books and reference material, some special equipment, materialsand supplies for conducting demonstrations, meetings, study tours, evening classes, skillschools and other educational activities. The kind of equipment and supplies necessary incarrying on these activitee will vary with the prevailing conditions and the program setup by each extension worker. Especially in less developed areas, extension field workersneed to have on hand some simple equipment and tools not only for conducting extensionactivities but also for helping them to make better contacts and win the confidence of farmpeople.Such special equipment might includes hand magnifying lenssoilsampling auger'kit for quick PH, phosphorus, potash and lime toots in soil 217 prtniing shears and other horticultural hand toolstrocara syringe for inoculationrunning decameterslide aud film strip projectorblackboardcameraflannelgraph, maps, chartscollections of seeds, chemicals, insectsother exhibits and simple teaching aids.In most cases the latter can be prepared by the extension worker himesi-rhis particular needs.

Rana luet.;rs and sprayers, seed testing equipment, insect traps and other agrinultarel Implements and tools must be on hand for conducting demonstrations when needed.In this connection it should be emphasized that according to sound extension procedures, tools, implements and machinery for conducting demonstrations should be made available bj the cooperating farmer himself, since in no case should a new technique or farm practice be demonstrated if it requires expensive pieces of equipment which farm people find uneconomical to ,Jse or cannot afford to buy. Extension workers should also be provided or still better must be allowed to purchase and have on hand, all the material and supplies they need to prepare charts, maps and other visual aids as well as for conducting method and result demonstrations and other training activities. This might include spray materials, all sorts of chemicals, vaccines and innoculations, seeds, grafts and seedlings, plastics and other materials.Financing the Extension Program In countries where extension work is a state responsibility carried on through an extension service established in the framework of the ministry of agriculture, the law setting up the extension organization normally nthorizes this ministry to include in its budget the funds to cover necessary costs. These costs usually include all expenditures for salaries and allowances of extension personnel, transportation, office rent, equipment and supplies, and equipment and materials for operating the program in the field. In certain countries the financing of extension is the joint responsibility of national and local bodies and farmers associatione. In still others financing is the responsibility of farmers organizations which are also responsible for operating the program and receive subsidies and grants under certain conditions free the state budget. In the United States extension work is financed cooperatively by the states, counties a7',1 the federal government which through federal grants in aid provides financial assistance under certain conditions amounting up to 50% of the total expenditures for extension. 1/The way extension work is financed in a country reflects to a large extent the degree to which local bodies and farm people are interested in the program and the importance they attach to it as a means for raising rural standards. State participation in financing the extension program is also a recognition of the contribution extension can make to rural development and at the same time serves as an inducement to rural institutions and farm people to be interested and cooperate in the operation of the program. Furthermore the joint financing of the work by state and people automatically asserts the best possibly account ability to the general public for the funds spent and thus increases its faith in and support of the extension organization. For these reasons even though extension might be a publicservice financed entirely with public funds it is highly desirable that rural people through local bodies and organizations should participate as much as possible in the financing of they....x..M...weaaMM.y L.

It is the respoitY.,i. tae extension administration to prepare andsubmit to the munister of agriculture or other competent body its budget for the fiscalyear including all proposed expenditures for salaries, allowances, transportation, officerent, equipment and supplies as well as any other expenditures for operating the program.In completing the budget, appropriations of state funds, subsidies and contributions tobe made by local bodies and rural organizations participating in the financing of theprogram should be included.Where public service budgets are approved on a functional basis the extension budgetamounts for each category and project are incorporated under separate sections with anappropriate healing leading into the ministry budget. Salaries and allowances of fieldworkers and supervisors, personnel training, equipment and supplies for central, regionaland local services, travel of every category of personnel, materials and supplies fordemonstrations and other education activities are included. If the standard practice is forevery ministry to present a budget broken down by categories of expenditures for all theservices of the ministry such as salaries, travel of all personnel, equipment and supplies,then all extension budget category and item estimates are molded into the respective ones forthe whole ministry. In that case, after the approval of the ministry budget, financeauthorities have to make adjustments and allocate the available funds to each service withinthe total funds approved for every category of expenditure. The most serious disadvantagewith such a practice is that this kind of centralized budget does not clearly indicate theobjectives and needs of programs for a particular fiscal year new funds are to be spent inachieving particular targets. Neither does it provide a basis for the evaluation of the workaccomplished in relation to funds spent. On the o'ler hand the ministry administration hasmuch more flexibility and freedom in making adjustments in the allocation of Nall duringthe year. In thecase of a community development type of organization the drafting of itsbudget can easily be done on a functional basis and it can be presented together with itsprogram and targets to be reached in the particular fiscal year. An extension organizationwhich is sponsored and maintained by rural organizations and local bodies has the sameadvantage.In view of the many advantages a functional budget presents, the extensionadministration should not only present a functional budget together with its program butalso strive towards having it approved as such by the competent body.Procedures for dencentralizing as much as possible the financing of the extensionprogram by allocating the funds for all categories of expenditures to regional services andauthorizing them to disburse and spend the funds in keeping with the provisions of thebudget are extremely important. The extension program cannot be operated effectively ifthose responsible at the regional and local levels do not have at their disposal the necessaryfunds as well as the authority to disburse them to meet the needs of the program. Therelated procedures have to be worked out by the extension administration in keeping with therules and regulations for the release and disbursing of funds enforced in each country.Frequently the release and disbursing of funds is the responsibility of a central financeauthority.Formalities and delays may make it practically impossible for extension workersto have materials and supplies they need in time for their use in carrying on their activities.This difficulty may be overcome by establishing a revolving fund in each regional serviceand authorizing a finance officer to make payments for expenses duly approved by the chiefof bureau and the director of the regional service. -219- Where financing is decentralised and procedures are established on the regionallevel for disbursing funds, the central finance office of the extension service may put the necessary funds at the disposal of each regional bureau at the beginning or eachtrimester in proportion to the funds allocated for the fiscal year and require an account of expenses inc=rnw' the previous trimester. In this way the extension finance officecan closely follo% the execution of the budget in respect of funds allocated to regional services and ensure the financing of the program without any serious delay.Controls are necessary in the execution of the extension budget and in spending public funds. They are exercised by the public financing authorities in keeping with rules and procedures applied uniformly for the control of all services authorized to spend public funds for a. particular program. The important point to 1)s made here is that the extension administration should not only assume full responsibility for funds appropriated forextension and those contributed by local bodies and rural organizations, but must be in a position to account for the funds spent and prove through its annual report, en evaluation of work accomplished, that funds were properly spent and expenditures were justifiable inorder to achieve the objectives of the program.Pop this reason the proper controls shouldIt exorcized by extension administration to make sure that the funds allocated to eachregional service were spent in conformity with the rules and procedures set up for financingthe Work and that great 7.81* was exercised to avoid unjustified expenditures and waste of funis,This is absolutely necessary in order to establish for the extension service a high reputation and prestige as a public organization.Staffip an Extensionnsion Service 1../The kind and number of personnel required for manning an extension service will vary and must, in the final analysis, be determined by the simplicity or complexity of theextension program, by the number of clientele served, by the diversity of the clientele served, and by the relationship of those factors to the problem of maintaining effectiveorganizational communiestiono. Any projection of staff Tequirements made in this presentation must be assumed to be flexible and adjustable enough to sit into local, state and national conditions.In the earlier years of the Agricultural Extension Service in theUnited States the primary organization was a straight line situation having at its head an administrativeand supervisory director; having also extension specialists; and agent leader; a homedemonstration leader; sometimes a youth leader; and field extension agents. Some such simplified personnel structure may still be applicable in certain national environments,but probably not for long, since technological change and development in foreign countriesmay be much more rapid than it has been during the earlier years of extension's existence in the United States. Aa field extension staffs increased .;.n size and complexity, supervisory control became necessary. Districts with head supervisors were created to solve this problem. And with the division and promulgation of district supervisory and specialist positions inextension, there followed a change in the relationship and communication patterns between field and state level staff. \"In more recent years (in the United States), increases in the size of country andstate specialist's staffs, the need for more specialized leadership in program developmentand coordination, and the additional administrative workload have created the need for staff type positions at the state level. These include positions such as state program leaders inagriculture, home economics, or youth programs, as well as assistant director positions. \" / 1/ D. Roman J.

Publication No.21, p.7. - 220 - The increasing complexity cf the extension organization and its greater line ofcommunication further created the need for certain staff support units such as those inpersonnel training, basic communications methodology, program development and planning,and fiscal management.The foregoing thus briefly describes the gradual evolvement of personnel requirementsas the extension service moved from a simple to a complex organization. Where on thiscae finds the specific personnel requirements of a particular extension servicedependsthe national conditionalon the program needstatd on the sophistication of theprogram which is developed.To simplify a determination of the kind and qualifications of staff needed, cue cancategorize personnel requirements starting with the local level; variations an then beapplied by the elimination of certain levels, depending upon the simplicity or complexityof the organization required: 1.Field extension worker extension agenthome demonstration agentyouth agent 2.Area extension worker Area administrator or supervisor(or district) Area agentsArea specialists 3.State extension worker Administrative officer and assistants(or national) Subject-matter specialistsCommunications speoialistsTraining specialistsProgram leaders and supervisors Each of the three levels indicated can generally be assumed to require a higherlevel of training and specialization, whether it is in educational methodology, trainingexpertise, communications methodologyv or subject matter sophistication. The field levelqualifications are utilitarian, personal contact and human relations oriented. The arealevel positions are supervisory, middle management, and subject matter knowledge oriented.The state level positions are academic and research service, training support andcommunications service, and administrative-management service oriented. Each is to someextent dependent on the other for fulfilling the extension process. Without either Saefield service or the supporting state level research, management, and specialist services,the extension process would lose its basic strength.What should be the qualifications of these vari)us extension personnel? Qualificationscannot he stated exactly for they will vary both in kind and level from area to area, fromcountry to country. But some broad generalizations can be attempted: 1.Since the field agents of the extension service must deal with a wide varietyof problems, they should have a vide familiarity with the subject matter of most academicdisciplines in both agriculture and home economics. They should have a higher degree ofknowledge in some subjects. 2.They should have a solid understanding of the sciences, particularly thenatvral sciences. 3.A working knowledge of economics and sociology is basic to extension work. 4.Naturally, the extension agent should be well skilled in writing, speakingand the use of other communications media. - 221 - 5.Be should have an appreciation of education, the arts, and the culture of the environment in which he will work. 6.Be should know the techniques, the processes, and the methodologies which apply to adult education and adult learning; he should be able to relate these to on-the- job and in.the -time training. 7.He should first and foremost be interested in people, in their educational advancement, and in their individual learning abilities; his dedication to this concept should create in him a near missionary zeal to help people learn.8.He must have a pleasant and outgoing personality, an ability to converse freely with, and to relate easily to, people of all walks in life; his aptitudes and his inclinations, his approach to people, and his empathy are as important as his subject matter background. This is the field worker, a trained and skilled individual, a pleasant and outgoing individual, usually with no less than a Bachelors Degree and often with a Masters Degree, whose major roles are those of adult learning catalyst, agent of social and economic change, problem interpreter, and conveyor of general information with respect to agriculture, home economics, family living, and community development. The specialist, on the other hand, is best a person who has had some experience on the general level of training just described and some experience in the field work of extension, but who then moves on to specialize in such subject matter disciplines as livestock, agronomy, horticulture, dairy- ing, nutrition, family and child development, youth education, sociology, community develop- ment, or others related to the complex problems of rural people. The specialist must have many of the qualifications of the field worker, but in addition must have the desire and the intellect to relate to higher levels of subject matter specialization and research. Other facets of personnel qualifications will become evident as roles of both field agents and specialists are discussed. The Field Contact Agent The contact agent in the United States is traditionally either a local extension agent, a local home demonstration agent, or a local youth agent. In West Virginia, USA, and some other states there is another category of agent and specialist, the area agent and the area specialist. Increased complexity of agriculture and rural life in the United States and increased technology, mechanization, competition, and the need for more specialized resources made these intermediates essential. A strength of the United States system of agricultural extension is the fact that it is administratively and subject matter-wise related to an institution of academic learnng which carries on resident instruction and research in the academic disciplines from which the extension service draws its information and knowledge for dissemination to its clientele. Accepting this premise makes it easier to define the role of all extension workers.In that context the field contact agent serves as liaison representative between university and the rural public; he serves as an educator, an agent of social and economic change in agriculture, home economics, and rural life; he is considered a respected and accepted community leader, knowledgeable about all university resources with proficiency in rural oriented subject matter, in the foundations of adult learning and extension / teaching methods, in human relations, and in problem solving. He is not only an 4e4vidual, or group teacher of adults, but also the person who makes it possible for rural people to identify, seek, and obtain the educational resources needed for their own development and for that of their agricultural enterprise.He is a purveyer of knowledge. Heis primarily responsible for working directly with clientele. It is his task to assume a leadership role in developing the total agricultural resources in his looale. His duties are primarily those of informal education and the organization of various extension activities which will contribute to educational growth. - 222 - Specific duties of the local agricultural extension agent are: (1)to establishhimself in an educational leadership role in agriculture and other areas of competence;(.2) to serve as an organizer of activities supported by specialists in those areas wherehis own training does not permit sufficient competence; (3) to organize groups in such away that learning, planning, and action takes place; (4) to extend the scope andeffectiveness of the local extension program by finding, developing, and recognizing localleaders; (5) to maintain an effective public relations program; (6) to reflect interestsand needs of his clientele to specialists and research staffs; (7) to keep up to dateprofessionally by carrying out a personal program of continuing education and self improve-ment; and (8) to maintain an accurate system of records and reports in order to assistother extension personnel make a better contribution to his local program. The role of the home demonstration agent has a similar emphasis but in: (1) developingthe human resources, community evolvement, and social advances of the local extensionprogram; (2) in working with individuals, families, key leaders and groups for interpretingeducational programs of assistance to women and family life; (3 in carrying out aneducational program for social and cultural advancement; and (4 in keeping up to date asa home economist and professional worker for 'women. The role of the local youth agent is: (1) to assume a leadership role for developinginformal extension programs for youth; (2) to involve volunteer leaders and youth in aprogram of active educational endeavor; (3) to train adult leaders and to arrange for themto work with youth programs; (4) to develop program materials and activities based on theneeds and interests of youth at varying age level and developmental stages; (5) to cooperatewith other educational youth groups in the development of a total program for youth in thelocale; and (6) to engage in a continuing selfimprovement educational program.It may be worthwhile reiterating the earlier statements with reference to a fieldagent's pre-service training.' As a general rule he should have completed four years ofcollege work in the subject areas previously noted. As the extension program becomes morecomplex and as clientele needs become more technical and specialized, a Masters Degreebecomes an imperative. Although basic technical or vocational training is assumed sufficientby some countries, this writer feels that this should apply only to sub-professional aides,and not to the professional extension agent, he needs more than a mechanical knowledge ofthe subjects which will be his concern. He needs both factual and theoretical information,an understanding of.the theory and the more general educational background which permitsrational, critical, and analytical decision - making. Such expertise does not normally accruefrom a narrow vocational-trade school education where he may learn the skills but not thereason why.The Subject Matter SpecialistThe specialist has primary responsibility for subject support of the local areastate extension programs and for the training of county agents in a specialized subjectmatter or program field. He normally has only secondary responsibility for direct contactwith clientele, except insofar as he works with such related clientele groups as the LivestockProducers Association, the Vegetable Growers Association, or the Cooperative.The specialist interprets research findings and provides technical knowledge relatedto the actual practices and techniques of production, marketingiand utlization of agriculturalproducts in his area of expertise; he assists in the analysis of problem situations withrespect to his subject matter competence; he provides factual information relevant tomotivation of people, changing attitudes, and how to organize best fa.. educational activityand action.In general his role is that of supporting, strengthening, and complementingthe activity of the local agent. Subject matter leadership is oentered in the specialist;thus, he serves as a resource person for the field agent, he evaluates new technology withalternatives in subject matter and teaching methods; he prepares literature and otherteaching materials for use by both adult and youth clientele of the extension service.He plans and outlines projects for use by extension field personnel and lay leaders. 223 He trains county extension personnel both in subject matter and adult education methodology. He cooperates with governmental and professional agencies, with voluntary organizations and with industry in planning end carrying out appropriate practices and new ideas in his area of specialization. He interprets and transmits the specialized needs of clientele to researchers for further study; he maintains a constant flow of information related to his field over the mass media channels which are relevant to the clientele using newspapers, bulletins, radio, television, and other meaningful communication means.AB the level of technological sophistication and need in agricultural production increases, the specialist must become increasingly more specialized and kaowledgeable in his subject area. The resulting hazard can easily be an increase in oommunication's difficulty between the specialist and the agent he is supposed to support. Home economics and other nonagricultural specialists have similar responsibilities but in terms of their own subject matter. The subject matter specialist is a staff rather than a line employee; he is not a member of the supervisory, management, or administrative team. He can be compared to the ealher or professor at the college with responsibility for adult teaching methodology and 1-',cr subject matter information; he relays this information to secondary source instructors ythe field agents and the lay leaders). Although often partly responsible to an extension supervisor or extension program coordinator he is and should be directly responsible to a college subject matter department, where he is moat apt to receive the sustenance, assistance, and knowledge resources of research and teaching colleagues related to the academic discipline for which he has responsibility. Through such working relationships the extension service materially increases the breadth and depth of the subject matter resource at its disposal for dissemination to its clients.Criteria for Extension Supervision 21 Supervision is a process by which workers are helped to do their jobs with increasing satisfaction to themselves, to the people with whom they work, and to the agency.Extension supervision is concerned with the improvement, or growth, of extension personnel as individuals and as educational leaders. In contributing to individual growth, the goal of supervision is the maximum development of the potential capacities of the agent as a person. In contributing to the effectiveness of the worker as an educational leader, its goal is to provide the best possible extension program for the people of the country. .Criteria for supervision were identified by a review or literature from the fields of education, including extension, and from industry and voluntary agencies.Nine criteria were chosen for validation. These were submitted to a panel of 15 experts selected from State Directors of Extension and Leaders in the Federal Extension Service. Only criteria accepted by threefourths of the panel of experts were used in the study.Criteria alone can be rather abstract statements.It would be difficult to determine whether or not supervision met the criteria without clarifying general terms by using concrete or specific examples of activities and practices. Through activity and habitual practice, supervisors live out the process which we call supervision and demonstrate the extent to which they meet criteria. For each criterion, a list of 3 to 17 activities br practices was delineated. .2VMary L.

This is not allays the case. In factOhere seems to be an unfortunate metamorphosis that takes place with leaders when they become administrators. Too many lose their excellentleadership qualities in the performance of their administrative responsibilities. One may e43k, and students of administration certainly should ask why does this happen?First lets make sure we do not condemn all administrators. Certainly good adminis trators exist whom we recognize as good leaders. We are speaking of the others who are administrators but are not leaders.I Joseph Id. Franco Extensionist, FAO Pamphlet presented in Turrialba, Costa Rica July, 1966 - 228 - In the author's opinion, one is not a good administrator unless he is also a leader.One who does not lead the group may have the title of administrator but this in itselfdoes not insure that the individual adequately fulfills his role and responsibility. What is an administrator's responsibility? It is to carry out the process ofadministration which is to plan, organize, assign duties, direct and control the activitiesand personnel towards accomplishing the objectives of the organization. Both good andbad administrators would accept this general term of reference - in fact, all administratorsusually have this spelled out in their job descriptions. The difference, however, is inthe application of the process. Successful administrators put emphasis on the means toobtain the ends and unsuccessful administrators concentrate on the ends. To clarify, when one assumes the responsibility of administration he is responsiblefor a group.It is the group then which must work to accomplish certain goals. The processof administration requires that the group be taken into consideration in all activitiesdesigned to accomplish the ultimate goal of the group. This takes a special kind ofindividual who can utilize the resources of the group to carry out the necessary steps ofplanning, organizing, etc. Unfortunately it seems much easier for some administrators todo the job themselves. This is perhaps the clue as to where the dividing line occursbetween successful administration and unsuccessful administration. Success in administrationdepends upon the ability of the administrator to lead others in the activities necessaryto accomplish the objective of the organization. This kind of leadership is dependent upon the individual's: 1.ability to command respect and loyalty, 2,ability to transfer responsibility, 3.ability to include all levels in policy development, 4.ability to instill confidence, 5.ability to generate enthusiasm, 6.ability to teach, 7.ability to learn, 8.ability to instill team spirit and action, 9.ability to make prompt decisions, 10.ability to assume responsibility, 11.ability to listen, 12,ability to recognize limitations in self and others, 13.ability to judge fairly, 14.ability to be honest, and 15.ability to be objective. These are necessary attributes of a good administrator. These are evident in thosewho truly lead. They are not qualities usually found in autocratic administrators. - 229 - One other aspect should be touched upon, that is the fact thatan administrator is usually employed or appointed when an organization or group is involved.A leader also fits this category. One cannot be a leader alone, he must be a leader of others. Therefore, all the knowncharacteristics and qualities that make an individual become a leader are the same thatare needed when'an administrator is called for.That is why the \"leader\" of a group usually is appointed, selected or chosen as formal administrator whengroup action becomesnecessary (organized to perform a task or achieve mutual goals.)Too cften the individual who demonstrates \"leadership\" in a given role, i.e. athletics, research, skills, art, is chosen to head up a group, club or organization. towever, unless he has the other qualities in addition to his skill, he usually is a failure as anadministrator.He is not a leader in this case, he is only an \"expert\" or talented individual. This is notsynonymous with leadership and successful administration, although thereare individuals who are both talented and leaders.There is another phenomenon that occurs.Some individuals believe that in acquiring an administrator's title they automatically will acquire leadership qualities.The rank or title justifies their action.These type individuals become successful autocrats but never successful administrators. Sometimes they achieve their objectives, more often they do not. It not only requires that a person who aspires to be an administrator acquire and learn the attributes of good leadership he must be a unique individual who can evaluate himself in an honest and true light. This periodic self-check must be a part of his routine to insure that he does not drift into what we can term as\"administrative habits\". This driftingoften happens under pressure of the job. Thus periodic checks must be made.One method ormeans of determining whether one is successful is for the individual to leave thegroup (or job) and find that the group continues operating smoothly and efficiently during his absence.Another criterion that can be used as a guide is the morale of the individuals, that make up the team effort.It goes without saying that low morale indicates dissatisfaction and results in lower effort.If low moraleexists a good, administrator must seek its cause and rectify the situation.I put the level of production or achievement as another but lesser yard-stick although high production and achievement is the utlimate goal.Autocratic administration under certain conditions can be productive but usually is not consistent nor will high production continue during the administrator's absence.Are you a goodadministrator? Do you possess the attributes of good leadership? Do you check periodically the yardsticks that help you determine your success or failure? Do you work at the job of being a good administrator or do you work at administering? Should you bean administrator? Tb,r are pertinent questions that all individuals aspiring to be administrators and those adistrators aspiring to be successful should ask and seek honestanswers. Chapter 12.- 2 3 0 EXTENSION REPORTS 2/ Whatever the stage of development of at extension program in any given country, somesystem of reporting by the workers is essential if that program is to operate effectively.For adequate and accurate reports form the major means of communication between the variousgovernmental departments and the local participants upon whose combined support theprogram depends.Extension reporting systems, like the extension programs themselves, vary from countryto country.Some programs have complete reporting systems already in operation; othershave almost none. Considerable diversity in reporting system is not only expected,however, but desired. No reporting system, regardless of how well it may seem to servethe purpoya in the country in which it was developed, can be lifted bodily and set intoeffective operation in another country. In each country the reporting system must betailored to the special needs of the existing situation.Certain general principles of extension reporting, however, may prove of use toextension advisors and others responsible for establishing an adequate reporting system,improving reporting systems already in use, or training extension personnel to prepareadequate, accurate reports. Values of and Uses for ReportsSome resistance to making reports may initially be expected of those extensionworkers previously unacquainted with reporting systems - and indeed of all those whoseattention is directed to practical and immediate results. A discussion, therefore, ofthe values and uses of reports and their role in assuring the sought after practicalresults is an important first step in introducing and developing a reporting system.Some of the more significant values and uses for extension report:: are as follows:Self - praiea,.,1 and Intelliaeut Planning The over-all Objective of extension programs is to help people to develop and toincrease their ability and desire to help themselves. If this objective is to be reached,extension programs must be based on those people where they are and on their currentfacilities and resources. These conditions, however, will constantly shift. As timepasses, people change. If the extension program is having the desired effect, the localsituation will change. The people's desire to improve themselves and their surroundingswill increase. Their ability to carry on self-help programs will improve. Their physicalfacilities will increase. Skills and practices that contribute to an improved economicposition will be used more widely.As these changes come about, the agent or field worker will need to revise his programto fit the new situation. If the changes do not come about as fast as it is reasonableto expect, the worker will need to revise his procedure and methods in order to make themmore effective. 2./This publication was prepared jointly by the International Cooperation,and the United States Department of Agriculture. Washington, D.C. July 10, 1956. - 231 - The very act of preparing reports require the worker to review his past activitiesand resulting accomplishments in terms of changes in people and their surroundings.Astud7 of past reports helps the worker to evaluate the effectiveness of his work. A review of these reports may uncover weak and strong points in past operations. With this knowledge the worker can more intelligently plan for future programs. Su ervi sal of Workers Advancement within the ranks is one of the incentives motivating workers to do their best.The future success of a worker advanced to a more responsible position dependsoften upon how accurately his supervisor has appraised his ability. Among the severalsources of information available to the supervisor in his appraisal of a worker'seffectiveness are the reports previously prepared by the worker.Planning 1125pu ecierorvi )amAnother important function of the supervisor is to help the workers become more skillful and effective in their work. The supervisor must always be alert to ways in Which he can help the worker. He must so plan his supervisory program that he can spend the major part of his time with the workers needing most help and only a minimum amount of time with the more successful workers. Because some workers over-report, othersunder-report, and still others fail to prepare reports giving a clear picture of the work being done and the results obtained, information secured from reports must be supplementedby information secured on trips to the field. Nevertheless, reports furnish much basicinformation that will help the supervisor in planning where his time is most needed. Director's Guidance_ of the Over-All Program and OrganizationThe director is responsible for guiding the over-all program.He must also direct the field organization and interpret administrative directives, rules, and regulations applying to his particular region. To carry out these directives and comply with these rules and regulations he must prepare and put into effect various plans and instructions.To fulfill these duties the director must keep up to date on what is happening in his region.When there are only a few field workers, as in the earlier stages of develop-ment of extension work, a director might be able to meet with every worker as often as once a month. Thus he could remain acquainted with field activities and developments. But as the work develops and the staff increases, the director is no longer able to makefrequent personal contact with each staff member. Hs must therefore depend upon reports as the most reliable source of information regarding field operations and developments.Thus, to a very large extent, the effectiveness of the director depends on the prompt-ness, accuracy and comprehensiveness of the workers' reports. Background for New Workers and Supervisors From time to time workers and supervisors may be transferred to areas where extension work has been carried on by another person.In such cases the new person must become familiar with the local situation. This is necessary if he is to beset bis program on the people where they are and the facilities they have and know bow to use. IA background material for making a rapid and accurate assessment of the situation, a complete set of reports left by the former worker or supervisor will prove extremely valuable. -232- Justifying Public Expenditures and Supporting Budget In nearly all countries where extension has developed to any appreciable extent, itdepends upon public funds for its support. As with any organization depending upon publifunds, IA has two important obligationet to justify past expenditures and to supportreqr,eet.i,: for budgets with valid evidence of its worth in national development. High governmental officials and those responsible for appropriations must determinethe uses to which public funds will be put. They therefore look to extension administra-tors to furnish them information justifying expenditures and supporting budget requests.Without adequate reports from the field, administrators would be unable to perform eitherof these obligations. Securing Public Support and Interest For its ultimate success extension needs public support and interest. It needs thesupport and interest not only of the local people in the areas where the work is beingdone but of the public in general. Wherever extension is making a creditable achievement,stories of its activities and resultant accomplishments and improvements go a long wayin securing ouch public interest and support. Extension officials or publicity departments who must present these stories to thepublic in an interesting fashion, look to reports as the beat source of ready informationfor these stories. The worker, depending as ho does on public support and interest, hasan obligation to include in his reports facts and ir,f7ymation of interest to the public. Recording Time TrendsWhen extension work has been carried on for some time in a given area, the resultingchanges in both people and situations will usually follow certain definite trends. Thesetrends should be revealed when reports covering a more or less extended period of timeare analyzed. Knowledge of such trends is an invaluable guide in planning future programs. To illustrate: if improved seed has been adopted by a large enough percentage of thefarmers, the agent can discontinue demonstrations of the results obtained from improvedseed, devoting that time to other needed activities. Another example might be that whenthe large -scale production of sugar crops and the manufacturing of sugar has been reached,by- products valuable as livestock feed are being wasted in large amounts. Realizationof this wastage might point the way to an increased livestock industry or to a campaignfor better feeding of the livestock already in the area. Developing at Effective Reporting SystemJust as extension programs need to be geared to the local people and the situationin which they live, extension reporting systems need to be geared to the extension organiza-tion and the stage of development in the country involved. This means in turn that thoseresponsible for developing a reporting system in a given country must have a full under-standingef its extension organization. DefinitionsA reporting system is the total reporting effort made by the extension staff membersat all levels.A standard reporting system requirea that all staff members at each organizationallevel use identical forms in their reporting. Further, in a standard reporting systemall staff members must have the same understanding of the type of information to berecorded in each seotion of the report. 233 NesciftaSts2nEteordard211SEItetimSome of the needs for a standard reporting system are revealed in a study of the values and uses for reports. Much of the material contained in the national report of extension work must come from the reports of local agents or field workers. Other information for the rational report must come from the reports of supervisors and directors. Therefore, the figures and statements contained in all these reports from the field, whichmust be consolidated and summarized into figures and statements to tell the national story of extension activities and accomplishments, must be compatible.If figures and statements within a number of reports to be summarized are not compatible, the resulting figure or statement will not be valid. To illustrate: (1) If the report calls for yields per acre and one worker reports bushels, another kilos, whileothers report sacks or some other unit, the resulting figure when such dissimilar units are added together would be meaningless. (2)The report might call for the number of demonstrations. If the kinds of demonstrations are not specified, some workers may report only method demonstrations, others only result demonstrations, while still others might report both result and method demonstrations. Such inconsistencies in reporting would also result in a misleadimg total. Unless instructions for preparing reports specify what is desired, different workersmay interpret many items in any extension report form in more than one way. At the same time, without a standard reporting system, workers in one section or region.in the extensionprogram may include a wholly different set of items in their reports from those in another. It is, therefore, as important in a standard reporting system for all reports of the samelevel to contain the same items as it is for all items in the reports to be fully defined. inEffective StanriSstemda1.The first step in developing a standard reporting system is to analyze theextension organization and its method of operation. 2.If there is a reporting spatem already in use, it will need careful study.Do the reports being prepared by each level of the staff contain all theinformation needed by the reporter in carrying out the functions of hisposition, in planning futtrm activities, and in informing the public in his area of operation? Do the reports of each level contain the information needed by the staff member or officer of the next higher level?Do the national reports contain sufficient information to justify pastexpenditures, support requests for appropriations, inform the general public, and to make administrative decisions?Are all items in each report fully defined?Do all persons preparing reports fully understand what they need to report and why this information is needed?Are workers at each level required to report on the same items as are other workers of the same level?Last but not least, could some of the items be deleted from the reportswithout impairing their effectiveness? - 234 - 3.What information is needed by the central or national office must be determined. 4.Which provincial or state offices will need to plan their activities andprepare the reports needed by the central national office must also bedetermined. 5.This same procedure should then be carried out in turn for each lower levelof the field staff. 6.How best to obtain needed information should be studied. Can some of it beobtained through conferences, correspondence, field trips, or from othergovernmental agencies? What information will need to be secured by reports? 7.Report forms and narrative outlines for each level should be prepared. 8.Detailed instructions for the preparation of each report containingdefinitions and clarifying statements for each item not completelyselfexplanatory, should be developed. 9.Representatives of administrative offices should explain the reportingsystem and instructions to field directors and supervisors, planning withthem ways and means of getting the system into operation and training theworkers to prepare the required reports properly. NOTE:The steps listed in this section are primarily for countries where extensionis organized on a national basis, with a central administration and varying levels ofsupervision.In countries where the organization is less complete, the process ofdetermining what is needed should start with the highest existing staff level and workdown to the lowest. Where the area involved is only a region, the process should startwith the highest staff level in the region. But, in addition, information required ofthat region by provincial or rational offices must be included for consideration. Determing How Frequently Reports Should be Required A first principle of a good reporting system is that only truly essential reportsshould be required. Field workers are not as a general rule enthusiastic report writers.Time and thought spent in preparing reports must be taken away from time spent in thefield.If workers are required to mske unnecessary reports, they will be wasting valuabletime.Where the extension service is new and relatively undeveloped, the worker may needto submit a shortterm report to the supervisor every 15 days. The director for hispart may be required to make a quarterly report to the administrative officer. Whenthe somewhat frequent reports are available, supervisors and administrators can keepmore closely in touch with current operations. At the same time, the field reports,being frequent, can be brief and relatively easy to prepare. As an organization develops, however, fewer reports will be required. Field operational patterns will become established. Supervisors and directors will become more familiarwith the work of the individual agents. The field workers themselves will become moreproficient in preparing their reports. At this time, shortterm reports should be madeto cover a longer period of time and can be somewhat more comprehensive. The following is a suggested outline of report periods for different staff membersof a fairly well developed extension service. - 23) - Staff Member Report Period To Whom Report is SubmittedAgent 1 month1 yearSupervisorSupervisorSupervisor 3 months1 yearDirectorDirectorDirector 1 year Administrator In the early stagee of development of an extension service, supervisors, rather than field workers, may more profitably prepare the a Aual reports. In this case, onlya brief supplementary statistical report at annual report time may be needed from the field workers. Setting the time for closing the report year should be considered carefully.Since administrators will need information on accomplishments when they present their budgetrequests, the report year should perhaps end early enough that a consolidated nation-wide report would precede the preparing of budget requests. On the other hand, reportingmight be more effective if the report year closed at the end of a partichlar season. Kinds of ReportDefinitionsIn any reporting system both short-term and long-term reports will usually be r4quired of the extension workers at the lower level. Since much of the supervisor's programmingmust meet current situations and problems, he will need to have certain reports from thefield workers often enough to keep his plans up to date and therefore make his work most effective.Supervisors on the other hand should not need to report to directors as often as workers report to supervisors. 1.Short-term reports designate reports submitted either semi-monthly or monthly.These are primarily operational reports; that is, most of the information whichthey contain derives from work performed by the field staff and cooperatingparties. 2.Long-term reports designate quarterly or annual reports. Long-term reportsprimarily record accomplishments. They will contain information regarding programaccomplishments and progress, pointing out desirable changes which have resultedfrom the activities of the extension organization. Forms of Reporting Experienoe in many countries has shown that in order to tell the story of extensionin a comprehensive, understandable manner both work stories and figure stories are necessary.It has also been found that the most effective way to do this is to divide the reports ateach reporting level into sections - the statistical section and the narrative section. 1.In the statistical section of a report the story of extension's activities,accomplishments and progress is told as completely as possible with figures.This section might well be called the quantitative section of the report. It showssuch things as the amount of work done, the volume of services rendered, thenumber of practices adopted. -236- 2.No matter how complete and comprehensive the statistical report, someexplanation and additional information will be necessary to tell a storythat is both well-rounded and understandable to all concerned. Content of ReportsThe statistical sections of extension reports are more easily read and understoodwhen they are divided into several sub-sections. The following is a suggested seriesof sub-sections, but they should of course be varied to fit the existing situation.(Some of the suggested sub-divisions should be left our perhaps and some not mentionedshould be added.) Statistical sub-sections 1.Work done by days 2.Extension teaching methods and activities 3.Distribution of time and contacts by subject-matter lines 4.Cooperation with other departments or agencies 5.AccomplishmentsSub-sections (1), (2), (3) and (4) can be used for short-term reports. Sub-section(5) can be the major part of the statistical section of the long-term report. Inaddition to sub-section (5), condensed summaries of sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) mightalso be included in the long-term report. Sub-section (1) would not appear in the long-term report.The work done by days sub-section should show (1) the date, (2) the place where workwas done (commr9ity, village, barrio, or other term designating the sub-divisions ofthe reporter's area, or office if the worker's time was spent there), (3) the separateportions of the day spent at each place, (4) the uature of the work done in brief concisestatements, such as Organized Village Council; Organized Women's Club; Conducted SprayingDemonstration; Started Cotton Fertilization Result Demonstration; Conducted ClothingClass;Visited (state number) Community Leaders; Arranged for Poultry Educational Meeting;Trained Sanitation Committee; Conducted Drama.While this sub-section is usually classified as a part of the statistical portion.ofthe report, it is really a combination of statistical and narrative, part being reportedin figures, part in descriptive statements.See a sample form of the work done by days sub- section at the end of this chapter.The extension teaching methods and activities sub-section should show the way thework is being carried on. The following is a list of activities and methods that or other meetings held or attended- Attendance 9.Groups organized- work committeesNumber of members -238- 10.Posters, leaflets or bulletins distributed 11.Radio broadcasts prepared 12.Fair:: or exhibitsNumber heldPersons attending The preceding list. of methods and activities of course, is only suggested. Thosethat do not apply to the existing situation should not be used. Others needed in thesituation should be added. Possibly several of the suggested items might profitably beconsolidated into a single item that would better serve the need.See a sample form of the extension teaching methods and activities :rib section atthe end of this chapter.The distribution of time and contacts by subject should show the time spent andcontacts made by the workers on each major line of work. The following is a suggestedlist of lines of work: management12. control13.Farmtomarket roads14.Improved machinery and equiPMent15.Buildings16.Health preservation19.Clothing20.Nutrition21.Social life and vacreation22,Community improvement'3.Intercommunity activities -239 The preceding list Should also be rovised to fit the situation.For each line of work the following items should be reported:Days devoted by workerAttendance at meetingsIndividual visitsDays devoted by leaders or committeemenVisits received by worker at headquartersSee a sample form for this subsection at the end of this chapter.In the sub section, coo eration with other de artments orancies, the name of the department or agency should be given together with the project or activity involved and the amount of time spent by representatives of that department or agency.In the accomzlishment subsection the worker should report selected recommended practices which have been adopted and improvements completed. Na attempt should be made in this section to reportall the improvements made or all the recommended practices adopted.TO do so would require detailed surveys and, evaluation studies. Only selected items common to all regions or important to the national development should be included in this sub section. The following are sample items: 1.AgricultureCultivators using improved seed. Hectares or acres planted with improved seed. Cultivators using commercial fertilizers.

It should contain only he most important items and the most important details in each item.Minor details, if needed for special purposes can be secured later. 240 -. In deciding what to include in the narrative report, we need to consider to whom thereport ie directed and the users for which it is intended. As the prior discussion onvalues and uses of reports has shown, an agent writes his report for his on use, forhis supervisor, the director, the administrative officers, governmental officials, andthe people.The supervisor writes his report for his own use, for the director, theadministrative officers, governmental officials and the public. With the uses in mindthat the report must fulfill for each one of these persons or groups, the types of information that the narrative must include can be determined. For example, since the supervisor will want to get information from the workers' reports that will help him to be ofmost assistance to all the agents, each agent should describe the most significant problemswhich he has overcome and the methods which he used in their solution. Perhaps moreimportt,he should also state the problems he has not been able to solve. The agent'sreport also Should explain the most pertinent figures in the statistical section, showinghow these figures indicate desired changes in people and in communities. For use by thesupervisor, director, and others who will inform the public of tha progress and accomplishments of extension, the agent should also include brief statements of outstanding achievementsas well as a few well chosen success stories of persons who have been helped by extension.The supervisor in turn, should include in his report both a general statement ofthe progress of the work in hie area and selected achievement and success stories fromagents' reports. Important supervisory problems solved and problems not yet solved shouldalso be described.The following is a suggested outline for agents or field workers' narrative reports.It should, of course, be revised to fit the local situation:Outline for Agent's NarrativeReview of activities of report periodExplanation and clarification of important factsreported in statistical eectionOutstanding achievements and eventsSelected individual succeso storiesOutstanding problems met and overcomeOutstanding problems not yet overcomeStatement of plans for immediate future Since persons receiving a report are interested in checking field t!tivities anddevelopments in only a few subject areas, a division of the narrative report by headingsindicating the various lines of work facilitate their finding the information they needwithout reading the whole report. This division can be done in two ways. One methodwould be to use as main headings, the items in the preceding outline with subject mattersubtitles under each item where they apply. The other method would be to use subjectmatter listing as main headings for the narrative, with those items in the preceding outline listed as subtitles for each line of work to which thty apply.A common mistake of persons making reports is to feel .equired to report sometidng inconnection with each item on the statistical report forms or in the narrative outline.On the contrary, all report writers should thoroughly understand that they are to reportonly on those items applicable to some definite activity carried on or some definiteaccomplishments achieved during the reporting period. That is to say, if the standardreport. form calls for certain information on wheat, and. wheat is not grown in the particulararea for Which the report is being made, the worker should not feel that he is expected toreport something on wheat. Of if the standard form calls for a report on food preservationand no work has been done on food preservation in the reporting period, the agent shouldleave that section blank. -241- Records Needed in Preparing ReportsThere is no really easy way to prepare reports. Bus there are ways and means to make the task as easy as possible. First among these is a good set of records.As a rule, the person who habitually keeps his records up to i'te is the person most able to prepare accurate, comprehensive reports with the le of time and effort. A number of records that the worker can keep will he__ 1.ke reporting easier. Four types of records helpful in preparing reports are list. :flow:1.Organization records 2.Project or line of work recoils 3.Cooperation with other departments or agencies4.Daily records These four types will, as a general ruletbe found to be th most helpful in the preparation of reports. Under some Qcnditions, not all of these records may be necessary. Upder other conditions, still other records may be both necessary and helpful. Organization records Two types of organizations especially concern the agent or field worker. One type includes organizations that perform functions of a general nature such as program planning and general program promotion, which are essential to the car raring on of an exasion program. Such organizations deal with matters essential to many of work.They may have been organized by the agent for the specific purpose of carrying on extension work, or they may be organizations already existing and newly directed to establish and implement the over-all extension program. Typical extension functions per- formed by such general organizations are program determination, program planning, and leader- ship in program execution. Organizations of this type are: (1) communityor village Councils, (2) women's clubs, (3) home economic councils, (4) youth councils, (5) special program committees.The other type of organization consists of those designed to promote particular projects or lines of work. Typical of such groups would be: (1) a health and sanitation committee, (2) a cotton improvement committee, (3) a consumers' cooperative, (4) a livestock improvement association.A special file or record book should be set aside'for the keeping of records on the general type of organization. Included in such a file or record book would be the follow- ing information: 1.Name of organization2.Headquarters3.Date of organization4.Names and addresses of officers5.Names and addresses of members6.Places and dates of meetings7.Minutes of meetings8.Special or sub-committees9.Members of special or sub-commi10.Assignments and activities of oomnics. -242 Records of specialized committees or organizations should be kept in the project orlines of work record to which they apply. Project or lines of work recordsOne set of records should be kept for each project or line of work that is includedin the extension program. The records of committees or organizations whose funr.tionsare limited to a specific project or line of wee''_: should be kept under that line of work. Some of the information to be included in project or line of work records area 1.Names of committees2.Members of committees3.Activities of committees4.Names of volunteer local leaders5.Activities of local leaders6.Activities and teaching methods used by agentMeeting and attendanceSpecial events of an educational natureMethod demonstration and attendanceResult demonstration(i)Date established(ii)Name of demonstrator(iii)Detailed description of demonstration including(a) practices, (b) size, (c) location (iv)Meetings at demonstration and attendance(v)Results(vi)Visits or cal7-4DramasOther educational activities7.Accomplishments (Persons families adciAing practices)8.Individual success stories9.Other pertinent information Coo eration with other departments or or izationsA complete record should be kept of all work done by the extension agent in furtheringthe programs of other departments and agencies dealing with rural development. Likewisea record should be kept of all work done by representatives of cooperating departmentsand agencies in furthering the extension program. 243 These records should contain: 1.Name of cooperating department; agency, or organization2.Name of representative or representatives of such departmerts, agencies,or organizations3.Name of project, activity, or line of work4.Work done by extension worker5.Work done by representatives of other groups Daily recordDaily records of work accomplished are very helpful to the extension worker when the time comes to prepare reports. Workers who go about their work for one or two weeksneglecting to poet their daily records, almost invariably find that they have forgottenor overlooked many details. The worker who trains himself to jot down daily record information at the time it happens, or at least once each day usually has the most completerecord and prepares it with the least effort.Below is a suggested guide to the type of information to be included in the daily record 1.Village or community visited2.Time spent in each3.Time spent in office or headquarters4.Nature of work done in each place5.Persons interviewed or visited6.Meetings and attenda;ce7.Any otner information that might be needed at a later date. Report and Record FormsStandard report forms are an essential part of a good reporting system. In the firstplace, the person preparing the report will have much less difficulty including the neededinformation in his statistical report if an adequate form is available. Also the jub-*of summarizing the workers' reports to make an area report and the summarizing of areareports to make regional and national reports are greatly simplified by the use of uniform standard forms.As has been stated earlier, a reporting system must be based on local situation.The same is true of report forms. Report forms which have served excellently in onecountry may not be suitable at all in another.When the reports to be made by the Workere and the information to be contained inthose reports has been determined, suitable folms should be prepared and put into use in the field for a trial period. After the trial period the forma should be carefullystudied in order to be improved and batter adapted to the situation.Several sample report forms are shown at the end of this chapter. While none ofthese may be usable precisely as they ars, they can serve as guides in the preparation of forms to fit the local needy All of the sample forms have been abridged. No attempthas been made to include i.. them all of the items that may be needed. 244 As a rule, all of the practice;,; adopted or all of the improve:.ents mnde would not beincluded in the accomplishments section of the report. The main purpose of this sectionis to record the overall results of extension work and its contribution to nation development.The items included would be those that wou1d best serve as evidence of ruralimprovements resulting from extension work.If extension work is already well established in a country, the accomplishmentssection might not be prepared more than once a year. But where extension is in theearlier stases of development, achievement reports prepared quarterly or even monthly mighthelp to further the work. Record formsJust as reporting can be made easier by the use of forns, the task of keeping recordsu1e lightened and systematized in the same way. Recore7are for the purpose of storinginformation for later use. When it has been determined what informaticn will be needed,forms for the recording of that information should be prepared. 1.Daily record form_Crops are harvested in the field, then transported to the warehouse, wherethey are stored until they are needed. Information for reports is handled ina somewhat similar manner. The extension worker picks up the information heneeds for his reports, then carries it to his files to be stored until he beginsto prepare the reports. A suitable conveyance is needed to carry this informationfrom the field to the office. Many people use their memories for this purposewhich is like carrying crops from the field to the storehouse in ones arms.Much is likely to be lost on the way. Like a basket or cart, the daily recordform carries our information with the minimum of loss.One of the most convenient ways to use the daily record form is to bind anumber of them together in a field book size which can be carried handily bythe ag:At as he goes abut his work. This fteld book of daily record forms willthen serve as a daybook in which all types of information can be entered at thetime it is received. At least once each week the information from the dailyrecord and entered into the report. 2.Demonstration record formsForms can also be prepared to facilitate the keeping of records of bothresult and method demonstrations.Sample forms for keeping records of Result Demonstrations and MethodDemonstrations are shown on the following pages. But many other record formsmight be used. These may serve as guides in preparing forms to simplify recordkeeping. -245 - SAMEJE: DAILY RECORD PORN DATE 19 ------- --i I 1 1Community or Village Time Spent 1Nature of Workt tt 1 t 1 tt t V.,...' \"VImlay,MI.P*111 MEETINGS Place1111.Kind of Meqing___--2----11122gelet-_-------- PERSONAL VISITS OR INTERVIEWS Place Person's Name .111,Subject or line Work NOTES (OTHER INFORMATION NEEDED) - 246 - SAME.'.:RESULT DEMONST'iATIA RECORD FORM Line of WorkName of DomcistratorLocationAddress Practices to be Demonstrated Date EstablishedIf demonstration involves more than one operation, list each operation anddate it was performed below.Operation Date Performed Meetin s at DemonstrationDate Attendance DateAttendance Results NOTE: O of these forms should be used for each Result Demonstration.

Chapter 13.252 -- EXTENSION EVALUATION 2.1 AND INVESTIGATION 2./ Extension has been defined as an educational process with the purpose of bringingabout desirable changes in people's behavior (knowledge, skill and attitude) which willcontribute to better farm and home practices and better family living. The conceptualchanges (thinking or feeling) must precede the technical change (action) and can best bebrought about by education. Extension evaluation is the process of determining the extentto which these desired behavioral changes have been accomplished in ways of thinking, feelingand acting.Evaluation means to appraise carefully, and it not only helps to determinethe effectiveness of a program but also clarifies what is really being done and how it isdone.The extension worker, if properly trained, should be able to judge if the programhas been adequately planned and successfully accomplished, not only as to number of practicesadopted, but also as to their permanence.These benefits are attained in evaluating an educational program:The evaluation process makee it necessary to state clearly the objectivesof the program and to plan carefully.Program effectiveness Evaluation of program progress reveals strengths andweaknesses and accordingly helps to improve the program.Eye opener to the teacher (extension worker) Evaluation provides a criticalview of the on going program, and makes the extension worker aware of any needfor improvement.Public relations Evaluation provides objective evidence and reliable informationto be given to the public on progress and justifies financial support. Extension personnel Through program evaluation, extension personnel gainsatisfaction by knowing the extent of achievement.This encourages increased effort.Even though assessment of programs is by no means a new concept, it is often notplanned as part of a program. There are many reasons or excuses for this, such as lackof trained personnel to supervise evaluation, weak program planning and lack of wellspecified objectives, reluctance to face the responsibility of undertaking evaluation,fear of revealing weakness to the public as well as lack of time, and pressure of routineactivities.But it is perhaps more the lack of understanding of the purposes and methodsof evaluation and the role it plays in an educational program that prevents extensionworkers from using evaluation as an extension tool.

The local extension worker is more concerned with the relatively simple evaluation processes which give him an insight into his workand leaves the more complicated studies to evaluation specialists.Everyday observation involves planned Observation of the daily activities which gives an impression, even if subjective, that can helpfully guide the work. Such information is collected from casual conversation and offhand remarks, farm and home visits, meetings, and individual discussions.Informal studies may involve review and analysis of information obtained from records, annual reports, checklists, questionnaires, census data and the like. Extension workers shoald be trained for this type of evaluation which should form a fairly Objective basis for imaging a program.Formal studies are more scientifically planned and carried out to provide objective information as a basis for assessment of the achievement of objectives or effectiveness of methods used. They may include extensive interviews, questionnaires, compilation of data by different devices and benefit from collaboration with rural sociologists and statistical institutions.Certain basic principles underlie effective evaluation: 1.Evaluation of extension work should be well planned and clearly defined in scope as to what phase of a program is to be evaluated. 2.Ektension personnel themselves should :take part in evaluation.Selfappraisal helps those who carry out a program, and can be usefullycombined with appraisal by an outside person.3.EVeryday evaluation should be continuous and integrated with the programdevelopment process from its planning stage to the end. 4.Reliable and effective devices should be used, and a representative sample chosen according to means available. 5.EValuation should be more concerned with the achievement of behavioral changes than with the number of participants, meetings, hours, items prepared, etc.6.Careful analysis and interpretation of findings should be considered when an evaluation study is being planned. Decide What Aspects of a Project to EValuateSpecify what aspects are to be evaluated and limit evaluation according to means and needs.One or more of the following aspects may be considered for evaluation:Situation analysis Evaluation starts with an investigation of the situation before a program is initiated. Consider the persons involved, general situation and related programs.Analysis of the situation provides a realistic assessment of current problems and a bench mark (baseline) from which to judge accomplishments at the end of a pi-ogram. - 254 - Program planning - Evaluation helps to relate a program to actual conditions, andto 'adjust it to changing needs during its progress. Which groups of people arebeing reached? Why are some groups not interested in the extension activities?Which community organizations are most effective. to work with? How can localleadership be promoted? Which approaches are most useful with different categoriesof people?What readjustments need to be made?Ingram action - What is being accomplished during the course of the program, andwhat adjustments need to be made?Teaching methods - Evaluation serves as a check on teaching methods used. Whichmethod(sY is most effective in a certain situation? Are the methods appropriateand suitable?Results - EValuation determines the extent to which the objectives have been reached.How much of the planned program has been accomplished and how long has it taken?Was the information collected in the beginning sufficient and did it serve as auseful bench mark from which to judge the result? Has the desired change in peoplethat was set out in the program been attained?Extension - Evaluauion helps to appraise the effectiveness oforganization and administration of extension services. Facto ;:s to Consider in Extension EvaluationThere are certain factors involved in evaluation which must he duly considered whenplanning evaluation of a program.Persons involved in evaluation:Evaluation project leader - Evaluation should not be undertaken unless someone istrained in the procedure and can guide the process throughout.Extension personnel - Local extension personnel should be trained in informalevaluation, how to look for evidence of progress or failure, and for reasons whya program is going well or not.Outside resources - Collaborate with sociologists, statisticians, and other expertson formal studies. Avoid outside evaluation in which personnel themselves are notinvolved.Local people - Inform local people about activities, such as interviews that mayinvolve them, and enlist their cooperation.Before an investigation is made find out what other studies can give needed information.Census data, reports and yearbooks are often useful resources.The time factor - Some technical changes require social changes and are a gradualdevelopment.Others can be accomplished only at certain seasons. Desired changes ofbehaviour may not have occured when the program is finished. It is necessary to give areasonable time for the accomplishment.Choice of devices - The device chosen should fit the project to 1-9 evaluated. Thedevices most commonly used are interview-questionnaires, mail-questionnaires, and checklists.Financial implications - Before a study is started determine the financial requirementsto cover the scope of the project, obtaining the required information, tabulation andanalysis of data. 255 Criteria for Evaluatin Ektension Programs Evaluation may be applied to each step used in program development. The major stages in the extension program cycle and their relationship to evaluation are as follows:Program DeterminationSituation analysis (for setting a baseline) Study of conditions involves collection of tho information (fact finding), including social, economic and cultural factors, which is needed for program planning, followed by careful analysis according to certain standards in re:.ation to the situation. The extension worker should ask Are the facts adequate and accurate? For example, if a demonstration is planned on the development of a vegetable garden, one must know the kind of soil available, which vegetables are suitable for planting, etc., before a program is suggested. It is of no use to collect a number of facts if the data cannot be carefully analyzed. Fact finding, therefore, needs to be planned and limited according to available resources for analysis.When analyzing the actual situation, it is also necessary to find out what other programa are being carried out or planned in order to ensure that the extension program fits in with them and does not overlap.Identification of roblemsOn the basis of information collected, identify and analyze the problems. or example, which problems are of concern to people in theregion and therefore come under the responsibility of the extension workers? Are the people (local leaders) involved in setting the objectives and drawing up plans?Determination of objectives Look carefully at the proposed objectives to make sure they are stated and defined in a way that is measurable. Are the objectives based on the needs of the people? Do the objectives clearly define what changes are to be accomplished in relation to people involved? Are the objectives specific enough to serve as a basis for carrying out a specific program? Are the objectives within the limits of available resources and possible to achieve within a set time limit? *Program planDuring the program planning stage, evaluation is used to determine how the shortterm programs fit into the long-term programs, whether the teaching methods are well chosen, and whether the extension staff are well prepared for their teaching duties, or if outside persons need to be called upon.Are the local leaders involved in the program?Progress Appraisal During execution of the program, the extension worker should constantly consider whether the program is going in the right direction, and what measures need to be taken to adjust it.Is the program reaching the objectives? If not, are the objectives not clearly defined, were they too comprehensive for the means available, or has the situation changed so that it is necessary to adjust the original objectives? Were the objectives decided upon in collaboration with the people? Does the plan identify jobs to be done, persons responsible, teaching methods to be used, dates for events and activities? Is the plan being followed? Are the methods that are being used effective and particularly suited to the people, their education and interest? *See *Defining Objectives in Operational Terms\", p. 263. -256 Does the content of the program meet the needs of the people? If not, is theprogram flexible so that it can be adjusted?Is the time limit set attainable?Are the efforts of the extension worker coordinated with those of other agencies? Analysis of AccomplishmentsHas the program reached the main objectives?What kind of changes have taken place, if any:0 In physical situation; for example increased production,improvements of conditions or practices; ii)In people, i.e. changes in behaviour, knowledge, attitudes, skills;and by what means have these changes been brought about?If certain changes in practices, attitudes and skills have taken place are thechanges of a temporary, occasional or more permipent nature?Are desired changes the result of the program or of other factors?Is the cost of bringing about desired changes reasonable/Was the change attained within the time limit set in the objective?What improvements can be considered in planning future program?EVen long personal experience used as basis for planning a program can be misleading.It is more satisfactory to use careful observations and a more scientific method ofappraising progress. Planning and Conducting an Evaluation StudyThese steps are essential in planning an evaluation study: (1) select a problemdemanding investigation; (2) clearly formulate what is to be measured; (3) determinethe kind of information needed; (4) decide how to collect the information; and(5) plan how the information is to be used.The following points will serve as guidelines when planning and conducting evaluationof an educational program. 1.Determine what personnel and financial resources are available and needed formaking an investigation -- what cooperation is needed from outside resources as to personnel and money?what time is required for carrying out a study? 2.Select and define a part of a program to studywhat objectives or content of the extension program are to be evaluated? which phase of this program will be evaluated, i.e. program action,teaching methods, results, etc. - 257 - - will an evaluation of a certain program or aspect of a program be useful for the future?- will it be necessary to collect data for the evaluation or is some information already available from other sources?3.Define and ,,Itcrify the objectives of the study- What evidence is needed to determine that the educational program is reaching its goals in terms of (a) number of accomplishments, or (b) changed behaviour of the people? Which are the most important indicators of changed behaviour? 4.Decide on how to collect information and what devices are needed- what kinds of devices are to be used - questionnaires, observation forms, etc.?- if a questionnaire is to be used, what questions should be asked and how should they be phrased?-set up record forms and prepare instructions for using them,- pre-test devices and revise if necessary.5.Plan tabulation- Type of tabulation methods and tables needed to discover relationships- Persons and equipment needed for the tabulation.6.Determine samples- Define population to be sampled.- Determine what sample is needed and feasible.- Prepare instructions for sampling.7.Prepare for the collection of information.- What persons are available to collect information?- Select interviewers or collectors of information,- Determine what training they need in interviewing, recording, etc.?- Conduct training.8.Collect information in the field- Provide necessary supervision. 9.Edit and tabulate data collected.10,Interpret facts and prepare a report- What are the important findings of the study?- Do different reports mod to be written, e.g. for professional and for lay people? - 258 - 11.Plan for use of the findings- What implications might the findings have for future work? Even the simplest study such as observation of a demonstration needs to be carefullyplanned if the evidence colle ted is to be significant.A first evaluation study shouldbe on a small scale and well defined so that the evaluator does not find himself incapableof carrying it out. However, everyone learns by trial and error. Ramplin$. Collection of Data Tabulation and Analysis of Results If a program to be evaluated involves only a limited number of people or items(population), they can all be included in the investigation, but if the population islarge it is necessary to decide upon a sample or a part of the total number. Populationis the group of items from which a sample is drawn. The population must be defined, andit should be clarified whether it refers to people, crops, animals, etc. To draw a samplemeans to select a small number of items from the total population included in a program.The size of a sample chosen for an investigation should be representative of the totalpopulation, but not larger than time and money allow. A sample should not be alteredonce it has been chosen. If all people or items are to have an equal chance of inclusionin the sample, it is culled a \"random sample.\" The random sample may be of an area(area sampling) or of a group of individuals.The collection of facts can be rather time-consuming, but it is facilitated by carefulpreparation and supervision.Tabulation means the process by which the collected information is organized and factsare grouped.Plar the tabulation to provide totals or summary of each item of informationgathered and to establish relationships among the items which are relevant to the study.Tabulation may be done either by hand or by machine according to facilities available. Interpretation of the tabulated data requires a specially trained person who knowsthe subject and can make an objective and realistic report of the findings. Some methods of collecting information - the choice of methods will depend upon severalfactors:(1) the scope and purpose of the study; (2) the number and characteristics ofrespondents from which the data will be collected; and (3) the resources available in termsof person(s) who will collect the data, level of training and conditions under which he willwork, time available for the study, place where the data will be collected, funds budgetedfor this purpose, and the practicability of various methods in a particular situation. The Methods used Generall Include the Followin Personal Observation - Home economicsand agricultural extension advisors have many oppo t es toe personal observationsthrough seeing and hearing. Observations must be systematically planned, recorded andhave a purpose. The record should show who was observed, what was observed, how manytimes an activity took place, where, and for what purpose.Some advantages of personal observations are that they provide an opportunity forobserving many details and for studying personal reactions, practices acid conditions.Observations may be carried on as regular work is done without very much extra time andeffort.However, there are disatvantages in that the observer makes subjective judge-ments in terms of what he thinks is important, and he may have difficulty in separatingfacts from subjective interpretation. If many observations need to be made which arenot routine work, it can become rather costly. Observations may not be representative ofthe population, and if information is needed on many items this method of collecting isimpractical. - 259 - Checklists - Are often used in order to enable people to make one or more choicesfrom a list of statements regarding a problem or an idea.Usually'a statement of the problem is madfolloweby a list of several possible answers from which a choice may be made. The advantages of checklists are that they are easy to answer, tabulation is easy,they serve as reminders on items which the respondent may not think of, and respondentsare more likely to check p:r, interest than to state an interest in an open ended (or freeresponse) question. Some disadvantages are that they provide for answers which the personwording them considers important, but they may omit important items from the respondent'sown thinking, also the order of arrangement of items in a checklist may influence replies.Rating scales - In rating scales informants are asked to choose, among various degreesof opinion, a feeling or interest about a problem or idea, Descriptive words such as\"good\", \"fair\", \"poor\", and numerical ratings should be defined in terms of characteristicsto be measured. Attitudes, opinions and degrees of interest in a subject are some typesof behaviour chanter that can be checked by the use of rating scales. The advantagesare that they are easy to tabulate and provide an opportunity for people to state a degreeof feeling or opinion which is not provided for in \"yes or no\" questions. On the otherhand it is difficult to choose appropriate words for describing values as people's inter-pretations of words may be different, also people often choose the middle value ratherthan the extremes of \"very good\" and \"excellent\" or \"poor\" and \"of no value.\"Nail questionnaires - have the advantage of being a reasonably inexpensive method ofcollecting information and more people can usually be reached by mail than by personal contact;answers are not influenced by an interviewer if no signature is required, andthe person answering the questions can take more time to think through questions andpossible replies. However, questionnaires are usually more limited in value than personalinterviews.Questions may not be understood as there is no opportunity to explain them,returns are fewer, and follow-up is necessary in order to obtain replies from all to whomquestionnaires are sent. (Obviously, mail questionnaires are impractical where respondentsare illiterate or where mail service is unreliable.) Case studies - There are studies of a limited number of problems or situations whichare valuable for providing concrete information on problems or solutions, and on sequencesof events leading to ptoblem solution. They are useful in tesVing approaches to aspecific type of problem. However, they do not provide information for general conclusionsand require a great deal of time for observing, recording facts and preparing reports.Relatively few cases can be observed and reported. Personal interviews - may be carried out in groups or individually. A study can berendered useless or very valuable according to the way in which the interviewer collects the data. Both group and individual methods of interviewing have their merits and limitations.The individual interview allows the interviowe^ to explain the questions and to keep theinterest of the respondent for a considerable period of time. Reasons for resistancemay be discovered and overcome. The personal contact offers the interviewer opportunitiesto establish friendly relations, observe personal reactions, and to secure fairly complete answers.However, it is rather expensive to locate and contact individualer and an untrained interviewer may be apt to bias replies by suggesting answers.21122 interviews - This means bringing people together in a group and asking them to fill in individuar questionnaires in writing. In this procedure the person collectingthe data explains the questionnaire or record form to the entire group and gives anopportunity for questions to be asked and for clarification of the record form.Eachindividual member of the group then fills in the form. The interviewer is present toprovide further help to understanding the form and to encourage completion of the record.The same explanations regarding the meaning of questions will be received by all grouprsibers. - 260 - There are some limitations to the group interview - respondents may reel less freeto ask questions in the presence of others. There may be a problem of People communicatingwith each other and being influenced accordingly. There is little or 00 opportunity forindividual probing to get more complete replies if the record form incmmdes free resPonsequestions.Extension personnel must have training in the use of the chosen method(s). This isparticularly true in regard to the interview techniques.The interviewer bears an important part of the responsibility for the successfulcompletion of an evaluation. He should:(1) understand the purpose of the :study beingmade and for what reasons information is being collected; (2) be thoronghly familiar withthe questionnaires or record form; (3) be able to locate a prospective respondent, makethe contact and secure his cooperation; (4) get the facts and record them honestly,completely and as objectively as possible; (5) be considerate and honest with the respon-dent;(6) follow questions carefully and not suggest answers; (7) follolt samplinginstructions completely and report any unumual situations; and (8) edit schedules carefully.Once an interviewer is assigned certain prospective respondents, it then becomes hisduty to locate the persons and secure the information. A respondent is; not given upbecause he may not be at home, or is absent for a long period of time, i11, or unavailablefor other reasons. Several calls may be necessary to locate a person Vho is swell fromhome for some reason.Interviewing is best done by people who are interested in the worm and who canmaintain an objective approach. If possible, the local extension wormer should beconsidered for such assignments. The interviewer should be allowed sufficient time inwhich to complete a job when once started.Whatever method is chosen, it should be well understood by those milo are to use it,and persons involved in the collection of -.reformation should be adequate4 trained forthis purpose. Examples of EValuation StudiesEvaluation of the result of a program in terms of physical evidemoeA number of agricultural projects and reorms have been undertaker: ih Italy with thepurpose to improve agricultural productivity and transform an economy of enbsietancefarming into a market economy. In a pilot project undertaken in 1954 VY the ItalianShell Company 1 it was thought that the system of agrarian land reform0 can only atiMulateagricultural productivity if it goes hand in hand with measures for imcfeasing thetechnical knowledge and the initiative of the farmers themselves. The Pl'OjeCt VISS under-taken in a typical peasant community of Northern Italy, Borgo Mortames with the Purposeof demonstrating how a rural area can be improved through technical assistance by theactive participation of the people themselves. The objectives of the ertject were (I) totransform small farmers into competent managers of their farms; and (2) to create achannel of information between farmers and research institutions outside the community. Borgo)ozzano, Technical Assistance in a Rural Community in Italy by L.S VirenelGeographical Publications Ltd., The World Land Use OCOSSiaael Papers, No. 4 -261 In order to assess the project later a bench mark was set by making a detailed surveyof physical, economic and demographic characteristics. The technical assistance project started with the appointment of an agronomist whocollected information in regard to occupation of the active population, use and ownership of the land, number and size of holdings, livestock, as a basis for further activities.The agronomist lived in the community in order to get acquainted with the people and togain their confidence, obtain necessary information and to start simple improvements.Based on the investigations, the problems of the community were divided into two categories:(1) simple problems, i.e. those that could be tackled by the farmer himself and give immediate results; and (2) complex problems, those that needed more time andinvolved outside resources, such as cooperative undertakings.The agronomist helped the farmer to face the problems and work on solutions and when necessary to seek help from outside sources. Two years later a home economist wasemployed to work with the rural women along the same lines especially with practicalaspects such as poultry management where tangible results were more easily obtained.Evaluation of the results of a project like that at Borgo a Mozzano, could dewily be done in respect to physical evidence by comparing the results with the initial study.The main purpose of the project was to show that with the help of technical assistanceagricultural productivity could be increased. When assessing the results it was clearlyevident that the income of the farmers had increased considerably, which is of extremeimportance if any betterment of the living conditions are to be obtained in a community.Without physical evidence the farmers tend to show great resistance toward other changes.The objectives of the project in this respect, i.e. to improve quantity and quality of the agricultural produce, to reduce production and distribution costs, and to introducenew productive activities, were well achieved and shown in figures in the report. Thefinancial result shown after eight years of technical assistance was most encouraging asto increased income, improved products and farm and home practices adopted.No planned evaluation was undertaken in respect to changes in the behaviour of thepeople, such as changes in the skills and attitudes. It is clear however that followingthe shift in agricultural practices the farm families have made a number of changes intheir own behaviour patterns as well as in their attitude toward accepting the innovations that have been introduced. A special study would be needed to show exactly what changeshave taken place and the permanence of such changes. Evaluation in Terms of Chan ed Behaviour of the Peo le i.e. the Ado tion ofNew Farm Practices The studywas undertaken in a rural community of Iowa, (USA) as to the sources ofinformation and the time for adoption of two new farm practices, i.e. the use of a weedspray and an antibiotic feed supplement for hogs. The study was undertaken in 1955 withthe purpose of evaluating the process of adopting new farm practices: (1) the stages inthe adoption process-awareness, interest, trial and adoption; (2) sources of informationused by the farmers at different stages; (3) the rate of adoption over time; (4) theinterrelationships between time of awareness, trial and adoption and the time lag betweenthese stages;and (5) personal, social and economic characteristics of the adoptercategories. George M. Beal and Everett M. Rogers - The adoption of the Farm Practices in aCentral Iowa Community, Special Report No. 26. Ames, Iowa June 1960. - 262 - The findings of the study revealed that certain sources of information are moreimportant at some stages than at others.Mass media is important at the awareness and interest stages, informal sources suchas friends and neighbours are particularly important at the application trial and adoptionstage, with government agencies including the extension service second in importance.Commercial sources take the third and fourth places in importance. A most interestingresult of the study was the importance of informal sources, such as friends and neighbors,in the process of diffusing new technological practices. SummaryEvaluation is a fundamental part of extension programs. Every extension activity.involves a conscious or unconsicus appraisal of progress and effectiveness. Simple butobjective and well organized extension studies, conducted by extension workers incooperation with rural leaders help make the extension program realistic in terms ofpeople's needs, justify the investment of public funds and are educational to those whoparticipate.Steps in making an evaluation study include: J 1.Decide upon the need and use of an evaluation study. 2.Meet with the persons who will be involved to plan the evaluation. 3.Decide upon the inforMation you want from the evaluation. 4.Prepare the forms on which the information will be recorded and pre-testthe record forms. 5.Decide upon the population from whom you want the information and thesampling procedure. 6.Determinewho will collect the information. 7.Train the interviewers to collect the information. 8.Make the interviews. 9.Edit the record forms each night. 10.Analyze the records and organize the data to answer the major questionsof the study. 11.Prepare a report organized around the need for the study and the majorquestions. 12.Act on the findings of the study. 1/ Fred P. Frutchey - How to Make an Evaluation Study - Federal Extension Service,U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. USA. - 263 - Defining Obj Operational Terms 2/All too often, objectives are drafted to tell a good deal or program, but they do not specify the intended outcomes in terms of the They fail to include criteria for determining when the intended outcome /ed.When objectives are clearly defined, participants can evaluate the .088 at any stage of the project or program and can adjust their efforts around relevant activities for accomplishing those objectives.Many words or phrases commonly used in stating objectives are open to a wide range of interpretation. When we use such words, there are endless opportunities for misinterpre- tation.Examples that come quickly to mind include - to know, to understand, to appreciate,to grasp the significance of, to enjoy, to believe.Other words we could use are open to fewer interpretations and, as a result, willcontribute to more precisely stated indicators of behavior. Examples of this categoryinclude - to write, to identify, to differentiate, to solve, to construct, to name, to compare. It is all right to use such words as \"understand\" and \"appreciate\" in stating objectives only if you indicate what the participants in the project or program will be doing when demonstrating their understanding and appreciation. The most importantcharacteristic of a useful objective is that it identifies the kind of performance to be accepted as evidence that participants have achieved.Invariably, when objectives are stated in meaningful and useful terms rather thangeneral terms there will be many objectives for the project or program.The more specificthe level at which you develop your objectives, the more accurately you ban determine theintermediate and ultimate successes of the project or program.Objectives can range from the broad and general - reduce mortality - to the veryspecific - read a health leaflet on initial symptoms of heart malignancies. In a total project or program there is an unlimited universe of objectives and sub-objectives for the many steps or actions. In a well designed project or program these steps and actions willblend into a continuous series of events which, for purposes of evaluation, must besystematized into some hierarchy of objectives and sub-objectives. Each objective willdepend for successful accomplishment on success of the previous objective and, in turn,will exert a preconditioning force on the next and subsequent objectives.The chain of objectives can be subdivided into immediate, intermediate, and ultimate objectives.The first refer to the results of a specific act with which you are concernedmomentarily, such as the formation of an obesity club. Intermediate objectives deal withaccomplishment of specific acts, such as concrete indicators of weight reduction of club members.The ultimate objective is stated in measurable terms relevant to the effectachievement of intermediate objectives has on the health of members in such terms asreduction in the incidence of heart disease.A well written project or program objective should answer three questions: (1) What will the people who have been involved or will be involved be doing or be expected to do? (2) Under what conditions will they be doing it or be able to do it? (3) To what extentare they doing it or are they able or willing to do it? Stated in a single sentence, awell written objective specifies under what conditions and to what extent it is desiredthat a certain participant performance will take place. JJ. Neil Raudabaugh, Director, &tension Research ani. Training DivisionFederal Extension Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. - 264 - Let us consider first the term \"performance\" which means doing. A participant whoperforms something does something. Here are two statements. One is expressed in termsof participant performance. (1) Participants will acquire a good understanding of thestages in the social change process. (2) Participants will be able to name and describeeach of the stages of the social change process model.The second statement tells what participants will be able to do. They w_11 be ableto name and describe the stages of the social change process. The first statement statesthat the participants will end up with a good understanding of the process. What thisreally means is difficult to determine. We cannot tell what it is the participants aresupposed to be able to do as evidence of their new understanding.Now let us consider \"conditions,\" the conditions under which the performance or doingis to take place. Here is our earlier statement of the Objective concerning socialchange:\"Participants will be able to name and describe each of the stages of the socialchange process model.\" This statement does not set forth the conditions under which theperformance is to take place. From this statement we cannot tell whether participantsmust be able to name the stages from memory, in sequence} or in random order. We do notknow whether focus of the description of the stages is to be on the action that takesplace or if it is some other condition that is expecte0 for each. A more definitivestatement of our objective might be: \"Participants wil1,1 be able to name in sequentialorder each of the stages of the social change process nodel, and to describe the actionthat takes place at each stage.\"The next consideration in stating objectives is the matter of extent and level ofperformance.A well written objective will establish an acceptable minimum standard ofachievement.How about this objective? \"Participants will be able to name in sequentialorder the stages of the social change process model, describe the action that takes placein each, and apply the concept of the change model ij1 a current community action project.\"According to this objective, the participant is expected to take part in and apply or makeuse of the concept in a community action or change Project.This establishes a minimumstandard of achievement. The participant is expected to use or apply the model in atleast one ongoing community project.Finally, a well written objective will suggest how its accomplishment can be evaluated.Our objective, as stated above, makes plain how its accomplishment oan be determined.In what community project did the participant take Part; what uses were made of the socialchange process model?If project and program leaders would be this explicit in writing objectives, they .would io much to eliminate one major cause of failure traditional among those whomust carry out projects and programs that of fuzziness in statements of what constitutesproject or program success. Concepts of Evaluation JEvaluation can be defined as the process of determining the value or amount of successin achieving a predetermined objective. This includes the following steps: formulationof the objectives, identification of proper criteria to use in measuring success and inthe determination and explanation.of the degree of a4ccess. The key conceptual elementsin evaluation are \"the value or amount of success\" and \"predetermined objective,\" operational terms are and \"determination andexplanation of the degree of success.\" Thus inherent in evaluation is the process ofassigning value to some objective and then determining the degree of success in attainingthis valued objective. y J. Neil Raudabaugh, Director, Extension Research and Training DivisionFederal Extension Service, U.S. Department of kriculture, Washington, D.C. - 265 - Evaluation is sometimes defined this way - The measurement of desirable and undesirableconsequences of an action that has been taken in order to forward some goal that is valued. Value may be defined as any aspect of a situation, event, or object that is invested with a'preferential interest of being \"good,\" \"bad,\" \"desirable,\" \"undesirable,\" or the like. Values are the principles by which priorities are established.Evaluation should as far as possible be a process whicH satisfies scientific criteria such as -objective, systematic, and comprehensive. Itd be distinguished from allforms of assessment which take the form of one or more judgmentof the success or failure of a project, no matter how sensible and. wiu, thatgement appears to be.Evaluation can be visualized as a circular process, stemming from and returning to the formation of values. Evaluation always starts with some value - for example, it is good to follow management principles in farming; then a goal is formulated from this value.The selection of goals is usually preceded by or concurrent with \"value formation.\" An example of \"goal setting\" would be the statement that more commercial farmers should have a greater net return on their farming operation. As a measure of this goal we might find out how many farmers have what margins of profit or net returns on their farming operations.In identifying the current measure of this goal the indicators to use in determining the attainment of the goal are decided. U.A:t, a goal-directed activity or program is planned. In this case it-is probably decided to have an in-depth management school to bring about understanding and adoption of management principles, partial budgeting, etc. to increase net profits.Now the goal-directed'activity is put into operation - we conduct the in-depth training. Following this we want to find out the effect of the goal-activityor in-depth training - is it contributing to changes in farming operations that will lead to increased net returns. Finally we return to value formation and a resetting of goals or objectives. Evaluation Process.71.Value Formation__ 6. Assessing the Effectof This Goal Operation(Program Evaluation) 5. Putting Goal ActivityInto Operation(Program Operation) 4. Identifying Goal Activity(Program Planning) Figure 13-12.Goal Setting (Objectives) 3.Goal Measuring (Criteria) The above description and circular process of evaluation points up the close inter-relationship between evaluation program planning and program action. Values play a largerole in determining the objectives of public educational and service programs and anyevaluation of the desirable and undesirable consequences of such programs must take social values into account. A great deal of confusion and debate exists in regard to evaluation because of thefailure to recognize that scientific adequacy is a matter of degree. Decisions aboutthe rigorousness of evaluation' must usually be a compromise between scientific requirementsand administrative needs and resources. A program or activity may be evaluated on thebasis of one or more levels or types of measurement based on different value systems.At the first level, we have the evaluation whioh a reoipient group plaoes on ea activityaccording to its own personal objectives and value system. This represents the individualor group's estimate of the success or failure of a program in whioh he is taking part. -266- At the second level, the evaluation could be,the appraised worth of an activity as givenby a group of \"experts\" or informed appraisers, usually on the basis of reasonableexamination and comparison with prior determined standards or criteria. At the thirdlevel, we come to the scientific measurement )f effectiveness made in terms of acceptablestandardized procedures. This level would adhere to the rules of scientific methodologyand utilize instruments of determined reliability and validity. Investigation in Extension 1./Extension work is of a dynamic r in all phases of extension workaffecting conditions and ways of life pitweir local commimities are occurringevery day.This changing situation deserves full comprehension and understanding aswell as thorough knowledge about how to adapt the changes to the local situations. Newmethods of approaching the important problems arising from those changes need to be found,studied and used. An organization such as the Extension Service, needs to be fullyequipped with the knowledge of the scientific process applicable to the study of thenature of such changes as well as the extent to which these are affecting the extensioneducational process.There are several important areas in the extension field of work that require frequentstudy and evaluation on the part of the extension worker himself. Basic information suchas the following concerning his community of work and its people is very essential. 1.History of his area of work 2.The economic situation 3.The resources available and their use 4.The social evolution of the community - cultural background 5.Basic knowledge of Rural Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology: - understand people and their behaviour- factors responsible for the acceleration or inhibition in the adoption ofimproved practices and the production of favorable changes in knowledge,skills, and attitudes- methods and means to be used to accelerate the production of favorable changes - means of communication to use most effectively to accelerate the productionof favorable changes 6.Evaluation techniques - how and when to evaluate to find out if objectivesare being accomplished 7.The proper kind of language and communication techniques to use in the conduotof the extension teaching.There should be some kind of specialized personnel in an extension organizationcapable and fully equipped with the scientific knowledge of the techniques of theinvestigation process applicable to the study of the social sciences, with the responsibility J Fernando del Rio, Extension Education Specialist, Inter-American Institute ofAgricultural Sciences. Turrialba, Costa Rica. - L. of training all extension personnel on how to conduct periodic studies and investigationsthat will give the necessary light as to the new methods and new approaches to be used tohelp people in the solution of their daily problems. This specialized personnel shouldalso have the responsibility for conducting otudies and investigations in some areas ofa more complex nature that might warrant special skills.Before starting his teaching job with satisfactory results, the extension worker hasto know well the people he is working with, their wants and needs, in order that he canmake use of the proper ways and means of approach. Different situations require the use of different methods. Under certain conditions the demonstration would be the mosteffective method to be used in bringing out favorable changes in people. In several otherinstances the personal contact method, although expensive And time consuming, would probablybe the most effective method with certain kinds and levels of people. Many times anextension service cannot afford to depend on this expensive method of individual approach.Group approach would be then the most advisable way of conducting the extension work fromthe economic and time element points of view. Thus, there is a need of studying andinvestigating what combination of methods would bring the best results in the teachingjob under different situations and with different kinds of people.No matter how well technically equipped an extension worker is, he will not be ableto achieve the degree of success desired in terms of improving the wellbeing of his people,if he has not given of his time and effort to investigate and learn about his communityof work and the people. The study of his community of work and his people will not onlyprovide him with the knowledge and understanding so much necessary for his success, but willalso give him a feeling of confidence and faith in what he is doing that contributes somuch to his personal satisfaction and to the degree of efficiency with which he carries on his work.The continued effectiveness of an educational organization such as the Extension Service will depend on: 1.Its program of work and the process through which it is examined periodicallyin an objective and scientific way. 2.The willingness and disposition of respcnsible persons in the organization toeffect the changes brought out from that examination process. 3.The quality of its personnel and the scientific approach that this personnelis able and willing to give to the different program activities.This process shall necessarily require much thinking and planning and _concertedefforts from various persons in the organization.To ensure the effectiveness of the organization there needs to exist close relationship between the resources and objectives and the complexity of the changes that takeplace.Several steps have been taken to analyze the scope of activities of extensionwork.Efforts have been made by a number of committees and outstanding leaders to identifythe most important areas with emphasis to show the value that a scientific examination ofthis kind would have in helping people to improve their general living conditions.However, the truth is that the investigation work done in extension concerning the development of the different program activities has been very limited. Much remains to be done to: 1.Identify the process through which programs in extension are developed. 2.Identify areas that warrant research. 3.Determine the proper kind of research that would provide the kind of evidencenecessary to strengthen and improve the extension program. - 268 - The primary responsibility of extension work is to develop an educational programthat would bring desirable changes in the people. The success of this effort will dependon the quality of the program and of the personnel involved in its development. Theconcept of developing the program includes formulating, implementing and evaluating theprogram.The process is the framework within which all activities and efforts in extensionshould be organized in close relationship with the obejctives of the organization. In linewith this thinking the process may be divided into the following eight major phases: 1.Pormulation of the basis and framework for the extension program. 2.Adapting this framework to the existing situation. 3.Organizing the resources necessary for the program planning function. 4.Planning the program on basis of studies conducted. 5.Writing the program statement. 6.Developing the plan of work. 7.Implementing the plan of work. 8.EValuating the program activities and accomplishments.Within each one of these phases there exists a number of problems involved in theprogram process that warrant study and investigation in line with the philosophy, object-ives, policies and purpose of the organization. This program process is of a dynamicnature subject to continued changes and adjustments. Thorough study and investigationof these and other relevant problems will need to be conducted at different occasions toobtain objective information that can be used as a basis for strengthening and improvingthe program process.In conclusion, the fundamental purpose and objective of extension work is to developan educational program aimed at bringing about desirable changes in knowledge, skills andattitudes of people. The degree of success obtained will be determined by the quality ofthe program and of the personnel and resources involved in its development and implement-ation.The major challenge which extension workers have been confronting is that of theproper identification of the most effective and efficient methods to be used in the programprocess.Up to now, this identification process has been limited to a few observationsand experiences based on very little study, investigation and analysis of the variousphases involved in extension work. There is need for developing a systematic plan forinvestigation work on the extension program process. This will require giving attentionto the educational objectives of the organization besides a well defined plan for thetraining of the extension staff and the proper use and coordination of all necessaryresourc:$s.It is very necessary that major areas and problems in the program process beproperly identified for the purpose of a thorough study and investigation process. Chapter 14.- 269 - PERSONNEL TRAINING AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT \"Eoonomic and social growth among village rople -in any nation depends on theability to build an adequate staff of properly trained professional people to manage the rural development enterprise.\" 1/ Shortage of adequately trained personnel limits theeffectiveness of extension services in many countries. This is true at all levels:field extension workers, supervisors, subject matter specialists and regional and national administrators. 'Other rural development institutions and services face the same problem.Their personnel require many of the same basic qualification as extension workers. Thus extensionservices must compete for personnel trained in agriculture and home economics.The nature of extension education, like any profession, calls for special knowledge, skills, understanding and attitudes. Knowledge of technical subject matter in agricultureand home economics; practical skill in applying technology in farming and living, skillin teaching earners and villagers; an understanding of the human relationships in societyin which teaching is carried an, of the people, their customs, values and attitudes toward change;and a belief in the ability of rural people to develop and carry out programs for their own benefit. All extension workers require special knowledge or competence in a number of broad areas.While each employee has special training needs according to his own job requirements,knowledge and understanding is needed by all in the following areas:Technical subject matter in agriculture and home economics is the chief commodity extension has to offer people. There is no substitute for sound technical training. AsPaul Leagans 2./ says uto undertake to teach what one does not know is to invite failure from the start.\" An extension worker must have thorough basic knowledge of technicalinformation appropriate to his job and must keep abreast of current material. To do this he must know reliable souroes of information. Furthermore, he must understand how subjectmatter relates to problems of farming and living. Extension Service Organisation and Operation - every extension worker needs to knowthe abjectives of the service, understand its organization, be familiar with its policiesand understand office management, business procedures, personnel responsibilities andqualifications at all levels. Human Development - He requires understanding of human development processes, behaviorpatterns, group dynamics, group interactions and skills in huMan relations. His successdepends to a large extent upon the relationships he develops and maintains with farmersand villagers, local leaders, his colleagues in the extension service and with officials of other agencies and services. .11J.

Allextension personnel must understand the processes involved in order to make their respectivecontributions. The Educational Process involves the principles of learning, the learning procenn, howto motivate people and the methods and techniques of teaching. 40tila *MOM - To work effectively with his people an extension worker needs to under-stand basic owned organization including reference groups (family, church, oommunity, powerstructures, how to identify local culturelsocial, economic etc), how to identify and developleaders, group and sooial action processes. Communication - The ability to communicate effeotiveely canine developed and improved.It in;;MiiiZarng, writing, counseling, demonstrating and the use of group and massmethods. Research and Evaluation - &tension personnel need to be able to measure the effective-ness of programs and the methods used, to understand the experimental approach and to assistpeople in evaluating their own efforts.In addition to general training for all staff members', special instruction is neededfor each segment of the extension staff. Each must understand his specific role and thespecific subjeot matter involved. He must develop special job related skills. The following groups need the special types of train ing indicated: 1/ 1.For specialists- Role of the speoialist;- Intensive training in the abject matter speoiality;- The speoialist's funotion in extension program building;- Effective techniques in extension teaching;- Working relationships with other staff members; and- Bow to analyze and interpret eoonomic and social data. 2.For supervisors- Role Of thesupervisor;- Broad training in teohnioal agriculture, home eoonomics, and in theirapplication to current rural problems;- Public relations; &tension Development Around the World - Federal Ekteam:kon Service, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture and Agenoy if International Developme04; U.S. State Department. - 271 - - Personnel selection, interviewing, counseling;- Job analysis;Personnel management, evaluation, and training; andPxo,Kram development and supervision. 3.For local extension workers- Teennimg in applied agricultural and home economics science ata ire.' high enough to merit the confidence of looal people; and-Skt.IL4L in demonstrating improved farm and home practices. 4.For administrators at all levels- Role of the administrator;- Principles of coordination and dircotion; and- Personnel management and development. 5.For secnotarial and \u00b0lexical workers- ]Ming the public and giving out information;- Ofhousekeeping;and- Records, reports, and filing. Most extension personnel enter the extension service at the local level.

ThisAixperience gives them first hand knowledge and under-standing of problems faced by Dumas and villagers in changing their methods of farmingand living, harm teohnology may be applied under varying conditions and most important anappreciationofflrthe vital role of human relations in extension work. For these reasonswe will emphamOee the training of local extension workers with appropriate reference tothe trainingoCtother categories of extension personnel.Four bromicoategories of extension training are generally recognized. These area(1) pre-servico4 (2) induction, (3) in-eervioe and (4) graduate or sometimes calledpromotional tnedning. Pre-Servioe TrekeingPro-servinm training refers to the professional training received prior to appointmentto the extensioa service. This includes a diploma in agriculture or baohelor of sciencedegree in agriculture or home economics in the more economically advanced countries.Graduates at is level are not available in sufficient numbers in most newly developingoountriea and lenzteoeion services most employ graduates of secondary vocational sohools.The latter mount hove the breadth or depth'of training obtainable in college or university.But in any oalem:tt; is essential that the local extension worker be better trained thanthe farm or village people with whom he works. What he lacks in pre-service academictraining :must be made up to tbe extent possible in induction and in-servioe training. We shall discuss the curriculum for training of prospective extension workers to theattainment of a bachelor of science degree under the assumption that training institutionsin most countries have this as their goal. Bachelor of Science Et e in Agriculture or Home Economics .Local agricultural extension workers require professional training in two generalareas:(1) agricultural science and the technology appropriate to the agriculture ofthe area, and (2) the social sciences. Home economics extension workers require similartraining in the social sciences and basic natural sciences with courses in human nutrition,food preparation, textiles and domestic arts substituted for some agricultural productioncourses;not forgetting that women are very much involved in agricultural production;especially gardening, poultry and small animal husbandry in many countries.The agricultural extension worker requires general training in the physical andnatural sciences, i.e. physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, bacteriology, entomologyas a foundation for such applied sciences as agronomy, horticulture, animal husbandry andagricultural engineering. In addition he requires a certain amount of concentration inthe study of crops and enterprises in the area.The method of teaching is as important as content. Too often subject matter teachingconsists of dull memorizing of generalities and unrelated scientific facts. A centralfunction of extension workers is the application of scientific knowledge in solving problemsof agriculture production and rural living. Problem solving through the application ofscientific information should be an integral part of the teaching in agriculture and homeeconomics.In almost all agricultural faculties in the past, the social science area has not beengiven muoh attention. The'emphasis has been on training in agricultural science andtechnology.Only in recent years has there grown an awareness and interest in the socialaoienoes.Di Franco J suggests five areas of study in the social sciences of value to studentsplanning careers in extension. These include: 1.Fundamentals of education 2.Rural sooiology 3.Educational psychology 4.Cultural anthropology 5.Agricultural economics Introductory courses in each of those areas can greatly improve the efficiency ofextension 'workers in conducting educational programs. \"Agricultural teohnology isimportant but it is only a part of the total picxurs. Of equal importance is how to putthis knowledge to work. This calls for trained awicultural leaders who know modernagriculture, their country environment, their people, their relationships and how to plan,execute, administer and involve the total resourceu of materials and people to get thejob done.The sooner trained talent in sufficient members can be provided, the sooner Joe Di FrancoAgricultural &tension Specialist. FAO Rome, Italy. - 273 - can progress be achieved. In fact, until this is done, very few real benefits can be expected from extension services or from developmental programs and'institutions.\"Basic training in agricultural economics is assuming increasing importance for extension workers throughout the world. Agriculture is becoming more and more specialised; modern farming requires constantly increasing investment of resources;efficient marketing is as important as efficient production; and skillful management may mean the difference between success and failure. Training in money management and the wise use of credit is becoming an essential feature of extension education.Ability to eommunicate effectively is essential to success in most professions and particularly so in extension education. Courses in spoken and written communication are essential elements in the preparation of prospective extension workers at whatever level training is given.Opinions differ as to the time and place for specific training in extension organi- sation and methods. The need for such training is not questioned. Some colleges and universities include such courses in their undergraduate programs while others postpone such training to the induction period and continue it in in-service training. In the United States in particular, less emphasis is presently given to training in extension methods and more emphasis tofundamental training in the social sciences. Many extension administrators feel they can provide better training with more direct application as induction and in-service training. A further advantage is that participants inin-service training include only employees of the extension service having a genuine interest in the subject, rather than a large proportion of students planning other careers and having only academic interest in extension education.In many countries however, students may already be committed to extension careersand are definitely interested in praotioal aspects of extension education. Sub - Collegiate Training in Agricultural_RstensionYIn many developing countries the extension service draws a substantial number of personnel from among the graduates of secondary agricultural school's and institutes of lower than college or university level. This is because they do not as yet have a largeenough number of men with bachelor of science degrees in agriculture to fill the extension posts.Another factor is that in many developing countries a preponderant number ofstudents in agricultural colleges and universities come from towns and cities and havenever done any practical work on farms. Thus, they lack the intuitive understanding whichmen who'grew up working on a farm have regarding cropping practices and the handling ofanimals.This is very important for extension agents who try to teach farmers improvedfarming methods. Xany urban youths tend to look down on farmers as ignorant peasantsand thus are often unable to establish friendly relations with working farmers on a planeof equals.Furthermore, young men reared in towns and cities are reluctant to live invillages and want desk jobs in government offices.For these reasons it has been found that at the present stage of rural development inmany countries, young men who grew up in villages and completed an agricultural course atthe sub - collegiate level, often prove to be more effective extension workers in stimulatingfarmers to put improved production practices into use. As the educational level of themajority of farmers rises and more young men with farm background graduate from the agri-cultural oolleges and universities, possession of the badhelor of science degree in agri-aulture will doubtless become a requirement for employment as an extension farm or homeadvisor as it now is inAmerica, &trope, and a number of developing oountriee.

Thus, thesoientifio basis for modern advanced production practices in growing craps, fruits, animals,and poultry has to be much simplified or omitted from the subject nee\" taught in thesecondary level.Very fair sub-collegiate agricultural schools include in their program of instriactionthe agrioultural social sciences of agricultural economics (including farm management andmarketing of farm products), rural sociology, and extension methods sod education. SinceWorld War II, a growing number of these schools have added a course in extension, or areincluding the subject in other courses. They ineludetEastern Caribbean Farm Institute, TrinidadMoots Plantation School of Agriculture, Ibadan, NigeriaZest Pakistan Academy for Village Development, ComillaExtension Training Centers for Village Workers in India-Ambo and Jimma Agricultural Sohools, Ethiopia In Ethiopia, the extension service employs graduates of the Ambo and aril% Agricultural'Schools as local level extension agents. Men graduating from the /109ftial Agriculturaland Mechanioal College at Alemaiya are engaged for the posts of extension specialists inthe various lines of production such as field crops, animal productio0, poultry production,and as extension training specialist. The college graduates are given a period of inductionexperience as assistant agents with a successful experienced agent to at at the grassroots how extension work is done with farmers who mostly lack formal ()gaoling. Thespecialists who demonstrate promise in their work for a few years are sent abroad fortraining at the master of science degree level to up-grade their knoWlekge and skills.In Egypt, graduates of secondary agricultural schools are hired for posts of assistantextension agent whereas graduates of the faculties of agriculture of the three universitiesgo into the posts of extension agent. An agent is in charge of the extension program ina markas or county in which there may be 50,000 farmers living in up t\u00b0 50 villages.Extension headquarters in a markaz are in a government agricultural center. The assistantagent is in charge of the demonstration fields, growing of plants for Bale to favors atlow prices, care of the stallion, jack, and bull for up- breeding the POMersi animals,and supervision of the demonstration flocks of chickens and the rabbit cages. The extensionagent is responsible for the extension program cf activities with feelers throughout themarkaz.In the 1950s the Egyptian extension service assigned a few of it() agents to the postsof production specialists to assist local agents to develop extension Programs in variouscrops aud kinds of livestock. Most local agents did not call upon tOase specialists toassist them because they knew that the specialists had the same bachsPr of science degreeas the agent S and thus had no greater knowledge. The Specialist portta were later abolishedand experienced specialists of other department, of the Ministry utiliOai. Extension TrainingaInters- 1, When a nation starts an the path of expanding farm production, 08 bomber of 41Z-tensionadvisors required is far greater than the existing agricultural schools, colleges, anduniversities can turn out annually. Besides, their graduates have i0POrtant and oftenGordon H. Ward - Professor of Agricultural Economics, Faculty of AiDioultOral Sciences,American University of Beirut, Lebanon. - 275 - vital roles to play in other aspects of agricultural development. Research stationsrequire more trained personnel to work out the new practices, more productive plants,animals and chickens which the extension service teaches farmers how to use on their farms.Thus, new institutions are urgently required to train young men and women with medium leveleducation in the improved production practices developed by the research stations and inextension methods for teaching these practices in ways that stimulate farmers to put them to use on their farms. To meet this urgent need for trained extension workers, India,Pakistan, and some other developing countries have established extension training centersto prepare village level workers in a two year course.A conference of principals of Indian extension training centers made the followingrecommendations regarding the program of these centers: 1.Period of training in all states should be one year basicagricultural training, followed by six months extension training. 2.Training should he more realistic and emphasis should be givento the following:- Methods and techniques for proper approach.- How to conduct a village survey.- How to analyse problems and establish local work priorities.- How to plan a family and village program.- How to understand essential elements of village social organizationssuch as village panchayate, village leadership., and village functions.- How to develop the spirit of service. Morning prayer may includeinspirational talks or readings selected for this purpose.- How to build up general knowledge. To provide for this, an informationroom should be sat up in each center with charts and maps of India andof the state concerned, and other information material; and competitionsshould be held among the trainees.- How to plan, prepare for and use various extension methods and media.How to evaluate a village program.- How to use the services of the technical staff.- Use methods to solve problems as a chief feature of training andteaching methods that help to develop the trainee's ability to think.3.Practical work at the training centers should be more job-related andproblem - oriented.4.Group discussion is recommended as the main method along with leotures.5.Prinoipals of training centers and other staff Should be allowed to visitprojects and to meet the trained village level workers eo they can evaluatethe training and know what problems the village worker faces.6.Each training center should select one village for intensive overalldevelopment and beautification. 1 -276- Training women as village level workers:There is a need for more women workers to conduct home economic activities with villagefamilies.Home science wings should be added to as many training centers as possible totrain women in the following:- Home crafts - clothing construction, knitting, and needlework.- Nutrition - food preparation and preservation.- Maternity care and child welfare.- Home improvement and sanitation.- Kitchen vegetable and fruit gardening.- Family budgeting- Family planning- Poultry and duck raising- Youth activitiesFirst aid and household nursing- Prevention of disease The curriculum for a two year course for training local level extension workers insuch a center includes both theory and practice, courses in both production practices andextension teaching methods.

For every 10-15 ofthese village-level workers, there is a better trained extension worker at the block orunion level who supervises and guides their work. This supervisor helps the agents inhis area with their problems and supplies the knowledge and skills needed to supplementthat of the village extension personnel. Induction inTrai.11Induction training is the training given new extension personnel after they have beenemployed and before they are assigned to work in a particular area, usually as an assistantagent or advisor. When an extension service is first established in a country, the entirestaff from director and deputy director, administrators and national level specialists,down through the area supervisors to the local level personnel, all need special trainingto prepare them for their particular jobs and to give them understanding of what agricul-tural extension is, its prinoiples, objectives and philosophy, and methods of teachingfarm people the improved practices recommended by the extension service.Induction trainingfor all new extension personnel should develop an attitude of personal dedication to theservice of rural people. This kind of training is to supplement whatever pre-servicetraining the new personnel may have had.Adequate and effective induction training of new extension personnel should: 1.Help the new worker to know the history, objectives, scope andphilosophy of his country's extension service. 2.Acquaint him with the extension organization he has just joined, itspolicies and procedures. 3.Help him to understand what his responsibilities are to the extensionorganization and the advantages of extension as a profession. 4.Help him to understand well the kind of moral conduct and behaviorthat is expected. 5.Help him to understand the rules and regulations that apply to his job. 6.Help him to know the job he is expected to do and how he should do it,Train him in teaohing methods and subject matter that apply to his work. 7.Train the worker in practical agricultural skills required in his work,not provided through previous training and experience. 8.Help him to know and understand the problems of the people in the area. VGordon H. Ward - Professor of Agricultural Economics, Faculty of AgriculturalSciences, American University of Beirut, Lebanon. - 279 - 9.Help him to understand the working conditions in the extension serviceand how to make the best of them. 10.Help him to develop a wholesome attitude toward public service. Induction training 113 frequently divided into three parts: 10Classroom instruction regarding the organization structure of the extensionservice, operation procedures and reports, subject matter regarding farmproduction and home economics, and the various extension methods appropriatefor teaching different kinds of subject matter and related skills. 2.Observation of work in progress at government research stations and farms, theact vities carried on by successful local farm and home advisors, demonstrationsand field days. 3.Supervised field training in which each trainee is assigned for apprenticework with a successful advisor to work for six months to a year to learn thevarious extension activities and teaching methods by doing them under guidanceand supervision. Classroom instruction needs to be combined with observation of how the extensionmethods being taught are actually applied in extension work in nearby farming areas andhow the knowledge being acquired is used. The trainees learn how to apply the knowledgethey acquired during the two to six weeks induction training and work six months or ayear as apprentices or assistants under the guidance of a skilled extension agent at thelocal level.Each trainee performs all the various jobs involved in agriculturalextension work. When his trainer is satisfied that he can perform as an assistant farmadvisor on his own initiative with minimum direction by a senior advisor, the man is assignedto an assistant advisor post in another area,.The nature and extent of induction training required to prepare new personnel to carryout duties of an assistant extension farm or home advisor satisfactorily depends upon thekind and amount of pre-service training the individuals may have had. If the new staffmembers have graduated from an agricultural college or university in agronomy, animalhusbandry, or another of the fields of agricultural production, or from the general agri-culture curriculum, they may need little or no instruction regarding production matters.Unless the institution from which they graduated was one of the relatively few that havecourses in extension teaching methods, these subjects should make up the major part of theinduotion training course. This is the situation in Ethiopia, Lebanon, and Jordan wherethe great majority of the local level farm advisors are employed following graduation fromsecondary level agricultural schools. King Eusein Agricultural College in Jordan hasrecently inaugurated a semester course in agricultural extension at the junior collegelevel.Some of the secondary agricultural schools in Egypt now have a series of lectureson extension work by officials of the extension service as part of their pre-servicetraining.This material is reviewed and supplemented with additional material and topicsin the induction oourse of training.The curriculum for the six weeks induction training course given in the extensiontraining oenter oonducted by the Jordan Agricultural Extension Service illustrates thenature and soope of suoh training programs. - 28o - Jordan Agricultural &tension Training CenterCurriculum for Six Weeks Induction Training CourseFor New PersonnelSubjects Studied of subjectsAgronomy 2Farm machinery 2 objeotives, philosophy, organization,program planning, teaching methods, evaluation 40Audio visual aids 18Extension youth clubs 5Recreation for youth club members 5 EducationAdult education 5Health education 8Rational education 6 Supporting subjectsAgricultural industries 14Library science 3Reports 2Total periods in classroom courses 124Field work and practice under supervision 10 days Relatively little time is devoted to farm production subjects because the men haveat least three years of study of these subjects in the secondary agricultural school.The main job of the training center is to give the new agents training in effeotive methodsof teaching the subject matter they learned in the agricultural school.As they progressin their work as assistant extension agents in an assigned territory, they will haverefresher (souring of a few days, a week or longer to up-date their knowledge and skills invarious lines of farm production. In-Service TrainingBroadly speaking, in-service training includes all forms of training for professional extension personnel during their period of employment by the extension service. It may involve both on -the -job training and training while away from the job on educational leave. There are numerous forms of on-the-job training whereas most educational leave is spent atan institution of higher learning in post-graduate study which leads in due course to a diploma or an advanced degree. However, extension personnel who do not have their bachelor of science degree are not eligible for a post-graduate degree. They may work fora bachelor of science degree, take diploma courses in various aspects of extension work, or study in various refresher and summer school courses.Of the numerous forms of this kind of training only the more important will be discussed. Annual Staff ConferenceThe extension service in most states of the United States holds an annual conference of all the professional staff members. Some of these conferences continue for an entire work week.In other states they begin Tuesday morning and end Friday afternoon or evening to allow the local personnel time for travel from and to their posts. Generally, the conference is held at the state university where the director and administrative staff have their offices. This permits using members of the teaching staff of the university as speakers.The program for such conferences generally has four parts. The first consists of discussion of administrative matters and policy questions which the administrators believeare preferable to present to the staff in person in order to avoid misunderstandings andto permit questions to clarify any points that may not be clear. The second aspect aims to inspire the men and women taking part in the extension programs and to give them a broader vision of the importance of their work. They return to their posts with renewed zeal and belief in themselves, farm people, the program in which they are working, and democratic acticni in rural oommunitiea.A third emphasis deals with subjects related to more effective extension teaching.In addition to considering improvements in well established methods, speakers discussvarious subjects which will help extension workers to understand and motivate people. They may present the findings of a recent research study in rural sociology which willgive extension greater appeal and usefulness to farmers and their families. A professor of peyohology may present ways of attracting more farm people to participate actively in the local extension program. &tension personnel may need instruction in the specialtechniques of radio and television communication.The conference program usually includes training in the latest rural developmentssuch as cooperatives, rural electrification and telephone service projects which oonoern farm women as well as farm men. Men agents and women agents hold separate sessions forcertain subjects, suoh as animal and crop production, farm management, home improvement,nutrition and foods, child care, and clothing. The extension specialists and researchpersonnel in these various subject areas usually present the topics of these sessions.There is not enough time during an annual conference covering so many and so varied' subjects for thorough study of subject matter. Consequently, only new developments are explained briefly. Teohnioal subjects are dealt with in more detail in training sessions held in the areas where the topics are of greatest importance in the extension program. 1/ Gordon H. Ward Professor of Agricultural goonomics, Faculty of AgriculturalSciences, American University of Beirut, Lebanon. - 282 - Local Area Training SessionsThis term is used to cover any kind of training of local level personnel lasting fromhalf day to a week and conducted within an area where the particular subject matter isapplicable.A half day training conference may be held in a livestock producing areawhen a new government regulation is to go into effect regarding testing milk cattle forcontagious abortion. The agricultural extansion workers in the territory around a centralmarket town to which travel for them is convenient are called to a meeting in that town.The government veterinary officer is on hand to explain the regulation, what is to bedone, why it has to be done, how the regulation will be carried out, and the educationalrole to be played by the local extension personnel. The district extension supervisorstresses what the agents are expected to do in the program. The livestock extensionspecialist explains ways of teaching farmers about the teat, and how to use the test tobuild up a disease-free herd. Short CoursesAs the name indicates, the period of time extends through one or two weeks, whereas,refresher courses continue for a month or longer. Generally, short courses and refreshercourses are given on the campus of an educational institution, such as a secondary agri-cultural school, an agricultural institute, an agricultural college, or an extensiontraining center. The distinguishing feature of a short course is that it concentratesintensively upon one subject and important supporting topics. It may deal with milkproduction and cover housing, breeding, feeding, controlling common disease, and themanagement of animals and the dairy enterprise. In addition to the extension dairyspecialist, other specialists from the research station present the findir,1 from studiesof various aspects of the production of milk. Suggestions are offered regarding howfarm advisors can use the information gained in the short course for teaching farmersimproved practices in producing milk. Refresher CoursesRefresher courses usually extend for four to six weeks and cover the supportingsubjects as well as the main theme such as broiler production, or a broader subject suchas extension education methods.The curriculum or program of study for a six-week refresher course given to districtagricultural assistants in Sarawak in the spring of 1962 illustrates this type of in-servicetraining.The course included both technical and extension subjects grouped as follows: 1.Technical sub'ects - rubber, pepper, riot', fruit tree management, inlandf e eeel pest control, land tenure, and home eoonomios. 2.Extension subjects - personal contacts, programs, records and reports,photography, operation of projeotors, drawing and composition of visual aids,country dancing and party games.The 11 agricultural assistants selected to attend the course were chosen from amongthe superior performing assistants who had:- Adequate practical experienoe in the field.- Skill in human relations with his colleagues and the public.- Intelligenoe to learn new ideas and to think.- Ability to handle an increasing measure of responsibility for the leadership,advising, and supervision of junior personnel, and maintaining proper two -waycoamunication between them and the agricultural officer. - 283 - The coarse was divided into three main parts as follows:Part 1.Orientation in extension education, 24 to 30 April,Extension Training Center, Tarat.Instruction was given in the principles and methods of agriculturaleducation.After brief orientation and motivation, the basicextension course normally given to junior agricultural assistants andhome demonstrators was condensed into a highly intensive week of theoryand methods.Part 2.Field practice, 1 - 19 MayDoing the work of a junior agricultural assistant in extension inLive hereto unworked village communities in tetle of two or three.Each team was visited twice for consultation and advice duringthis period.Part 3.a. Review of field practice, 21 .- 26 May, Extension Training Center, Tarat.A guided review of the three weeks practical experience was followedby a study of the duties of a district agricultural assistant andinstruction in his extension responsibilities, including practicalsupervision and leadership of extension teams in the field.Part 3.b. Winding up training, 28 May - 1 June, Sarawak Civil ServiceTraining Center. Kuching.Instruction was given in supervision, public relations, and infiles and filing. The agricultural assistant's evaluation of the course showed that the phasing ofinstruction and practice, first in the extension job and secondly in the job of supervisingextension, was about right for officers of their experience. The three-week assignmentat village level was a valuable and, on the whole, enjoyable experience and a necessarypreliminary to the supervision of workers at village level. 'raining CoursesEttension services in various parts of the world arrange and conduot in-servicetraining oourses according to the needs of their personnel. In New York State in theUnited States for example, the extension service engages young men and women who haverecently graduated from the college of agriculture and the college of home economics. Few if ary have studied formal oourses in agricultural extension methods. After a briefperiod of two weeks of induction training dealing mainly with explanations regarding theorganization and funotioning of the extension service and how they are expected to work as -assistant agents in training, they are sent to their posts for apprentioe training for six months to a year. One of the requirements for new agricultural agents is that during each of the first three years on the extension service staff, they will spend three weeks eachsummer studying extension methods and the subject matter regarding farm produotion, farmmanagement, and other 'nib:Acts important in the area where they are serving.They learnto see clearly the connection between what they are learning in the classroom and theproblems that farmers and homemakers have been bringing to theth in their daily work.This makes them take more interest in the training and delve more deeply into the subjectmatter they are studying.In oountries in the process of building up the extension service it is often necessary to employ as farm and home advisors young men and women from the villages. The formal eduoation of such persons may not have gone beyond elementary school. They are startedon their village assignments in extension work after a two to four-week period of induction - 284 - training.This covers mainly the principal extension methods to be used in the villagesto which they are assigned. They need additional training in both scientific agricultureand home economics in addition to extension methods.The curriculum for such an in-service training course developed by Mr. Gray andMiss Loraine Stevens, US/AID extension advisors in Jordan and Professor Gordon Ward ofthe Faculty of Agricultural Sciences of the American University of Beirut to be taughtat the AUB Farm illustrates the extent of the subjects to be included in this type ofin-service training project. It was planned to have the course open to local levelextension workers from Arabic speaking countries with most of the instruction in thatlanguage.At the time the training course was planned no comparable training was beinggiven in the region.

Participants and staff live together at a selected location for one, two, or more weeks. Its distinctive feature is that each participant brings with him a personal professional problem upon which he wants to work with the help of the staff. A group project common to the majority ofthe areas represented can also be an important part of the sessions in order to train the participants to analyse the problem, determine the procedures to use in finding a solution,secure adequate and current information necessary for the solution, activate an agreed solution, and evaluate results.With these two major objectives, a daily workshop schedule might include the following:8:00 - 9:30 A.M. Discussion groups 10:00 - 12:00Subject matter content based upon needs discovered by a pre-conference survey of the extension workers expected to attend.Leaders are extension staff members with special qualificationsand visiting specialists.Group project (general and within the experience of all)Developed from start to finish by participants and staff together.2:00 - 5:00 P.M. Individual problemsEach participant works upon the problem he brought with him.Staff members are available for consultation upon request of anindividual.This can be the participant wishing to sit downwit), a staff member or a group of staff members to discuss thepmgress of his work and the next steps to take.8:00 - 9:30 P.M. General assembly 1.Opening session to set workshop objectives, procedures, workexpectancy;to meet and learn the areas of specialty of theworkshop staff; to stimulate enthusiasm for the opportunityto work alone and in groups. 2.One evening each week for evaluation of the total workshopprogram as it is funotioning in all its parts; for determiningnecessary \u00b0henget: in procedure and guidance; for sharing groupand individual results to date. - 286 - 3.One evening each week for an cut standing inspirational speaker. 4.One evening each week for a recreational program planned andconducted by the participants. The effectiveness of the workshop depends upon a highly qualified staff, a planningcommittee made up of selected workshop staff members and extension workers working atleast six months in advance of the dates set for the workshop, and preparation by theparticipants. Should two or three workers select the same urgent problem unknowingly theywould naturally work upon it together, dividing responsibility for study of individualfacts of the problem. Field TripsField trip or tour of successful extension projects, especially result demonstrationswhich show clearly the higher output obtained through following recommended improvedpractices, is a valuable teaching device for in-service training of extension agents.Seeing what other agents have accomplished helps to encourage the visiting agents.Frequently a field trip or tour is arranged in the country near the place where thein- service training program is being carried on. The projects visited should be directlyrelated to the topics which are being covered by the lectures and class discussions. SeminarsSeminars can be arranged for a definite group of agents at a convenient place todiscuss an important subject of current interest in the extension program such as theJapanese method of rice production which gives a substantially higher yield. By schedulingmeetings every week or every fortnight at some central point for a group of 10-15 agents,the training can take place without the agents being away from their posts too long. Thesessions should be under the leadership of a well qualified specialist in the field underconsideration. He should lead discussions on various aspects of the subject that themembers of the seminar have studied through assigned readings. After the introductorymaterial has been covered, each member of the group is assigned one or more topics on whichhe is to prepare a report and present it orally to the group at a specified time. This ofitself is good training in the preparation of talks to be given at extension meetings. TraininclOubject Matter SpecialistsTraining of local extension workers in technical subject matter and methods parti-cularly effective in relation thereto is a major funotion of extension subject matterspecialists.Suoh training is s000mpliehed in a variety of ways including:- Working with the local extension worker on projects in which hissubject matter is involved.- Conducting special training conferences and courses in his subject field. - Preparation of pamphlets, leaflets and fact sheets for use of localextension personnel.Assistance with leader training.- Assistance with extension program planning. -287 The extension specialist should always bear in mind that the local extension workeris the official representative of the extension service in his area and do nothing toinjure his prestige among local people. Foreign Participant TrainingMany developing countries whioh lack facilities for adequate training of extensionpersonnel take advantage of participant training programs offered by the more advanced countries.The governments of developing countries themselves finance much of thistraining but also utilize scholarships end fellowships offered by FAO, IAlateral programsof technical assistance, foundations and other organizations.Only limited numbers of personnel can be trained in this manner.It is expensive,few people oan be spared from their assignments at one time. For this and other reasonscare is essential in selection and programming of participants. The following guidelinesare suggested for the effective use of partioipant training in furthering the developmentof the extension service: 1.Decide on key positions for which outside training is required andassign priority. 2.Choose participants for selected positions on the basis of demonstratedinterest, ability and potential contribution after training, as well aseducational background. Do not provide foreign training as a reward forpast servioe.3.Be sure that trainees have adequate language ability for the type oftraining offered. 4.State objective of training clearly and concisely in training programsand indicate how training is to be used in developing the &tensionService. 5.Secure a commitment from the participant to return to the &tensionServioe for a specific period of time, e.g. two years, so that hisimproved ability can be effectively utilized.6.Provide the partioipant with assurance that he will not lose senioritybemuse of absenoe for a period of time. 7.Arrange programs to provide training in prinoiples, method of applyingthe principles to the solution of local problems and how to train othersupon return to home oountry. 8.If possible arrange for partioipant to be trained as one of a group havingsimilar training objectives. Better training can be provided to groups than to individualsgand participants gain through an exchange of ideas andexperiences with partioipants from other oountriee. 9.Request that training be oonoentrated in one or two locations and avoidobservation tours if training in depth is desired.10.Make specific and definite arrangements for returning partioipants totrain others in the extension service. Participant training cannotusually be justified on any other basis. The International Extension Training Center in Wageningen, The Netherlands, offers afour weeks training program each miter in July and August. It is conducted by theWageningen University, the Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture with the patronage of FAOand the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Center provides broadtraining in various aspects of extension education in agricultureland home economics andrelated fields. The program provides ample opportunity for discussion and exchange ofideas among participants from 30 to 40 countries each year.Agricultural Extension and Rural Development Center, University of Reading, UnitedKingdom - Four one -yeas full time courses are taught at the Center. There are opportunitiesfor suitably qualified graduates to follow courses for higher degrees by research MPhil.and Ph.D.) into basic aspects of extension and social development in rural communities. Graduate Stuffy and Professional ImprovementAfter serving for a period in the extension service, many extension workers feel theneed for additional academic training, either to improve performance in their presentpositions or to qualify for promotion. Those aspiring to become subject matter extensionspecialists will take courses leading to a Master of Science degree in their chosentechnical field, with additional courses in extension education. Others will concentrateon the field of extension education with most of their courses in the social sciences.The courses described in this section are available to those in the latter group.Diploma Course in Agricultural ExtensionIf an individual can take a year away from his post for specialized training inagricultural extension, the University of Queensland in Australia offers a one-yearresidential diploma course.

After studying at summer schoolfor several years, some farm and home advisors obtain educational leave to spend a term orsemester at the university to complete the requirements for the advanced degree. for Advanced degreeThe time required in study for an advanced degree in extension education beyond theBachelor of Science degree, or its equivalent, requires from one to two years for theMasters degree and two to three years beyond the Master of Science or Master of Educationdegree to complete the requirements for the PhD or Doctor of Education. For the Masterof Scienoe degree, the number of courses required can ordinarily be completed in oneacademic year provided the student has previously passed the pre-requisite courses.Generally a period of three to six months is required to do the research and write' thethesis.Some candidates for the Master of Science degree in extension education completetheir course work at the university and return to their poste to do the research studyplanned with their faculty advisor and write the thesis.Two examples of courses of study for thin advanced degree illustrate the kinds ofsubject matter to be covered. 1. University of Missouri, USAThe masterof science degree at the University of Missouri Columbia requiresa minimum of 32 semester credit hours. Of these, at least 16 must be at the400 level or above. A semester credit hour is one hour of instruction per weekin one subject for one semester of 18 weeks duration. A student is permitted toearn no more than 8 oredit hours through off-campus or correspondence courses.The program must be completed within a period of eight years and must be completedwith 80% of the grades being B or better.An advisor is assigned to each student and guides him in the selection of coursesfor his program of study. An attempt is made to plan each program in line withthe student's needs and job aspirations. Courses for the study program are chosenprimarily from the departments of Extension Education, Regional and Community Affairs,Rural Sociology, and from the College of Education. In some cases students maytake technical arrioultural subject matter if this seems desirable.The master's program is a nom-thesis program, but a special problem written upin research style is required of all students. Two to four credit hours are allowedfor the researoh depending; upon the detail's of the project. All students must pagea comprehensive written and oral examination near the end of their period of study.Courses in Extension Education which are suggested and taken by most studentsinclude Fundamental's of Communication, Principles and Procedures in ExtensionTeaching, Fundamentals of Extensior 1:zehing of Adults, Program Development andEvaluation, and Special Research Problems.2. American University of Beirut. LebanonA total of 36 'semester credit hours of work are required for the Master ofScience degree in Extension Eduoation. Writing of an acceptable thesis dealing witha researoh study regarding some aspeot of agricultural extension oounts for 6 credits. - 290 - Approximately two-thirds of the remaining 30 credit should be in the major subjectarea of extension and th, balance in the minor. Usually9credit hours are earnedin the minor field. A committee of the Faculty of Agricultural Scienoes guides thestudent in planning a program of study oovering subjects which will help prepare himfor the work he will undertake following graduation, holders of the Bachelor of Sciencedegree in agriculture, or its equivalent, who have studied undergraduate courses inextension work, eduoation, rural sociology and agricultural economics usually cancomplete the requirements for the Master of Scienoe in one aoadeiic year of coursework plus about six months to do the research for and write a thesis.Students who have not studied foundation oourses in these fields generallyrequire two academic, years to oomplete the requirements. They devote the inter-vening summer to field research, oolleoting data and information for their thesis.The subject areas for inclusion in the program of study for the Master of Sciencedegree are given below.American University of BeirutFa lty of Agricultural Cciences Program of Study for MS in_Mricultural &tensionRequirements Credits 1.Courses in the major field of extension education 21selected from among the following:Methods of extension educationComparative extension methodsOrganisation and administration of an extension servicePersonnel training and administrationSeminar in agricultural extension Audio -visual aidsPsychology of educationSocial psychologySeminar education organizationRural community developmentApplied rural sooiology 2.Courses in the minor field are to be selected from among:Agricultural economicsRural sociologyAgricultural education9 - 291 - RequirementsEducationAnimal and horticulture productionSoils and irrigationFood technology and nutrition 3.Thesis reporting on original research in some aspector phase of agricultural extensionCredits 6 Total credits for the XS Degree 36 PhD Degree in Extension EducationThe PhD degree in extension education is granted by only a limited number of universi-ties.In the United States but four Land-Grant Universities offer this terminal degree,Cornell University of New York State, Ohio State University, University of Wisconsin, andOklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical University. Affiliated with departments of agri-cultural education at Cornell and Wisconsin are special institutes dealing with agriculturalextension education. At Cornell there is the Comparative Extension Education Programwhich offers a special program for graduate students from developing countries and forAmerican Extension personnel concerned with extension programs in various countries underthe US/AID program. The National Extension Training Center sponsored by the United StatesFederal Extension Service for advanced training of extension personnel is connected withthe Department of Agricultural and Extension Education of the University of Wisconsin. Cornell University Program of Study for Ph. D. in Extension EducationThe Graduate School provides extensive flexibility in course requirements for thePh. D. degree. The granting of the degree is based upon the recommendation of a committeeof faculty members formed to guide each student in a program of study fitted to his partioularinterests and needs. The committee recommends the student for the degree when it issatisfied with his accomplishments in 'course study and in writing a dissertation based onoriginal research.The, graduate faculty considers study on the university campus essential. Eachcandidate for the Ph. D. degree must earn six units of residence beyond the B.S. eachterm representing a unit. If a student cannot remain in residence continuously, he mustapply for a leave of.absence. All requirements for the degree must be completed within10 years after the date of first registration as a candidate.Candidates for the doctorate must offer themselves for examination in one majorsubject and in two minor subjects. The following graduate courses are especially designedfor extension education students.CoursesThe Cooperative Extension ServioeAdministration and Supervision of CooperativeExtension ProgramsDesigning Programs of Developmental ChangeCommunicating TechnologySemester Credits 3 3 3 3 - 292 - Courses Semester Credits Special Studies in Extension Education 2 Seminar:Comparative Extension Education Systems 2 Seminar:Implementing Extension and Commanity DevelopmentPrograms in Developing Countries 2 SeminarsCurrent Problem and Issues in Extension Education 2 Adult Education 2 or 3 Seminar:International Agricultural Development 0 Candidates for advanced degrees normally study courses totaling 12 to 15 credit hoursper term.Upon completion of the program of study of course work set by the studentelcommittee, he is given a comprehensive examination by members of the committee. Most ofthe examination is oral. When the student has completed his dissertation to the satis-faction of his thesis advisor, he is examined regarding his research and his findings bythe committee. Upon satisfactory performance in these examinations, the committee recommendshim to the Graduate School for granting him the degree. National Training Centers 1/This refers to national extension training centers or seminars organized with theassistance of FAO or some other aid agency. Such training centers are generally held incountries where agricultural extension is still in the early stage of development, andtraining in extension is offered for the first time. The training is generally designedfor extension workers at the national level or the provincial level or both. After receivingthe training, they can in turn organize similar short courses for extension personnel ata lower level. The advantage of having such a national extension training center is thata large number of nationals in positions of leadership can be trained at one time underlocal conditions.The success of a national extension training center requires thorough preparation andsatisfactory arrangements, which are briefly discussed in the following paragraphs. Objectives of the Training Center Who will be the trainees? What is their educational background? How much experiencedid they have in agricultural extension work, and what is the nature of it? What willthey be expected to do after receiving the training? These are some of the questions thatMust be answered before a suitable training program can be worked out for the center. Si, m Location and DurationFor the convenience of discussion, the oenter should be kept at a reasonable size, notexceeding 40 participants, and they should be seated in a round table formation. Shouldmore people need to be trained, they can be divided into two or more separate classes, heldin succession. C.W. Chang - Agricultural Adviser, Asia and the Far East Region, FADBangkok, Thailand. -293- Wherever possible, the training center should be located at a regular training insti-tution such as an agricultural college or an agricultural school, in the hope that the training institution will offer such short term training courses by itself, after gaining this experience. If accommodations permit, the trainees and instructors should live together thus providing more opportunity for personal contacts.Depending upon the level of the trainees, the training center may last from two to three weeks.If it is too long, it will be difficult to maintain a high level of interest, nor is it possible for a group. of high level people to be away from their jobs too long. Courses of Study The training center may be devoted entirely to the area of \"how to teach\". This may include such subjects as Extension Education or Comparative Extension Farmers' Organization and Leadership Training; and Extension Teaching Methods and Teaching aids. Or the train- ing center may also include two or more subjects from the technical fields or the area of \"what to teach\". Then such subjects as Seed Multiplication and Distribution, FertilizerUse, Insecticides, Farm Management, Marketing, and Farm Mechanization may be added.Having subjects of both areas included in the training program will make the training more meaning- ful and substantial. However, the major emphasis should be laid on \"how to teach\". Technical subjects can be offered any time for one or two days when the need arises. Village Surveys and Program Planning For this purpose a village of 50 to 100 farm families -should be selected in theneighborhood of the training center so the trainees can make a general survey or severalspecial surveys, during the training period. All the instructors of the center will need to visit the village beforehand, and decide on the nature and the scope of the surveys to be undertaken as a part of the training program.By proper arrangements, all the surveyscan be finished in one day. During the next two class periods of two hours each, theinformation thus gathered can be tabulated and written in report form by the groups of trainees who conducted the survey. The instructors will go over their drafts, and piecethem together to form a complete report for the village. Then one morning session shouldbe set aside toward the end of the training center for discussion on program planning, based on the survey findings. Trainees selected for the purpose may act the part of villageelders.At this meeting, the extension education instructor should play the role of an extension supervisor. After explaining the purpose of the meeting, he will call on the leaders of each survey group to report on their survey findings, as if they were villagelevel workers. This will be followed by a general discussion in an effort to define theproblems, decide on objectives, and to suggest measures for improvement. If the directorof agriculture and some of his senior research and extension officers are present, theyshould be asked to comment on the recommendations and suggestions reached. If the discussionis well planned and well conducted, it can be finished in one morning session. This should be the climax of the training course. As a result of their active participation in makingthe surveys, reports and discussion trainees learn how to proceed with their work, and appreciate the value of the training.The village under survey should be made a pilot village for demonstration and trainingpurposes and the conduct of an on-going extension program. Otherwise, villagers will receive no benefit from their cooperation. Involvement of the TraineesIt is important to involve villagers in program planning and program implementation, to make sure that the program is based on their needs and interests. Similarly, thetrainees should be represented in the staff meetings of the training center, so their viewscan be expressed, and to assure that the instruction is adjusted to their capacities andrequirements. - 294 - Awarding CertificatesIt is a good practice to give public recognition to the participants for worthwhileachievements. Awarding of certificates signifying satisfactory completion of the trainingcourse serves this purpose.Evaluation should be undertaken periodically and at the end of the training program.This will serve several purposes. First periodic evaluation will guide the staff inadjusting and improving the program from day to day according to the reaction of theparticipants. Secondly a terminal evaluation will provide information useful in improvingfuture training centers. Finally and most important it will serve as a demonstration tothe trainees on the use of the evaluation process in extension teaching: Career Development TasksThe Individual as a UnitIn recruitment and selection of extension personnel for employment, we pay closeattention to an individual's background and previous training. Once we have employed aperson, however, we tend to lose him in the group and forget about training him as anindividual.If we want efficient training, we will examine the individual's previous training tofind areas in which he is strong or weak. The transcript of college credits can be ourtool for trying to understand the individual's previous background and experience. Theinformation on strong points or gaps in previous training can be used to eliminate someagents from certain kinds of training altogether and for grouping others in order to providetraining.Job descriptions, personal inventories of training needs, or performanceevaluations are other tools for determining an individual's need for training. This is one aspect of the Unit Approach. Now let's turn our attention to another. Career Stages as UnitsWe have given a good deal of thought to the first year's training for new workers.It might be said that we pour all we know into employees in the first year and then werepeat this same 'dose' over and over throughout the career life of the worker. In contrast,we need to think of the natural stages in an extension career and determine the type oftraining appropriate to workers at each stage.From a study of human development processes we know that the child study scientistsworking in this field speak of the 'developmental tasks' of children and youth. They haveidentified these tasks as: 1.Accepting one's physique. 2.Achieving new relations with playmates of both sexes. 3.Achieving emotional independence of parents and ether adults, etc. S Expert from \"Career Development Tasks\" ER&116.91 prepared by Mary L. Collings,&tension Training Branch, Federal Extension Service, United States Departmentof Agriculture, Washington, D.C. USA. - 295 - There are these three and six other tasks, making a total of nine developmental tasks. These tasks the scientists have identified by thinking back over their own lives, byquestioning boys and girls to find out what their principal interests and concerns are, by observing boys and girls to find out what their goals are, and by analyzing the values of our American society. Those who have studied in this field of human development speak of children 'working on' one task or another at certain stages of their development.Borrowing this concept, we can apply it to an extension career.Each extension workerhas career developmental tasks to do, each must grow in the career he has chosen, each must work on the tasks one at a time; or do all of them at once if he has the courage to do so, though some tasks are more appropriate at one stage of the career than at another. Then, secondly, training should be geared to help agents undertake each task in sequence at the stage of his career when each is appropriate.What are these career developmental tasks? Without the benefit of scientificexperimentation or study in this area, we can only surmise that there are six tasks, 1.Establishing one's self in job performanceThe new worker must first find a place for himself in the county and prove tohimself that he personally can perform the teaching function assigned him.Hc, must show himself and others that he can make personal contacts with laypeople and be accepted by them; he must show himself that he can interpretscientific information and apply what he learned in school in a good demonstra-tion;speak to groups in public meetings and over radio; write news articlesthat are printed in the papers and read by people he may never know personally.He must show himself that he cannot only plan for his own activities but candirect the work of a secretary and other office staff in an efficient way. This is his first task. If we accept this as the first task then the newworker training should be focused solely, or almost exclusively, on the workerhimself as a performer. 2.Achieving team statusClose on the heels of the first task, the extension worker learns how tomake himself a member of the team of county and state extension workers. TheUSDA News Letter recently quoted Brewster Jennings' words on teamwork:\"Man'sgreatest discovery is not fire, or, the wheel, or the internal combustion engine,or atomic energy, or anything in the material world. It is in the world ofideas.Man's greatest discovery is teamwork by agreement.\"Teamwork, at times, seems harder to achieve than the secret which unlockedthe prooess of controlling atomic energy. In this second stage of his development,the extension worker must come face to face with the fact that he can no longerthink of himself as a solo performer but as a member of a team. He must begin toidentify himself in his own mind with other phases of extension work than his own.He must recognize his obligation to develop as much understanding and appreciationfor the work of those in agriculture, home economics, or 4-H Club work, as thecase might be, even as much concern for the success of other staff members inthese other phases of the work, as for his own.This is not achieved by an hour's talk at an induction training conference.It comes about the hard wayby repeated opportunities in training sessions andin day-to-day activities to develop a feeling for 'our' program and 'we county staff members'. Some personnel never learn this task. Our second task intraining, developing teamwork, is one of our most important tasks. - 296 - 3.Achieving organization mindedness&tension work has built up an enviable reputation for organizational ability.At great expense of human evergy and even in staff turnover, perhaps, we havebuilt this reputation and this organization. Learning to build and work througha lay organization, though it is complicated, has been for some of our personnelrelatively easy. They learn it in the first 2 or 3 years of employment. Somenever learn it though they may stay on the job many years. These latter persons,perhaps, have the wrong 'role perception'. This term is used quite a bit thesedays, meaning the images a person has in his own mind of what he wants to believeabout himself and his job and what he wants others to see in him. Some agentssee themselves as servants of the extension organization and go about doing endlesschores for it. They are never able to take a step back and allow leaders 'tolearn by doing,' to make their own mistakes, to do their own thinking, to giveguidance but not direction, to draw people out, not tell them what to do.This third task is one of setting members of our groups free and helping themto beoome effective and responsible leaders in the extension organization. Thisseems simple enough. Yet the first career task of learning to perform themselvesmakes some agents continue to think of themselves as 'the indispensable man.'They can never cease to be the organizer themselves and train leaders to becomethe organizers, to work through leaders instead for leaders. In our training of agents in organization and leadership development and inprogram planning we have not grounded all agents thoroughly on techniques forbuilding a sound, effective, self-perpetuating organization. This is the reasonthat some county extension organizations fold up when experienced agents arereplaced by new workers or when leaders move out of the county.With rapidturnover, stability for extension work comes through the leaders, not the agents.We need to think through more carefully what sort of training is needed to helpagents learn the task of organizing and conducting their work in such a way thatleaders are involved more and agents less in mending 'organizational fences.'We need to think more of procedures that are used to get county organizations toplan for their own program and for their own expansion, to rotate leadershipresponsibilities, to use past leaders to train incoming leaders for programplanning and to work out contaots with other agencies, to name only a few organi-zation 'fence mending' jobs that need to be done by leaders, not agents. Perhaps we try to teach these things too soon in the career of immatureagents and we get poor results or complete defeat. Then we allow experiencedagents to get in the rut of being work horses for their county organizations.Surely there is a way to analyze what the training for this developmental taskis and provide it at the time when it is appropriate and will be understood andapplied. 4.Becoming management- consciousClosely allied to the previous career tasks is the fourth one, to becomemanagement conscious. Some of our workers are so pressed for time that theyare literally a menace to recruitment of new workers.With the growing pressuresof the job, they lose control of their own destiny, sacrifioe their serenity, andgive way to self-pity. All agents are equal in ane thing, the amount of timegiven them to do the job. That some of them are more effective than others isdue in large part to management. The poor manager can inherit from his predecessora good extension program and wreck it. Many of our agents have had littleopportunity in college to learn the principles of management as applied to time,or anything else. Business experience, perhaps, has contributed to preparationin time management, but this is not a guaranteed bonus from such experience. - 297 - We are trying to teach management to farm and home development families.The same decision-making process needs to be used in considering the professional's use of time.The new worker's job is to find something to put into his time schedule;the experienced worker's task is to decide what to take out.When pressures begin to mount, training can be directed toward helping theagent analyze the whole job, decide on important things to do, set up proceduresfor meeting different sorts of demands on his own time attack each job directly,arrange good sequence (doing most important things first), delegate jobs and train helpers, and analyze his own personality to better understand how to adjust his work order if he is a 'slow starter' oz an 'easy tirer.'In his role as an educator, the agent must adjust himself to the slowprocess of working through ethers at the pace they can learn. In this role asan executive the agent must learn to regulate his own activites so as to producewith reasonable cost of time, according to a design or plan.The latter role requires that he know something about management but even more that he believesthat he is, at least to some extent, master of his own fate when it oomes to timeuse and a decision maker, not simply a victim of his job. 5.Achieving a professional attitude The fifth development task is one that is assumed when the agent takes a professional job, i.e., to become truly a professional in attitudes. But it takes time to achieve. If the extension worker has a professional attitude henot only thinks of what he gains from being classed as a professional but of whathe contributes to professional standing for the Cooperative &tension Service.To be classed as a professional, workers must accept for themselves the characte- ristics of a profession, such ass- a long period of specialized preparation or training,- a code of ethics which governs individual behavior,- high work standards, - willingness to accept responsibility for one's own actions,- a self-administered organization, etc.To be truly professional, an extension person must take as experimentalattitude toward his work. He must develop insatiable curiosity as to what worksand why.He must search continually for the better way, see extension work asan intelleotual adventure--requiring ingenuity and initiative in meeting thesuccession of problems whioh constitute the day's work. He will go out aftermore training for the personal satisfaction of acquiring more knowledge and forthe privilege of associating with the great ideas of the world, not solely forthe extrinsic values of promotions, salary inorease and the like. 6.Making way for one's own replacementsThe sixth and last career developmental task perhaps is making way for one'sown replacements. In a certain sense, each experienced worker who has been givenan assistant at that point in his career may be faced with this task. This issomething that the professional faces which is much like the situation that thefirst child goes through on the advent of the second, third, and fourth child.Yet we associate this experience more generally with the 'about- to-be- retired'person. - 298 - It is a hard task,for some of our personnel. It requires that they'move over' so to speak--in the plaoe of affeotion of ()aunty people and stateworkers, give up some of the preferred parts of the job and watch someone elsedo 'their' job in a different, or even a better way. If personnel learn thistask of adjustment well, they not only give over some things to the new worker,they make the way smoother for the new worker to develop and do a better jobthan has been done before. Some of our personnel do this exceedingly well andbecome excellent trainer agents. Others do this task with resentment, jealousy,and bitterness. But oome it must to all personnel. Surely training can helpto make the learning of this task easier and less painful. Chapter 15- 299 - Section V - INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND RELATIONS INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE IN EXTENSION DEVELOPMENT International 000peration in agricultural development had its beginning with theestablishment of the Institute of Agriculture in 1905. This was the forerunner of theFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations(FA0), the major present-dayinter-governmental organization devoted to agrioulture. Prior to World War IX, only themore advanced countries of Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand had agriculturalextension or advisory services. Shortages of food, fiber, rubber and other strategicmaterials focused attention on agricultural production in less - developed oountries duringWorld War II.Following the war, food was the critical need in war-torn countries andthroughout the world where population was expanding at an alarming rate. The technicallyadvanced nations recognized a need and an obligation to assiitless-advanced oountries toexpand food production and help the masses of rural people-attain a higher level of living.They realized that peace and stability could not be achieved while large segments of theworld's population were hungry. Furthermore, they realized that disparity of incomesbetween the people of advanced and less - advanced countries restricted trade and limited theprosperity of both. With 60 tr., 80 percent of the people engaged in the production ofinadequate supplies of food in the backward countries, economic development required thathigh priority be given to modernizing agriculture.Low agricultural productivity in the less- advanced countries stems from manycauses and modernization of agriculture requires the marshalling of many resources to solvethese problems. But when these resources are made available, improved production dependsupon changes in farming practices of millions of primary producers. Since it is afunction of agricultural extension to induce rural people to adopt improved farmingpractices, a part of the technical assistance effort is direoted to the establishment andstrengthening of extension services.Objectives of International Assistance in ExtensionThe primary object of technical assistanoe in agricultural extension is to helpnations develop and strengthen rural extension educational services thus contributing toimproved levels of living in rural communities, food and fiber production to meet the needsof expanding world populations, and agricultural, economic and social development of thecountries involved. It is hoped that accomplishment of this objective will strengthendemooratic self-government in developing countries, relieve tensions caused by disparity of .opportunity between classes and between people of different countries, and contribute toworld stability and peace.Technical assistance in extension, as extension education itself, is built on theprinciple of self-help. No foreign agency can establish an extension service and operateit effectively on a continuing basis. Like other institutions, the extension service mustdevelop to fit the cultures and other environmental conditions of each country. Anextension service established with foreign technical and/or econamio assistance musteventually stand on its own feet and justify the expenditure of resources required for itsoperation through its contribution to rural economic and social progress. Technic441assistance provides a country with knowledge and experience gained in the advanoed countrieslargely through experimentation and trial and error. It is provided on the assumptionthat te.e period required for development of the service into an effective and efficientinstigation can thereby be shortened. - 300 - Organizatiora Rendering International AssistanceEconomic and. technical aid to agriculture has flowed from the more advanced to thedeveloping countries mainly through 1) inter-governmental organizations; 2) bilateralprograms of technical assistance; 3) private foundations, and 4) churches and other bene-volent organizations and institutions.Inter-governmental organizations providing technical and/or economic assistanceincludes 3.1- The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations- Inter-American Institute of Agricultural Sciences of theOrganization of American States- The Colombo Plan- World Food Program- World Bank Group- Inter-American Development Bank- European Economic CommunityBilateral programs of technical or economic assistance are conducted by some fifteencountries of Europe, North America, Australia and Japan. Israel, the Soviet Union andthe Peoples' Republic of China also furnish economic aid and technical assistance to anumber of countries.Several private foundations provide assistance to agriculture, mainly in the areasof research, training and education. Among thous:, concerned most with agriculturalextension are the Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation and the Near East Foundation.Multilateral aid to agricultural development for the period 1960 -66 amounted toapproximately 1,385 million U.S. dollars. Bilateral assistance from the fifteen countriesmentioned above in 1965 alone amounted to 1,507 million U.S. dollars. Data is notavailable on the amount of assistance funds devoted to the development of agriculturalextension services, but in the cases of the United Kingdom's and the United States' bi-lateral programs, approximately 20 percent and 19 percent respectively were used in the areaof agricultural education, research and extension. These were leading countriescontributing to this area of development.Multilateral Technical AssistanceTypes of Assistance Rendered by FAOUnder its Regular Program, FAOse principal functions are to collect and analyseinformation relating to programs of nutrition, food and agriculture; to recommend andpromote national and international action leading to improvement of agricultural productionand marketing; and to furnish such technical assistance as governments may request 2/. The permanent staff, in collaboration with short-term consultants, carry otltagricultural research, planning and fact-finding activities, the preparation of statistic'sand studies, arrangement of conferences, seminars and panels. In.addition, FAO administersvarious technical assistance programmes financed by the United Nations Development ProgramTINDP) and also in collaboration with bilateral agencies such as DANIDA (Denmark), NOR ADNorway), SIDA (Sweden). 21 Aid to Agriculture in Developing Countries, OECD, Paris 1968.21 Condensed from Aid to Agriculture in Developing Countries, OECD, Paris, 1968. -301- Much of FAO's work is concerned with education:and training in specialized fields - fisheries, forestry, nutrition, home economics, etc., as well as all the aspects of general agricultural education and training. The latter is the responsibility of the Agricultural Education, Extension and Rural Youth Service which liaises with Cooperatives, Land Reform and other important institutional aspects of rural development.There has been a marked shift in the work of FAO during recent years towards multi- disciplinary and integrated development projects which seek to integrate the various inputs reoeived by the farmer - credit, extension, farm supplies, market organization, etc.It may not be too much of an over-amplification to say that without education and training) all forms of aid to agriculture are only stop-gaps. Fortunately, more and more governments and funding agencies are recognizing the need for training projects. The whole subject was thoroughly studied at the World Conference on Agricultural Education and Training, held in Copenhagen in 1970. The report of this conference is a rich source of information on the whole field. Attention should also be drawn to the report on Rural Extension in Latin America and the Caribbean (Chiolayo, Peru, 1970)4/FAO's current work emphasises the integration of extension and other services to farmers with the aim of closely involving the farm family and, particularly, rural youth in developing countries. Special emphasis is placed on the strengthening or establishing of farmer training oentres and their close link with the extension services. Increased attention is now being given to non-formal methods of agricultural education and training and the possibilities opened up by the mass media. The following list of activities illustrates the types of assistance in extension development and operation provided member countries by FAO: - Advising member natiAns on matters related to the planning, implementation and development of extension services.- Helping to formulate and execute projects for the advancement of rural youthprograms with special emphasis on the development of youth leadership and the greater involvement of youth in agricultural and rural development, and cooperating with UN and other organizations in the planning and implementation of comprehensive youth projects.- Helping to reinforce and expand farmer training systems and to establishappropriate systems in countries not having such programmes.- Organizing and participating in national and international training centers and conferences on agricultural extension, rural youth and farmer training. - Participation in meetings and training courses organized by national andinternational organizations.FAO recognizes the tremendous training problem involved if the millions of farm families in developing countries are to provide the increasing amounts of food and fibre required for their expanding populations. Fundamental to the development of training institutions and programs is a determination of requirements and polioies for trained manpower at the professional and technical levels. FAO is assisting member countries to develop and improve the training of professional and technical personnel for extension and other rural services by the following means:110/Unesco/ILO World Conference on Agricultural Education and Training, Copenhagen, Denmark, July/August 1970, 2 vols.

Inter-American Institute of Agricultural SciencesThe Inter-American Institute of Agricultural Soiences (IAIAS) is a cooperativeagricultural development agency of the Americas. It is a specialized agency of theOrganization of American States (OAS) founded in 1943. Its assigned objectives are toencourage and advance the development of agricultural sciences in the American Republicsby strengthening institutions of higher agricultural education, research centers, and ruraldevelopment services in the OAS member states. Headquarters of the Institute are atSan Jose, Costa Rica, with a training and research center at Turrialba and regional(zone)offices in Guatemala City, La Molina, Peru, and Montevideo, Uruguay. Two regional researchand training centers have been developed in the zones, backstopped by the Turrialba Center.The Institute's contributions to development of extension services in the areaincludes1) training of students in disciplines related to extension education;2) assistance to Latin - American Universities in up-grading training, the establishment ofgraduate courses and inter-university coordination of effort; 3) research in rural andsocial sciences, and 4) advisory assistance in agricultural development and agrarian reform.More than 300 students have received master's degrees from the Training and Research Center.Of these, 40 percent are engaged in university teaching, 45 peroent in research and 15percent in rural development and agrarian reform. Over 14,000 professionals from theAmericas have been trained at the graduate school or through international oourses, nationalcourses or in- service training, involving the Institute's staff.The Institute has close working relations with other technical assistance agenciesincluding contracts with the U.S. Agency for International Development, Atomic EnergyCommission, and the United Nations Development Program-financed FAO projects. TheInstitute works with the Inter-American Committee of the Alliance for Progress (CLAP), asan advisory body. 2./ Souroe - International Agricultural Development, No. 39, January 1968. -303- The World Bank Group VThe International Bank for Reoonstruction and Development and affiliates havebeen giving increasing emphasis to the financing of projects in the agricultural field.The Bank provides technical aaaistanoe in connection with its lending operations. The Bankin cooperation with FAO and the International Coffee Council has undertaken a major studyaiming to give guidance to coffee producing countries on how they might best diversifytheir agricultural production. A special mission organized by the Bank made a long-rangestudy of experiences with the development of agriculture in tropical countries providingbackground information useful in the formation of extension and other developmental programs.The Bank has come to the conclusion that an integrated approach is necessary foragricultural development and is now financing comprehensive agricultural programs involvingland survey, demarcation and registration of individual farm holdings, farm water supplies,agricultural research, technical advice to farmers, credit extended through technicaladvisers, farm access roads and the provision of marketing facilities. Inter-American Development Bank V The Inter-American Development Bank is an agency created in 1959 by 19 American countries.In addition to Ordinary Capital'and Special Operations funds, the Bank administersthe Social Progress Trust Fund under an agreement with the United States. The Bank hasbecome more heavily engaged in financing agricultural development in Latin America thanany other development agency.The total amount of technical assistance grants to agriculture was $14.8 million upto December 31, 1966. Much of this amount has been spent to help the implementation ofprojects to develop and strengthen institutions that have received loans. An additional$842.000 has been made available for training and research activities sponsored by theBank.Six loans of $ 12.8 million in all have been made for agricultural education andtraining.Five of these loans went to universities to help develop the teaching of agri-cultural sciences. The sixth loan was for developing a national center that combinesteaching, research and extension. European Economic Community ..11 Under its first 5-year endowment of $581 million in 1958, the European EconomicCommunity exercised only an indirect influence on agricultural development. Under itssecond 5-year endowment, its operations are concerned more directly with productiveoperations.By March 1967, commitments were made under the following categories; economicand social investment projects, technical assistance linked with investments, generaltechnical cooperation emergency aid, aid to agricultural production and aid to agriculturaldiversification. Aid to agricultural production and diversification amounted to 32% of totalcommitments under the second fund.Technical assistance in.the agricultural field takes the.form of preparatorysurveys, training, supervision and direction of work as well as supply of productionrequisites.Agricultural extension operations are generally restricted to a limitedarea with comparable ecological and sociological conditions. They have been foundmost successful within the framework of cash crops development, much less so in areasof pure subsistence agriculture. . .-il Source- Aid to Agriculture in Developing Countries OECD Paris, 1968. -304- Assistance Rendered through Bi lateral Programs of Technical AssistanceWith the exception of the United States, most of the countries giving extensionrelated technical assistance provide it in the areas of research and training.The UnitedKingdom has provided large scale capital aid for the development of educational institutionsranging from agricultural colleges to farmer training centere including the training ofextension workers. These institutions are located mainly former colonies and protectorates.Although operated by the Ministries of Agriculture in the recipient countries, theUnited Kingdom furnishes many of the technical and administrative staff. French technical assistance is concentrated largely in the Franc area and consistslargely of assistance to the governments of former French territories. However, aid toother areas, noteably Latin America, is increasing. Research and training institutionsare the recipients of much of the French technical assistance although community developmentprojects receive support in a number of countries. 110 research and training institutionsin 29 countries received help in 1966. Large numbers of nationals of cooperating countriesreceive sholarships for technical training in domestic institutions and in French Universities.Approximately 300 Volunteers for Progress with non university background demonstrate modernmethods of animal husbandry and production in rural communities of recipient countries. Denmark has established demonstration and training farms in Mysore India, Thailandand Iran.Agricultural training institutes in Tanzania and Zambia help meet those countriesneeds for trained extension personnel. Denmark supplies experts in a number of agriculturalfields and provides specialist short course training for technicians.The Australian technical assistance program is concentrated in Asia and the SouthPacific with special emphasis on agricultural research, education and extension in Papuaand New Guinea. Australia provides training in agricultural fields to substantial numbersof students and technicians.The Netherlands is developing a new scheme for the establishment of agriculturalresearch and extension services in selected countries. She has long been a leader inproviding training ia tropical agriculture and supplies many experts in extension andrelaLe0 fields under multilateral programs of technical assistance.Japan provides guidance and training in agricultural development at 13 TechnicalCooperation Centers in India, Cambodia and Pakistan. During fiscal year 1966, 149 Japaneseagricultural experts were assigned to lees developed countries to carry out research andto provide agricultural training and extension services.Belgian extensionrelated technical assistance activities are concentrated largelyin the Congo, Burundi and Rwanda and involve mainly assistance with agricultural researchand the training of students. United States Technical Assistance ActivitiesUnited States governmental technical assistance activities in agricultural extensionare administered by the Agency for International Development and carried on in cooperationwith the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Land Grant Universities. Beginning asearly as 1941, AID and its predecessor agencies have assisted in establishing agriculturalextension services in more than 70 countries.Assistance has' been both technical and economic. Advisers have assisted in theorganization and operatio::. of extension services. Specialists have been assigned to helpdevelop extension work in various technical fields. Grants in aid have helped provide facilities for researchi training and the conduct of extension activities.As many as 1,500 technicians and officials have received training in extension organization and methods in a single year in the United States. In addition many thousands of studentshave attended United States universities and technical schools on scholarships and fellow. ships.Their training included varying amounts of extension education.United States technical assistance efforts for the first 20 years or so were directed mainly toward institution building; i.e. establishing an extension organization, recruiting and training staff and developing related agricultural research and teaching institutions.Development of coordinated research and teaching institutions has been carried out largelythrough contracts with Land Grant Universities in the United Mates.These institutions provided much of the participant training. With completion of the establishment of extension services on an operating basisin most cooperating countries emphasis has been shifted from institution building to the promotion of specific agricultural production programs. Agricultural and home economics extension advisor posts have been terminated with the exception of a few countries, mainlyin Asia and Africa, which got a late start and are still developing an organization.Specific U.S. aided agricultural production programs involve greater use of technical agricultural specialists. These specialists assist governments with intensive campaigns to increase production by introducing high yielding varieties of wheat, rice, maize and other crops.Such campaigns require specialists in such technical fields as agronomy, soil fertility, pest and disease control, irrigation and farm machinery. Bat most important to their success is the existence in the country of established and operating extensionservices to carry those programs to the farmers. Without an extension organization those campaigns are unlikely to succeed. In the opinion of some officials, U.S. technical andfinancial support of national extension aerviceu was withdrawn too precipitously. Govern ments have been unable to adjust to the added technical and financial burden fast enough and their extension services have deteriorated in both effectiveness and in staff morale. Extension Activities of Private Foundationsk advantage of technical assistance by Foundations is that they can concentratetheir efforts in those areas not being attended by governmental agencies because of legal and political restrictians. As long as they conform to tax legislation governing theactivities of charitable institutions they have considerable freedom in the use of their often quite large resources. Among the largest which concern themselves with agriculturaland rural development are the Near East Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation. The Near East Foundation was a pioneer in agricultural education and extension in the countries of the Near East and Southern Europe. Its activities paved the ,,'ay forpresent day extension services in Greece, Iran and some other countries.The Rockefeller Foundation chartered,in 1915, started with public health problems such as its initial campaign against hookworm in rural areas of Southern United States.Thereafter similar campaigns against hookworm were carried out on six continents and29 islands in the \"hookworm belt\" that then girdled the globe.In 1943 Rockefeller Foundation inaugurated another campaign in cooperation with the government of Mexico. Using the techniques of basic genetic research, Foundation scientistsworking with their Mexican colleagues developed varieties of corn and wheat that would growwell in Mexican soils and climate. Since 1943, Mexico has become self sufficient in cornand wheat even though its population has risen 60%. The lessons learned in the MexicanAgricultural Program have since been carried into other LatinAmerican countries, Asia and Africa. Ford Foundation has concentrated largely upon social research, education andtraining as of concern in the development of agricultural extension. The communitydevelopment programs of India, Pakistan and a number of other countries were aided materiallyby the training and research provided by Ford Foundation. More recently, Ford Foundationand Rockefeller Foundation have jointly established and now operate the International RiceResearch Institute in .1-e Philippines. The Institute has developed a rice varietydescribed in Southeast Asia as the \"miracle rice\". This variety produces yields intropical and snb-tropical rice producing regions, under traditional methods of cultivationof up to twice what the farmers are accustomed to.The Institute is now concentrating on the training of extension and other specialistsand technicians, It was found that there people lacked practical experience and soundtechnical knowledge in such areas as diagnosis of disease, identification of insects anddistinguishing varieties. A two-part program was inaugurated including lectures and theactual growing of rice and all operations involved throughout the growing seasons. Thisprogram resulted in improvement of technical knowledge from around 30 percent to 90 percent,better relationships with farmers, greater knowledge of problems, and greater selfconfidence on the part of the teohnicians. As of April 1969, two classes of 30 men each,representing most Countries of the region, were in training. The University at Los Banosis collaborating in the training and taking ever - increasing responsibility. An additionalstaff member has been added so that training oonsultant services may be offered tocooperating countries.The Foundation proposes to follow up with this training approach at other centers,including the International Corn and Wheat Research Center in Mexico, the InternationalInstitute of Trcpioal Agriculture at Ibadan, Nigeria, and the Tropical Food, Livestock andPasture Center in Venezuela.The Foundation coordinates its activities closely with AID, FAO and other public andprivate technical assistance programs. Chapter 16-307 - PROGRESS IN EXTENSION DEVELOPMENT AND EXPERIENCE GAINED Nearly all countries in the world today provide some type of educational service to help rural people imp: -.Pe their agricultural productivity and to raise their levels ofliving.Extension type services in the more advanced countries had their beginning earlyin the present century and in recent decades developed into powerful forces for economic and social progress. Most newly developing countries established their systems of extensioneducation since World War II, with assistance from the more advanced countries and inter-national agencies. Impetus for establishment of extension type services in developing countries has come from several sources. The threat of famine has forced governments to take measures toexpand food production. Social unrest among rural people has made it politically imperativeto give people assistance in bettering their levels -f living. Newly independent countrieshave found that agricultural modernization is a first step towards economic, developmentAnd freedom from economic dependence upon more powerful and advanced nations. And, finallythere has come a recognition that rural people, who constitute a majority of the populationin most countries, have a right to equality of opportunity for advancement and a better life. With few exceptions, extension eduoation is administered by ministries or departments of agriculture. Exceptions include India, Pakistan and Korea in which agriculturalextension is a part of broader programs of community development. Even in these instances,ministries of agriculture are usually responsible for technical support of extension inboth training of staff Lnd in field operations. In Colombia, various federations andinstitutes, as well as tLe Ministry of Agriculture, conduct extension type programs.Another system, involving cooperation between ministries of agriculture anduniversities, patterned after the Land Grant College System of the United States, isbeing developed in some Indian states and in Ethiopia.Extension services in developing countries are in widely varying stages of development.Latin American countries although independent republics for many years established theirextension services with outside technical assistance after 1950. Many African countrieshave attained independent status since 1960. Prior to independence, government serviceswere administered in the main by colonial civil servants. There were few eduoatednationals and very limiteL training facilities. Thus the newly independent nations werefaced with the enormous tasks not only of organizing a government but simultaneouslybuilding such institutions as schools and universities to train personnel, research centersand the whole infra, - structure required for economic development. Government policies variedas to the emphasis on agricultural development and the resources allotted to extensioneducation.Cons'quently, some countries have fairly well established extension serviceswhile others are still operating on a very limited scale.In countries where extension services operate within the Ministry of Agriculture,organizational structure varies from separately organized and staffed extension servicesto the assignment of extension education function to ministry technical personnel alongwith their other administrative, research or regulatory duties. In many countries, theextension service has a ligited field staff but must depend upon technical departments ofthe ministry for specialist support. Often such support is not available when needed. 308 Efforts of development countries up to this time have been largely directed to buildingthe infrastructure of an extension service. This has included: (1) establishing anorganization, (2) recruiting and training personnel, and (3) developing educational methodsand techniques appropriate to the socioeconomic conditions prevailing in each country.Development of an organization has been hindered by lack of an established civilservice, instability of many governments, especially those in newly independent countries,lack of enabling legislation and lack of understanding by political bodies of the specialnature and requirement of an extension service organization. Consequently, many extensionservices are handicapped by inadequate financial support, frequent changes in administrativeleadership and fluctuation in levels of staffing.Shortage of technically trained personnel is common to all developing countries. Thisproblem is being solved in varying degree by (1) the concurrent development of agriculturalschools, colleges and universities, (2) establishing extension training centers as in Indiaand some other countries, and (3) supplementing the limited numbers of technically trainedstaff with subprofessionals who work under close supervision. In many countries the ratioof technically trained extension workers to numbers of rural families is 1 : 10,000 or more.Progress in extension education is necessarily slow in such situations.Educational methods and operating procedures developed for use with farm families inthe United States and Europe have not always been effective when applied to societies andcultures with different traditions, values and levels of education, and under differentphilosophies of civil government. Channels of communication are limited and changes in .attitude and actions must often be motf.vated through appeals to different values.Research into attitudes, values and methods of inducing change is as yet meager and needsto be conducted in each society in ora.er to improve methods of extension education.AgricUltural production has been the main thrust of extension services in developingcountries up to this time with lesser emphasis on the general improvement of rural living.Even countries such as India, where the policy has been one of carrying out broadprogrammes of community development, has been forced to concentrate most of its effortson food production.et In spite of technological advances which have triggered dramatic increases in production in advanced nations, world population is increasing faster than food supplies.It took from the beginning of time until 1967 to reach a living world population of3 billion people, but it will take only 33 more years for that population to become6 billion. The earth is now adding more than a million people each week, most of themin the less developed countries.These countries already have a food deficit of 16 million tons of grain annuallymet by imports from the developed countries. The new mouths born in the developingareas of the world by 1980 will need an estimated 300 million additional tons ofgrain or its equivalentnearly all.that the United States, Canada and WesternEurope combined now produce.Annual world food production barely stays the same, while population increaseswildly.As a result, worldwide per capita food production in 1965-66 fell by 2 percent.In Latin America, Africa and the Far East, it fell approximately 5 percent.These are discouraging statistics.*With the cold certainty of mathematics, we are suddenly aware that by 1980 theremay not be enough food anywhere in the world to placate famine's force.* In 1971, food production increased by 3 percent, exclusing fisheries. PAO has estimatedthat the number of under nourished people in the world stands at 300 million 500 millionlittle different from the estimate for the period 1957-59. Famine on an international scale can destroy world order and politicalstability.World peace becomes more precarious with increasing unrest withinhungry nations. Therefore, all nations have a vital concern with preventingfamiue that leads to political violence .It is clear now that any stop-gap food aid for disasters or crises inthese countries must be fully coordinated with long-run self-help programs.In the long run, most of the adJitional foo'i well have to come fromexpanded food production in the hungry nations themselves.If these nations can move quickly enough, the food supply may be able towin the deadly serious race with over-population. \"1.2Failure of food production to keep pace with expanding populations in developingcountries has been interpreted by some people as an indication of failure of extensioneducation as a force in agricultural development. This is like saying health servicesare of no value when there are only a few poorly trained doctors in a country with nohospitals, medical supplies or other health facilities. Admittedly, extension educationhas not yet had the impact on agricultural production expected by many of its proponents.But it must be recognized that \"certain conditions must exist for the fullest agriculturaldevelopment of any nation. There must be (1) markets, (2) constantly improving technology,(3) supplies and equipment locally available, (4) incentives, and (5) adequate transpor-tation.Contributing to the strength of these conditions are the nation's degree ofliteracy, its communication system, and the kinds of government policies, land tenurecustons, and social mores that encourage initiative.\" _1/ Many of these conditions areinadequate or entirely lacking in the developing countries. Although extension educationalprograms can help improve these conditions, they must first be provided for in the policiesof the countries, with agricultural development as a national goal, and with relevantresearch, education and extension programs to carry them out. .It must also be, borne in mind that\"Before village cultivators can be expected to get excited about taking upimproved agricultural practices, they have to undergo some inner changes.First, they must recognize they no longer have to live as they have lived, andthey must want things they don't now have. Second, they must have been made aware ofthe exstence of better practices and of their benefits. And third, they must haveseen these practices demonstrated in their villages, must have understood them, andrealized they were possible to adopt.Having been taken through these steps of change, they can now be educated tosee the importance, to them, of adopting improved agricultural practices. Byintensive extension education, the cultivators can be taught with stronger emphasisupon carrying out the recommended improved agricultural practices. They can cow bebrought to see that the adoption of the improved agricultural practices will providethem the wealth they must have if they are to get the new things they now expressas wants.\" 2/ _1/People and Fool - ECOP Subcommittee on International Programs, USA, p.3.2/ Frontiers of Change - reproduced by J. Paul Leagans, Professor of Extension Education,Cornell.For consideration of members of the Seminars Comparative ExtensionEducation, page 9. Preliminary conclusions of a current study of extension service in Latim America J indicate that although technical assistance agencies have aided these countries to buildextension institutions, these institutions have not been used well. Productivity levelsin traditional food crops have remained considerably below feasible levels. Extensionstaffs have not coordinated well with national food production programs. Rather, extensionhas gone its own way and has been limited in impact to marginal returns that accrue tostrictly \"educational\" inputs. The extension services established with technical andfinancial assistance have seemed to national governments to be too expensive to carry onafter financial aid was withdrawn, with the exception of one or two countries. Corsequentlythe large non-salary component of budgets - transport and per diem of field extensionworkers, equipment and supplies was reduced to the point where workers were largelyineffective.Furthermore, finance ministers would not allow extension directors to reducethe number of agencies andre-deploy the savings to supplies etc.The implication of this study is that extension generally does not have much to offerby itself.\"The old technology cannot be significantly improved upon simply byrearranging factor inputs. New inputs are necessary, and these cost money. To overcomethe farmer's reluctance to make cash outlays on traditional crops, extension must be ableto offer either low risk credit or a high profit ratio. Subsistence farmers will needboth.Extension in the Andes has operated with neither\". Exceptions noted include the\"catalyzes\" effect of closely following a rearrangement of price/cost relations which widenprofit margins.The future of extension in Latin America may lie in serving as the vehicle for thenew package campaigns. The extension services are swinging in this direction withconsiderable success. These packages tie fertilizer, seed, pesticides and other inputstogether with new farm management techniques and a single - usually traditional-crop.Although agricultural progress has been sluggish in the developing countries duringthe period they have been establishing extension services, there is no reason to condemnextension education as a force in agricultural and rural development. In fact, nocountry has been able to achieve maximum agricultural progress without a system forextending technical knowledge to the producer and assisting him in its application. Thesolution lies in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of extension services alongwith the development of other conditions which are essential for agricultural progress.Trends in Eitension DevelopTentTrends in extension development in advanced and developing countries reflectdifferences in stages of development, different problems asosciated therewith anddiffering present and expected needs of their clientele. For these reasons trends inadvanced and developing countries are discussed separately. What is happening in suchcountries as the United States, Australia and other economically advanced countriesgive some indication of future problems to be faced by developing countries.Some Trends in Developing CountriesAs previously stated, much effort to date has been directed toward establishing theinfrapstruoture or organizational framework of extension services in developing countries,recruiting and training staff and learning to develop programs and methods. Accomplishment effMorIIMNIMINONO41./ Edward Rios, AID/ Washington D.C., U.S.A. has varied from country to country. Many services still are handicapped by shortage of qualified staff, frequent turnover in personnel, poor facilities and inadequate financial support.lifnrerthelees an organization does exist with considerable potential for rural and. agricultural improvement. In many countries, rural people have learned that there areand more productive methods of farming and they adopt new practices which show -betAr yields and higher income. A break with traaition is taking place which thetir to agricultural modernization. Developments in several countries indicater!:,,v0\u00b1.7A,nits are beginning to take advantage of this situation.,P:dler of countries are focusing their efforts on one or two crops where new varietiesy,,Aential have been developed through research. So called Mexican wheat varieties in Mexico with the assistance of the Rockefeller Foundation are a notable example.we:e found adapted to conditions in Turkey, Pakistan, India, Tunisia and a number of vqn:,,I Tn7.nntisies. With proper fertilization, irrigation and cultural practices, they produ,:.ed up to three times the yields of locP1 inArieties.Ministries of Agriculture procured thez,Tranged for the fertilizer and credit to the producers.Previously established extension services were ready to launch campaigns demonstrating the new verities and related pr.ntices. They followed up the distribution of seed with educational programs on weed 'vid insect control. This coordinated effort of- farmers and government agencies with extension playing an important role has increased wheat production in Turkey to the point where she has shiftedfrom a wheat importing to a wheat ernortir nation.similar results had been previously achieved in Mexico and are forecast for soi:.e other countries.The rice producing areas of Southeast Asia are focusing on the production of new high yielding dwarf rice varieties developed at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. Results similar to the Mexican wheat program are being achieved in those countries as well as in Senegal in West Africa. Even while the war is underway in Vietnam,rice growers are responding to the promise offered by the new high-yielding rice varieties and are accepting the improved cultural practices advocated by extension.The Mexican hybrid maize program developed with the assistance of the RockefellerFoundation in 1940-50 period was a forerunner of such concerted action focused on a specific commodity. Hybrid maize promises to be in the forefront of agricultural develop- ment in Kenya and many other countries as it was earlier in the United States.These examples are encugh to illustrate a trend toward focusing the efforts of extension and other developmental agencies on specific crops and commodities.The results of the above projects have demonstrated the necessity for closer coordina- tion of effort among extension services, research institutions and technical services of ministries of agriculture. However, since the contribution of research and supply agencies is more concrete and visible, some government officials seem to fail to recognize the role of extensioneducation in the success of these projects. Consequently, some have transferred extensionfunctions and funds to teohnical departments and are not providing their extension services with the resources necessarythr the maintenance of a viable field organization with effective subject matter support. If this is true it is a regrettable trend.Acute food shortages in Southeast Asia have forced concentration of resources on food production and postponement or reduction in some of other community development efforts. Some observers identify this as the beginning of a trend toward making extension the centralrural educational development agency including those areas of community developmentprograms, such as nutrition, sanitation, home improvement and community resource developmentconsidered of highest priority by rural people. If such a trend materializes9extension concepts and programs in these countries will more closely' resemble those of the Cooperative Extension Service of the United States. Training in extension educaticn concepts and methods had to be obtained abroad in theearly stages of development in many countries. With inauguration of extension educationcourses in local training institutions and the establishment of extension training centresoften with the assistance of international organizations, foreign participant training hasfallen off.This policy allows more personnel to be trained at less cost with trainingbetter adapted to local needs.Some Trends in Economically Advanced CountriesTrends in extension development in the more advanced countries are responses to anumber of factors and forces. These include: (1) natural evolution of a dynamic serviceto meet ever changing needs; (2) economic forces which are changing farming practices andrural living; and (3) social forces which demand attention.The evolution of extension services under enlightened leadership is illustrated bydevelopments in Australia since 1962. That year marked the first Australian universityteaching appointment in agricultural extension at the University of Queensland.As of1969, nine of thirteen universities provide degree courses in agriculture and seven of thesenow have at least some formal courses in agricultural extension at the undergraduate and/orgraduate levels. Extension research was also being undertaken. About 40 graduate extensionworkers with considerable field experience had completed the postgraduate diploma inagricultural extension at Melbourne or Queensland Universities with significant effect onthe state extension services.Farm management extension has had very considerable accent and a relativelylarge number of graduates (about 150) are in private practice or farmer groupemployment as management consultants or advisers. Commercial organizations havealso recruited a lot of experienced graduates and diplomates from the state services,so the latter have their staffing problems.The Commonwealth has considerably expanded its financial support for the stateextension services on the basis of approved project or programme support, rather than\"untagged\" grantsinaid. To administer the expanded Commonwealth extension servicesGrant, to be responsible for the Commonwealth's interest in agricultural extension,and, less publicized, to provide a national professional leadership grouplthe ExtensionServices Division was formed within the (Commonwealth) Department of PrimaryIndustry.JEnropean agricultural advisory services are placing increased emphasis on marketing andfarm management as well as farm mechanization. This is a natural response to the competitivesituation in agriculture arising from development of the European Common Market. In 1966, the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges(NASULGC) and the United States Department of Agriculture, conducted a national study ofthe cooperative extension service at the request of the EXtension Committee on Organizationand Policy (ECOP). A high level committee collected information from state extensionservices, universities, agricultural industries, rural leaders and the general public.The joint committee report 11./ analyzes current activities of the Cooperative ExtensionService and develops the Committee's recommendations for the future. Although implementation of the recommendation will depend upon national and state legislation as well as the51 State Extension Services and the Federal Extension Service, the report summarizes theopinions of many people on the direction extension should go over a 10 year period. .22R.N. Farquhar Extension Service Division, Department of Primary Industry, Canberra.Personal correspondence with the author.2.1A People and a Spirit A report of the joint USDA NASULGC Extension StudyCommittee, USDA, Washington, D.C. 95 pages. The joint committee analyzed current activities of the Cooperative Extension Service and projected chances in extension manpower allocations for the nation in various program areas over a period of 10 years. Program areas were classified under four general headings: (1)Agriculture and Related Industries, (2) Social and Economic Development, (3) Quality of Living, and some indications as to trends in extension programs in the United States.The basic thrust of recommendations contained in this report calls for the Cooperative Extension Service to adapt its staff and program effort toserve more adequately the broad range of social and economic problems of the nation while strengthening its assistance to the agricultural sector of the economy.Another basic recommendation calls for Cooperative Extension Service to stand ready for an organized, active, and significant role in technical assistance and development programs of the less developed nations of the world. The efforts already al?..-de by :.(2operativeXtension Service to improve the effeG=.1veness of its programs should be acknowledged. In recent years, there has been a marked improvement in the professional qualifications of specialists.Many area or multi-county specialized agents have been assigned. Efforts have been increased in adaptive research, and increasing attention is being directed 'oward educational programs which relate agriculturalproduction enterprises to the total sales and distribution system of the nation.The role of the extension agent has increasingly involved a commitment to the community and those groups active within the community. Developmental programs have been added which deal with a broad range of social and economic factors.Family and youth programs have become increasingly effective in the urban environment. New arrangements with agencies and local organizations have emerged.Increasing emphasis has been given to staff training and development and considerable progress has been made in the level of forms:.training possessed by extension personnel.The Joint Study Committee recommends that the Cooperative Extension Service seek maximum effectiveness from its manpower resources by:Eknploying more specialized area agents.Upgrading the professional competence of personnel.Increasing use of specialists holding joint research, teaching, and extension appointments.Experimenting with new organizational structures suoh as multi-countystaffing and specialist teams.Employing personnel trained in disciplines relevant to the assigned educational role.Increasing the use of consulting teams on a contract basis for special problems.Increasing the use of non-Extension personnel hired for specific work on a part-time, one-time, or periodic basis for help in disciplines not available on the regular staff. 314 -Making the best use of available staff by utilizing new electronicteaching devices, new communications systems, and new teachinFtechniques.Agriculture and Related Industries - National goals related to economicgrowth, technological change, and to agriculture demand that r -)erzativeExtension maintain an effective prefiram In 47.7%.ou1ture anti Come ,emends :hat the Co(729er.stive Exten-sion Service:-Increase program emphasis in marketing and farm business management.-Reduce the relative percentage of effort in husbandry and productionprograms.-Take advantage of the capabilities of commercial agricultural firms toprovide a part of the technological information.Social and Economic t-Expand efforts in educational programs of social and economic development.-Make significantly greater efforts to assist low-income farmers indecisions other than agricultural production, including selection ofalternative vocations.-Expand program activity dealing with natural resclIrces and theenvironment.-Build upon extension strengths in rural areas, but also increase thecommitment to the central city in the years ahead.Quality of Living-Expand extension programs of youth and family education.-Expand sharply the educational programs to help the disadvantaged andthe alienated.-Emphasize the disciplines of social and behavioral sciences as well asthose of home economics in filling positions to support futureprograms related to the family.-Assign personnel to work in extension youth programs who are qualifiedin disciplines relevant to the education and motivation of youth.-Adapt and expand 4-H as well as provide additional youth educationalactivities where 4-H is not a suitable mechanism for meeting specificproblems.-Undertake continuing national as well as state dialogue with leaders ofcooperating organizations, to seek ways by which each organization canassist in meeting the merging broad human development problems. - 315 - International Extension-Evolve lona-a-are* prcaram strategy for the U.S. overseas agricultural development aauaTams.

Until passage of the Smith-Lever Act by the Congress of the United States in 1914, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, State Departments of Agriculture, Colleges of Agriculture, farmers associations and other groups attempted to conduct unrelated and often isolated extension activities.Legislation brought extension activities together in one organization and provided a sound basis fur coordinatedefforts in agricultural teaching, research and extension. Many developing countries aadsome more advanced countries have failed thus far to centralize extension -type functions in a single adequately staffed and financed institution with its responsibilities and scope of operations well defined. Such national legislation provides a legal framework forcoordinating the essential elements of agricultural and rural development and, if inte- grated with a national civil service, provides a degree of permanence and security Whichreduces staff turnover and improves continuity of extension programs.Adequate fill-maim is a second basic need of all extension services.Finance ministers must recognize that extension programs require intimate contact with masses of rural people. This means not only large numbers of adequately trained field,supervisory and technical support staff but transport, supplies and equipment. Where finances are limited, it is better to maintain fever adequately financed local agencies, with emphasis on work through farmer committees and rural leaders, than to employ larger numbers of personnel with no means of contacting the farmers and carrying on their educational activities. Some countries in Latin America have felt unable to continue their extension service at former levels when foreign technical end financial support was withdrawn. Budget support programs through the use of P.L. 480 funds (local currency paid for U.S. agricultural commodities under conceasional sales agreement) are helping to remedy this situation in some instances. Salaries for extension workers comparable to those in competing agencies and industries will enable extension services to retain competent personnel and justify more emphasis on staff development.The organization of extension services can be greatly strengthened in most countries through the greater use of technical subject matter specialists under the administrative control of the extension director. They are needed not only to provide technical support for often inadequately trained field personnel but to develop impact programs in their respective fields and to strengthen coordination with agricultural research and the programs of related technical departments. .1/ A People and a Spirit - A Report of the joint USDL- RASULGC Extension Study Committe\", USDA, Washington D.C. 95 pages. 316 The advanced countries as well an the developing countries feel the need for moreeffective specialist support. Agricultural specialization has progressed so far and-problems of production, marketing, management and allocation of resources have become soinvolved that local extension agents need more and better trained specialists, availableon an area basis.Use of many young and inexperienced extension workers having minimum training andoften lacking rural '.vi'e-,-7gz-ound demands close supervision and guidance. This is anotherarea requiring strengt.ning in many countries.Extension work with rural women and youth is barely getting started in most countries.In view of the influence of the mother, not only upon the health and welfare of thefamily but upon agricultural production, this is an area of extension wort' that countriescannot afford to neglect.Farm youth must be taught the advantages as well as the methods of modernagriculture if future leadership is to be available for f\"..ontinuing rural progress. Theattitudes and values developed among young people today will profoundly influence thedevelopment of rural communities in the future.Improvement in Training at all levels is a continuing need in all countries. Theneed is most apparent in countries with newly established extension services which arerecruiting and training new staff. But the need for upgrading of personnel and improvingtheir ability to serve fast changing needs of an expanding clientele is just as importantin the old established services. In both developing and advanced countries ability toorganize people for cooperation on common problems, and an aptitude for working withrepresentatives of other development agencies and institutions is becoming increasinglynecessary.Few extension workers have sufficient understanding of group dynamics, andknowledge concerning the social and psychological principles involved. Farm and homemanagement, marketing and processing and wise use of credit are other areas needingunderstanding by all present day extension workers. Fundamental to improvement in trainingis the establishment of a training policy in each country. This involves setting traininggoals, developing facilities, adequate financing, assignment of responsibility fortraining activities and periodic review of progress.Definite irn)rovemellt is needed in extension programs. It is not enough to askpeople what are their problems and baae the program on those problems, although anunderstanding of people's wants and needs is fundamental to effective extension education.The extension worker, as an educational leader needs to discover, and help his peoplediscover, opportunities for greater agricultural productivity, higher incomes and betterliving.A much more positive approach is needed than has been displayed in the past. Whenopportunities have been discovered, often with the help of specialist, those should beselected for concentrated effort which offer the greatest possibility of accomplishmentand satisfaction to the people. Their council is important in deciding on projects theyare ready to carry out and in setting of goals. Because of their knowledge of localconditions, their competence in organizing for community action and their training ineducational and information methods, extension personnel should be actively involved indeveloping and carrying out national and regional production programs. Coordination of extension .ro; ams with icultural research creditcoonativesand deve opmen a programs of technical departments is an acute nee in many countries.The advantages of such coordination have been demonstrated in the Mexican wheat introductionprogram in Turkey, the rice improvement program in Southeast Asia, the service systems insome Latin American couAtries such as Peru and in other areas. As developed under -317- Extension Or in Chapter 3, no one institution working alone can assure agricul- tural and rural progress. Neither can may institutions working independently and in competition.But working in unison, progress is almost assured.Resources Required for Extension Development.Agricultural extension services require several kinds of resources for the establishment and continuing effective operation. They include: (1) human resources of trained anddedicated personnel, (2) physical resources and facilities including supplies and equipment with which to work; (3) technical resources, scientific knowledge adapted to use in agricultural and rural development; (4) financial resources to assure continuity ofoperation, and growth to meet increasing needs of rural people; (5) political and admini- strative support; and (6) an institutional environment conducive to rural development and agricultural progress.Human ResourcesAn extension service is primarily people. Their attitudes and behaviour determinethe effectiveness of the organization. It is important to have enough personnel toorganize and conduct programs reaching all members of the rural community. But this may not be possible for services in early stages of development or where funds are limited.Quality of personnel is more important. And quality is achieved through careful selectionand training.Technical trained personnel are simply not available in sufficient numbersto staff all public and private developmental institutions and agencies in many countries.Therefore the development of schools and colleges must proceed concurrently with thedevelopment of extension and other services. Extension cannot approach its potentialuntil such institutions have operated effectively for a number of years.Organized programs of staff development are essential to new and long established services alike. Services in developing countries must make up for inadequate pre-servicetraining.The Joint-Study Committee in the United States recommended that \"the presentextension staffing for staff training be doubled Extension must do for itself whatit seeks to do for other organizations; namely, improve organizational efficiency and staff competency.\"Physical Resources Lack of transport, demonstration and teaching equipment, supplies and facilities with which to work can make an extension worker almost entirely ineffective. His work beingwith people he must be able to contact them on their farms and in their homes.Without transportation contacts are limited to those who come to see him and the few who livewithin walking distance. Demonstration and teaching equipment are the tools of hisprofession.Few people learn new practices only from the spoken word. They must be shown how as well as told. Supplies of improved seed for demonstrations, samples ofmaterial used in sewing, efficient equipment for demonstrating the use of fertilizersand insecticides are equally important, always bearing in mind that equipment used indemonstrations should also be available to farmers and farm women who are expected tofollow recommended practice. These things seem so obvious it should not be necessary torepeat them but extension workers in nearly every country are handicapped by lack of thephysical resources necessary for effective work. In many cases it would be better toreduce staff and use the savings in salary to provide adequate transport and equipment for the remainder. 318 Technical ResourcesIMMIMINIIMMINV..=.Technical information in agriculture and home economics is the main commodity theextension worker has to dispense. All extension workers are presumed to have basic technicaltraining before assignment. But the adequacy of such +raining varies and may be moretheoretical than practical. FUrthermore, the volume of technology is increasing at anaccelerated rate and is said to double every eight years. Field extension workers must have a readily available source of technical informationin a form applicable in solving problems of agricultural production and rural living.Applied or adaptive research provides the technical information required by the fieldextension worker in developing and executing his program. The statement has often been made that \"you can't have an extension service untilyou have technical information to extend.\" Although few farmers, even in highlydeveloped agriculture, apply all of the available information, there is an element oftruth in this statement. New crop varieties providing dramatic increases in yield, or useof a new and highly effective insecticide are easy to \"extend\" because the dramaticresults can be demonstrated. But management practices which reduce costs and increaseprofits, and improved sanitation which reduces disease are equally important and acceptableto rural people when well understood. Financial Resources Adequate finds with which to operate an extension service is the most commonly expressedneed of extension administrators. An extension service requires more funds than some othergovernment agencies because of the large'number of personnel required, as well as transport,supplies and equipment. Since the effectiveness of extension. education depends so much onthe energy and initiative of the staff, high morale is especially important. Underpaid andillequipped personnel are unlikely to display much enthusiasm in their work. Shortage offunds to finance government services is common to nearly all developing countries.Generally, extension services are expected to operate within budgets and salary scalesset for all government services, often without regard to the special aptitudes, abilitiesand technical competence required for effective extension work. Consequently, extensionservices lose their best qualified staff members to private industry or institutions notsubject to government salary scales. Technical assistance agencies have sometimes attemptedto upgrade staff by supplementing their salaries or providing other fringe benefits. Thisworks as long as such financial assistance is available. But when assistance is withdrawn,salaries may be reduced with lowered morale and loss of staff as a result. The onlypermanent solution appears to be a budget policy which takes into account the essentialityof extension services and a salary scale which give due allowance to staff qualificationsand excellence of performance. Political and Administrative Support Although extension personnel must refrain from partisan political activities andserve all rural people regardless of political affiliation, support by the currentpolitical administration is essential. One Country established an entirely independentextension service unaffiliated with any government ministry. Soon it found itself withoutsupport in its efforts to obtain appropriations and in disfavor Idth the technicaldepartments of the ministry of agriculture. Extension needs admnistrative support of bothbudget and program. It must conduct itself in such a manner that each succeedingadministration recognizes its value and gives it the necessary support. . -319 Rural Institutional EnvironmentAn extension service working alone can do little to raise the productivity and level of living of rural people. A land tenure system that assures the producer his rightful share of benefits from improved practices; markets at fair prices; sources of agricultural seeds, supplies and equipment, credit at reasonable rates; roads and transportation; research and experiment stations; schools and medical services all are required for rural progress. Absence or ineffectiveness of any of these institutions and services reduces the efficiency of the others including extension.
