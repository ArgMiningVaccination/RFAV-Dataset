Failure to do so may result in loss of immigrationstatus. /c183Students in B-1/B-2 status are not eligible to register foracademic coursework. For more information regarding thisDHS regulation, please contact the International Student &Scholar Services office. /c183Audit courses are not counted toward a full course of studyfor the purpose of maintaining an F-1 or J-1 status.Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students may audit courses only ifthey are registered full-time for courses taken for credit. SEVIS: Student and Exchange Visitor System Universities enrolling F-1 and J-1 students are required to re - port to the DHS any student who fails to maintain status, fails to enroll, or who completes his or her program. In addition, eachterm and no later than 30 days after the beginning of the semes - ter, universities are required to report the following registration information: 1) full-time registration or authorization for reducedcoursework; and2) current address of each enrolled student. Finally, ISSS reports to DHS immediately if students with - draw, take Temporary Leave, or drop below full-time registra - tion without ISSS authorization.

Regular office hours are Monday through Friday, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm.Special Registrations Audit Registration Note: International students in F-1 or J-1 visa status should not audit courses. Audit courses are not counted toward a full course ofstudy for the purpose of maintaining an F-1 or J-1 status. There - fore, F-1 and J-1 students may audit courses only if they are regis - tered full-time for courses taken for credit. Students who attend a class but do not wish to receive a final grade or credit for the course must register as an auditor. Tuitionand fees for auditors are the same as those for students register - ing for credit. Changes to or from audit may be made through the eighth week of the semester. Audit registration is subject to thesame regulations as credit registration. Faculty may establishstandards of class participatio n and attendance for auditing that must be met if a student is to remain in audit status. To register asan auditor, choose \"Audit\" as the grade type when processing aregistration. Internship Registration An internship is a combination of academic study and sub - stantive paid or unpaid work experience, approved by a super-vising faculty member in advance. Registration for internships is open to qualified degree students in good academic standing.Academic departments may have additional requirements, but generally the prerequisite for registration at the undergraduatelevel is completion of 30 credit hours of course work (12 credithours for transfer students) with a minimum grade point averageof 2.0. The maximum number of internship credit hours that may count toward an undergraduate major is six credit hours. Stu-dents may take up to a maximum of 12 internship credit hoursthat count toward the 120 credit hours of undergraduate degreeprogram. Customarily, students will not have more than 6 in - ternship credit hours in any graduate program and some pro - grams may set lower limits. To receive academic credit, the work for the internship must be more substantive than adminis - trative, with non-administrative work comprising in general at least 85% of the work performed. All students are encouraged to work with an advisor in the Career Center. For additional information about internships, callor visit the Career Center, Butler Pavilion 5th floor,202-885-1804. Information is also available at:www.american.edu/careercenter . Registration for internships is during the registration period for the fall or spring semester or summer session. Students may add these courses until the end of the second week of classes inthe fall and spring semesters. Students must have met all prerequisites, secured the work position, and confirmed their work schedule with their site su - pervisor prior to registration. The student and supervising fac - ulty member must agree upon and document the credit value of the experience, depending on the nature of the academic compo -Registration, Tuition and Expenses, and Financial Aid 31nent and the number of hours required for the work component. The recommended standards for academic credit may vary buttypically are: 7-10 hours per per week for 5-6 cred - its. Students work throughout the term (14 weeks or more). Students must submit a completed and approved Internship Registration Form, along with the Internship Consent and Re - lease Form to the Office of the University Registrar. Forms are available at: www.american.edu/provost/registrar/pdf/list.cfm . Independent Study Registration Students in good academic standing generally may register for two types of independent study. In an Independent Readingcourse, a student will read a body of material with a minimum offormal instruction. In an Independent Research project, the stu - dent will research a topic agreed upon by the student and the in - structor. Individual academic units may have restrictions on this policy. Before processing registration for these courses, the student and the supervising faculty member must agree upon and docu - ment the title, objective, scope, and credit value (1-6) of the pro - ject to be pursued. The department chair or program director must approve the project and faculty member's involvement. Inparticular, he or she must attest that the project does not dupli-cate a course already offered in the semester's schedule whichwould be available to the student. Independent study may not be used as credit toward the Col- lege Writing or University Mathematics requirements, or to-ward General Education. Independent study that substitutes fora major requirement must be approved by the teaching unit chairor equivalent. A temporary gra de of IP (course in progress) may be assigned, at the discretion of the instructor, at the conclusionof the semester of registration. Students must submit a completed and approved Independ - ent Study Registration Form to AU Central. Forms are available at:www.american.edu/provost/registrar/pdf/list.cfm . Community Service-Learning Projects Undergraduate students may have the opportunity to earn credit for community service performed in conjunction withcourses in which they are enrolled. In addition to at least 40hours of approved field work, community service-learning pro - jects require an academic component related to the course with which the service project is associated. Students earn one creditfor each community service-learning project they successfullycomplete, with a maximum of three credits applied to gradua - tion. Credit earned for a community service-learning project cannot be used to fulfill requirements for General Education,College Writing, or University Mathematics requirements. Onlythe pass/fail grading option is available. Permission of the in - structor of the course is required. The Office of Campus Life certifies community service organizations and provides orienta - tion sessions for students. For more information on registrationfor Community Service-Learning Projects, go to www.american.edu/ocl/volunteer .

Students on academic probation will be re-quired to obtain the signature of their academic dean before theywill be permitted to withdraw from all courses and/or separatefrom the university. Course and Schedule Information Course Numbers Each course is designated by a subject code and a course number. The subject code identifies a particular academic disci - pline or teaching unit in the curriculum; = Anthro - pology; ECON = Economics; ARTH = Art History. The numbers identify the level of the course as follows: 0-99,Non-Credit Courses; 100-299, Undergraduate Advanced Courses; that allow qualified, advanced undergradu - ates; 600-899 Graduate Course s. No undergraduate students may take 600-799 graduate courses except under specific cir - cumstances where the courses are cross-listed with undergradu - ate courses as part of a combined BA/MAprogram or by special permission of the associate dean of the academic unit. Credit Hour Value All undergraduate and graduate courses are valued in credit hours. American University uses the Carnegie Classificationdefinition of a semester credit hour. Asemester credit hour is de - fined as at least 12.5 hours of direct faculty instruction per se - mester (in class, online, or remote sites) with at least 25 hours ofstudent work outside of that direct instruction, typically conducted over a 15-week semester, or an equivalent amount offaculty instruction and work over a different time period. Gener - ally, each credit hour is equal to 50 minutes of class instruction a week for 15 weeks or 750 minutes of class instruction per se - mester. Course Descriptions and Syllabuses Descriptions of permanent courses currently in the university curriculum are listed by course number in Course Descriptions at the end of this catalog. Catalog course descriptions, as well asselected and rotating topics course descriptions, are availableeach semester from the Schedule of Classes atwww.american.edu/provost/registrar/schedule/index.cfm . A syllabus describing the general nature and scope of each course is available from the department offering the course forthree years. Course Prerequisites Many courses call for a minimum background of knowledge, as indicated by prerequisite courses cited in individual descrip - tions. Titles and numbers are those of American University courses; equivalent courses satisfactorily completed at other ac-credited institutions also meet prerequisite requirements bytransfer credit. Students are responsible for entering the class with the re- quired competence. Thus, prerequisites warn students of theknowledge they are to bring with them in order to meet the ex-pected standards of performance. Class Periods Day classes, except those on Wednesday and Saturday, ordi- narily meet two days a week for 75 minutes a meeting. Wednes - day classes ordinarily meet once a week for two hours and 30 minutes. Some classes meet three times a week for 50 minutes ameeting. Evening classes ordinarily meet once a week for twohours and 30 minutes or twice a week for 75 minutes a meeting. Courses involving laboratory, studio, discussion groups, or workshops may vary from these schedules. Independent readingcourses, independent research or study projects, internships, and similar kinds of study opportunities meet according to the spe - cial arrangement with the school, department, or faculty mem - bers concerned. Cancellation of Courses Occasionally it is necessary to cancel a scheduled course be - cause of low enrollment, the last-minute unavailability of an in - structor, or other unavoidable reasons. Every effort is made to announce the cancellation before the first class meeting, but thisis not always possible. If a course is canceled, a student whodoes not choose to transfer to another course may receive a fullrefund of the tuition and fees paid for the canceled course bycompleting a refund request form in the Office of Student Ac - counts.34 Registration, Tuition and Expenses, and Financial AidClass Attendance Individual classes may have different attendance require - ments; it is the student's responsibility to check each course syl - labus to determine policy and to speak to instructors regarding excused absences such as major religious holidays (posted an - nually by the Office of Provost and Kay Spiritual Life Center), medical or mental health events, and athletic team events.Unexcused absences may affect a student's grades. Studentsmay not be penalized for excused absences but are required tomake-up all work missed as a result of the excused absence. Veterans and others receiving government benefits are re - minded that the paying agency may have specific attendance policies. Emergency Cancellation of Classes Classes at American University are expected to meet accord - ing to the announced schedule and no instructor is authorized to change the day, hour, or place of any meeting. Unless cancella - tion of classes is announced publicly, classes will meet. When cancellation of classes is necessary, instructors are expected toarrange for additional reading, study assignments, or class meet - ings to compensate for attendance time lost. Final Exam Policy Students are expected to take final exams at the times sched- uled by the Office of the University Registrar. Accommodationsare made for students with excused absences, students with doc-umented disabilities, students with two exams scheduled for thesame time, and students with three or more final exams on a given day. Students should notify their advisors who will workwith the instructors to resolve the conflict. Unexcused absencesat final exams may result in a penalty. Students must follow anyadditional policies or procedures set by individual academicunits. Waitlist Rules Students often \"waitlist\" if they are considering adding a course or a new section of a course in lieu of the section in whichthey are currently enrolled. Students may not waitlist for morethan one section of any course at any given time. Students maynot waitlist for more than three unique courses at any point intime. Student Responsibility Students are responsible for their behavior, academic and otherwise, at American Univer sity. American University ex - pects that students, as mature members of the academic commu - nity, will adhere to the highest standards of personal and academic integrity and good taste. To protect their academic status, students should seek the ap- propriate approval of their academic program advisors. It ishighly recommended that students keep their own records of alltransactions with the university (grade reports, registrationschedules and changes, incomplete forms, etc.). It is also advisable to keep copies of all tests and papers sub- mitted in fulfillment of course work. Tuition, Fees, and Other Charges Undergraduate students who register for 12 to 17 credit hours are assessed tuition at the full-time rate. Undergraduate studentswho register for fewer than 12 credit hours are assessed tuitionbased on the number of credit hours taken. Undergraduate stu - dents who register for more than 17 credit hours are charged the full-time tuition rate with an additional charge for each credithour over 17. Graduate and nondegree students are assessed tuition per credit hour. Washington College of Law (WC L) students are assessed tu - ition on the same basis as undergra duate students. However, the WCL tuition rate differs from that of the rest of the university.The off-campus tuition rate differs from the rate for on-cam - pus courses. Full-time undergraduate students, however, who register for courses both on and off campus are assessed tuitionat the on-campus full-time rate. Charges for institutes and other courses with special tuition rates are listed in the Schedule of Classes or in publications orwebsites supplied by the offering university department. Given the probable continuation of current economic condi - tions, as well as the need to continue to accelerate the academic development of the university, it is reasonable to expect that tui - tion and fee increases will be required each year in the near fu - ture.Registration, Tuition and Expenses, and Financial Aid 35Tuition Undergraduate Students Full-time (12-17 credit hours) ......... $19,491 (Above 17 hours, $1,299 per additional credit hour)Part-time (per credit hour) ............1 , 2 9 9 Graduate Students Full- and part-time: (per credit hour) .......1 , 3 9 9 Graduate Business Program:12-17 credit hours (per semester) ....... $16,507 (Above 17 hours, $1,261 per additional credit hour)Fewer than 12 credit hours (per credit hour) . . 1,261 Law Students (Above 17 hours, $1,700 per additional credit hour)Part-time (per credit hour) ............1 , 7 0 0 Nondegree Students Course level 100-400 (per credit hour) .....$ 1 , 2 9 9 Course level 500 and above (per credit hour). . . 1,399 Off-Campus Programs (per credit hour) ................ $ 1 , 1 7 8 Note: Auditors pay the same charges as students enrolled for credit and are subject to all applicable special fees.Non-AU Study Abroad Fee For all American University undergraduate students partici- pating in non-AU study abroad programs via a Permit to StudyAbroad.

Students registering after the advance registration period (di - rect registration) must pay the balance due, less expected finan - cial aid, on the day they register. American Installment Plan (AIP) The American Installment Plan (AIP) is available to all full-time students. This plan covers the academic year and re - quires ten monthly payments from June 1 through March 1, or twelve monthly payments from May 1 through April 1. Formore information, please go to www.american.edu/fi - nance/studentaccounts/AIP.cfm . The American Guaranteed Tuition Single Payment Plan [Ameriplan ContractualAgreement] Available to incoming freshmen who do not receive any fi- nancial aid, this plan allows students to stabilize tuition expensesby prepaying four years' tuition at the entering academic yearrate. For more information contact the Associate Director ofStudent Accounts at 202-885-3559. Late Payment and Financial Restrictions A finance charge will be assessed against a student's account for failure to meet the initial payment due date. The universitywill use a rate of 1 percent per month to compute the financecharge. The university figures the finance charge on the stu-dent's account by applying the 1 percent per month to the ad - justed balance of the student's account. In addition, failure to make payment when due will result in a financial \"restriction\" being placed on the student's account. Thefinancial restriction will result in a \"hold\" being placed on thestudent's academic records, including transcript and diploma,and may also result in denial of priority registration and use ofthe payment plan or other credit privileges. A student who has once had a financial restriction placed against his or her account may be denied future priority registra - tion and payment plan privileges even though the student has been reinstated upon payment of the reinstatement fee. Re - peated failure to make payments when due may result in sever - ance of the student's relationship with the university. Students who incur financial obligations in the parking and traffic office, library, health center, or athletic department maybe subject to late payment fees and financial restriction proce - dures. Students who fail to pay tuition or fees will be responsible for all costs of collection, including attorney's fees in the amount of15 percent of the balance due.Employer or Agency Tuition Assistance A student requesting employer or agency billing arrange - ments must furnish Student Accounts with a valid contract or purchase order before the first day of classes. A contract or purchase order must contain the following in - formation: (1) student name and ID number, (2) term of atten - dance, (3) specific costs (and dollar amounts) to be paid by the sponsor (tuition, books, supplies, fees), (4) sponsor's billing ad - dress, and (5) contract or purchase order number or accounting appropriation, if applicable. Documentation submitted in lieu ofa valid purchase order will not relieve a student of financial re - sponsibility. In case of partial assistance, the student is required to pay the balance of his or her tuition costs at the time of registration in or - der to be considered registered. A student portion which quali - fies for one of the university payment plans is to be paid according to that plan. Failure to comply will result in the assess - ment of a 1 percent per month finance charge. (See Late Pay - ment and Financial Restrictions , above.) A student entitled to Campus Store credit may obtain a book voucher form from Student Acc ounts. Purchases are permitted through the end of the Add/Drop period. Failure to submit vouchers in a timely manner may result in the assessment of late fees. A student is responsible for paymentof any billed amounts which have been disallowed by his or hersponsor. Employee Tuition Benefits Only full-time permanent faculty or staff employees of American University are eligible for tuition benefits. There is anonrefundable $50 registration fee each semester, in addition toany special course fees, and mandatory sport, technology, andactivity fees. Late registration f ees are not applicable to faculty and staff using employee tuition benefits. The Tuition Remission Application is available online at myau.american.edu . For more information, contact Human Re - sources at 202-885-2591. Refunds and Cancellation of Charges Course Drops Students who reduce their course load (except for full-time undergraduates maintaining 12 credit hours or more) by drop - ping courses during the refund period of the semester will have the course tuition cancellation calculated as of the date of thecourse drop. The student's account must show a credit balancebefore a refund will be processed. MBA modules and other courses on nonstandard schedules have different refund policies, percentages, and dates. In addi - tion, tuition and fee refund policies and deadlines for study abroad and other special programs may differ by program and38 Registration, Tuition and Expenses, and Financial Aidlocation. Students should check with the appropriate office for specific guidelines. Discontinuing attendance in class or notifying an instructor does not constitute an official course drop. Withdrawal Students who completely withdraw from the university must complete the appropriate withdrawal forms in consultation withtheir academic advisor and with Housing and Dining Programs.The amount of tuition to be canceled will be calculated based onthe documented last date of attendance and in accordance withthe tuition cancellation schedule, below. If the withdrawal re - sults in a refund, the request for refund should be made through the student's portal or through AU Central. The student's ac - count must show a credit balance before a refund will be pro - cessed. Discontinuing attendance in classes or notifying instructors does not constitute an official withdrawal. Students who do notofficially withdraw during the cancellation period by submittingthe appropriate forms to AU Central will be responsible for pay - ment of the full amount of the applicable tuition and fees. Tuition Cancellation Schedule The cancellation percentage is based on the date of the course drop or withdrawal:Drop/Withdrawal through the second calendar weeko f c l a s s e s.................... 100% Drop/Withdrawal through the third calendar weeko f c l a s s e s ..................... 5 0 %Drop/Withdrawal through the fourth calendar weeko f c l a s s e s ..................... 2 5 %Withdrawal after the fourth calendar weeko f c l a s s e s ................... NONE Note: the calendar week for cancellation of tuition ends on Fri - day (adjustments are made for legal holidays that fall within the first four weeks of the semester). Students should check the Aca - demic Calendar for specific dates for each semester. Housing Requests for cancellation of room charges must be initiated by the student in writing to Housing and Dining Programs, An - derson Hall, by the withdrawal deadlines. The student must then request any applicable refund through their portal or with AUCentral. The cancellation percentage is based on the date ofwithdrawal:Withdrawal through the first calendar weeko f t h e s e m e s t e r .................. 7 5 %Withdrawal in the second calendar week o f t h e s e m e s t e r .................. 5 0 %Withdrawal in the third calendar weeko f t h e s e m e s t e r .................. 2 5 %Withdrawal after the third calendar weeko f t h e s e m e s t e r ................. NONE Note: academic dismissal will result in a prorated charge for the weeks the student resided in university housing. Meal Plan Students will only be permitted to decrease or drop their meal plan during the first 15 days of the semester. Meal plan adjust - ments are made on a daily prorated basis, not by the number of meals used. Requests for meal plan cancellations must be initi - ated in person in Anderson Hall. Students then may request any applicable student account refund through their portal or withAU Central. Meal plan increases or sign-ups may be done at anytime during the semester. Medical Withdrawal Policy No special waiver or refund of tuition and fees is made when a student discontinues attending classes due to medical reasons. However, when a student is hospitalized on an emergency basisand is therefore unable to formally withdraw from classes, theAssociate Dean may contact the Registrar and request a retroac-tive withdrawal based on the last date that the student attendedclass. The student must file with the Dean of Students evidenceof his or her hospitalization and the date of last attendance inclass as documented by the instructor. Provided that the retroac-tive withdrawal date falls within the tuition cancellation period,and the evidence is received within the same semester, the stu-dent's account will be adjusted accordingly. Tuition Refund Insurance The Tuition Refund Plan can minimize financial loss in - curred in a medical withdrawal from the university. This elective insurance plan provides coverage for tuition and housingcharges. The plan extends and enhances the university's pub - lished refund policy. To participate, applications and fees must be returned before the first day of fall semester classes. The planis coordinated through the Student Health Center.

Once a student is ad - mitted to American University, the Financial Aid office will de - termine need and develop a financial aid award that includes funds from the programs for which the student qualifies. In addi - tion to awarding funds from American University, the university administers federal grant, loan, and work-study programs thatmay be included in the award. The financial aid award may in - clude a combination of American University scholarships, grants, federal grants, feder ally subsidized or unsubsidized loans and/or student employment. To receive consideration for need-based financial aid, a stu - dent must be a United States citizen or eligible non-citizen in a degree program. New students should not wait to be admittedbefore filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid(FAFSA) and the CSS Profile. Afinancial aid application has nobearing on a student's admission application. For more information contact Financial Aid at 202-885-6500 or e-mail facounselor@american.edu.

Students haveone calendar year from the beginning of the course tosuccessfully complete the course. If not completed in thattime frame, the course counts as credits attempted but notearned, and is factored as a grade of F. Frequency of Monitoring The Financial Aid Office monitors the Satisfactory Aca - demic Progress (SAP) of each aid recipient annually. This audit occurs in late May upon the submission of spring grades. Finan - cial Aid will notify in writing students who are not making satis - factory progress. Academic Appeals All questions regarding the factual substance of academic re - cords and all requests for changes to those records must be made to the academic departments. Financial Aid has no authority toalter the academic record of a student. Re-Establishing Financial Aid Eligibility For a student who has failed to maintain satisfactory aca - demic progress, eligibility for financial aid funds may be re-es - tablished by the following means: the changing of a grade, the completion of incomplete or in progress course(s), or the report - ing of a missing grade. Please note that funds are not set aside for40 Registration, Tuition and Expenses, and Financial Aidstudents in these circumstances. Even if the appeal is granted, funds may not be available at that time. Financial Aid Appeals Students failing to meet SAP standards due to extenuating circumstances that precluded them from successfully complet - ing their coursework may submit an appeal in writing to the Fi - nancial Aid Office. Priority consideration will be granted to students who submit an appeal by the deadline stated on the SAPnotification. The request should include a comprehensive de - scription of the circumstances, supporting documentation, and a plan of study with the student's anticipated enrollment for theupcoming academic year. The Appeals Committee will reviewthe appeal, make a recommendation, and send a letter of re - sponse to the student. Refund and Repayment Policy For American University's refund policies regarding tuition, housing, and meal plan charges, see Refunds and Cancellation of Charges . The American University refund policy does not apply to first-time American University students. A \"first-time student\"is defined in Federal regulations as any student who has not at-tended at least one class at American University, or who re-ceived a full refund for previous attendance at AmericanUniversity. Federal (Title IV) Financial Aid Recipients Return of Title IVFunds Policy The Financial Aid Office is required by federal statute to re - calculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who with - draw, drop out, are dismissed, or take a temporary leave prior to completing 60 percent of a payment period or term. The federalTitle IV financial aid programs must be recalculated in these sit - uations. If a student leaves the institution prior to completing 60 per - cent of a payment period or term, the Financial Aid Office recal - culates eligibility for Title IV funds. Recalculation is based on the percentage of earned aid using the following Federal Returnof Title IV funds formula: Percentage of payment period or term completed = thenumber of days completed up to the withdrawal date dividedby the total days in the payment period or term. (Any breakof five days or more is not counted as part of the days in theterm.) This percentage is also the percentage of earned aid. Funds are returned to the appropriate federal program based on the percentage of unearned aid using the following formula: Aid to be returned = (100 percent of the aid that could bedisbursed minus the percentage of earned aid) multiplied bythe total amount of aid that could have been disbursed duringthe payment period or term.If a student earned less aid than was disbursed, the institution would be required to return a portion of the funds and the studentwould be required to return a portion of the funds. When Title IVfunds are returned, the student borrower may owe a debit bal - ance to the institution. If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to him or her, the institution would owe the student a post-withdrawal dis - bursement which must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal. The institution must return the amount of Title IVfunds for which it is responsible no later than 30 days after thedate of the determination of the date of the student's withdrawal.

Refund and Repayment Policy For American University's refund policies regarding tuition, housing, and meal plan charges, see Refunds and Cancellation of Charges . The American University refund policy does not apply to first-time American University students. A \"first-time student\"is defined in Federal regulations as any student who has not at - tended at least one class at American University, or who re - ceived a full refund for previous attendance at American University.Registration, Tuition and Expenses, and Financial Aid 43Federal (Title IV) Financial Aid Recipients Return of Title IVFunds Policy The Financial Aid Office is required by federal statute to re - calculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who with - draw, drop out, are dismissed, or take a temporary leave prior to completing 60 percent of a payment period or term. The federalTitle IV financial aid programs must be recalculated in these sit - uations. If a student leaves the institution prior to completing 60 per - cent of a payment period or term, the Financial Aid Office recal - culates eligibility for Title IV funds. Recalculation is based on the percentage of earned aid using the following Federal Returnof Title IV funds formula: Percentage of payment period or term completed = thenumber of days completed up to the withdrawal date dividedby the total days in the payment period or term. (Any breakof five days or more is not counted as part of the days in theterm.) This percentage is also the percentage of earned aid. Funds are returned to the appropriate federal program based on the percentage of unearned aid using the following formula: Aid to be returned = (100 percent of the aid that could bedisbursed minus the percentage of earned aid) multiplied bythe total amount of aid that could have been disbursed duringthe payment period or term. If a student earned less aid than was disbursed, the institution would be required to return a portion of the funds and the studentwould be required to return a portion of the funds. When Title IVfunds are returned, the student borrower may owe a debit bal-ance to the institution. If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to him or her, the institution would owe the student a post-withdrawal dis - bursement which must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal. The institution must return the amount of Title IVfunds for which it is responsible no later than 30 days after thedate of the determination of the date of the student's withdrawal.

Please contact FinancialAid for current interest rates. Those students who need more than $20,500 over two semes - ters may elect to cover any remaining educational expenses through the Federal Graduate PLUS loan program. American University Programs Graduate Merit-Based Awards American University is committed to quality graduate educa- tion that is responsive to the needs of students, disciplines, theuniversity, and the larger community. Our goals are to provide ahigh quality educational experience for our students and to offergraduate support that assists students in completing their pro-grams of study. To this end the university has set priorities for theallocation and awarding of graduate assistantships and fellow-ships as shown below. Recipients of all awards (except Dissertation Fellowships) must be full-time degree students. Specifically, this requires thata recipient be registered for a minimum of 9 credit hours duringeach semester of the academic year. Award recipients mustmaintain full-time status in order to continue to receive theiraward during the academic year. Awards are intended to assistgraduate students to pursue full-time education. The university has established the following awards to assist graduate students: Graduate Fellowships are merit-based awards that the univer - sity offers in order to attract the most outstanding students in the discipline. These awards are given to new graduate degree stu - dents and normally provide the recipient up to 24 hours of tui - tion remission in degree-related courses in a given academic year and may also provide a stipend. The tuition remissionshould be used during the academic year but may with the per - mission of the teaching unit head be used during the summer session. Special Opportunity Awards for minority students\u2014American Indians, African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islander Americans,Alaskan Native Americans, or Hispanic Americans\u2014providetuition remission from 6 to 24 hours of degree-related courses ina given academic year. The tuition remission should be used44 Registration, Tuition and Expenses, and Financial Aidduring the academic year but may with the permission of the teaching unit head be used during the summer session. Hall of Nations Awards are made by the deans of CAS, KSB, SOC, SIS, or SPA, as appropriate, with the approval of the Deanof Academic Affairs. These awards, which are for tuition remis - sion only, are given to international students who do not have permanent residence status or US citizenship. Dissertation Fellowships are awards that provide recipients with a stipend and up to 18 hours of tuition remission in one aca - demic year for dissertation seminar credits only. These awards are limited to students who have completed all doctoral coursework and comprehensive examinations and who have an ap - proved dissertation proposal at the time of application. Disserta - tion fellows are selected by the deans of CAS, SIS, or SPA, as appropriate, with the approval of the Dean of Academic Affairs. Designated Awards A description of other designated awards, such as United Methodist Awards and Massey Awards and their eligibility re - quirements is distributed annually by the Dean of Academic Af - fairs.Registration, Tuition and Expenses, and Financial Aid 45Veterans' Benefits American University's degree programs are approved for en - rollment of veterans (and eligible dependents of deceased or dis - abled veterans) for educational benefits under the various federal laws relating to veterans. While every effort has beenmade to provide accurate and complete information, changes infederal regulations and university policy may occur at any timewithout notice. The following should be considered informa - tional and not binding on the university. New Students Veterans entering American University must file a Veterans Application for V AEducational Benefits (22-1990) with a certi - fied copy of DD-214 through AU Central. Service men and women wishing to receive Veterans Administration (V A) bene - fits for the first time must present the Serviceman's Application for V AEducational Benefits (22-1990), signed by the EducationOffice and the Commanding Officer. Enrollment Certification(22-1999) is sent to the V A by AU Central to initiate benefits forthe enrollment period. Transfer students who have received V Aeducational benefits at another institution and wish to receive V Abenefits for the firsttime at American University should file a Request for Change ofProgram or Place of Training (22-1995) through AU Central.This form will be sent to the V A with the Enrollment Certifica-tion (22-1999) completed by the university. Continuing Students Continuing students must file the American University V A claim form for educational benefits each semester with AU Cen - tral. All changes in registration (adds, drops, and withdrawals) must be reported to AU Central.Payment and Financial Responsibility With the exception of disabled veterans who are training un - der V ocational Rehabilitation, all beneficiaries of V A educa - tional benefits are personally responsible for the payment of their bills to the university. V A checks for educational benefitsare sent directly to the address designated on the American Uni - versity V A claim form. Eligible students (chapter 30 persons only) who wish to receive advance payment must file an ad - vance payment request form. St udents who are granted advance payment pick up only the first check from AU Central. Thereaf - ter, checks are sent directly to the address on file with the V A. V Abenefits are awarded on the basis of the expected comple - tion of a certain number of credits each semester as stated on the Certification form. The V A interprets \"completion of credits\"differently from the university. Completion of credits is definedb yt h eV Aa sg r a d e so fA ,B ,C ,D ,F ,P ,o rF Z .H o w e v e r ,v e t e r a n swho drop below the anticipated number of credits by receiving aW (withdrawals), L (audit), or N (no grade reported) will be inoverpayment status according to the V A. Benefits will be re-duced for future periods of enrollment or, should no further en-rollment occur, students will have to refund money directly tothe V A. The V A directs the university to notify them of a change in status for students during or immediately after the end of themonth in which the change occurs. Under mitigating circum-stances, exceptions to the above policies may be made throughthe Veterans Administration Regional Office. Forms and information are available from AU Central, Asbury 201, 202-885-8000.46 Registration, Tuition and Expenses, and Financial AidUniversity Regulations and Policies Academic Integrity Code Academic integrity stands at the heart of intellectual life. The academic community is bound by a fundamental trust that pro - fessors and students alike undertake and present their work hon - estly. As a community of the mind, we respect the work of others, paying our intellectual debts as we craft our own work. The Academic Integrity Code (\"Code\") for American Uni - versity defines honorable conduct, outlines attendant rights and responsibilities, and describes procedures for handling allega - tions of academic misconduct. Violating standards of academic conduct is a serious matter subject to discipline. Most charges ofCode violations are brought by the university faculty to the Aca-demic Integrity Code Administrator of the major teaching unit(School or College) in which the course is taught. Violations adjudicated under the Code include the following: plagiarism; dishonesty papers; work donefor course and submitted to another; fabrication of data; in-terference with other students' or scholars' work; bribes, favors, and threats; and other academic misconduct. Violations of theCode will be treated seriously, with special attention to repeatoffenders. Sanctions for Code viol ations may include failure for the course, a notation on the student's permanent record, suspen - sion and dismissal, as well as other lesser sanctions. Freshman Forgiveness does not apply to Code violations. By enrolling at American University and then each semester when registering for classes, students acknowledge their com - mitment to the Code. As members of the academic community, students must become familiar with their rights and their respon - sibilities. In each course, they are responsible for knowing the requirements and restrictions regarding research and writing,examinations of whatever kind, collaborative work, the use ofstudy aids, the appropriateness of assistance, and other issues.Students are responsible for learning the conventions of docu-mentation and acknowledgment of sources. American Univer-sity expects students to complete all examinations, tests, papers,creative projects, and assignments of any kind according to thehighest ethical standards, as set forth either explicitly or implic-itly in this Code or by the direction of instructors. The Academic Integrity Code may be found at: www.american.edu/academics/integrity/ Student Academic Grievance Policy In the course of academic life, a student may come into dis - agreement with a faculty member or with the policies and ac - tions of an academic unit as they affect the student's progress toward completion of a course or degree. In cases of complaintor disagreement over academic matters not resolved by consul - tation among the parties, the university provides the student the right to initiate a grievance procedure. Students should have protection through orderly procedures against prejudiced or capricious academic evaluation. At thesame time, they are responsible for maintaining standards of ac - ademic performance established for each course in which they are enrolled. Evaluation of students and the awarding of creditmust be based on academic performance professionally judgedand not on matters irrelevant to that performance, such as per - sonality, physical disability, age, race, gender, sexual orienta -tion, religion, national origin, degree of political activism, or personal beliefs. Judgement regarding standards of evaluation for a student's academic performance is a faculty responsibility and is notgrievable. Normally, only questions relating to whether a facultymember complied with the stated requirements of the courseand applied standards of evaluation fairly and equitably are po - tentially grievable. Cases involving complaints about grades will be considered only when there is clear evidence that castssignificant doubt on the objectivity of the grading process or in - dicates that the faculty member failed to comply with the stated requirements of the course. The Student Academic Grievance Policy may be found through the \"Policies & Procedures\" portion of the Office of theProvost website at: www.american.edu/provost/ . 47Student Records Astudent's academic record begins in the Admissions Office, which assembles and maintains the application and supportingdocuments and the record of admission actions. Once a studentenrolls in courses, the academic history is maintained by the Of - fice of the University Registrar. Normally the only record main - tained for nondegree students who are citizens of the United States are the record of their registration(s) and their academicperformance. A full record is kept for each internationalnondegree student. The purpose of the official student record is to document the student's academic career and to provide a repository of infor - mation which can be useful to advisors. All relevant materials are maintained until the student has received the degree or hasleft the university. Periodically, the basic materials in files aremicrofilmed and only the microfilmed copy and the electronicpermanent record, on which the summary of the total record isentered, are retained. Information needed for the continuing evaluation of the prog - ress of a student, grades earned, and the like are made available to the dean by the University Registrar. The various colleges,schools, and departments also develop files to aid in the counsel-ing and appraisal of their own students. Such files are not, how-ever, to be considered official. Important decisions relating to astudent's academic career should always be based on the infor-mation maintained by the Office of the University Registrar. The alteration or misuse of official student records, or attempt to alter or misuse them, under any circumstances or for any pur-pose, will result in the peremptory permanent dismissal of anystudent or employee of the university involved and the institu-tion of such legal proceedings as may be appropriate. Confidentiality and FERPA The following explains the university's policy for complying with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974(\"FERPA\" or \"Act\"). Students at American University have thefollowing rights regarding their education records: 1) to have ac - cess to their education records, 2) to consent to release a record to a third party, 3) to request nondisclosure of directory informa - tion, 4) to seek amendment of information in an education re - cord which the student demonstrates is inaccurate, 5) to be notified of their privacy rights, and 6) to file complaints with theFamily Policy Compliance Office of the US Department of Ed - ucation concerning alleged failures by American University to comply with the Act. For purposes of this policy, the term \"student\" means any in - dividual who is attending or has attended American University and for whom the university maintains education records. Theterm \"education records\" or \"student education records\" means,with certain exceptions, any records 1) that are directly related toa student and 2) maintained by the university or its agents. Stu - dent education records are confidential and may only be re -leased with consent of the student or as otherwise permitted by law. The university does not maintain education records in one central office. Education records are maintained in the variousdepartments, schools, or college s. A student should contact the Office of the University Registrar, or, for law students, theWashington College of Law (WCL) Registrar, for guidance indetermining which unit(s) a student should contact about an ed - ucation record. Examples of academic and non-academic student education records include without limitation: /c183Academic Records: Permanent record of academic performance (e.g., transcript, including supportingdocuments) maintained by the Office of the UniversityRegistrar, the WCL Registrar, academic advisor, dean'soffice, and Provost's Office; files of progressmaintained by the school/college academicoffice and Provost's Office; admission files of students;Career Center files. /c183Non-Academic Records: Files related to Financial Aid,Housing and Dining Programs, International Student andScholar Services, Student Accounts, and the Library;student discipline files; employment files of students whoare employed because of their student status (e.g.work-study, graduate assistantship/fellowship). Only information directly relevant to the educational pro- cesses of the university or which is voluntarily offered by thestudent and accepted from the student shall be included in stu-dent education records. Specifically excluded from such student education records are: /c183Medical and mental health information which is created, maintained, or used by a physician, psychiatrist,psychologist, or other recognized professional inconnection with treatment of the student and disclosed onlyto individuals providing the treatment. Such records arestrictly confidential and not accessible except as providedby applicable laws; /c183Sole possession records or private notes maintained byindividual faculty and instructional, supervisory, oradministrative personnel for their own use and which arenot accessible or released to anyone except a substitute; /c183Records created and maintained by Public Safety solely forlaw enforcement purposes; /c183Employment records of students which are made andmaintained in the normal course of business, relateexclusively to their employment, and are not available foruse for any other purpose; /c183Alumni records which contain only information aboutformer students after they are no longer students at theuniversity.48 University Regulations and PoliciesStudent Access to Student Education Records Each student may inspect his or her education record, subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. A studentmust submit a written request to review an education record.The request will be granted as soon as possible, but no later thanforty-five (45) days from the date of the receipt of the request. Atthe time of inspection, the student must present identificationand must inspect the records in the presence of a designated uni - versity official. In lieu of inspection and at the request of the stu - dent, the university may provide a copy of the requested education record. The student may be charged for the actualcosts of copying the records. The university reserves the right todeny requests for copies of records if there is an administrativerestriction on the individual's student account (e.g. financial ob - ligation, disciplinary stop). Student may not access the following education records: /c183Financial information submitted by parents; /c183Confidential letters of recommendation for which a student has waived the right of access provided that therecommendations are used only for their intended purpose(i.e. admission, employment, or consideration for anyhonor). However, the student may know the names of allpeople making recommendations; and /c183Confidential letters of recommendation placed in a recordbefore January 1, 1975, if the letters were used only for theintended purpose. Disclosures of Student Education Records At its discretion, the university may release directory infor- mation unless the student has file d a request for nondisclosure of directory information with the Office of the University Registraror, for law students, the WCL Registrar. Prior to releasing direc - tory information, the university official processing the request must ensure that the student has not requested nondisclosure ofdirectory information. Directory information includes a stu - dent's name, telephone numbers, a ddresses, e-mail addresses, month and day of birth, dates of attendance at the university, ma - jor field of study and class, date of graduation, degrees and hon - ors received at the university, participation in officially recognized university activities, height and weight of membersof athletic teams, photographs and similar information. At its discretion, the university may release directory infor - mation for persons requesting such information. The university, in connection with specific events such as commencements,dean's list announcements, scholar ship presentations, athletic contests, or other university-rela ted news stories, may release directory information to the news media or the public. The uni - versity may release directory information for law enforcement purposes, and will release directory information as required bylaw. Students who object to the disclosure of directory informa - tion must notify in writing the Office of the University Registraror, for law students, the WCL Registrar. Forms for this purpose are available from the Office of the University Registrar or theWCL Registrar and should be filed within thirty (30) days fol - lowing the first day of classes each fall and spring semester. The request for nondisclosure may be rescinded by written notifica - tion to the Office of the University Registrar or the WCL Regis - trar. In addition, the Registrar will notify students at the beginning of each fall and spring semester about the option to re - quest nondisclosure of their directory information. University officials are determined to have legitimate educa - tional interest if the information requested is necessary for that official to perform a task that is related to their normally as - signed job functions or related to their performance of a contract with the university. A\"university official\" includes faculty, staff,a member of the board of trustees, third-parties acting on behalfof the university, and individuals , including students, serving on university committees. The determination as to whether a legiti - mate educational interest exists will be made by the custodian of the records on a case-by-case basis. Third-Party Access to Education Records The university may disclose student education records with the prior written consent of the student. Astudent may authorizeaccess to third parties to review the student's education record bycompleting a written and dated authorization form which speci-fies the information to be released, the reasons for the release,and to whom the information is to be released. The university may disclose information in the following cir- cumstances without the prior written consent of the student: /c183To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. Unless otherwise directed by the order orsubpoena, the university will make a reasonable effort tonotify the student in writing of the order or subpoena inadvance of compliance; /c183To the parents of a dependent student, as defined in theInternal Revenue Code. The parent must sign, and provideto the university, a written statement confirming that thestudent is a dependent; the statement must be accompaniedby a copy of the parent's most current tax return whichreports the student as a dependent; /c183To persons or organizations provi ding the student financial aid, or who determine financial decisions concerningeligibility, amount, conditions, and enforcement or terms ofthe financial aid; /c183To organizations conducting studies for educationalagencies to 1) develop, validate, or administer predictivetests, 2) administer student aid programs; or 3) improveinstruction. Disclosure under this paragraph shall only bemade if the study is conducted in a manner that does notpermit personal identification of students by individualsother than representatives of the organization and thatpersonally identifiable data will be destroyed when nolonger needed for the purpose for which it was collected;University Regulations and Policies 49/c183To authorized representatives of the Comptroller General of the United States; Secretary of Education; or state and localeducational authorities to audit or evaluate a federal or statesupported education programs, or for the enforcement of orcompliance with legal requirements of those programs.Disclosure under this paragraph shall only be made ifinformation is protected in a manner that does not permitpersonal identification of students by individuals other thanthe specified officials and that personally identifiable datawill be destroyed when no longer needed for the purpose forwhich it is collected. /c183To accrediting organizations for purposes related toaccreditation of the university; /c183To appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency; /c183To victims of crimes of violence or non-forcible sexoffenses concerning the results of disciplinary proceedingsabout those incidents; /c183To appropriate parties as permitted by the university'sParental Notification of Disciplinary Violations Involvingthe Use or Possession of Alcohol or a Controlled Substance;and /c183To appropriate parties in other circumstances as required bylaw. Education records will only be disclosed to third parties if they are advised not to redisclose the information to others with-out the prior written consent of the student or as permitted bylaw. Each university office must maintain a list of all individuals or organizations who have obtained access to a student's record.The list must indicate the legitimate interest that each person ororganization has in obtaining the information. This \"record ofaccess\" is part of the student's education record. A record of ac - cess is not necessary for disclosures: 1) to the student, 2) pursu - ant to a written authorization from a student, 3) to university officials, 4) of directory information, and 5) in response to a sub - poena or court order specifying that the existence and/or con - tents of such documents may not be revealed. Student's Right to Challenge Information in the Student Education Record If a student demonstrates that the student's education record is inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of the student'sprivacy rights, the student may request in writing that the recordbe changed. The request should be made directly to the custo - dian of the record. Any disagreement should be resolved infor - mally, if possible and within a reasonable time period. If the request is denied, the student may file a written appeal within 30days to the University Registrar or, for law students, the WCLRegistrar. The Registrar will appoint a hearing committee to re - view the complaint. The committee will provide the student a full and fair opportunity to present evidence. The student may beassisted or represented by one or more individuals of the stu - dent's choice, including an attorney. After the committee com- pletes the proceeding and makes findings, it will render a writtendecision and forward it to the relevant parties for implementa-tion. Students, dissatisfied with the results of a hearing, may place an explanatory statement in the relevant education record com-menting upon the information in dispute, and/or setting forthany reason for disagreement with the institutional decision notto correct or amend the record. Such a statement will becomepart of the student education record. Other University Regulations and Policies Enrollment Certification AU Central supplies, on request of a currently enrolled stu - dent, certification of certain academic data concerning the re - cords and status of the student. These certifications are used for Department of Education and sc holarship forms, employment applications, and so forth. They are not to be confused with tran - scripts of the student's permanent academic record.

Courses below the 100-level or taken pass/fail are not in-cluded in the grade point average, nor are grades of Incomplete(I) or In Progress (IP). Credit accepted for transfer from another institution is in- cluded in the total amount of credit applicable to degree require-ments, but grades earned in such courses are not recorded on thepermanent record at American University and are not used incomputing the cumulative grade point average needed for grad - uation. A student's GPA will not be rounded for purposes of evaluat - ing satisfactory academic progress of academic standing (e.g., a cumulative or semester GPA of 1.99 will not be rounded to2.00). Academic units or teaching units will not accept C- or D grades in major and major-related courses, in minor courses, ortoward courses that were taken to satisfy the College Writing orUniversity Mathematics requirements. A course with a grade ofC- or D may be used as an elective toward graduation require - ments and the C- or D grade is calculated in the cumulative grade point average. Pass/Fail For undergraduate students, the grade of P indicates a quality of performance no less than C (2.00) on a conventional gradingscale. For graduate students, the grade of P indicates perfor - mance equivalent to a B (3.00) or better on a conventional grad - ing scale. Performance below these levels is reported as FZ. Degree credit is received with the grade of P.Graduate students may not choose the pass/fail option. How - ever, courses that can only be taken with pass/fail grading may be included on a student's Program of Study. Undergraduate students may select the pass/fail option for no more than four courses after admission to the university. In anygiven semester, students may select the pass/fail option in onlyone course. Only elective courses may be taken pass/fail, andthus students must take for a letter grade courses in a major, in aminor, in General Education, and in courses that are taken to sat - isfy the College Writing or University Mathematics require - ment. Those courses that can only be taken pass/fail are exceptions to the preceding rule and such courses are not in - cluded in the aforementioned four course maximum. Incomplete Grades At the discretion of the faculty member and before the end of the semester, the grade of I (Incomplete) may be given to a stu - dent who, because of extenuating circumstances, is unable to complete the course during a semester. The grade of Incompletemay be given only if the student is receiving a passing grade forthe course work completed. Students on academic probationmay not receive an Incomplete. The instructor must provide inwriting to the student the conditions, which are described below,for satisfying the incomplete and must enter those same condi-tions when posting the grades for the course. Students are re-sponsible for verifying that the conditions were enteredcorrectly. Instructors must identify in writing the conditions for satisfy- ing the Incomplete. Those conditions must include what workneeds to be completed, when the work must be completed, andwhat the course grade will be if students fail to complete thatwork, which, at the latest, must be before the end of the follow-ing semester absent an agreemen t to the contrary. Instructors will submit the grade of I and the aforementioned conditions tothe Office of the University Registrar when submitting all otherfinal grades for the course. If students do not meet the condi - tions, the Office of the University Registrar will assign the default grade automatically. The Associate Dean of the Academic Unit, with the concur - rence of the instructor,may grant an extension beyond the agreed deadline, but only in extraordinary circumstances. Incompletecourses may not be retroactively dropped. An Incomplete maynot stand as a permanent grade and must be resolved before a de - gree can be awarded. In Progress Grades An In Progress (IP) is only available for designated courses and is a temporary posting that indicates the course is in prog - ress. Afaculty member may post an IP in lieu of a final grade for a course, research project, thesis, or capstone which has not beencompleted by the conclusion of the semester of registration andfor which a final grade is not yet due. An IP grade may not standas a permanent grade and must be resolved before a degree canbe awarded.University Regulations and Policies 51Changes in Grades Once reported, a grade may not be changed except to remove a grade of I (Incomplete) as stated above, or to correct a grade re - corded in error. To remove a grade recorded incorrectly, the fac - ulty member must certify in writing to the Office of the University Registrar that an error was made. Repetition of Courses Undergraduate students have a maximum of three attempts to pass a course. Withdrawals count as an attempt. Once a studentpasses a course taken at American University, he/she may repeatit one more time unless the repetition exceeds the maximumnumber of three attempts. The repetition policy applies to amaximum of five courses including those courses repeated un - der the Freshman Forgiveness policy (given below) during their tenure at the university. Students are responsible for determiningany academic or financial implications for repeating courses. Inthe context of this policy, passing a course includes meeting anystipulations needed to satisfy a university or major or minor re - quirement. Grades for each attempt are computed in the overall cumulative GPA, but only the highest grade and the credit asso - ciated with that grade counts toward the major or minor GPA requirements. Graduate students may repeat only once a course they have previously completed and failed or from which they have with-drawn. They may repeat only two courses in this fashion duringa graduate program of study. Grades for each attempt are shownon the transcript and are used to compute the overall GPA, butcredits for only one passed course are included in the credits re-quired for the graduate degree. Freshman Forgiveness Degree students, during the first two semesters of full-time undergraduate study, may request Freshman Forgiveness forany two courses that have resulted in a grade of C- or lower.Part-time degree students may request Freshman Forgivenessduring the first 30 credit hours of study. Students must repeatsuch courses within the next calendar year or at the first possibleopportunity. Only the second grade is computed in the cumula - tive GPA, but both courses remain on the transcript. Students may not request Freshman Forgiveness for a course if they re - ceived a sanction of a grade of F for that course due to a violation of the Academic Integrity Code. Full-time, part-time, and Washington Mentorship students are eligible to apply for Freshman Forgiveness. Transfer andnondegree students may not claim F reshman Forgiveness. Cer - tain classes may not be repeated for Freshman Forgiveness. Stu - dents should check with their academic advisor to determine which courses are not eligible for Freshman Forgiveness.Graduation Candidates for degrees submit an Application for Graduation form, available at myau.american.edu . Once application for graduation has been made, the Office of the University Registrar with the advisor begin processing thenecessary information for final certification of graduation. Stu - dents who fail to complete all degree requirements by the end of the term for which they applied to graduate must reapply in or - der to graduate later. Conferral of Degrees and Commencement The university confers degrees and issues diplomas at the end of the fall, spring, and summer terms. Formal commencementceremonies are held in May. Only students who successfully complete degree require - ments by the end of the term for which they have applied (or re - applied) to graduate are certified for conferral of a degree. In witness of the degree conferred, the permanent records of thegraduates are appropriately noted with a statement of graduationand their diplomas are released. Candidates for degrees whose academic records indicate that they can satisfy degree requirements by the end of the term forwhich they have applied are permitted to participate in com-mencement ceremonies. Particip ation in a commencement cere- mony does not itself constitute conferral of a degree, nor does itimply an obligation on the part of the university to award a de-gree before all requirements have been met and certified. Interruption of Studies A student who takes a temporary leave or separates from the university is no longer taking courses at AU. Student financialaid, merit awards, university housing, and immigration statusmay be affected by any temporary leave or separation from theuniversity. Students should consult with their academic unit orthe appropriate university office (Financial Aid, Office of theDean of Students, International Student and Scholar Services,etc.) for help in determining the effects of the temporary leave orseparation in their case. The two interruptions from the univer - sity are different in the following ways: Temporary Leave Atemporary leave is an approved temporary separation from the university for a specified period of time after which the stu - dent is expected to return to active status. A temporary leave is initiated by the student in consultation with the student's aca - demic unit and may be general, medical, or military in nature. Separation A separation from the university results in the loss of active student status. Students who ha ve separated from the university must reapply to regain active student status. A separation can beinitiated by the student or a representative of the university. If52 University Regulations and Policiesstudents are considering separating from the university, they should consult with their academic unit as soon as possible todetermine whether there are other more viable alternatives. The University may suspend a student from the University for an interim period pending disciplinary or criminal proceed - ings or medical evaluation regarding behavior relevant to such proceedings. Students whose work toward a degree is disruptedas a direct result of pandemic, hostilities, war or some similaremergency shall be given every possible consideration. In theevent of a personal tragedy or trauma, students may need to co - ordinate alternative arrangements to complete coursework. Stu - dents or their authorized representative may contact the academic unit. Further information about temporary leaves or separation from the University is available in the Academic Rules and Reg - ulations for Undergraduates or for Graduates, which may be found through the Office of the Provost website at:www.american.edu/provost/ . Resuming Study Students who cease to attend the university for an entire se - mester, whether voluntarily or not, may not resume study until they have been readmitted. Readmitted students are subject toall regulations and must meet all requirements in force whenstudies are resumed unless other arrangements have been agreedto in writing by the student's dean before the beginning of suchan absence.Students who change degree objective, college, or school, or who choose to conform to new regulations or requirements,must be prepared to complete all requirements and abide by allregulations in effect at the time such a change is made. Records Retention After five years since the student has graduated or was last registered at the university, the university generally destroys stu - dent education records. Exceptions include but are not limited to the following: permanent records of academic performance, in - cluding supporting documents; such financial records as are necessary so long as there exists a financial obligation to the uni - versity; and disciplinary records that involve a permanent nota - tion to the student's record. Transcripts Students may obtain transcripts of their academic records from the Office of the University Registrar. Transcripts will bereleased only on the signed request or release of the student con - cerned. The university will not issue a transcript that reflects only a part of the student's record, nor will it make copies of transcriptson file from other colleges and universities. Students with in-debtedness to the university may not obtain transcripts.University Regulations and Policies 53Undergraduate Rules and Regulations Undergraduate Academic Standards Academic Load An undergraduate student admitted to and enrolled in a de - gree program usually registers for 15 credit hours each semester so that the required minimum of 120 credit hours for the bache - lor's degree is completed in four years. Students are considered full-time if registered for at least 12 credits hours, half-time if registered for 6 to 11.99 credit hours,and less-than-half-time if registered for less than 6 credit hours.This designation applies to fall, spring, and summer, with sum - mer status determined by total credits across all sessions. For fall and spring, a typical load for a full-time student is 15 credit hours; however, the flat undergraduate tuition rate appliesto a total of 17 credit hours. To register for more than 18 credithours, students must receive permission from their academicunit. Good Academic Standing Undergraduate students (degree and nondegree) are in Good Academic Standing when they are maintaining a 2.0 cumulativeGPA and are either enrolled in semester classes or are eligible toenroll in subsequent semester classes. There may be higher re - quirements for students receiving financial aid or other awards. Satisfactory Academic Progress Undergraduate students (degree and nondegree) are making Satisfactory Academic Progress when they are in Good Aca - demic Standing, are completing 80% of all cumulative at - tempted credits at AU, and are meeting on time the minimum requirements for majors and add itional requirements defined by the program. There may be highe r requirements for students re - ceiving financial aid or other awards. Academic Warning When the academic unit determines that a student has lost good academic standing or failed to make satisfactory academicprogress, the academic unit may issue to the student in writingan academic warning. Students will be given an academic warn - ing when either the student's semester GPA falls below 2.00 orthe student is not making satisfactory academic progress. An ac - ademic warning is not recorded on the transcript. Academic Probation and Dismissal The Registrar will place students on academic probation when their cumulative GPA falls below 2.00 or when the Regis - trar is notified by the Academic Unit that a student has failed to meet other conditions for academic progress that may apply insome majors. The Registrar will notify the student in writing oftheir academic probation status and of any conditions associatedwith the academic probation. Conditions that students must ad-here to during the academic probationary period may include,but are not limited to, inability to petition instructors forincompletes, successful completion of specific courses, mini-mum grades in courses, or the overall GPA to be achieved in theacademic probation period. Once placed on academic probation, a student must maintain a minimum semester GPA of 2.33 and show satisfactory aca-demic progress towards raising their cumulative GPA to the re - quired level and meeting any other requirements unrelated to GPA, as stated in their notification letter from the Registrar. Stu - dents can be placed on academic probation only twice, and for no more than three semesters in total, whether for one or two ac - ademic probationary events. After either the two academic pro - bation threshold or three semester period threshold is reached, students will be permanently dismissed from the University. A student on academic probation may be subject to restric - tions as to the load for which he or she may register. Such a stu - dent is ineligible to hold office in student organizations or to participate in intercollegiate events. The student may, however,be permitted to participate in intercollegiate athletics programsas of the end of a session in which the cumulative GPA is raisedto 2.00 (C), even though technically still on academic probation(as when academic probation is stated for a two-semester term).Also, a student may with permission of the student's academicunit complete the season of any collegiate sport in which he orshe is participating at the time he or she falls below a 2.00cumulative average GPA. The university will permanently dismiss immediately stu - dents whose cumulative GPA, after attempting or completing 24 55credits (excluding courses in which the recorded grade is W), falls below 1.0 (D). When dismissing students from the university, the university may give students the option of reapplying for admission afterone calendar year has passed from the final day of the sessionduring which the dismissal was implemented, or the universitymay choose to permanently dismiss students from the univer - sity, which means that it will not consider future applications from the student. The type of dismissal will be included in theletter from the academic unit, and recorded by the Office of theRegistrar on the transcript. Readmission applications are evalu - ated based on the total record of the student and consistent with the admission practices in effect at the time of application. A re - admitted student is governed by the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmission. Academic probation and dismissal are permanently recorded on the transcript of undergraduate students. Changes in Field of Study To change from one academic unit to another or to change majors within an academic unit within AU, students must be ingood academic standing and receive the permission of the aca - demic unit or teaching unit designee in charge of the program to which they wish to transfer. The various academic units andteaching units may establish additional requirements whichmust be met by each of their candidates for a degree. Class Standing Class standing is determined by the total number of credits, with adherence to the policies for repetition of courses, that stu - dents have earned including graded courses at AU, IB/AP/CLEP/A-level credits, or transferred courses. Creditsthat are not included in calculating class standing are credits notcompleted (N, I, IP), or credits not accepted through transfer, ex - amination, or experiential learning. Credit HoursCompleted Standing 0-29 Freshman 30-59 Sophomore60-89 Junior90 or above Senior Undergraduate Degree Regulations No student shall be subject to regulations and academic re- quirements introduced during the student's continuous enroll-ment in good standing in a single degree program if the newregulations involve undue hardships or the loss of academiccredits earned to satisfy the requirements previously in effect.Undergraduate students are governed by minimum require - ments for the undergraduate degree (each teaching unit may have further major and major-related requirements). Credit Hour and Residence Requirements Bachelor's Degrees The university offers the following bachelor's degrees: Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Bachelorof Science (BS), and Bachelor of Science in Business Adminis - tration (BSBA). All bachelor's degrees require completion of at least 120 credit hours of course work with a cumulative GPA of 2.00 orbetter. At least 45 credit hours out of the last 60 must be com - pleted in residence at American University. A minimum of 15 credit hours must be completed at American University in up - per-level courses in the student's major. Amaximum of 75 hours may be transferred towards a bachelor's degree. Students maytransfer this cumulative total of 75 credits as described from thefollowing: 1) a maximum of 75 credits from an approved four-year institution or a combination of approved two-year andfour-year institutions or 2) a maximum of 60 credits from an ap-proved two-year institution, or 3) a maximum of 30 credits ofapproved exams can be used towards the credits necessary forgraduation. The minimum graduation requirement of 120 credit hours must satisfy a major requirement and also satisfy the require - ments for the General Education program, the College Writing Requirement, and the University Mathematics requirement. Credit earned in any American University course, in any in - structional modality, is residence credit. Some AU courses and programs are offered at physical sites other than the AU campusand are considered in residence courses by the Office of the Uni - versity Registrar. With some exceptions, students receive in res - idence credit for such courses. Credit earned by an American University student through the Consortium of Universities ofthe Washington Metropolitan Area is also residence credit. Courses considered not in residence by the Office of the Uni - versity Registrar include those t ransferred into AU, those taken through a Permit to Study at Another Institution, or credits ac - cepted through exams including CLEP, IB, AP, FB, A-levels, or other approved exams for transfer credit. Undergraduates may count a maximum of 12 credit hours of internship toward the 120 minimum credit hours required forgraduation with a maximum of 6 credits counting in their major.56 Undergraduate Rules and RegulationsThree-Year Bachelor's Programs The university offers a limited number of pre-defined three-year bachelor's programs. These special programs offer anintensive cohort experience that continues through each sum - mer session until the completion of the degree. Prospective stu - dents may apply directly through the Office of Admissions. Dual Degrees Students who decide to declare a second degree in a major field of study are expected to declare their second major oneyear prior to the intended date of graduation, usually 90 creditsearned at AU or the end of the junior year. Students must have a3.00 cumulative GPAat the time of declaration of the second de - gree. Students who fulfill all the requirements for two bachelor's programs (including major, major-related, and residence re - quirements) and who have earned a total of 150 credit hours may be awarded two bachelor's degrees. At least 24 credits must beunique to each degree. Dual degree students can apply a maxi - mum of thirty credits for approved exams. Such students should note that financial aid is only available for a maximum of 180credit hours. Combined Bachelor's and Master's Degrees American University offers students the opportunity to earn both undergraduate and graduate degrees through its combinedbachelor's/master's programs. Students can choose from a widevariety of established bachelor's/master's programs, or they cancreate bachelor's/master's programs with the approval of the ac-ademic department supervising the graduate-level work. Stu-dents may complete graduate degrees in disciplines differentthan their undergraduate degrees, provided they are admitted tothe master's program by the supervising department and theyhave completed the prerequisites required for the graduate pro - gram. A combined bachelor's/master's program involves tentative admission to graduate standing while a student is still an under - graduate so that both a bachelor's and master's degree may be earned. Although graduate standing is not officially granted un - til all bachelor's degree requirements have been fulfilled, stu - dents who are admitted to a combined bachelor's and master's program are granted conditional graduate admission so that theymay take courses based on their planned Program of Study tofulfill both the bachelor's and master's degree requirementswhile still officially enrolled in undergraduate status. Undergraduate students in good academic standing may ap - ply for a combined degree after they have completed 75 credit hours towards their undergraduate degree, and, except in rarecases, by the end of the semester in which they have completed90 credit hours. No more than one graduate degree can be earnedas a combined degree. Once admitted, students will be enrolledin the combined program at two levels, once for the undergradu - ate degree and once for the graduate degree. Once admitted to a combined program, students must follow their Program of Study, and the Program of Study must showwhich courses will be applied toward the bachelor's degree andwhich courses will be applied toward the master's degree. Onceall undergraduate requirements h ave been satisfied, students will be officially enrolled in the graduate program if they com - plete their bachelor's program in good academic standing, and if they meet all University, academic unit, or teaching unit require - ments for admission to the master's program for the combined degree. Each academic unit or teaching unit sets its own admis - sion standards for graduate st udents. Once enrolled in the mas - ter's program, students are subject to the academic regulations governing graduate students. Students may count graduate credits earned at the 600 level during an undergraduate degree, towards a master's degree if thecredits are listed as part of an approved graduate program ofstudy. Specifically, a student can share up to 9 credits for30-hour master's degree (with or without thesis), 12 credits for a36-hour master's degree, and 15 credits for a master's degree re - quiring 39 or more semester hour credits. Programs can set lower limits than those specified here. Students are required to complete the graduation application and clearance process once for the bachelor's degree and oncefor the master's degree. Evaluation of Progress An evaluation of each undergraduate student's progress is made by the office of the student's dean after each semester. Inaddition to the cumulative grade point average, this evaluationconsiders completion of all university requirements and the ratioof courses satisfactorily completed to all courses attempted bythe student. Students who are not making satisfactory progressare informed in writing of the result of their evaluation and of - fered academic advising. The university has no strict regulations governing the total amount of time an undergraduate student may take to fulfill therequirements for a degree, provided the student maintains theappropriate grade point average and gives evidence of being se - riously interested in the eventual achievement of his or her aca - demic objective. Major Requirements A major requires a minimum of 36 credit hours, at least 18 of which must be earned in residence at American University. Atleast 18 credits must be earned in upper-level courses in the ma - jor, and at least 15 of those credits must be earned in residence. Students who wish to take an upper level course at another insti - tution in the first 18 hours of major course work must receive permission from their teaching unit chair or equivalent. A gradeof C or better is required for each course used to satisfy the ma -Undergraduate Rules and Regulations 57jor. Students should note that a C- does not qualify and any course with a C- or lower will have to be repeated or an equiva - lent course taken to satisfy th e major requirement involved. Courses in the major may not be taken on a pass/fail basis. Declaration of Major Students are expected to declare a major before completing 60 earned credits. The declaration must be approved by the aca - demic unit or teaching unit designee in charge of the proposed major. The academic units or teaching units may require higherthan minimal performance in major and related courses as a con - dition for acceptance as a major. Students can declare more than one major if they have a mini - mum 2.50 cumulative GPAand if at least 18 credits are unique to each major. Individual academic units or teaching units may re - quire a higher GPA and have other requirements that exceed the regulations. Double Majors If the majors are offered by more than one academic unit within the University, then students will designate at the time ofdeclaration of the majors the single academic unit in which theywill be registered and from which they will be graduated. Stu-dents will need to satisfy the general academic unit requirementsof that single academic unit only. When majors lead to differentdegrees (e.g., BA and BS), students will specify which degreethey wish to be awarded. Electives may be used to satisfy doublemajor requirements. Individualized Majors Students may design their own majors and minors by apply- ing to a review committee overseen by the Vice Provost for Un-dergraduate Studies. Students must have a 3.00 cumulative GPAand must apply no later than before the completion of 60 earnedcredits in residence. Individualized programs mus t meet the minima described above in Major Requirements . Minors Specific course requirements for minors are listed under de - partmental programs. All minor programs consist of a minimum of 18 credit hours, including at least 9 credit hours at the 300level or above. For all minors, at least 9 credit hours of the statedrequirements must be taken in residence at American Univer - sity. At least 12 credit hours of the minor must be outside of the course requirements for each major or other minor the student ispursuing. A grade of C (2.00) or better is required for eachcourse used to satisfy the requirements of a minor. Students who decide to declare a minor field of study are ex - pected to declare their minor no later than one year prior to the intended date of graduation, usually 90 credits earned at Ameri - can University or the end of the junior year.Students should consult with their advisors as to the proce - dure for declaring a minor. Minors are noted as a comment on the student's permanent record at the time of graduation, but willnot appear on the student's diploma. Individualized Minors Students may design their own minors by applying to a re - view committee overseen by the Vice Provost for Undergradu - ate Studies. Students must have a 3.00 cumulative GPAand must apply no later than before the completion of 60 earned credits inresidence. Individualized programs mus t meet the minima described above in Minors . Certificate Programs All credit certificate programs must include a minimum of 12 credit hours. Admission to credit certificate programs is openonly to those students who meet University minimumnondegree enrollment requirement s. Admission requirements in excess of University minimums must be stated explicitly in thecredit certificate program proposals. Equivalent credit earned at an accredited college or Univer- sity may be applied toward a certificate at the following rate: 3credit hours for certificates from 12 to 18 credit hours in length,and 6 credit hours for certificates over 18 credit hours in length. Students enrolled in undergraduate certificate programs must maintain a 2.0 grade point average to remain in good academicstanding. Nondegree certificate students may be placed on aca-demic probation, dismissed, or readmitted to certificate studyaccording to regulations governing nondegree students. Certificate students who are also enrolled in undergraduate programs may be placed on academic probation, dismissed, orreadmitted to certificate study according to regulations govern - ing undergraduate students. Grades of C- or D in certificate program courses will not be accepted toward the fulfillment of certificate requirements al - though these grades will be included in the calculation of the cu - mulative grade point average. Students in other than graduate certificate programs must have at least a 2.0 grade point averagein certificate courses in order to be awarded a certificate. Students in certificate programs must take a minimum of 6 credit hours during each 12-month period after they are admit - ted. All programs must be completed within four years. Study at Another Institution An enrolled student who plans to take courses at another col - lege or university for transfer credit to American University must be in good academic standing and must receive prior ap - proval from the student's department chair and dean using the Permit to Study Abroad form or the Permit to Study at AnotherUS Institution form. For study abroad, approval is also requiredfrom the AU Abroad director. If the course to be taken is outside58 Undergraduate Rules and Regulationsthe area of the student's major, the chair of the department which would offer credit for such a course must also approve the per - mit. Approval is granted for specific courses. Permits to Study may not be authorized for courses at community colleges ornon-accredited four year institutions. The visited institution, if in the United States, must be region - ally accredited. With departmental approval, transfer credit is applicable toward the requirements of a major. Transfer creditmay be used to fulfill General E ducation Requirements through the evaluation of equivalent courses taken at another institutionand with the approval of the student's dean. Because of the spe - cial nature of the program, after the student has been admitted to American University no credit toward General Education Re - quirements may be earned through transfer credit. Transfer credit from a Permit to Study is accepted for courses with earned grades of C or better. Grades for courses taken dur - ing a Permit to Study at another institution are not recorded on the AU transcript and are not computed in the GPA, though theywill count in the total number of credits needed for graduation.However, students must meet GPA r equirements for individual courses taken at other institutions as required for electives ormajor or minor courses. Students must satisfy any additional re-quirements provided on the Permit to Study form. Permit to Study at Another US Institution Students in good academic standing who wish to take courses that would not be considered in residence courses must receiveprior approval by their academic unit. Students who want to ap-ply a course to their major or minor must receive teaching unit orequivalent approval. Students must secure approval from the ac-ademic unit prior to registering for the course and such approvalis granted only for specific courses. Students may transfer up toa total of 10 credits during this course of approved study at an - other US institution. The number of credits approved for transfer from an international institution requires advanced approvalfrom the academic unit. Permit to Study Abroad Undergraduate students in good academic standing who wish to study abroad on any non-AU Abroad study abroad programor at any foreign university not partnered with AU must receiveprior approval of their academic unit and of AU Abroad. Per - mission for such study is granted only when the student can demonstrate that the academic opportunity offered by the pro - gram or foreign university cannot be met through study at any one of AU's existing partner universities or study abroad pro - grams. Grades for courses taken during a Permit to Study Abroad are not recorded on the AU transcript and are not com - puted in the GPA, though they will count in the total number of credits needed for graduation. Students will be allowed to trans - fer a maximum of 36 credits from studying abroad in a non-AU program via the permit process. Complete permit applicationsmust be submitted before the end of the semester prior to the an -ticipated study abroad program. The University will not approve retroactive permits. Students who complete the Permit to Study Abroad form and enroll in an non-AU study abroad program are required to paythe Permit to Study Abroad fee for each semester, includingsummer, they are registered. Medical Permit to Study While on a temporary leave for medical reasons, students may request from their academic unit a medical permit to studyin order to minimize disruptions to their academic progress. Inorder to receive a Medical Permit to Study, students must havean approved Medical Temporary Leave. Students should pro - vide medical documentation only to the Office of the Dean of Students. With a medical permit to study, students may take twocourses at another institution for up to eight credits per semesterfor a maximum of four courses for up to 16 credits. Individualacademic units may have additional restrictions. Courses mustbe preapproved by the student's academic unit prior to enroll - ment. Course credits that are approved may count toward the 120 credits needed for graduation as defined in the academic inresidence requirement. Study Abroad American University offers numerous study abroad pro- grams through the AU Abroad Program. Students may also par-ticipate in study abroad programs offered by other institutionsthat are part of a regionally accredited US college or university,and are recorded on the transcripts of those institutions. For de-termination of regional accreditation, the publication Credit Given is the accepted reference. After consultation with and approval of the student's dean and the AU Abroad director, application is made directly to theinstitution for admission to its foreign study program. Transfercredit will be granted on the basis of the transcript from the spon - soring US college or university. Students may also attend institutions abroad not affiliated with an American college or university. For details, see above Permit to Study Abroad . Transfer of Credit The Admissions Office evaluates official documents show - ing previous college-level work completed. Individual teaching units determine how this credit will apply to specific degree pro - grams. Grades and quality points earned in courses accepted for transfer will not be included in the grade point average to bemaintained at American University, but the credits will count to - ward the total number required for graduation. Transfer students may normally expect to receive credit for courses taken at collegiate institutions that were, at the time thecourses were taken, regionally accredited or recognized candi -Undergraduate Rules and Regulations 59dates for accreditation. These courses must be appropriate for academic credit at American University towards an undergradu - ate degree program. A maximum of 75 credit hours will be ac - cepted on transfer from four-year collegiate institutions. A maximum of 60 credit hours will be accepted from two-year col - legiate institutions. Amaximum of 75 credit hours from all insti - tutions of higher education may be transferred toward a bachelor's degree. A maximum of 30 credit hours will be accepted on transfer for a combination of relevant work completed satisfactorily incollege-level Armed Services School courses, US ArmedForces Institute correspondence or extension courses, or anyMilitary Occupational Skills (MOS) courses completed with agrade of 70 or better, as recommended at the baccalaureate levelby the American Council on Education and which is appropriatefor academic credit as determined by the Admissions Office af - ter consultation with the appropriate academic unit. Amaximum of 30 credit hours may be granted for a combina - tion of relevant work completed in college-level nondegree, cor - respondence or extension courses completed at an accredited institution provided the course work is recognized by that insti - tution for credit toward a degree, and is appropriate for academic credit as determined by the Admissions Office after consultationwith the appropriate academic unit. Transfer students may be awarded credit for satisfactory scores in subject examinations of the College Level Examina-tion Program (CLEP). Students may not receive credit for a sub-ject examination if a course comparable in content has beenaccepted in transfer by the university, or if the student failed sucha course (see Advanced Standing, below). Official score reportsmust be sent directly to the Admissions Office from the Educa-tional Testing Service. No transfer credit towards the GeneralEducation requirements may be earned once the student has ma - triculated at American University. Credit through Examination Up to 30 credit hours will be accepted from one or a combina - tion of Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate, and CLEP subject examinations. Upon recommendation of theappropriate teaching unit, advanced standing may be awardedor a course requirement waived for an entering student on thebasis of performance in the Advanced Placement ExaminationProgram of the College Entrance Examination Board, theHigher Level subjects of the International Baccalaureate Pro - gram, or successful performance in the Subject Examination Program of the College Level Examination Program (CLEP).All undergraduate students in a degree program are eligible for course credit, with advanced placement where appropriate,on the basis of performance on the CLEP subject examinations,if the student has not failed or completed a credit-bearing coursecomparable in content. Course credit, with advanced placement where appropriate, will be assigned for successful performance in the Subject Ex - amination Program of CLEP, contingent upon the specification of norms and upon approval of the appropriateness of the con - tent of the examinations by the teaching unit concerned. Se - lected CLEP examinations may be applied to up to four courses to meet General Education requirements (see below). Credit to - ward General Education requirements may be awarded only for examinations taken prior to entering American University. Un - der no circumstances will students be permitted to re-take a sub - ject examination. Students should consult with their advisors as to how exami - nations will apply to their degree programs.

Inaddition, students need to acquire the critical reading skillsneeded for all their college courses. Students must satisfy the College Writing requirement within the first 30 credits earned in residence. Students who do not sat - isfy the College Writing requirement within the first 30 credits will be blocked from registering for subsequent semesters untilthe requirement is met. Students must receive a grade of C orbetter in any course taken to satis fy this requirement. Students are allowed at most three attempts, per the academic regulationsconcerning Freshman Forgiveness and repetition of courses, tocomplete this requirement. Incoming freshmen may satisfy theCollege Writing requirement in one of the following ways: /c183Earning a grade of C or better in LIT-100 and LIT-101; in LIT-130 and LIT-131; or in LIT-102 and LIT-103; or /c183Scoring 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement EnglishLanguage and Composition Test; or scoring 5 or higher onthe Higher Level International Baccalaureate Examination,and also earning a grade of C or better in LIT-106 orLIT-132. Writing Proficiency Examination for Transfer Students Transfer students who present 6 hours of acceptable compo- sition credit from another institution will satisfy the CollegeWriting requirement by passing the Writing Proficiency Exami-nation within the first calendar year of admission to AU. Stu - dents failing the exam twice must enroll in a College Writing requirement course that is approved by the College Writing Pro - gram and must pass the course with a grade of C or better. Transfer students who present 3 hours of acceptable compo - sition credit from another institution may satisfy the College Writing requirement within the first calendar year by passing acourse that is in the College Writing sequence and approved bythe College Writing Program with a grade of C or better. Students who do not satisfy the afo rementioned requirements will be blocked from registering for subsequent semesters untilthe relevant requirement is met.

University Mathematics Requirement Students must satisfy the University Mathematics require - ment within the first 30 credits earned in residence. Students who do not satisfy the University Mathematics requirementwithin the first 30 credits will be blocked from registering forsubsequent semesters until th e requirement is met. After stu - dents have matriculated at AU, no credit toward the University Mathematics requirement may be earned through transfercredit. Students meeting the requirement through course workmust receive a grade of C or better. Students are allowed at mostthree attempts, per the academic regulations concerning Fresh - man Forgiveness and repetition of courses, to complete this re - quirement. Incoming freshmen may satisfy the University Mathematics requirement in one of the following ways: /c183Earning a grade of C or better in one approved AU mathematics courses at the level of MATH-150 or above, orone AU statistics course offe red in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics; /c183AP Calculus AB or AP Calculus BC score of 4, or 5; /c183AP Statistics score of 4, or 5; /c183SAT II Mathematics Level II Achievement test score of650; or /c183CLEP Calculus examination score of 75. Transfer students and graduates of secondary schools outside the United States should consult with the Department of Mathe - matics and Statistics for a list of options that will satisfy this re - quirement. Transfer students may satisfy the University Mathematics requirement by completing a test as specified bythe Department of Mathematics and Statistics. The Department of Mathematics and Statistics will specify the appropriate placement of students in 100 and 200-levelmathematics or statistics courses.Undergraduate Rules and Regulations 61General Education Program The General Education Program is designed for all under - graduate students regardless of degree program. Aimed at build - ing a strong intellectual foundation, the General Education requirements are drawn from five Foundational Areas. The pro - gram is designed to be completed during the first two years of study, allowing students ample time to pursue their major as wellas study abroad, internships, and minors or second majors. The General Education Program is the cornerstone of a stu - dent's academic program at American University. This chapter guides students in building a meaningful and valuable program.While reading, please keep in mind the following: /c183students take a total of ten General Education courses; two courses in each of five Foundational Areas, with at least onecourse from The Natural and Mathematical Sciences(Foundational Area 5) that includes a laboratory scienceexperience /c183no more than two courses from a discipline may be taken forGeneral Education credit; disciplines are designated by thecourse number subject prefix (e.g., ANTH, BIO) /c183once a student has enrolled, all courses to fulfill GeneralEducation Requirements must be taken at AmericanUniversity General Education Program Definitions Foundational Area (or \"Area\") One of the five content-specific subdivisions of the General Education Program: 1 .T h eC r e a t i v eA r t s2. Traditions that Shape the Western World3. Global and Cross-Cultural Experience4. Social Institutions and Behavior5. The Natural and Mathematical Sciences Discipline Refers to the subject prefix in a course number regardless of academic department or course content. For example, the coursenumber PHIL-105 refers to a philosophy course; the coursenumber RELG-210 refers to a religion course. Although thesecourses are in the Philosophy and Religion Department, theyhave different prefixes and are in different disciplines. Thecourse number ARTH-105 refers to an art history course; thecourse number HIST-100 refers to a history course. Althoughthese courses are both about history, they are in different disci - plines.Foundational Area Requirements Students select courses from those that are designated as General Education courses. Students choose two courses in eachFoundational Area at either the 100- or 200-level. Courses at the 100-level introduce students to the fundamen - tal concepts, issues, and achievements in the disciplines. Courses deal explicitly with the appropriate processes and stan - dards for gathering and evaluating information (quantification, experiments, primary sources, authoritative texts) and interpre - tation (methods of investigation and analytic skills) in a specific disciplinary field. All science 100-level courses include a labo - ratory experience. The courses are designed to help students achieve a broad view of how different disciplinary viewpointsand fields of knowledge can contribute to their understanding ofthemselves and the world around them. Courses at the 200-leveltend to be more academically rigorous and are geared towardsecond-year students. Some may have prerequisites at the100-level, as designated by the academic unit offering thecourse. General Education courses differ from traditional survey courses by integrating into the course some of the intellectualskills and resources essential to life in the twenty-first century. These learning outcomes include the following, as appropri- ate: Aesthetic sensibilities: Critical reflections on the nature and history of beauty and art. Communication skills: Interchanging ideas and information through writing, speech, and visual and digital media. Critical inquiry: Systematic questioning and analysis of prob - lems, issues, and claims. Diverse perspectives and experiences: Acquiring knowledge and analytical skills to understand a variety of perspectives andexperiences, including those that have emerged from the schol - arship on age, disability, ethnicity, gender and gender identity, race, religion, sexual orientation, and social class. Innovative thinking: Venturing beyond established patterns of thought in imaginative and creative ways. Ethical reasoning: Assessing and weighing of moral and politi - cal beliefs and practices, and their applications to ethical dilem - mas. Information literacy: Locating, evaluating, citing, and effec - tively using information. Quantitative literacy and symbolic reasoning: Applying mathematical, statistical, and symbolic reasoning to complexproblems and decision making. Course Selection Students select two courses in each Foundational Area. Stu - dents will not be able to satisfy General Education Require - ments with more than two courses in any one discipline even62 Undergraduate Rules and Regulationsthough a discipline may have courses included in more than one Foundational Area. Courses required for College Writing andUniversity Mathematics do not count in the two-course limit. Prerequisites Students who have placed at or below Finite Mathematics must satisfy the University Mathematics Requirement beforeenrolling in a course in the Natural and Mathematical SciencesFoundational Area. Relation to the Major The requirements for the major, the area of a student's aca - demic concentration, are listed under individual degree pro - grams. Many of the courses in the General Education Program also meet requirements of the major. Students interested in adouble major need to plan ahead if they expect to fulfill all re - quirements within 120 credit hours. Grading Requirements To receive General Education credit, a student must success - fully complete a General Education course with a grade of D or better. However, if the course is also being taken to fulfill a re-quirement for the major at least a C is required and the gradingpolicies for that program should be consulted. Advanced Placement Credit Students presenting a 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement ex- amination, qualifying score on the CLEPexamination, or gradesfor which they have received credit from the British A Levels,CEGEP, International Baccalaureate, German Abitur, or otherinternational credential for which they have been granted creditby American University may apply the credit for up to fourcourses to meet General Education requirements in any of thefive Foundational Areas. Credit for General Education mayonly be awarded when specific General Education courses,which have been so designated, match particular exam results(with the exception of the CEGEP and German Abitur, whichare handled ad hoc) and only for examinations taken prior to en - tering American University. Specific information regarding ap - plication of this principle is contained in the \"General Education Advanced Placement Credit Articulation\" effective for the aca - demic year of admission. This document is maintained by the Office of Admissions and is available in all advising units. Transfer Students Transfer students satisfy their General Education Require - ments through a combination of appropriate transfer courses and completion of courses in the General Education Program atAmerican University. Through the evaluation of equivalentcourses taken at another institution and with the approval of astudent's dean, transfer credit may fulfill all 31 credit hours. Insome cases, students supplement t ransfer credit with General Education courses taken at the university to meet the 31-hour re - quirement.Study at Another Institution Transfer credit may be used to fulfill General Education Re - quirements through the evaluation of equivalent courses taken at another institution and with the approval of the student's dean.Because of the special nature of the program, after the studenthas been admitted to a degree program at American Universityno credit toward General Education Requirements may beearned through transfer credit. General Education and the University Mathematics Requirement All students must fulfill the University Mathematics Re - quirement before enrolling in their first course in the Natural and Mathematical Sciences Foundational Area (Area 5), unless theyhave placed above Finite Mathematics. Students who haveplaced above the level of Finite Mathematics may take their firstcourse before or concurrently with course work taken to satisfythe University Mathematics Requirement. Questions about General Education Who has to complete the General Education Program? All American University undergraduates must fulfill General Education requirements. How many courses do students take? All students must take two courses in each of the five Foun- dational Areas (for a total of ten). What if a course closes before a student can register for it or it is not offered the semester a student wants to take it? Almost all courses are offered at least once a year, so a stu - dent may wait until the next semester and see if it fits into that schedule. Or, a student may take a different course if it's compat - ible with his/ her schedule and s/hehas met all the prerequisites. How many courses may be taken from each discipline for Gen - eral Education credit? Although some academic departments have courses in sev - eral Areas, students may not take more than two General Educa - tion courses in a discipline. For example, a student may only take two sociology courses (course numbers beginning withSOCY) out of the ten General Education courses. What grade is required for General Education classes? Students must get a D or better in order to get General Educa - tion credit. However, if a General Education class is taken to ful - fill a requirement towards a major, at least a C is needed, and possibly a higher grade. Check with the appropriate academicdepartment to be sure.Undergraduate Rules and Regulations 63May a General Education course be taken, but not for General Education credit? Yes, a student may be able to c ount courses in the General Ed - ucation Program towards major or minor requirements, or for elective credit. Courses are offered for non-General Educationcredit under the same course number. Should General Education courses be spread out over four years? The program is designed so that it can be completed in a stu - dent's first two years. Students should finish their General Edu - cation requirements as soon as possible to keep their last years open for off-campus opportunities, such as internships and studyabroad. If a student has not yet completed the math requirement,it is essential to speak to an advisor about its connection to theNatural and Mathematical Sciences (Area 5) requirement. May advanced placement credits be used towards General Edu - cation requirements? Students presenting a 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement ex - amination, qualifying score on the CLEPexamination, or grades for which they have received credit from the British A Levels,CEGEP, International Baccalaureate, German Abitur or otherinternational credential for which they have been granted creditmay be able to apply the credit for up to four courses to meet theGeneral Education requirements in any of the five FoundationalAreas. Credit for General Education may only be awarded whenspecific General Education courses, which have been so desig-nated, match particular exam results (with the exception of theCEGEPand German Abitur, which are handled ad hoc) and onlyfor exams taken prior to entering American University. Specificinformation is contained in the General Education AdvancedPlacement Credit Articulation effective for the academic year ofadmission. This document is maintained by the Office of Ad - missions and is available in all advising units and online at: www.american.edu/provost/gened/CreditByExam.cfm . Do transfer students have to complete General Education re - quirements? Yes, transfer students must still fulfill General Education re - quirements. However, course s taken prior to admission to American University will be matched with General Educationcourses to determine whether they qualify for credit in the pro - gram. It is technically possible for all ten courses to be trans - ferred with a dean's approval.Where can students go for help in planning their General Edu - cation courses? Students should take the responsibility of planning which General Education courses they will take, making sure they fol - low all program requirements and rules. Each semester before registering online, students are reminded to review their elec - tronic degree audit report, which will indicate the General Edu - cation requirements still needed. An academic advisor or the publications available on campus and online at www.ameri - can.edu/provost/gened may be able to assist students who have questions or are having difficulty in choosing a particularcourse. Students may also contact the General Education Pro - gram at 202-885-3879 or gened@american.edu. What's the connection between the General Education Pro - gram and the University Mathematics Requirement? All students must fulfill the University Mathematics Re - quirement before enrolling in their first course in the Natural and Mathematical Sciences Foundational Area (Area 5), unless theyhave \"placed\" above Finite Mathematics. Students who haveplaced above the level of Finite Mathematics may take a coursein Area 5 before or concurrently with course work taken to sat-isfy the University Mathematics Requirement. Most Important Program Regulations /c183Do not take more than two courses from any single discipline as indicated by the subject prefix (for example,BIO is Biology and HIST is History) for General Educationcredit (including transferred courses). /c183Fulfill the University Mathematics requirement beforeenrolling in the Natural and Mathematical SciencesFoundational Area (Area 5), unless placed above FiniteMathematics. /c183At least one course in the Natural and MathematicalSciences Foundational Area (Area 5) must include alaboratory science experience. /c183Once enrolled, all courses to fulfill General Educationrequirements must be taken at American University. /c183Students must pass a General Education course with a gradeof D or better.64 Undergraduate Rules and RegulationsFoundational Area 1: T h eC r e a t i v eA r t s The creative arts celebrate the human capacity to imagine, to create, and to transform ideas into expressive forms such aspaintings, poems, and symphonies.

In comprehending the mechanisms and rulesthat give shape to complex societies, we gain strength to influ - ence institutional processes. Through reflection on principles that explain human behavior, we create understanding of our in - terpersonal experiences. Courses in this Foundational Area are of three kinds: those that use one of the traditional social science disciplines to pro - vide an overview of the interaction of individuals and the institu - tions that shape our economic, political, and social experience; those that focus on a single institution and the complex ways inwhich it affects our lives; and those that use a societal dilemmaas the entry point for discovering the ways in which the qualityof individual life is protected or challenged in various settings. The many and distinct disciplines that contribute to this area are united by a self-conscious dedication to the modes of inquiryof contemporary social science, as applied to the American ex-perience.

To be eligible for graduation honors, stu - dents must have completed at least 60 credit hours required for their degree in residence at American University and haveachieved the requisite grade point average. Both Latin Honorsand University Honors are listed in the commencement programand on the student's diploma and permanent record. Latin Honors Latin Honors are calculated and recorded on the transcript and diploma by the Office of the University Registrar upongraduation. To be eligible for Latin Honors, students must com-plete in residence at least half of the required credit hours neededfor a degree at American University (60 of the 120 earned cred-its) and must achieve the requisite cumulative grade point aver - age as indicated: summa cum laude : 3.91 or higher magna : 3.81 through 3.90 cum laude : 3.67 through 3.80 University Honors Program The University Honors Program is a comprehensive program of honors options drawn from the General Education curriculumand departmental course offerings to qualified undergraduate students. The program is characterized by small seminars, indi - vidualized attention from faculty, unique access to the resources of Washington, DC and the special atmosphere of an honorscommunity of committed faculty and students. Qualified entering freshmen, transfer students, and current students are eligible to apply for admission to the Honors pro - gram. Entering freshmen are admitted to the program based upon excellence in their high school academic performance anddocumented potential for high performance as undergraduatestudents. Other students may be admitted to the program at thediscretion of the honors director if they have achieved a cumula - tive grade point average (GPA) of 3.50 for their first 30 earned credits at American University. Students entering the program as freshmen must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours in designated Honors course workwith a grade of B or better in each of the Honors courses and acumulative GPA of 3.50 or above. Students who enter the Uni - versity Honors Program after the freshman year are required to complete the number of required hours determined by the direc-tor of the University Honors Program. Students who complete the upper-level requirements for Uni- versity Honors in their major will, upon recommendation bytheir teaching unit or equivalent, receive University Honors intheir major or majors. Alternatively, students who fulfill the up-per-level requirements through University Honors seminars orthrough interdisciplinary course work will graduate with Uni-versity Honors. All University Honors students are required to meet with their Honors counselor for advisement before registering eachsemester.

Students who are registered for more than a half-time credit load in any semester, but less than a full-time credit loadfor that semester, will be cons idered half-time students. Graduate students must remain registered for a full-time course load under specific conditions that include: holding ahalftime Graduate Teaching Assistant or Research Assistantaward; holding a University Graduate Fellowship; having par - ticular types of student loans; and, having international student status. Associate Deans of academic units will contact the Officeof the Registrar each semester following the end of the drop/addperiod to obtain enrollment information to check the full-timestatus of graduate students who are required to be enrolledfull-time. It is the responsibility of individual graduate studentsto understand how changes in course load or full-time status may have an impact on payment schedules or other conditionsof their obligations to entities providing them with educationalloans. Academic Good Standing and Satisfactory Progress Graduate students are in Good Academic Standing when they are maintaining at least a 3.0 cumulative GPAand are eitherenrolled in semester classes or are eligible to enroll in subse-quent semester classes. Students are making Satisfactory Academic Progress when, in addition to being in Good Academic Standing and meetingany higher standards for the GPA that individual programsmight set, they are: meeting on time the defined milestones intheir Program of Study and they have received credit in at leasttwo-thirds of the courses which they have attempted. For mas-ter's students, such milestones include, but are not limited to,completing the required coursework and completing the cap - stone experience satisfactorily. For doctoral students, mile - stones include, but are not limited to, completing the required coursework, passing the comprehensive examination(s) orequivalent, defending the disse rtation proposal, completing the dissertation, and defending the completed dissertation. For students writing a thesis or dissertation, it is the collective responsibility of the student and the student's Thesis Advisor orDissertation Committee Chair to ensure that Satisfactory Aca - demic Progress is being maintained. This process is coordinated by the student's Thesis Advisor or Dissertation CommitteeChair, and oversight authority rests with the Graduate ProgramDirector. Thesis Advisors and Dissertation Committee Chairsare required to review annually all students conducting theses ordissertations to determine that t hey are making Satisfactory Ac - ademic Progress, and to (1) inform the student, and (2) inform the Graduate Program Director, who will communicate the find - ing to the Associate Dean of the Academic Unit. Students may request of the Graduate Program Director, at least once each se - mester, that their Thesis Director or Dissertation Committee Chair meet with them to discuss progress on the thesis or disser - tation. 71Academic Integrity Code Students are bound by the University's Academic Integrity Code, which ensures that all work done in pursuit of a degreewhether graded or ungraded, formal or informal, meets the high - est standards of academic honesty. The baseline sanction for a first-time offense for graduate students violating the code is sus - pension from the university, although academic dismissal is also a common sanction. Suspension and academic dismissal arepermanently recorded on the transcript as a violation of the Aca - demic Integrity Code. For more information, see page 47 of this catalog. Academic Probation and Dismissal The Registrar will place students on Academic Probation when, after attempting at least 9 credit hours of coursework,their cumulative GPA falls below 3.00 or when students fail toreceive credit in at least two-thirds of the courses they attempt.Full-time students will be placed on Academic Probation for onesemester. Part-time students will be placed on Academic Proba-tion for the time it takes them to attempt 9 more credits, or threesemesters, whichever is shorter. The Registrar will inform thestudents of their probationary status in writing. This notificationshould also inform the students that they cannot receive an in-complete grade while they are on Academic Probation status.After the Academic Probation period is completed, studentswho fail to bring their cumulative GPA up to 3.00 or fail to raisetheir course completion rate will be permanently dismissed fromthe University by the Registrar. If the Program Director or Associate Dean of an academic unit determines that a student is not making Satisfactory Aca - demic Progress for reasons other than failure to maintain GPA and course completion requirements, the Dean may decide to ei - ther issue an Academic Warning, place the student on Academic Probation, or academically dismiss the student. The Dean mustnotify the Registrar of the decision to apply a sanction. The Reg - istrar will notify each student of the decision and the reason for the decision. In the case of either an Academic Warning or Aca - demic Probation notice, the Registrar must also inform the stu - dent in writing of the period for the warning or probation and of the conditions that must be met for the student to regain Satisfac - tory Academic Progress status. Customarily, students who are on an Academic Warning status for one semester are subject toAcademic Probation in subsequent semesters, and students whoremain on Academic Probation in a subsequent semester aresubject to Academic Dismissal. Academic Dismissals are permanently recorded on the tran - script. Academic Warnings and Academic Probation are not.Combined Bachelor's and Master's Degrees American University offers students the opportunity to earn both undergraduate and graduate degrees through its combinedbachelor's/master's programs. For more information, seepage 57 of this catalog. Continuous Enrollment Once enrolled in a degree program, graduate students must maintain continuous enrollment at American University by reg - istering for at least one semester hour of credit each fall and spring semester until the degree objective is reached. Studentswho fail to register and who have not requested and received atemporary leave (see page 52 for more information) will be dis - missed from the University at the end of the academic term for which they failed to register. Credit Requirements Criteria for Graduate Academic Credit Course numbers 600-800 are reserved for graduate courses. Required core courses that have key content in the discipline forgraduate degrees at both the master's and doctoral degree arecustomarily at the 600 level. Courses at the 700 level are cus-tomarily advanced courses for master's programs, while coursesat the 800 level are reserved fo r Ph.D. students. Graduate stu- dents will not receive credit for courses below the 500 level un-less the course is an AU language course that is necessary forlanguage proficiency levels for the graduate degree and is agraduate program requirement. Classes at the 600-800 levelcourses may not meet jointly with 100-, 200-, or 300-levelcourses. A 500-level course may be used for fulfillment of gen - eral master's degree requirements for courses of general impor - tance to the discipline (e.g., elective courses), but, ordinarily, not for required core courses for master's or doctoral degrees. Noundergraduate students may take 600-level courses except when(a) they are seeking a combined ma ster's/bachelor's degree, (b) when the courses are cross-listed with undergraduate coursesunder an undergraduate number at the 400 level, or (c) by specialpermission of the Associate Dean of the academic unit. Gradesof C- or lower will not be accepted as fulfilling the requirementsof the Program of Study but will be calculated in the cumulativeGPA. Individual programs may set higher standards. Transfer Credits Students may request to transfer credit for courses taken at an institution outside of the Consortium of Universities of theWashington Metropolitan Area, prior to their admission to agraduate program at AU. They must receive prior approval fromtheir Graduate Program Director within the first semester oftheir program and the courses must be included in their Program72 Graduate Rules and Regulationsof Study. Students must give the Graduate Program Director an official transcript of the course and a course syllabus for eachcourse requested for transfer. Courses must be completed with agrade of B (3.0) or better and must be completed no later thanfive years prior to the beginning of the semester in which the stu - dent is admitted to a graduate program. Graduate programs may require that courses requested to be transferred be completedmore recently than this and may limit the number of credits thatmay be transferred beyond the university limit. Customarily the number of total credits transferred for a sin - gle degree program would be no greater than six credits, but in all cases the number of allowable transfer credits is limited byresidency requirements. In no cas e may graduate credit be given for coursework designated as solely undergraduate by the insti - tution where the coursework was completed. Courses proposed for transfer cannot have been used as credits toward a completeddegree in the same field at another institution. Decisions byGraduate Program Directors with regard to allowable transfercredits may be appealed to the Vice Provost for Graduate Stud - ies and Research. In Residence Credit and Residency Requirements Courses are considered in residence when they are taken at American University, through an AU-coordinated off-site oron-line program, or through any member of the Consortium ofUniversities of the Washington Metropolitan Area. Coursesconsidered not in residence include those transferred from an-other institution into AU. Courses that are not taken in residenceare not included in the computation of the GPA. Both master's and doctoral degrees require a minimum of 18 semester credit hours of in residence graduate course work,while enrolled in a degree program, exclusive of 797 or 899.Students in the Dual Degree option must complete a minimumof 36 semester credit hours of in residence coursework at Ameri - can University, with at least 50 percent of the credits unique to each degree. Individual program requirements may requiremore than 18 credit hours for either or both degrees. Coursesused to satisfy residence credi t requirements for an undergradu - ate degree may not also be used to satisfy parallel requirements for a dual master's degree. Repetition of Courses Graduate students may repeat only once a course they have previously completed and failed or from which they have with - drawn. They may repeat only two courses in this fashion during a graduate program of study. Grades for each attempt are shownon the transcript and are used to compute the overall GPA, butcredits for only one passed course are included in the credits re - quired for the graduate degree.Grades and Grade Point Average Included in the calculation of the cumulative GPA for gradu - ate students are all graduate-level courses taken at AU and courses taken from the Consortium of Universities of the Wash - ington Metropolitan Area as required by the Program of Study. Credits accepted as transfer credit from other institutions orearned during a permit to study at another domestic or foreigninstitution are included in the total number of credit hours appli - cable to degree requirements, but grades earned in such courses are not recorded on the transcript at American University andare not used in the calculation of the GPAneeded for graduation.Determination of the cumulative GPAfor graduate students, andthe notification of graduate students regarding any deficienciesin GPA is the responsibility of the Office of the Registrar. Graduate students may not choose the pass/fail option over the letter-grade option in courses that are part of their Program ofStudy. However, in some instances, courses that can only betaken pass/fail may be included as part of a student's Program ofStudy. A grade of Pass for a graduate student indicates perfor - mance of no less than a B which indicates at numeric equivalentof 3.0. Neither Pass nor Fail grades are used to compute the GPA. Graduate students may register for courses with an auditgrade option that are not part of their Program of Study. Thesis (797) and dissertation (899) course credits are graded as Satisfactory Progress (SP) or Unsatisfactory Progress (UP).With grades of either SP or UP, students receive credit for thesecourses but the grades earned are not used in computing theGPA. These grades do not change upon the completion of thethesis or dissertation, and neither thesis nor dissertation creditsmay be retaken to change a previously assigned UP to an SP. The instructor of record may assign an Incomplete status for a grade when extenuating circumstances prevent a student, whohas otherwise completed the majority of the work in the course,from completing all work during the stated instructional period.Students on probation may not receive an Incomplete (seepage 51 for more information). Graduate students may register for courses with an audit grade option that are not part of their Program of Study. Facultywill establish standards for class participation and/or attendancefor auditing students. When auditing students fail to meet thosestandards, the instructor will assign the grade of ZL (administra - tive withdrawal from audit). Tuition for courses registered for an audit grade option will be billed at the same rate as courses regis - tered for academic credit (see page 35 for more information). The grading scale and the grade calculations used in the grad - uate GPA are equivalent to those used for undergraduate stu - dents (see page 50 for more information).Graduate Rules and Regulations 73Graduate Research Assistantships (RA) A research assistant (RA) is a graduate student who assists a faculty member with academic res earch. Research assistants are not independent researchers and are not directly responsible forthe outcome of the research. They are responsible to a researchsupervisor or principal investigator. The work assignments for RAs must be significantly more academically substantive than administrative. Requirements forRAawards are typically fulfilled with 600 hours of work per ac - ademic year, often with a 20 hour assignment per week over two traditional semesters, but may b e fewer hours per week for a lon - ger period, with proportional reductions in the amount of the as - sociated monthly stipend. The Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Research can, in cases where a compelling rationaleexists, authorize a graduate student with an RA award to workmore than 20 hours per week. Graduate Teaching Assistantships (TA) A teaching assistant (TA) is customarily a graduate student who assists an instructor with instructional activities. TArespon-sibilities vary greatly and may include the following: tutoring;holding office hours; assisting with grading homework or ex-ams; administering tests or exams; assisting an instructor with alarge lecture class by teaching students in recitation, laboratory,or discussion sessions. Student s who assist with grading may not grade assignments or exams for students at their own or higherdegree level; e.g., a doctoral student may assist with gradingmaster's and undergraduate work ; a master's student may assist with grading undergraduate work. Advanced doctoral studentswho are awarded teaching assistantships may also be the in - structor of record for an undergraduate course. The work assignments for TAs must be significantly more ac - ademically substantive than administrative. Requirements for TAawards are typically fulfilled with 600 hours of work per aca - demic year, often with a 20 hour assignment per week over two traditional semesters, but may b e fewer hours per week for a lon - ger period, with proportional reductions in the amount of the as - sociated monthly stipend. The Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Research can, in cases where a compelling rationaleexists, authorize a graduate student with a TA award to workmore than 20 hours per week. Independent Studies With the approval of their Graduate Program Director, stu - dents making Satisfactory Academic Progress may register for an independent study. The indepe ndent study must be identified as a course in the Program of Study. Before registration, the stu - dent and the supervising faculty member must agree upon anddocument the title, objective, scope, credit value (1 to 6 credit hours), and the method of evaluation for the independent study.The instructor must notify the Graduate Program Director of theagreement for the independent study. Students will not havemore than 9 Independent Study credit hours in any graduate pro - gram. Individual program s may set lower limits. Internships Graduate students may enroll in credit-bearing, paid, or un - paid work assignments (internships) with a significant academic component under the guidance of a faculty member. The workfor the internship may be no more than 15% administrative innature, and instructors must weigh the academic component asat least half of the course grade. The internship must be identi - fied as a course on the Program of Study. Internships may be taken for variable credit. With the approval of the Director of theGraduate Program, students may enroll for 1 to 6 credits. Overthe 14 weeks of a traditional semester (or the equivalent for sum - mer or special term classes), a student will work typically an av - erage of 7 hours per week for 1 internship credit, 10 hours for 2 credits, 14 hours for 3 credits, 18 hours for 4 credits, 22 hours for5 credits, and 26 hours for 6 credits. Customarily, students willnot have more than 6 Internship Study credit hours in any gradu-ate program. Individual pr ograms may set lower limits. Program of Study The Program of Study is an individualized, formal plan de- scribing the program requireme nts a student must meet to com- plete a specific degree, including the dates by which eachrequirement is expected to be completed. Students must meetwith a designated advisor to outline their Program of Study bythe end of their first semester in the program, and earlier as ap - propriate. Thereafter, students are expected to meet as needed with their designated advisor or Program Director to monitortheir status related to Good Academic Standing and SatisfactoryAcademic Progress and to update the Program of Study asneeded. Research Assurances and Research Ethics Training Graduate students at American University who are conduct - ing independent research are responsible for obtaining the ap - propriate research assurances for research that involves: human participants, animal subjects, recombinant DNA, infectious ma - terials, select or toxic agents, or human materials. For applica - tion forms and guidelines, please see AU's Research website (www.american.edu/research/ ). Copies of research assurances must be presented to the Doctoral Program Director with thecompleted dissertation proposal at the time of the defense of thedissertation proposal.74 Graduate Rules and RegulationsAppropriate protocol review and oversight of faculty and stu - dent research is an essential component of Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training on campus. All graduate studentswho are conducting research in partial fulfillment of a master'sthesis or doctoral dissertation are required to participate in RCRtraining. Documentation of RCR training must be presented tothe Doctoral Program Director with the completed dissertationproposal at the time of the defense of the dissertation proposal. Data resulting from research projects, including thesis and dissertation research projects that do not receive a protocol re - view when appropriate from the Institutional Review Board (IRB), Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)or Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) cannot be used tofulfill degree requirements, cannot be published and must be de - stroyed. A research protocol cannot be reviewed and approved retrospectively by an IRB, IACUC, or IBC. Willful avoidanceof the oversight functions of University research review com - mittees can result in a charge of research misconduct. Submission and Publication of Thesis/Dissertation Dissertations and theses must be submitted to the University Library in electronic format after final approval of the disserta-tion or thesis by the Examining Committee. Dissertations andtheses submitted to the University through the ETD process willalso be deposited in the AU Library's online electronic archive,the American University Research Commons (AURC), as wellas ProQuest's Digital Dissertati ons. The submission of the thesis or dissertation to the University in fulfillment of degree require-ments grants the University the one-time, non-exclusive right topublish the document in the American University ResearchCommons. Distribution is subject to a release date stipulated bythe student and approved by the University. As the owner of thecopyright of the thesis or dissert ation, students have the exclu - sive right to reproduce, distribute, make derivative works based on, publicly perform and display their work, and to authorizeothers to exercise some or all of those rights. Time Limits to Degree Students are expected to complete their degree within the time frame specified below. Programs may set lower limits forall students or for individual students in their program. Timelimits must be included in the Program of Study. The time to de - gree may be extended by the Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Research for a compelling reason. Approved separationsand leaves of absence do not count toward the time limits, butcannot be used for the sole purpose of extending the time to de - gree. Master's students are expected to complete all degree re - quirements in no more than six years after the date of first enroll - ment in the degree program. Doctoral students are expected to complete all degree requirements in no more than nine years af -ter the date of first enrollment in the degree program. Each se - mester, the Registrar will identify students who will exceed time limits to degree at the end of the current academic year and in - form the students of the potential status change. Time Extensions Under compelling circumstance, doctoral students may ap - ply for one-year extensions beyond the expected time to degree, for a maximum of three extensions. Students must petition theGraduate Program Director for each one-year extension. Peti - tions must include a timetable listing specific goals from the Program of Study to be accomplished during the extension.Each extension must be approved by the Associate Dean of theacademic unit and the Vice Provost for Graduate Studies andResearch. Additional extensions will not be approved. Study at Another Institution Permit to Study at Another US Institution Students in good academic standing who wish to take courses at another US institution that would not be considered in resi - dence courses, must receive prior approval by their Program Di- rector and Associate Dean. Students who want to apply a courseto their graduate program of study must receive teaching unit orequivalent approval. Students must secure approval from the ac-ademic unit prior to registering for the course and such approvalis granted only for specific courses. Customarily, students maytransfer up to a maximum of 6 credits during the span of ap-proved study at another US institution. Grades for courses takenduring a Permit to Study at another institution are not recordedon the AU transcript and are not computed in the GPA, althoughthey will count toward the total number of credits needed forgraduation. However, students m ust meet the GPArequirements of American University for individual courses taken at other in - stitutions as required for their graduate Program of Study. Stu - dents must satisfy any additional requirements provided on the Permit to Study form. Permit to Study Abroad Students in good academic standing who wish to study at any foreign university not partnered with AU must receive prior ap - proval of their Graduate Program Director and the Associate Dean. Permission for such study is granted only when the stu - dent can demonstrate that the academic opportunity offered by the foreign university cannot be met through study at any one ofAU's existing partner universities. Grades for courses taken dur - ing a Permit to Study Abroad are not recorded on the AU tran - script and are not computed in the GPA, though they will count in the total number of credits needed for graduation. However,students must meet GPA requirements of American Universityfor individual courses taken at other institutions as required fortheir graduate Program of Study. Students must satisfy any addi - tional requirements provided on the Permit to Study Abroad form.Graduate Rules and Regulations 75Master's Degree Requirements Master's Students must have an approved Program of Study that includes, but is not limited to, coursework and a capstoneexperience. Amaster's degree requires the completion of at least30 semester credit hours of graduate work. The requirement forresidence credit must be met .A detailed description of the de - gree requirements can be obtained from each graduate program and must be posted on the website of the teaching unit. Capstone Experience One capstone experience (e.g., thesis, research project, practicum, internship or other e xperience as determined by the graduate program) is required. The nature and scope of the cap - stone experience is determined by the graduate program and is included in the Program of Study. If the capstone is a compre - hensive examination, the structure, content, and grading of the examination, as well as any policy on retaking the examinationwill be determined by the teaching unit. Thesis Students writing a thesis as their capstone experience are ex- pected to demonstrate their capacity to do original, independentresearch. Students must take no f ewer than three semester credit hours of master's thesis research (797). Students continue to reg-ister for thesis credits each semester until the completion of thethesis. A thesis advisory comm ittee shall consist of no fewer than two members of the AU faculty. In consultation with theThesis Chair, the student solicits faculty for the committee andsubmits their names for approval by the Graduate Program Di-rector. Jointly Administered Degree Programs A Jointly Administered Degree Program is a specified com - bination of courses, typically from more than one academic orteaching unit, that combines elements of the various courses of study in those units for the purpose of providing a combined pro - gram of study towards a specific degree. Both units have respon - sibilities to monitor student progress and provide academic advising. Upon completion of the Jointly Administered DegreeProgram, the student receives one graduate degree. Dual Degree Programs A Dual Degree Program is a combination of two separate ap - proved degree programs. Upon completion of a Dual Degree Program, a student will be conferred the two degrees included inthe Dual Degree Program. Credits that apply from one programto another must be approved by their respective Graduate Pro - gram Directors and under the following conditions: /c183Students must meet all of the course, capstone, and other requirements for each degree program. /c183The details for dual master's degrees must be approved bythe Graduate Program Director and the Associate Dean ofthe academic unit for each of the two degrees. Candidatesfor dual master's degrees must submit a formal petition tothe Graduate Program Director of each master's programbefore the conferral date of the first degree. /c183The student applies for and receives each degree uponcompletion of all the requirements for that degree. Thedegrees may or may not be completed simultaneously. /c183At least 50% of the courses taken in each program in theDual Degree Program must be taken in residence, andstudents must satisfy residenc y requirements as specified in the graduate regulations.76 Graduate Rules and RegulationsGraduate Certificate Programs Graduate Certificate Programs for Credit Academic units and the School of Professional and Extended Studies, at their discretion, may develop and administer gradu - ate certificate programs for which there is academic credit. All graduate certificate programs for credit must include a mini - mum of 12 semester credit hours. All course work must meet the same requirements as those used for graduate academic pro - grams. Some certificate programs for graduate credit may have additional requirements. If approved by the academic or teach - ing unit that administers the certificate program, equivalent credits earned at an accredited college or university may betransferred toward a certificate at the following rates: 3 credithours for certificates from 12 to 18 credit hours in length, and 6credit hours for certificates over 18 credit hours in length. Graduate students who are enrolled in masters and/or doc - toral programs may pursue graduate certificates at the same time. Any sharing of the require d semester hour credits between the graduate certificate and the graduate degree program will bedetermined by the Graduate Program Director. Students who arenot enrolled in graduate degree programs but who are enrolled ingraduate certificate programs are not permitted to enroll incourses in the Consortium of Universities of the WashingtonMetropolitan Area. All students enrolled in graduate certificate programs must maintain a 3.0 grade point average to be considered as makingsatisfactory progress and to be awarded a certificate. Grades ofC- or below in certificate program courses will not be acceptedtoward the fulfillment of certificate requirements although thesegrades will be included in the calculation of the cumulativeGPA. Individual certificate programs may have higher stan -dards. Students who do not achieve a 3.0 grade point average at any point after completing six credit hours are subject to an aca - demic warning, probation, or dismissal from the certificate pro - gram. Students who do not achieve a 3.0 grade point average upon completion of 12 credit hours will be dismissed from thecertificate program. The Office of the Registrar will identify stu - dents with deficiencies in their grade point average and notify both the student and the certificate program. Certificate studentswho are dismissed may seek readmission at the discretion of theGraduate Program Directors and will be subject to any new ad - missions and program requirements instituted since their last en - rollment. Students in certificate progr ams must complete a minimum of 6 credit hours during each 12-month period after the start oftheir first semester of enrollment. All graduate certificate pro - grams must be completed within four years. Students who do not meet these minimum requirements will be dismissed fromthe certificate program. If a student is readmitted to the program,the acceptance of previously completed credits will be deter-mined by the academic or teaching unit upon readmission. Thecompletion of the certificate will be noted on the student's offi-cial transcript for the semester it was completed. Graduate Certificate Program not for Credit Academic units, centers/institutes, and the School of Profes- sional and Extended Studies, at their discretion, may developand administer graduate certificate programs for which there isno academic credit.Graduate Rules and Regulations 77PhD Degree Requirements Approved Program of Study All doctoral students must have an approved Program of Study (link to Program of Study section.) The ability to do inde - pendent research is an important part of the Program of Study and must be demonstrated by an original dissertation on a topicapproved by the Director of the Doctoral Program in which thestudent is earning the degree. A dissertation is required of allcandidates for a Ph.D. degree. An approved Program of Study includes: /c183Complete list of coursework /c183Schedule with anticipated dates for: /c183planned courses in required and elective subjects, /c183the comprehensive examination(s) or equivalent, /c183an approved dissertation proposal, and /c183successful defense and completion of the dissertation. Degree Requirements The PhD degree requires a minimum of 18 semester hour credits of coursework completed in residence, exclusive of dis-sertation credits. Individual PhD programs at AU require addi-tional semester credit hours, following the curriculum proposedby academic unit faculty and approved by the Faculty SenateCommittee on Graduate Curriculum. Comprehensive Examination(s) or Equivalent The nature and scope of the comprehensive examination(s) or equivalent are determined by the PhD degree programshoused within specific academic units. Options other than awritten exam may be used by a doctoral degree program to as - sess integration and synthesis of the body of knowledge ac - cessed via the program curriculum, and related research, practicum, or internship experiences. The completed compre - hensive examination(s) is typically read by two faculty readers from the academic unit and is rated \"with distinction,\" \"satisfac - tory\" or \"unsatisfactory\" by each. In order to pass the examina - tion, the student must obtain at least \"satisfactory\" on the examination from both readers. The faculty affiliated with adoctoral program may, however, elect to design a different sys - tem for grading comprehensive examinations in the academic unit. Astudent who fails a comprehensive examination may apply to the Graduate Program Director for one additional attempt. Ifthe Graduate Program Director approves the application, the re - take of the exam should occur within six months of the date of the first attempt. Students who fail a retake attempt will be dis - missed from the doctoral program. The Graduate Program Di -rector will notify the Office of the Registrar of the outcome of all comprehensive exam attempts. PhD Dissertation Committee The appointment of the Dissertation Committee should be made well in advance of the defens e of the dissertation proposal. All core Dissertation Committee members must hold the appro - priate terminal degree. In consultation with the proposed Disser - tation Committee Chair, the doctoral student solicits faculty for the committee and submits the names of the Chair and othercommittee members for approval by the Graduate Program Di - rector. Once approved by the Graduate Program Director, the proposed membership of a Dissertation Committee is then ap - proved by the Doctoral Council. If the status of any member of an approved Dissertation Committee changes, the doctoral stu - dent and the Graduate Program Director will recommend a re - placement for approval by the Doctoral Council. Customarily, the Dissertation Committee will have four or more core committee members, including the chair of the com-mittee. The minimum number of core committee members, in-cluding the chair of the committee, is three. At least two of thecore members must be full-time, tenure-line faculty members atAmerican University and preferably from the program in whichthe student is enrolled. Qualified individuals, either outside thedepartment or outside the University, may be invited to sit on acommittee as external members once the minimum requirementof two internal full-time, tenure-line faculty from AmericanUniversity has been met. Together, the internal and externalmembers form the core of the Dissertation Committee. Coremembers are charged with guiding the student and providing de - tailed feedback during the dissertation process. The chair of the Dissertation Committee must be an AU fac - ulty member who holds a tenured position. Untenured, ten - ure-line faculty may be appointed as co-chairs of Dissertation Committees, but must serve with a tenured faculty member. Ad - junct faculty, term faculty, and faculty from other universities and emeritus faculty may not chair a Dissertation Committeebut may serve on it. A Dissertation Committee chair who retiresor leaves the University before the dissertation is complete maypetition the Doctoral Council to remain on the committee aschair, as a co-chair, or as a member. At the time of the final examination of the dissertation, at least one additional member will join the core of the dissertationcommittee as an outside reader for the final examination. Thepurpose of the outside reader(s) is to provide a review of the dis - sertation by a colleague with the appropriate terminal degree who is an expert in the subject matter of the dissertation. Theoutside reader should have no direct association with the stu - dent. An outside reader serves an advisory role, and the charge to the outside reader is to determine if the dissertation meets gen -78 Graduate Rules and Regulationseral standards in the field, not necessarily to critique the work in detail. Once the dissertation has been defended successfully, allcommittee members sign the dissertation approval form. Advancement to Candidacy Students advance to doctoral candidacy when they have completed all of the courses on their Program of Study, passedtheir comprehensive examination or equivalent, and defendedsuccessfully their dissertation proposal. Advancement to candi - dacy normally occurs by the end of the third year of study but may vary among doctoral programs. At the time of advance - ment to candidacy, students who have not petitioned for or re - ceived en passant degrees (e.g., MA, MS) will automatically be considered for such degrees. If a student advances to candidacyafter the deadline to submit a petition for the degree in that term,the student will be considered for a degree in the following term.Students who do not advance to candidacy may receive a mas - ter's degree according to the established guidelines in their grad - uate program. Once doctoral students advance to candidacy, they will only need to register for dissertation continuing enrollment (899) forup to nine (9) credit hours per semester or a total of 18 credithours per academic year. They will continue to register asfull-time students until they defend their dissertations. AU doc-toral students who have been admitted to doctoral candidacymust register and pay for dissertation continuing enrollmentcredit hours and related services during fall and spring semestersof the academic year, unless they have an approved temporaryleave from the University. Examination of Dissertation Each doctoral candidate is required to defend orally his or her doctoral dissertation as a requirement in partial fulfillment of thedoctoral degree. The requirement for a dissertation examination is separate from, and is not fulfilled by, a comprehensive exami - nation(s). The dissertation examination will consist of a publicpresentation by the candidate on the research reported in the dis - sertation, followed by a formal, public examination of the candi - date by the Dissertation Committee. The Doctoral Program Director is responsible for pos ting publically the announcement of the oral defense of the dissertation seven days prior to the dateof the oral defense. The Dissertation Committee has the following options: /c183To accept the dissertation without any recommendations for changes and sign the appropriate form. /c183To accept the dissertation with recommendations for minorchanges and, except for the chair, sign the appropriate form.The chair then will oversee and approve all requiredchanges to the dissertation. Upon the chair's approval, thechair will sign the appropriate form. /c183To recommend major revisions to the dissertation and to notsign the appropriate form until the candidate has made therequired changes and submitted t he revised dissertation to the Dissertation Committee for additional review andapproval. Upon their approval, members of the DissertationCommittee sign the appropriate form for the reviseddissertation. /c183To recommend revisions and convene a second meeting ofthe Dissertation Committee to review the dissertation andcomplete the candidate's examination. /c183To evaluate the dissertation, including its examination, asunsatisfactory. If the candidate fails, the candidate canpetition the Dissertation Committee chair and theDissertation Committee for one retake.

The College provides a rich education in the liberal arts and sciences for all of American University's undergraduate stu - dents, offers challenging programs of study for its undergradu - ate and graduate majors; and fosters outstanding research, practice, and creative activity. The College is committed to the core purposes of liberal ed - ucation: promoting free and rational discourse, fostering an un - derstanding of the diversity of human experience, providing the critical intellectual skills necessary to navigate a rapidly chang - ing world, and integrating knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. Undergraduate Programs Academic Advisement The College challenges students to assume substantial re - sponsibility for defining their educational goals, yet provides careful professional guidance to help them respond to the chal - lenge. Undergraduates plan their academic programs with aca - demic counselors and faculty advisors according to theirinterests, professional plans, and academic progress. Before they enroll in classes, first-semester freshmen choose courseswith the assistance of a detailed curriculum guide. Duringfreshman orientation, students are assigned an academic coun - selor who serves as the primary advisor until they choose their majors, usually by the end of the sophomore year. After stu - dents formally declare their majors, they are advised by faculty advisors from their major departments, but may consult withtheir academic counselor as needed. At transfer orientation orupon enrollment, transfer students meet with an academiccounselor and then go to the departments of their intended ma-jors for academic advisement as described above. Transfer stu-dents undecided on a major, are advised by an academiccounselor. Foreign Language The university encourages students to gain proficiency in at least one foreign language, especially those embarking on a ca-reer in international relations, study of the humanities, or spe-cialization in minority groups in the United States. Graduatestudy will often require proficiency in one or more foreign lan - guages. Internships Internships engage students in practical experiences, sup - port learning, and provide on-the-job training. Interns work in many organizations in both the public and the private sectors inthe Washington area. The growing number of internships in theCollege is testimony to both their popularity and their success.For more information on internships, students should consultwith their academic units and the Career Center. Majors No later than the end of the sophomore year, students in the College are expected to declare an academic major. In this fieldthe student pursues study in depth and synthesizes academicknowledge. Major programs are de scribed in the departmental sections. Students should become familiar with departmentalrequirements and regulations as stated in this catalog. Whenmaking a formal declaration of major, students are assigned anacademic advisor who will supervise their studies until gradua - tion. Students interested in the natural sciences, mathematics, music, and art need to take specific courses in the freshman yearif they intend to complete a degree in eight semesters. Such stu - 81dents should declare their interests as soon as possible and seek explicit counseling from the appropriate department. Minors Undergraduate students may earn a minor in most depart - ments and programs of the College of Arts and Sciences. All minor programs consist of a minimum of 18 credit hours, in - cluding at least 9 credit hours at the 300 level or above.

The American Studies Program offers a highly interdisci- plinary major and minor in which students can explore the dif - ferent cultures and cultural expressions of the United States during its history and today. Students have the opportunity toresearch complex questions and follow interests that go beyondthe confines of a single discipline and which are crucial to anunderstanding of US society and politics. American Studies stu - dents learn to analyze US society through sources ranging from historical documents, paintings, films, literature, blogs, andvideo games, thus preparing them for a wide range of careers inthe media, museums, urban planning, education, and govern - mental and non-governmental organizations, in the United States or abroad. The faculty consists of expert teachers and scholars from different departments, including anthropology, art history, his - tory, literature, and education, who cooperate closely with DC community leaders and institutions, thus bringing diverse learn - ing experiences into the classroom. Courses in American Stud - ies encourage students to use the many resources DC has to offer and to participate in internships and service-learning(themed volunteer work accompanying a specific course andsupervised by faculty). Many of our students find internshipsand part-time jobs in DC's political and cultural institutions,thus complementing their education with practical experience.Taking advantage of its unique location, the American Stud- ies Program at AU focuses on studies of urban DC and the re-gion as well as the study of the United States' diverse culturalrelations with the world (such as migration, tourism, and ethniccuisine). We encourage students to participate in AU's StudyAbroad Program to experience an outside perspective on theUnited States. The American Studies Program at AU offers aunique profile and learning experience from which students canbenefit in many ways.

Shapiro-Perl Humans have always constituted their families, sexuality, gendered identities, social groups, religious practices, work,play, and artistic expression in dramatically diverse ways. An - thropologists explore everyday experience, cultural difference, and power relations in order to understand this diversity in thecontext of local and global histories. Stark inequalities are alsopart of the human experience, and anthropologists seek to un - cover the ideologies and processes that create and mask those inequalities. Different kinds of anthropologists explore difference and power from specialized perspectives. Cultural and social an - thropologists search for the connections between culturalmeanings and lived human experience. Archaeologists probe the remains of past civilizations for significant transformations inthe ways communities organized their homes and labor. Biologi - cal anthropologists document the dynamics of human evolution and study nutrition, health, and illness in their cultural contexts.Linguists examine the varied texts that speakers create for cluesthat language holds to hierarchy and personal expression. Anthropology students examine pa st and present societies to bring anthropological and archaeological theory and practice toongoing struggles against racism, sexism, homophobia, inequal - ity, poverty, environmental degradation, and ethnic/cultural genocide. The undergraduate anthropology program at Ameri - can University introduces students to all four subfields of anthro - pology, and many students specialize in one. Graduate programs include the MA in Public Anthropology and doctoral concentra - tions in cultural/social anthropology; archaeology; and race, gender, and social justice. A Certificate in Public Anthropologyis offered for both undergraduate s and graduate students. All programs stress active, cooperative learning, for anthropologyopens up many exciting questions for discussion and debate. Students are encouraged to learn outside the classroom, through internships and job placements, field trips and experien - tial classes, and study abroad.

Summerford N. Broude, M.D. Garrard, S. Lewis, M. Oxman, S. Pace, L. Penay Professor D. Kimes Associate Professor Emeritus/a M. Graham, M. Hirano, C. Ravenal Associate Professor K. Butler, Z. Charlton, T. Doud, A. Holtin, D. Kahn, H. Langa, C. Montes, K. Resnick,L. Silva Assistant Professor J. Bellow, N. Kunimoto, D. Mysliwiec, I. Sakellion Professorial Lecturer A. Pearson The Department of Art encompasses the creative activities of the fine arts (painting, sculpture, printmaking, and multime - dia), the artistic applications of design, and the theoretical and historical concerns of art history. These complementary pro - grams function together, so that the student gains not only depth of knowledge in a chosen specialty but also the breadth of expe - rience that yields understanding of artistic traditions, values, cultural awareness, and contemporary issues. A faculty of ex - hibiting artists, practicing des igners, published and respected historians, and strong studio programs focused on giving stu - dents facility with materials and familiarity with visual and the - oretical concepts make the art department, in effect, an art school within a university. The Art Department offers the Bachelor of Arts in Art His - tory, Graphic Design, or Studio Art, all of which can also be taken as minors, a Bachelor of Fine Arts, a Master of Arts in ArtHistory, and a Master of Fine Arts in Studio Art. The study of art awakens the ability to undertake a serious exploration of visual form, opens the mind to the special mean -ings encoded in visual language, and develops the creative, ex - pressive, and analytic abilities inherent in all people. In studio courses, students learn to see with acuity, to explore forms innature or from the imagination, and to make images that are for-mally coherent and personally expressive. In art historycourses, students are introduced to the art of civilizations pastand present, learn how to interpret works of art critically andhistorically, and discover how art functions both to reflect andto shape social values. In graphic design courses, students de-velop an understanding of the dynamic power of visual imageryand learn to apply their knowledge of the formal elements of artto the production of effective graphic communication. American University's Katzen Arts Center provides stu - dents with a state of the art facility for the investigation and pur - suit of both the visual and performing arts. The Art Department's classrooms, and s tudios are equipped for the in - struction of drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, design, computer graphics, multimedia, ceramics, and art history. As well as multiple performance stages and a full array of classroom and studio facilities, the Katzen Arts Center containsmore than 30,000 square feet of gallery space and an impressivemuseum including the Watkins and Katzen collections, withworks by Avery, Chagall, Dove, Klee, Kokoshka, Marin,Matisse, and Picasso, and a vital rotating schedule of exhibi - tions. The many world-class museums in Washington, DC also form an integral component of students' experience at Ameri - can University. In addition to the full-time faculty, each year the studio pro - gram brings nationally and internationally distinguished visit - ing artists-in-residence to the department, including Olive Ayhens, Gregory Amenoff, Frances Barth, Jake Bertlot,Susanna Coffey, Diana Cooper, Stuart Diamond, Tara Dono - van, Andrew Forge, Sam Gilliam, Judy Glantzman, Glenn Goldberg, Margaret Grimes, Diana Guerrero-Macia, Roger Steir, John Walker, Stephan Westfall, andothers. An internationally-prominent art history faculty and strong curriculum give the art history major a solid grounding in art asa historical and humanistic discipline in an environment thatprovides continuing contact with art past and present. Becauseof the university's location in one of the major art capitals ofthe world and its proximity to Washington's great museumsand art collections, all programs afford students the advantageof immediate experience with art masterpieces by diverse art - ists. The design curriculum is highly structured and sequential to provide students with the theory and practice of graphiccommunications design applicable to many purposes, as wellas the development of professional production methods.Courses cover publication and editorial design, corporate iden - tity, packaging, illustration, poster design, multimedia, experi - ence and interactive design, etc. Along with creative and technical skills, verbal and analytical abilities are developedthrough class critiques. Through internships with designersworking in the field, students learn to balance the ideal creativesolution with the reality of budget constraints, technical limita-tions, and deadlines. An important objective of the department is to prepare stu- dents for careers in the art world. Given the sound theoreticaland technical bases of our programs, graduates find that variedindividual career opportunities await them. Depending on thespecific discipline pursued, they have become professionalpainters and sculptors, teachers, critics, graphic designers, il-lustrators, and exhibition desig n specialists. Graduates also go on to PhD programs and careers in museum and gallery work,visual resources, and historic preservation.

Dittmar, X. Sheng, R. Sonenshine, M. Yesuf Economist in Residence C. Grown, E. Kraft, S. Mathur Professorial Lecturer J.C. Augustine, D. Lin, M. Martell The Department of Economics at American University emphasizes economic studies that enable graduates to partici - pate actively in the process of finding answers to the important economic questions that face our society and other nations ofthe world. Emphasis is placed on viewing economic problemsin both their domestic and international contexts. The university's location in Washington, DC enables it to assist students and graduates i n obtaining employment and in - ternships in several of the world's most important economic institutions, including the World Bank, the International Mon -etary Fund, research institutes, and the treasury, labor, and com- merce departments. Many of our graduates find policy-makingpositions in the public and private sectors of both the UnitedStates and other nations. The Department of Economics adopts a pluralistic approach to economics education that includes neoclassical, Keynesian,and institutional economics as well as political economy. Inter - national economic issues receive special emphasis, as do such socially-important topics as the economics of gender. The neo - classical and Keynesian traditions form the core of economic theory that our majors are expected to master. The study of eco - nomic history, the history of economic thought, and alternative economic methodologies alert students to divergent perspectivesand to the role of institutions. Courses in specialized fields dealwith monetary economics, public finance, economic develop - ment, the structure of US industry, international trade and fi - nance, and the economics of earnings and employment. Economics programs are designed to allow students the flex - ibility of a double major with other departments in the College of Arts and Sciences or with programs in other schools within AU.Within the BA in Economics students choose the general or in - ternational track. Students in the BS in Economics program gain the analytic and quantitative skills necessary for research posi - tions and Master's level study in Economics. The BS in Mathe - matics and Economics prepares students for a broad range of experiences including PhD level work in economics.108 College of Arts and SciencesThe MA in Economics offers a general economics track as well as tracks in business econom ics, development economics, financial economic policy, and g ender analysis in economics. The PhD in Economics offers a choice of theory tracks inmicroeconomics, macroeconom ics, and heterodox economics, as well as a range of applied fields. Study Abroad American University's AU Abroad program offers study abroad programs in which students take courses, participate ininternships, and interact with public officials and political lead - ers. Students wishing to use courses from study abroad pro - grams to count as their capstone must obtain approval of the undergraduate advisor. Honor Society A chapter of Omicron Delta Epsilon, the economics honor society, is active on campus. Membership requires an overallgrade point average of 3.25 and a grade point average of 3.50 ineconomics courses. Consult the undergraduate advisor for fur - ther eligibility requirements. Special Opportunities Several student prizes are awarded usually each spring: The Robert T. Adams Scholarship in support of an outstanding student majoring in Economics withdemonstrated financial need The Ruth Dewey Meade Prize for undergraduate researchThe Simon Naidel Prize for the best performance on a comprehensive examination in economic theory The Frank Tamagna Prize for excellence in international finance and monetary economics The Jos\u00e9 Epstein Prize in Development FinanceThe James Weaver Prize for Excellence in TeachingThe Nikos G. and Anastasia Photias Prize for dissertation research Bachelor of Arts (BA) Economics Admission to the Program Formal admission to the major requires a grade point aver - age of 2.00 (on a 4.00 scale) and the approval of the department undergraduate advisor.

The academic programs pro - vide students with opportunities to collaborate with profession - als in a large array of organizations that complement theirprogram of study. Further, international opportunities are available to students at the undergraduate and graduate levels.Degree programs can be completed on a full or part time basis,and knowledge is gained through community service, intern - ships, practica, and related-research work. The SETH faculty and programs demonstrate a commit - ment to the advancement of knowledge about the nature, func - tion, and practice of education and health. Faculty conduct a wide range of research with emphasis on equity, gender, healthpromotion, multiculturalism, nutrition, socioeconomic status,learners with special needs, the infusion of technology into edu - cation, adult learning, and the relationship of government and public policy to education. Themes common to faculty researchand programs include meeting the needs of special learners, im - proving the health of society, decreasing health disparities, re - search-informed policy development, as well as domestic and international formal and non-formal education. SETH is hometo the Institute for Innovation in Education, the Collaborativefor Urban Education Research and Development, and cam - pus-wide collaborative projects on societal health research. Students benefit from working with a highly qualified and dedicated faculty in small classes, and from opportunities toparticipate in ongoing faculty research aimed at influencing ed - ucational and health policy and practice.

In academic year 2011-2012, 425 students were enrolled in teacher preparation programs; 132 of these students werecompleting supervised student teaching programs. Fifty-ninefaculty members including 13 full time faculty in professionaleducation, and 46 part time faculty members (adjunct faculty)supervised and/or taught students in the teacher education pro - gram. The student/faculty ratio for field experiences was 3:1. The average hours per week required of students in the programwas 35 hours per week over 14 weeks, for a total of 490 hours.

Cheh Full-Time Faculty Professor A .C h e h ,D . C .C u l v e r Associate Professor K. Kim Assistant Professor S.E. MacAvoy, K.L. Knee The environment has become a nexus of a broad range of global issues including climate change, biodiversity loss, andresource competition. Environmental sustainability, whichcombines environmental, economic , and social considerations, provides a valuable and holistic framework for addressingmany of these concerns, and the ability to apply that under-standing appropriately and effectively in public discourse. The goal of the Department of Environmental Science is to inspire and train leaders concerned about sustainability with theknowledge and critical thinking skills to make independent, ra - tional decisions concerning current and emerging environmen - tal issues. To this end, the department provides rigorous, interdisciplinary programs grounded in a sound, scientific un - derstanding of how our natural world works. The Department of Environmental Science offers the BA in EnvironmentalStudies, BS in Environmental Science, minor in environmentalscience, MS in Environmental Science, and Graduate Certifi - cate in Environmental Assessment. The BA in Environmental Studies builds upon a set of foun - dational courses in both the natural and social sciences. The stu - dent then chooses from an approved list of related courses spanning many disciplines, from all schools and colleges atAU, to create a program of study suited to his or her specific in - terests and professional goals. Students are also encouraged to gain practical field experience through an internship at one ormore of the many public and private environmental organiza - tions in the Washington, DC area. Graduates will be prepared for employment in a broad range of fields where scientific in -formation is applied in the deve lopment and implementation of environmental policies. The BS in Environmental Science draws principally from the natural sciences, including biology, chemistry, physics, andmathematics and statistics. In addition to classroom work, theprogram provides students with extensive training in both fieldand laboratory techniques applicable to the study of the naturalenvironment. Students are strongly encouraged to seek researchexperience with faculty and engage in the creation of new sci-entific knowledge. Opportunities to carry our research at one ofthe many research institutions in the Washington, DC area arealso available. A minor in environmental science is also available for those interested in adding breadth to their standard science or socialpolicy degrees. The minor prepares students for employment inenvironmental research, policy, or management, or for furthergraduate work in the natural or social sciences. The MS in Environmental Science offers an opportunity to expand students' knowledge base for developing solutions toenvironmental problems. The program provides two ap - proaches: course-focused or research-focused. Students in the course-based program take a core set of science and statisticscourses and a selection of complementary courses in environ - mental policy. Students are encouraged to gain practical field experience through an internship at one or more of the manypublic and private environmental organizations in the Washing - ton, DC area. Students in the research-based program carry out research projects with faculty in the department, associated andaffiliated faculty at AU, or at one of the many research institu - tions in the Washington, DC area. Graduates will be prepared to engage in high-level, environmental problem solving or pursueadvanced studies in environmental science. The Graduate Certificate in Environmental Assessment is designed to provide students with advanced understanding ofthe environmental impacts of human activities. The programEnvironmental Science 133emphasizes the generation, transport, fate, and impact of toxi - cants that affect the environment, with both domestic and in - ternational scope.

Goldstene Historians explore the past, but the pasts they uncover de- pend on the questions they ask, and historians keep discover-ing new questions appropriate to their moment in time.Exploring civilizations across time and space, historians studyall the creations of men and women: politics and governments,the arts and the sciences, economic and technological changes,public and private lives, nations and their peoples. The undergraduate history program introduces students to history broadly, requiring study of ancient, medieval, andmodern histories in several geographic contexts before expect - ing students to specialize. The program's lectures, seminars, and discussions facilitate student engagement. Master's anddoctoral students specialize in either United States or modernEuropean history and hone research, writing, and analyticalskills. The department also offers an MA in public history, andpublic history may be taken as an outside field in the doctoralprogram. Students in American University's History Depart - ment have the opportunity to work closely with faculty experts who specialize not only in the United States, Europe, LatinAmerica, and East Asia, but whose research focuses on the his - tory of women, the Holocaust, immigration, politics, and cul - ture. AU History faculty have close, ongoing relationships with major historical institutions in Washington, DC, such as theNational Archives, Library o f Congress, National Museum of American History, National Building Museum, and the UnitedStates Holocaust Memorial Museum. These provide excellentopportunities for student internships and for their engagementwith public history, which is the presentation of history outsideof the classroom. During the summer, students may participatein the department's popular Civil War and Nuclear Studies In - stitutes.In addition to preparing students for graduate or law school, the Department of History's emphasis on research, writing, andintellectual problem solving prepares its students for a wide ar - ray of careers in business, government, public interest fields, journalism, and other professions.

The Jewish Studies Program recognizes that Jews and Juda - ism constitute a distinct yet integral component of the heritage of Western civilization. Jewish studies courses analyze the civi - lization of the Jews and its various cultural and religious expres - sions from the patriarchal period to the present. Jewish studies courses embrace the total experience of the Jewish people, spanning the spectrum of the arts, humanities,and the social sciences. Moreover, since dynamic contact withmany other religions and cultures influenced the developmentof Jewish civilization, courses view Jews and Judaism withinthe broader context of these dominant societies, and enrichone's understanding of American and world Jewries. The ma - jors and minors in Jewish studies prepare students for leader - ship within and service to the Jewish community, and for a greater understanding of our pluralistic society. A minor in Is - rael Studies is also offered.

Core Area /c18324 credit hours chosen from fields of study in one of three core areas: the humanities, the social sciences, or sciences/mathematics. The core area must include course work in four fields of study: 6 credit hours are to be taken in each field; at least 3credit hours in each of the four fields must be earned in acourse at the 300 level or higher. For students taking theSciences/Mathematics core, a minimum of 6 credit hours intotal must be taken in courses at the 300 level or higher. Nomore than three courses taken for General Education creditmay also count toward core area requirements. Six of theeight courses taken to fulfill the core area must be offered by the College of Arts and Sciences.

Specialization In addition to the core area courses, students in the Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies program are required to complete18-24 credit hours in a specialization chosen from the list ofuniversity-approved minors. Note: if the minor taken for the specialization requires 24 or more credit hours, students mayrequest reducing their core requi rements from 24 to 21 credit hours. However, the core must still include at least 18 credithours offered by the College of Arts and Sciences. Students may select a specialization that complements their core area, or they may choose a specialization that is a new areaof study. In all cases the student is encouraged to design a corearea and a specialization that reflects the student's particular in - terests and goals. Requirements for the specialization in the Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies degree are met when a student completes therequirements for a minor approved for the program. No morethan two courses taken for General Education credit may be ap - plied to a student's specialization.Liberal Studies 143Literature Chair Keith Leonard Full-Time Faculty Professor Emeritus/a P.

Dadak Concerned with the study of literature, writing, and film, the Department of Literature offers courses that embrace manyapproaches to the rich heritage of written, oral, and cinematictradition, as well as courses that challenge students to writecreatively and professionally. In addition to taking courses, ourstudents are encouraged to enroll in internships to sample ca-reers that use the skills they are developing in the classroom;Washington affords a wide range of job opportunities (manyinvolving writing or editing) in settings such as arts organiza - tions, radio and television, government offices, public interest organizations, museums, schools, and community groups. The department's faculty of scholars and writers staff three degree programs in literature: the BAand MAin Literature andthe MFA in Creative Writing. All three programs offer studentsthe chance to study literature, film, criticism and creative writ - ing; all are small and flexible programs that bring students and faculty into close contact in small classes and informal gather - ings and colloquia. The MA program provides an overview of the literary history of our culture in addition to a series of semi - nars on theoretical topics in which students and faculty to - gether consider what constitutes the discipline of literary criticism. The MFA in Creative Writing program includeswork in fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction; workshopswith distinguished visiting writers; internships; and coursework in literature and in the arts of translation and literary jour - nalism. It also offers students opportunities to give public read - ings, to meet with editors and publishers, and to produce a nationally known literary magazine.In addition, the department offers an interdisciplinary minor in Cinema Studies which combines course work in cinema,video criticism and history and takes advantage of the impres - sive film resources of the Washington area. The Visiting Writers Series Each semester, the department sponsors public readings by prominent poets, fiction writers, and editors. These visitors alsoconduct workshops for graduate and undergraduate creativewriting students. Visiting writers have included Michael Cunningham, Mari - lyn Nelson, Li-Young Lee, Amy Bloom, and Manil Suri. Distin - guished Writers in Residence have included Jean Valentine, Marilyn Hacker, Jon Silkin, Pablo Medina, and AliceMcDermott.

Keynes Director of Educational Services B. Jalali Mathematics may be studied as an intellectual discipline for its own sake or as a professional tool for application to theproblems of other disciplines. Majors in mathematics receivefirm grounding in the theory and techniques of algebra, analy-sis, and other fields as a basis for further work in pure or ap-plied mathematics and for graduate studies. The major inapplied mathematics offers training in mathematical prob-lem-solving techniques with a reduced emphasis on abstracttheory. This program is not as firm a foundation for graduatework as the mathematics major, but is tailored to the studentwho will need to apply mathematical, statistical, and computermethods to practical problems. Undergraduates majoring inmathematics may choose to take a second major in secondaryschool teaching. Statistics is the science of making decisions based on data. Data and decisions can come from business, law, medicine,politics, science, sociology, and every other field of study, butmay be based on incomplete observations or incorrect mea - surements. To mitigate such uncertainties, students studying statistics build and apply quantitative tools and techniques forthe collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and pre - sentation of data. They then utilize statistical techniques to dis - cover and investigate patterns, build predictive models, and control variability to improve decisionmaking. Undergraduate students majoring in statistics have two tracks available. Those who intend to continue with graduatework in statistics or those with an interest in the theory of sta - tistical methods should follow the sequence for mathematical statistics, which requires a st rong background in mathematics. Students wishing an emphasis in the use of statistical tech - niques should follow the sequence for applied statistics. This track is especially appropriate as a secondary emphasis for stu - dents who have a strong interest in a field of application.The Department of Mathematics and Statistics combines the resources and knowledge of these related disciplines. This en - ables the department to offer unusually varied and flexible pro - grams. A student with an interest in the mathematical sciences may choose a program within the department and later changehis or her emphasis without a great loss of time because the pro - grams share a common core. The university's Washington, DC location affords the student access to many governmental, cultural, scientific, and historicalinstitutions. These institutions serve as an important research re - source. In addition, they are a source of full-time and part-time employment opportunities for students with a firm grounding inthe mathematical sciences.

North American Studies Economic and social integration has accelerated in North America, but policy coordination and awareness of an emerg - ing North America have not kept pace. The Center for North American Studies (CNAS) at American University aims to edu - cate a new generation of students from all three countries-Can - ada, Mexico, and the United States-to begin a North American journey comparable to that begun in Europe five decades ago.The course work examines the differences and shared charac - teristics of the three nations; compares the North American ex - periment with Europe's; and challenges students and faculty to imagine a continental future. An undergraduate minor and a graduate certificate are of - fered. These interdisciplinary programs are administered by theCollege of Arts and Sciences with the support of the School of International Service, School of Public Affairs, School of Com - munication, and the Kogod School of Business. Students pur - sue an experiential component, based on study abroad in Canada or Mexico and/or an internship relevant to North Amer - ica. Students also need to demonstrate some level of profi - ciency in Spanish or French.

Oliver Philosophy explores the nature of the world, the basis of hu - man values, and the foundations of reason. Philosophy also of - fers the challenge of interpreting the work of thinkers who have created our intellectual traditions. The study of philosophy provides excellent preparation for law, medicine, social work, the ministry, and other professionalcareers. Many positions in science and industry require thekinds of analytical skills gained through the study of philoso-phy. Philosophy teaches precision in reasoning and clarity inexpression\u2014assets in any field. Alumni of the BA and MA pro-grams have pursued graduate work in philosophy and relatedareas such as political science, psychology, history, literature,and other professional programs. The study of Western and Eastern religious traditions intro - duces students to a major influence on all civilizations. Journal - ists, diplomats, and government specialists benefit from a serious consideration of the inner workings of the religiousethos of civilizations. Daily events remind us that there is nomore motivating factor in the cultures of nations than ardentlyheld religious belief. A thorough understanding of the modernworld requires familiarity with its religious heritage. AmericanUniversity's Washington, DC setting is advantageous for thestudy of religion, with national offices and centers for many re - ligions in the metropolitan area. The Consortium of Univer - sities of the Washington Metropolitan Area also offers a variety of courses in philosophy and religion that are available toAmerican University students.

Physics courses explore physical phenomenaand properties of the universe like mechanics, gravitation,electricity and magnetism, atomic and nuclear structure,waves and optics, and the properties of matter and energy.During coursework, students acquire skills with the theoreticaland experimental tools required for the practice of physics andastronomy. At the same time, st udents come to appreciate how the intersection of science and technology has shaped historyand society. The department's education facilities include laboratories equipped with modern technology and multiple teachingspaces tailored to foster interactive learning. All physics ma-jors are required to participate in undergraduate research expe-riences mentored by faculty members or by colleagues at anyof the many science research institutions in the Washington,DC area. The department's faculty members are active in re-search in multiple subfields of physics including optics, atomicand condensed matter theory, astrophysics, particle physics,physics education, quantum information, and gravitationalphysics. The Department of Physics offers two majors: BS in Phys - ics and BA in Physics. The BS in Physics prepares students for graduate school in physics and related fields and for careers inscience and technology. Also, students with the BS in Physicshave the technical and computing skills to qualify them forjobs at research laboratories and technical consulting firms.The BS in Physics program has three tracks: traditional phys - ics, chemical physics, and computational physics. The BA in Physics is designed to give students a strong scientific back - ground, but allow them more flexibility to complete additional academic programs and to pursue other interests. The BA inPhysics program is ideal for students preparing for fields inscience policy, science educa tion, science communication, patent law, and related interdisciplinary careers. Additionally,the department offers two minors in physics and applied phys - ics that enrich a student's academic program by providing complementary knowledge, skills and experience. Previousstudents have leveraged the physics background from their mi - nors into interesting career opportunities.Bachelor of Arts (BA) Physics Admission to the Program Formal admission to the major requires a grade point average of 2.00 (on a 4.00 scale) and departmental approval.

American University students can combine the advan - tages of both liberal arts and professional education. Students are awarded two bachelor's degrees in a five-year period. Students typically spend their first three years on the Ameri - can University campus concentrating in a major field in the Col - lege of Arts and Sciences. Students are strongly encouraged to choose a major field in one of the natural sciences, mathematics,statistics, or computer science at American University. If how - ever, the student chooses to complete a major in the arts, humani - ties, or social sciences, he or she may do so, provided that the engineering program requirements are also satisfied. This optionrequires careful planning and may result in an extra semester ormore of coursework. In the third year, with the recommendation of the preengineering faculty liaison, students apply to the engineeringprogram at the University of Maryland. The engineering programoptions at the University of Maryland include aerospace, bioengi-neering, chemical and biomolecular, civil and environmental,electrical and computer, fire protection, materials sciences, andmechanical engineering. After admission to the engineering pro-gram, the fourth year of study is spent there. Once the studentcompletes the requirements for the American University major(generally at the end of the fourth year), the first bachelor's degreeis awarded. After completion of the engineering requirementsduring the fifth year, the student receives a bachelor's degree inengineering from the University of Maryland. Students work closely with the preengineering faculty liaison and an advisor in their major field of study. The faculty liaison andadvisor will work together to individually tailor course selectionsto meet the student's interests and needs. Throughout the courseof their studies students should maintain a high grade point aver - age. Completion of basic courses must be done during the first three years of study in order to complete the requirements for anengineering degree in five years. Courses with grades below Cwill not transfer to the University of Maryland. Course Requirements The engineering program at the University of Maryland has basic requirements covering a b road range of study, which must be completed before entrance: /c183Two courses in English composition /c183Calculus I, Calculus II, Calculus III, and differential equations (aerospace majors also take linear algebra) /c183Two years of calculus-based physics with laboratory alongwith courses providing more in-depth study in mechanics,electromagnetism, or thermodynamics/c183One year of general chemistry with laboratory(bioengineering and materials sciences also require onesemester of organic chemistry; chemical engineering alsorequires a two-course sequence in organic chemistry) /c183One course in computer programming /c183Five courses in the humanities and the social sciences Prior to applying to a particular engineering program, students should also have taken ENES 100 Introduction toEngineering Design at the University of Maryland, which isoffered every semester including the summer. Prelaw Prelaw Advisor Tyler Atkins-Mose, CAS In considering law school, it is important that the prelaw stu - dent understands law schools' educational philosophy. As the Law School Admission Bulletin states: \"Any course, regardless of field, that helps you develop clear and systematic thinking,command of the English language, and a broad understandingof our society constitutes sound preparation for the study of law.Thus, law schools do not recommend specific undergraduatemajors for prelaw students.\" The prelaw student should also re-alize that admission to law school is selective. Students contem-plating careers in law should plan their undergraduate study toundertake a substantial academic curriculum and acquire abackground of outstanding extracurricular activities. Students interested in prelaw preparation follow the normal procedure for declaring and fulfilling requirements for a majorin one of the schools or departments or in gaining approval foran interdisciplinary program of study. Whatever the choice ofmajor, the prelaw student's program should be supported by abroad selection of courses from mathematics, the natural sci - ences, the social sciences, and the humanities. Courses recommended by law schools also include philoso - phy, literature and advanced writing courses, history, political science, accounting, business adm inistration, economics, math - ematics, languages, and other courses demanding logical think - ing, analytical reasoning, or verbal proficiency. The Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is required of ev - ery applicant to law school. It is strongly recommended that this test be taken in June before the senior year. With this test date,students can appraise their prospects and consider retaking theexamination in October or December or both, or, if necessary,make alternate plans. Students apply directly to the Law SchoolAdmissions Service (LSAS) to take the test on the AmericanUniversity campus and should register six weeks before the testdate. LSAT applications are available from the prelaw advisors.Preprofessional Programs Premed Programs Coordinator Lynne Arneson202-885-2186premed@american.eduwww.american.edu/cas/premed/ The premedical programs of the College of Arts and Sci - ences are available to help all undergraduate, postbaccalaureate, and graduate students who are consideringa career in medicine or one of the allied health professions. Premedical program services include extensive individual advising on careers, courses, volunteer and research opportu - nities, professional school examinations, selection of schools, and financial aid. The program also provides seminars byhealth professionals, resume preparation and essay writing as - sistance, medical school interview preparation, preparation of a composite letter of evaluation, and support in compiling andsending letters of recommenda tion to professional schools. Students from American University applying to medical, dental, or veterinary school have been highly competitive,with 86 percent of qualified applicants accepted by medicalschools. Advising Services Students interested in the health professions should contact the premedical programs coordinator as soon as possible. Thecoordinator helps students select an appropriate curriculum,prepare for the relevant admissions tests, make realisticchoices of professional schools, and learn first-hand about bio-medical research and clinical practice. The coordinator isavailable to meet with students individually at least once a se-mester to review their academic progress and course of studyat American University. Together with students' academic ad - visors, the coordinator helps assure timely completion of both degree and premedical requirements. Typically, at the end of their junior year premedical stu - dents submit a primary application to the American Medical Colleges Application Service, which forwards this general ap - plication to specified schools. Medical schools will then send individual applications to selected students. In order to prepare professional-school applications, each student assembles a file contai ning essential information. Members of the Premedical Evaluation Committee serve asmentors for students. The Writing Center and the Career Cen - ter can provide advice about writing personal statements and other documents and interview practice. After the file, includ - ing letters of recommendation, is assembled, a comprehensive Premedical Evaluation Committee letter of evaluation will beprepared to support the application. Included in the letter is asummary of the academic record and extracurricular activities,and an evaluation of commitment to a medical career. Premedical Curriculum Traditionally, premedical students have majored in the nat - ural sciences. However, the medical professions are also seek -ing well-rounded students with a broadly-based liberal educa - tion, reflecting the social, ethical, and cultural roles played by health care professionals. Students interested in medical careersmay major in any field, but must make careful plans to take thenecessary preparatory courses in a timely fashion. Most health professional schools require certain foundation courses in science and mathematics, along with a full year of col - lege-level writing. All science courses must include laboratory components. Undergraduate stude nts who wish to matriculate at a professional school directly after graduation from AmericanUniversity must submit applications at the end of the junior year.Therefore, the basic requirements should be completed in thefreshman and sophomore years, following the sequence ofcourses listed below. Freshman Year BIO-110 General Biology I FA5 (4) BIO-210 General Biology II FA5 (4)CHEM-110 General Chemistry I FA5 (4)CHEM-210 General Chemistry II FA5 (4)MATH-221 Calculus I (4) Sophomore Year BIO-300 Cell Biology with Laboratory (4) BIO-356 Genetics with Laboratory (5)CHEM-310 Organic Chemistry I (3)CHEM-312 Organic Chemistry I Laboratory (1)CHEM-320 Organic Chemistry II (3)CHEM-322 Organic Chemistry II Laboratory (1) Junior Year PHYS-105 General Physics I FA5 (4) and PHYS-205 General Physics II FA5 (4) or PHYS-110 Principles of Physics I FA5 (4) and PHYS-210 Principles of Physics II FA5 (4) This intensive plan also prepares students to take the Medi - cal College Admissions Test (MCAT) in the spring of their ju - nior year. To receive most favorable consideration, the Medical Col - lege Admissions Test (MCAT) or Dental Aptitude Test (DAT) must be taken in the spring of the junior year, about 16 monthsbefore matriculation in medical or dental school. Veterinaryschools typically require that the Graduate Record Examination(GRE) be taken at the end of the junior year. The above sequence presumes that a student has already de - cided by the beginning of his or her freshman year to pursue a premedical course of study. Students who do not decide on amedical career until the middle of their undergraduate studies orlater may need to complete their premedical requirements duringsummers or in a post-baccalaureate year. Research and Internship Opportunities The premedical program encourages close interaction with the faculty. Many undergraduates have engaged in independentresearch projects in biology, chemistry, physics, and experimen - tal psychology which have led to presentation and publication of papers.176 College of Arts and SciencesMany opportunities for internships, volunteer work, and biomedical research are available. Local hospitals and clinicsprovide students with clinical experience. At institutions suchas the National Institutes of Health and other local laboratoriesand biotechnology companies, students may gain first-hand ba - sic research experience in biochemistry, immunology, molecu - lar biology, and molecular genetics. Premedical Achievement Prize and Scholarship The American University Hassa S. Shanker Premedical Achievement Prize is a $2,000 cash award presented to themost outstanding undergraduate student intending to apply to a health professional school who has taken at least five scienceand mathematics courses at American University. Selection isbased on academic achievements, leadership qualities, and con - tributions to society or the health professions. Applicants must be planning to apply to medical, dental, or veterinary school, orto a program in the health sciences, such as physical therapy. The Josephine G. Gimble Scholarship is a $2,000 annual award to an undergraduate or postbaccalaureate student prepar - ing for a career in the allied health sciences. Postbaccalaureate Premedical Certificate Certificate Coordinator Lynne Arneson, 202-885-2186premed@american.eduwww.american.edu/cas/premed/CERT-GPMD.cfm Postbaccalaureate work consists of academic study under- taken after earning a bachelor's degree. American University'sPostbaccalaureate Premedical Certificate program is designedto complete basic requirements a nd strengthen credentials for application to health professional schools of human medicine(MD or DO), dentistry (DDS), veterinary medicine (DVM), po-diatry (DPM), optometry (OD), and oral surgery (DMD), and toadvanced degree programs in the allied health sciences such aspublic health (MPH) and physician assistant, nurse practitioner,and physical therapy programs leading to the MS or PhD de - gree. This program offers students extensive guidance and assis - tance in preparing for professional school and a career. With the help of advisors they polish resume and essay-writing skills,prepare for the Medical College Aptitude Test (MCAT) or otheradmissions examinations, practice medical school interviews,select potential professional schools, and address related finan - cial issues. Through the program, students may also attend sem - inars by health professionals, identify volunteer opportunities, and be matched with a mentor. Each emerges with a compositeletter of evaluation, held with letters of recommendation in apersonal file. The premedical pr ograms coordinator sends these letters to professional schools f or students and assists them in meeting all application deadlines.Admission to the Program Open to students with a bachelor's degree and a cumulative grade point average of 3.20 (on a 4.00 scale) overall and in sci - ence and mathematic courses, if taken.

Ag-ing populations, global pandemics, increasing environmentaldegradation and a rise in childhood obesity are just some of themany challenges to which the field of public health directly re - sponds. Because public health is a highly interdisciplinary area of study, students in the program benefit from interactions withscholars from across the university. After gaining foundationalknowledge and practical skills in the field by completing a setof core courses, students explore the complexities of publichealth by selecting elective courses from clusters in globalhealth; health science; policy, program planning, and evalua - tion; and social and community health. Students' growth in the field is furthered through internships in the Washington, DCarea and health-related study abroad opportunities. Finally, thecapstone course engages students in synthesizing their experi - ence and understanding of the field of public health. Students in the BA and BS programs have access to similar courses. Students pursuing the BA may want to focus oncourses that support careers in program planning, the develop - ment and assessment of public health projects, and the social and community health aspects of public health. Students pursu - ing the BS degree may be more interested in public health re -search, in future work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or in developing vaccination protocols. Special Programs TheThree Year Public Health Cohort Program provides an extraordinary opportunity for highly motivated freshmenwho have decided to pursue a career in the field of publichealth. The program allows a cohort of College of Arts and Sci - ences (CAS) first-year students to enroll in a BA in Public Health program geared towards completion of the degree inthree years. A BS in Public Health may be earned through care - ful selection of public health elective courses under advisement by the director of the program. The three-year program accen - tuates experiential learning, including special study abroad, ser - vice learning, and internship options during their course of study, while participating fully in the student life on campus. In this program, students: /c183engage in a specially developed study abroad experience as a cohort that provides opportunities for clinical experiences inanother country /c183apply public health skills and knowledge through servicelearning opportunities /c183work with public health professionals in internships locally orgloballyPublic Health 183/c183receive support from program faculty, staff, and public health alumni with career/internship placement /c183take core public health courses as a cohort /c183engage in meaningful service activities outside theclassroom as a cohort Bachelor of Arts (BA) Public Health Admission to the Program Admission is through formal declaration of major.

Neibrugge-Brantley Sociology explores how individuals, through their collec - tive actions, create and change patterns of social relations and how, in turn, these social relations influence people's lives. So - ciologists focus on three major levels of analysis, from whole societies as component parts of wider systems, to institutionsas component sectors of society, to individuals as participantsin two-person groups. They also study varied processes of so - cial change, from migration to social mobility, from urbaniza - tion to mass communication. Finally, sociologists study a wide variety of themes, from racial and ethnic relations to socialproblems and political change. This quest for knowledge is both an end in itself and a pathway for informed social change. The Department of Sociology of the College of Arts and Sci - ences shares a common purpose of education and research for social justice in an increasingly global social system. Facultyand students are empowered to participate in building equitable,humane, and sustainable social institutions by creating sociolog - ical knowledge and applying professional research skills to pro - duce effective policies and programs for social change. One source of its strength is the department's multicultural diversity,which its members take every opportunity to expand. The Sociology Department serves the university, including students from throughout the world, as a center for the study ofsocietal change, social institutions, and social processes, with anemphasis on inequality and social justice. Degree programs fo - cus on forms of inequality, their origins and patterns or reproduc - tion, related to issues of social justice, and how these issues vary within and between societies. They are intended to produce andapply knowledge for the benefit of society, not only to teach aca - demic skills, but also to develop knowledge of value to those in - volved in working for the promotion of social equality. The programs prepare students for a variety of careers in social advo - cacy, research, teaching, human services, and both public and186 College of Arts and Sciencesprivate sector policy-making institutions. Successful place - ments of the department's graduates in academic, research, and policy-making institutions attest to the high standards our grad - uates meet. The department's focus on international and comparative sociology and public sociology are especially well suited toWashington, DC, an international capital and center for policymaking. American University's location provides unparalleledaccess to government, research in stitutions, data and archival sources, advocacy organizations, and leaders involved in socialchange. The undergraduate program is unique in its emphasis on race, gender, social justice, global social change and appliedsociology/social policy. Majors and minors take core course se - quences in sociological theory and research methods, and courses from several areas of concentration. Membership in theAmerican University chapter of Alpha Kappa Delta, the inter - national honor society in Sociology, is open to qualifying ma - jors. The society sponsors lectures and other activities that involve undergraduates in the professional workings of the dis - cipline. In collaboration with the Department of Biology and other departments, an interdisciplinary BA or BS in Public Health, aswell a minor, are available to students. The Department of Sociology's graduate program consists of core training in sociological theory and research method,plus an area of concentration in public sociology, race, gender,and social justice; global sociology; social inequality; or genderand family. The program not only teaches academic skills, butalso develops knowledge of benefit to those working for thepromotion of social equality. Course are designed to enable stu-dents to deepen their knowledge of a specialty area, to developadvanced and systematic theoretical understanding, and to de-velop methodological areas for vocational and professionalcompetence.

Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Director Lauren Weis Faculty from other schools and departments of the university teach in the program. A list of the faculty members of theWomen's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Advisory Board andother program information is available at:www.american.edu/cas/wgs/ The Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) Pro- gram is an interdisciplinary program encompassing feministstudies, masculinity studies, and sexuality studies. The programis committed to a multicultural curriculum that sustains and in-tegrates diverse perspectives. Program courses emphasize par-ticipatory education in which student involvement, criticalthinking, and personal insight are encouraged and made rele-vant in the learning process. Many faculty members with na-tional and international reputations for their scholarly work onwomen's/gender/sexuality issu es regularly teach women's, gender, and sexuality studies courses, as well as courses in otherdepartments and programs that count toward the major and mi - nor. Students who major or minor in WGSS gain experience off-campus in the nation's capital through an internship place - ment in an organization or agency whose mission embraces some aspect of women's/gende r/sexuality studies. Students have access to powerful networks in Washington, DC that cangive substantial support in career development; student internsare actively sought by organizations focused on the arts, advo - cacy of all kinds, communication, employment and training is - sues, law and policy, reproductive rights and health, social research in a wide range of fields, support services for survivorsof violence and abuse, and US politics. The program also en - courages and facilitates students' study abroad. Majors and mi - nors have expanded their understanding of women's/gender/sexuality in programs in Africa, Asia, Europeand Latin America. A degree in WGSS leads to challenging careers in a wide spectrum of occupations. An undergraduate education inWGSS also equips students with a range of skills which arehighly valued in the twenty-first century labor force. The cur - riculum also prepares students for graduate study in the fields of women's/gender/sexuality studies or for advanced study in tra - ditional disciplines and professional fields. Moreover, at AU students can earn a graduate certificate in women's, gender, andsexuality studies by combining graduate-level coursework onwomen's/gender/sexuality theory and current issues/research inWGSS with approved graduate coursework from a range ofparticipating graduate programs.

Undergraduate Programs The undergraduate business program provides students with a sound understanding of the major functional areas of businesswhile focusing on the communication, teamwork, and realworld problem solving skills needed for successful professionalcareers. KSB undergraduate programs include the Bachelor ofScience in Accounting, Bachelor of Science in Business Ad-ministration, the Bachelor of Sc ience in Business, Language & Culture Studies, the Bachelor of Science in Business and Mu-sic, and the Bachelor of Science in Finance, as well as minors inaccounting, business administrati on, finance, information sys- tems and technology, international business, leadership andmanagement, and marketing. The first two years of study focus on the five foundational areas of the General Education Program and additional coursework to develop the necessary background knowledge, skills,and competency that apply to the study of business. The foun - dation work includes courses in college writing, mathematics (applied calculus and statistics), economics, and cross culturalcommunication. The business core courses emphasize broadbusiness functions, global perspectives on commerce, and theessential role of technology in the marketplace. It also providesbackground in the production and marketing of goods, the fi - nancing of products and organizations, and the management of people and enterprises. During th e first semester, freshmen take the Kogod gateway course, KSB-100 Business 1.0., which pro - vides a unique, hands-on, and fun introduction to the study of business. Business 1.0 uses a vari ety of different learning tools including small group discussions, team presentations, and lec - tures. In later semesters, students study accounting concepts along with the legal and ethical dimensions of decision-makingthat impact contemporary organizations. The program also fea - tures coursework in organizational behavior, business finance, international business, opera tions management, and business strategy. The undergraduate business programs have a liberal arts-based curriculum with a business core that provides a broadknowledge of business functions while emphasizing the globalbusiness environment. In addition to the business core, Kogodstudents have the option to choose a specialization and/or de - sign a double major, minor, or interdisciplinary curriculum. The objectives of the business core are: /c183develop students'intellectual curiosity and the ability to think creatively, reason logically an d respect diverse ideas and people; /c183a global perspective on business operations and economics; /c183an understanding of how goods and services are producedand marketed; /c183a foundation in the concepts and applications of accounting,financial analysis, and business finance; /c183an understanding of basic management theory andorganizational dynamics of the contemporary businessenterprise; /c183an appreciation of the legal, ethical, and societal dimensionsof business decision-making; and, /c183an ability to integrate learning across academic disciplinesand to develop strategic decision-making skills. In addition, each student is expected to: /c183demonstrate professional competence in oral, written, and interpersonal communication skills in a business setting; /c183understand how to use technology and analytical tools toimprove efficiency, productivity, problem solving, andcommunication; and, /c183understand the nature of group dynamics and how teams ofdiverse individuals work together to analyze and solvebusiness problems. Several features of the program are important to these goals and distinguish it, including: /c183an emphasis on the development of an individual career strategy and the development of professional skill sets; /c183an integrated set of courses and co-curricular activities thatdevelop managerial decision making skills; /c183extensive opportunities for study abroad, internships(domestic and international), and interaction withKogod School of Business 205international and national agencies that affect domestic and international business practices; and, /c183a learning environment composed of skilled faculty andstudents from all over the world. Internship and Field Experience Programs Qualified business majors are encouraged to participate in the Internship Program, which provides students the opportu - nity to apply theories learned in their coursework to a profes - sional work setting integral to their academic programs and career goals. The program enables students to make career deci - sions and prepare for the professional job market while earning degree credit. Positions may be with businesses, local, state, orfederal governments or community, social service, ornot-for-profit organizations. To earn academic credit, under - graduate students must have completed 12 credit hours in busi - ness including the 300-level core course in the relevant Kogod department. The credit earned in an internship course can beused only for a free business elective course, and cannot replaceac o r eo ra r e ao fs p e c i a l i z a t i o nc o u r s e . Students who do not meet the internship credit requirement may be eligble for a .25 credit field experience which has sub-stantively different requirements from an internship. Field ex-perience is defined as short-term experiential educationcompleted on site at a professional organization and is consid-ered integral to a business education (home offices do not meetthe criteria). Students who have a declared or intended businessmajor and have completed at least three (3) Kogod credits witha minimum 2.75 GPA, registered as a full-time student in thecurrent semester (or in the case of the summer, registered for thefall semester), but are not eligible for upper-level internshipcredit may register for up to two field experiences (one field ex-perience per organization). The field experience must be at leastfour weeks in length. Students must complete a pre- andpost-field experience session facilitated by the Kogod Centerfor Career Development (KCCD). Any student on an F-1 visafor immigration purposes will not be eligible for compensationuntil they have completed one full academic year.

An undergraduate ad - mitted to a combined bachelor's /master's program gains tenta - tive admission to graduate standing so that both a bachelor's and master's degree may be earned as the result of a planned pro - gram of study. After admission to the combined program, the student may enroll in approved graduate-level courses as part ofthe program of study. Students in good academic standing may apply for admis - sion to a combined program after they have completed 75 credit hours toward their undergraduate degree. With rare exceptions,applications must be made no la ter than the semester in which 90 credit hours have been completed. Upon admission to a combined bachelor's and master's de - gree program that includes a master's degree from Kogod, a stu - dent may apply up to 9 graduate credits earned as an undergraduate toward the requirements for both degrees. Cred-its so applied must be approved by the Kogod department thatoversees the graduate degree program. Once admitted to a combined program that includes a Kogod master's degree, a student must, in consultation with theappropriate advisor, prepare an approved program of study thatshows which courses will be applied toward the undergraduatedegree and which courses will be applied toward the master'sdegree. After satisfying all undergraduate requirements and allrequirements for admission to the master's program, the studentwill be officially enrolled in the master's program.

Understandingscientific inquiry and correctly using research techniquesrequire extensive preparation. All students in the programtake four courses in research methods designed to helpdoctoral students comprehend the nature of science andmaster tools of research (see Course Requirements, below). Each student selects a specialization in which to complete an original research project under the direction of programfaculty and write a dissertation. Students may chooseresearch projects within one of the major areas. It is theresponsibility of the student to secure the agreement of aDepartment of Government full-time tenured or tenure-trackfaculty member to serve as the chair of the dissertationcommittee. One of the other two members of the committeemay be from outside SPA. As part of this process, eachstudent must publicly defend the research proposal before thedissertation committee and other interested faculty. Thecommittee and the chair of the department, in consultationwith the SPA director of doctoral programs, must approve theresearch proposal in order for the candidate to advance tocandidacy. As work on the dissertation project progresses, students register for dissertation credit. Substantive course work maybe used as part of this requirement where it contributesdirectly to the research specialization and is specificallyrecommended by the dissertation committee chair. Upon writing the dissertation, the candidate submits the manuscript to the dissertation committee for review. If thecommittee members approve the dissertation, the candidatemust complete an oral defense of it, including demonstrablemastery of related literature on the general field in which itlies before the committee and other interested faculty. Afterhearing the candidate's defense, the committee decideswhether the dissertation is acceptable as the culminatingwork of the student's doctoral career. The dissertation must consist of high quality original research directly relevant to the student's doctoral program. Adissertation proposal may be rejected if the topic does notaddress a major research issue in political science, theresearch design is inadequate, the methodology isinappropriate, or because no full-time tenured or tenure-trackfaculty member in the Department of Government is academically competent or available to supervise the project.If the candidate fails to maintain satisfactory progress towardcompletion of the dissertation, his or her candidacy may beterminated.

Barnes, J. Gumbrewicz, S. Longfield Karr Instructor K.N. Kozey The Department of Justice, Law and Society (DJLS) has one of the oldest programs in the field of justice in the United States.The full-time faculty in the department have educational back-grounds in law, criminology, criminal justice, philosophy, politicalscience, sociology, psychology, and history. The department of-fers the Bachelor of Arts in Justice and Law and in Law and Soci-ety, Master of Science in Justice, Law and Society; a dual JurisDoctor and Master of Science program with the Washington Col-lege of Law, and the PhD in Justice, Law and Society. The BA in Justice and Law, with concentrations in criminal justice or criminology, analyzes the foundations, functions, pol-icies, and procedures of justice. Crime and deviance are seriouspublic policy concerns in American society, and systems of jus - tice are the main public policy responses for dealing with these problems. Cross-cultural and international perspectives arebrought to bear when they shed light on the nature of crime anddeviance in America or on the workings of American systemsof justice. The BA in Law and Society, with concentrations inthe humanities or social sciences, is an interdisciplinary pro - gram that examines the role of law in relation to social, political, and economic institutions. The complex relation of law and jus - tice, broadly conceived, is the central consideration in this pro - gram of study. Drawing on the social sciences and humanities, this curriculum offers an historical and international perspectiveon legal issues. Both undergraduate majors can be consideredprelaw majors. The MS in Justice, Law and Society further elaborates on the central concerns of the undergraduate degrees offered inDJLS. The MS concentration in justice and public policy offerstheoretical and applied grounding in criminology and criminaljustice issues, including all levels of policing and corrections.The concentration in terrorism and security policy focuses onnational security as well as the causes of terrorism and policyaffecting its prevention. Law and society is an interdisciplinaryapproach to the role of law in society including theoretical legalfoundations and law as it relates to the social sciences and issues of social justice. The jurisprudence and social thought concen - tration emphasizes both philosophical and comparative perspectives on law and analytical thought. The department's programs prepare students for law school and further graduate study, as well as for entry-level positionsand professional careers in the justice field. Washington, DCprovides a source of and internship placements, which oftenlead to challenging employment.

Students receive a thorough grounding in both empirical and theoretical approaches to public policy is - sues and take a concentration in either justice and public policy, law and society, jurisprudence and social thought, or terrorismand security policy. The concentration in justice and public policy provides a theoretical grounding in criminology and course work in crimi - nal justice, including corrections and policing. This concentra - tion prepares students for a variety of practitioner and research positions in criminal justice, or for advanced graduate work incriminology or criminal justice. The concentration in jurisprudence and social thought em - phasizes philosophical and comparative perspectives on law,providing students with an appreciation of the nature and struc - tural foundations of law and a firm grounding in analytical thought. This concentration serves students who have a back - ground in either the liberal arts or law and are interested in combining the two. The concentration in law and society provides an interdisci - plinary perspective on the role of law in society, including the theoretical foundations of law, the relationship between law andthe social sciences, and broad issues of social justice. This con - centration prepares students for positions in policy research and analysis or for advanced graduate work in law and society. The concentration in terrorism and security policy focuses on issues of national security from the perspectives of criminol - ogy and criminal justice. This concentration prepares students for a variety of practitioner and research positions in the area ofprevention and control of terrorism. Admission to the Program In addition to meeting the minimum university require - ments for graduate study, applicants must submit Graduate Re - cord Examination (GRE) test scores.

A minimum grade point average of 3.2 in all course work is required to remain in good standing and to earn the degree.School of Public Affairs 311/c183Advancement to candidacy is accomplished by successfully completing a written qualifying examination at the end of thesecond semester of study. /c183Students take two written comprehensive examinations, thefirst in either justice or law and society. The second may bethe other of these two fields or may be any other major field.Following completion of the written examinations, allstudents take an oral examination on their entire program ofstudy before a committee of faculty members, and defendtheir dissertation proposal. Students take a primary field comprehensive examination in justice or law and society. They take a secondary fieldcomprehensive examination in the other field, or they maytake a second field elsewhere in the School of Public Affairs(SPA), the School of International Service, or in anotherdoctoral degree-granting teaching unit. Under specialcircumstances, students may take a second field outsideAmerican University, subject to the approval of the SPAgraduate director, in consultation with the department. /c183The PhD is fundamentally a research degree. Understandingscientific inquiry and correctly using research techniquesrequire extensive preparation. All students in the programtake three courses designed to help doctoral studentscomprehend the nature of science and master tools ofresearch (see Course Requirements, below). Each student selects a specialization in which to complete an original research project under the direction of programfaculty and write a dissertation. Students may chooseresearch projects within one of the major areas or select aresearch specialization from one of the other graduate fieldswithin the school. Each student prepares a research proposal for the dissertation project. It is the responsibility of the student to secure theagreement of a School of Public Affairs full-time tenured ortenure-track faculty member to serve as the chair of thedissertation committee. One of the two other members of thecommittee may be from outside SPA. As part of this process,each student must publicly defend the research proposalbefore the dissertation committee and other interested faculty.The committee and the SPA director of doctoral programs(acting for the dean) must approve the defense and theresearch proposal. The topic covered by the proposal must berelated to ongoing research or publications of the supervisingfaculty. As work on the dissertation project progresses, students register for dissertation credit. Substantive course work maybe used as part of this requirement where it contributesdirectly to the research specialization and is specificallyrecommended by the dissertation committee chair. Upon completion of the research and the written dissertation, the candidate submits the manuscript to the dissertationcommittee for review. If the committee members approve the manuscript, the candidate must complete an oral defense ofthe dissertation and the general field in which it lies before thecommittee and other interested faculty. The committeedetermines conclusively at this point whether the dissertationand examination are acceptable. The dissertation must consist of high quality original research directly relevant to the student's doctoral program. Adissertation proposal may be rejected if the topic does notaddress a major research issue in justice, law and society, theresearch design is inadequate, the methodology isinappropriate, or because no full-time tenured or tenure-trackfaculty member in the School of Public Affairs isacademically competent or available to supervise the project.If the candidate fails to maintain satisfactory progress towardcompletion of the dissertation, his or her candidacy may beterminated.

Marvel, M. Walker Through its teaching and key location in Washington, DC, the Department of Public Administration and Policy (DPAP)seeks to enhance the knowledge, professional skills, and leader - ship potential of its students in their public service careers. Graduate degrees offered by the department include the Master of Public Administration (MPA), Master of Public Pol - icy (MPP), and PhD in Public Administration.

DPAP is the only department in the nation to have three master'sprograms accredited by the National Association of Schools ofPublic Affairs and Administration (NASPAA). The UnitedStates and other governments worldwide face the challenge ofdiscerning how best to harness the energy and expertise of pub - lic servants, the passion and commitment of nonprofit organiza -tions, and the dynamism and creativity of markets in the pursuit of democratic and constitutionally informed public purposes.We educate students entering, engaged in, and interacting withgovernment agencies in the United States and abroad. We treatadministration and policy as interrelated subjects strongly influ - enced by the values of public service and democratic constitutionalism. Through our research and civic involvement,we also seek to shape and enhance what is practiced and taughtin our field.

Students maychoose research projects within one of the major areas or theymay select a research specialization from one of the othergraduate fields within the school. Each student prepares a research proposal for the dissertation project. It is the responsibility of the student to secure theagreement of a School of Public Affairs full-time tenured ortenure-track faculty member to serve as the chair of thedissertation committee. One of the two other members of thecommittee may be from outside the School of Public Affairs.Each student must publicly defend the research proposalbefore the dissertation committee and other interested faculty. The committee and the SPA director of doctoral programs (acting for the dean) must approve the defense and theresearch proposal. The topic covered by the proposal must berelated to ongoing research or publications of the supervisingfaculty. As work on the dissertation project progresses, students register for directed study. Substantive course work may beused as part of this requirement where it contributes directlyto the research specialization and is specificallyrecommended by the dissertation chair. Upon completion of the research and the written dissertation, the candidate submits his or her manuscript to the dissertationcommittee for review. If the committee members approve themanuscript, the candidate must complete an oral defense ofthe dissertation and the general field in which it lies before thecommittee and other interested faculty.
