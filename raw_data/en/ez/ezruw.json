Since 2004, the Folk & Traditional Arts Program has added to those memorable experiences with events in state parks by musicians, dancers, craftspeople and storytellers who represent a wide variety of old and new Washington traditions. From tribal canoe family journeys to Cinco de Mayo festivities, from fisher poetry to Ecuadorian song, from Hawaiian hula to old-time square dances, the program brings people together \u2014 some to celebrate a common heritage and some to learn about the traditions of others.
