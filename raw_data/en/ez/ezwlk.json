Make sure you choose organic ingredients for your juice cleanse recipes. Below you will find our juice cleanse how to guide... Juice Cleanse How to Guide There are three main ways you can use juicing recipes for weight loss: A total juice fast, where you consume nothing but juice for a period of time, or balanced meal replacement with juice. and Finally, a purchased juicing diet. Option #1 - Total Juice Fast The first way to lose weight with juicing is to do a juice-only fast without eating any solid food. This is what Joe Cross did in Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead for 60 days and which resulted in him losing over 100 pounds. This juicing diet plan requires a lot of discipline and preparation, and can actually be dangerous if not done right. Don't do a total juice fast without consulting your doctor first. You don't have to do a 60 day fast like Joe Cross did, that is an extreme example. Seven days is the longest I'd recommend you do a total juice fast, and even then please get permission from your doctor before embarking on a juice cleanse. You can get a lot of health benefits with a short 3 day detox cleanse as well. Option #2 - Use as a Balanced Meal Replacement The other way to use juice recipes for weight loss is to incorporate it into your daily lifestyle and replace 1-2 unhealthy meals a day with a serving of detox juice. Use it to replace high carbohydrate foods like rice, bread, pasta, soda, bottled juice, and fried / processed foods. This is by far the healthier way to achieve long term weight loss. ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19248858)) It's important to mainly use the juice from vegetables and only use some fruit as a sweetener. Vegetable juice is lower in calories and usually has more beneficial nutrients, like antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Option #3 - Buy a Juice Cleanse The most expensive of the options, it to purchase a juice cleanse. You can find local juice cleanse options, and those are the most pricy, we found this option on Amazon that proves to be a better deal! This purchasable juicing diet option may seam expensive, but the benefits both in cost, as well as for your juice diet are plenty! Here is why we like this Juice Cleanse 3 Day: - You can travel with it, this juice cleanse 3 day is great for business trips! - You won't have food waste, most often than not, you may find yourself throwing away fruits and vegetables you purchased too much of, not with this! - It's 100% all natural. - It's Vegan! - It has 1 day, 2 days, and 3 day juice cleanse options. Key Point: Detox juice can be used for weight loss, either by drinking only detox juice for a period of time, or by using it to replace unhealthy meals. It's important to use minimal fruit when trying to lose weight with detox juice. There are 10 juicing for weight loss recipes above, as well as our juice cleanse how to guide.
