The most rewarding part of what I do is helping people to feel engaged in the work they do, but also supported. What I love about my inaugural role at Penn State Health is we're crafting what we want learning to be. Learning in and of itself is not an action, it's a state of mind. And so, what we're helping to craft is partnerships across the organization. For me it's connection and everything is rooted in relationships. The ability to connect with over 18,000 employees and their leadership is a blessing, as well as bringing forward efficiency and effectiveness when creating a pathway for learning and development. How have you seen the health system prioritize engagement and connection? We're in this highly transformative state, which to me is very exciting. We are prioritizing listening at the local levels, diversity and inclusion efforts, and getting information out, especially at the management level, to create a community of resources and support for individuals. That's how our leaders support people in these processes. Are we able to recognize where employees might need more support? How do you see learning and development playing a role in employee wellness? Learning and development is an undercurrent to everything we're doing in the organization. When we think about engagement, culture and wellness, learning and development play a part in that. For example, when we look at leadership programming wellness and the recognition of \"how do I manage myself first?,\" part of that is looking at the whole person as an individual. My hope is that we continue to foster relationships across the organization and create pathways where wellness, inclusion, engagement and development are seen as a continuum rather than separate aspects within our organization. Why is wellness important for employees at Penn State Health? Nothing happens in any organization without the employees. When I think about learning and development and wellness, the employees are the people that are in my care. If we are caring for them, they can then care for a patient. And wellness looks different for everyone. How I define wellness may not be how you define it, and so it is important for individuals to have options where they know they have support. I am excited about the upcoming changes and developments the organization is making. We're transforming Compass into a tool for you to explore and learn new things. It's a part of growth as an individual but also serving the key points that we are about in our organization. The second piece is leadership development programming for frontline and mid-level management pathways. This year we are developing a mix of on-demand classroom-based research tools and podcasts. We want to use these resources to foster excitement and create an environment that is motivating for individuals and teams. How do you prioritize your well-being and development? First, naming your emotions! I'm a huge Bren\u00e9 Brown and Adam Grant fan and admire their research on this topic. For example, instead of saying, \"I'm okay today or I'm fine\", name the emotions and say , \"Nope, I'm really frustrated, but I'm also feeling motivated to do XYZ.\" The second way to prioritize your well-being is giving yourself grace. I am good at giving grace to other people in their situations and I wasn't FALL 2022 EDITION INTELLECTUAL EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL SOCIAL OCCUPATIONAL FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL SPIRITUAL8 DIMENSIONS OF WELLNESS Our wellness program's mission is to inspire employees to lead a balanced healthy lifestyle across all dimensions of wellness.

When you are dealing with a challenge at home or at work, group support can offer perspective, encouragement, and most importantly , the reassurance that you are not alone. Virtual Support Connect (VSC) provides live, moderated sessions in a wide variety of topics. Confidentiality is key - you answer questions, participate in activities and provide feedback anonymously by exchanging texts with the moderator. When you join a moderated session, only the moderator is seen on camera. In addition to leading the session, the moderator also provides helpful tools such as worksheets and additional resources.SupportLinc Download the mobile app today! group code: psh at doing that for myself, so that's been a focus to say , \"am I extending grace and self-care to myself in ways that I do with other people?\" The third thing is rest! I can't highlight enough how much sleep matters on how we show up and how we feel. What motivates you to be well? I have a meditation journal that I use daily , and I carry it with me everywhere and it reminds me of writing down what you're grateful for today , and that could be as simple as a hot cup of coffee or an excellent connection with a team member being able to solve something together. The second piece is evaluating priorities. Instead of having a to do list every day , I create weekly goals. I usually have three weekly goals and if I meet those I can walk away and say \"this has been successful\" rather than 19,000 things on a checklist where it feels like there is always more to be done. What are your personal learning and development goals this year? I'm naturally a very curious person and I like to learn from other industries and find topics to educate myself on. I'm an avid reader and it's not just leadership books, but all kinds of genres. I find that reading is really peaceful for me, so if I only make 15 minutes for that a day , that's plenty for me. The third thing is teaching myself something that scares me. I pick one thing a year that I'm not good at and I start fresh on that topic. This year, I'm learning Spanish. I'd like to be further along, but I realized I've picked up a lot more in the language than I thought I would, so I'm right where I'm supposed to be. In the end, what will you hope that employees will say about wellness at Penn State Health? I hope employees will say that wellness is our culture. For me, wellness is where people have access to the things that they need as they need them; a collection of resources that are easy to navigate. Instead of it being a culture of wellness or a culture of engagement or a culture of learning, is that our culture is that of \"I feel supported, and I know that I have resources available to me.\" I believe wholeheartedly that I'm in service to the organization, and so although we have 18,000 plus employees, if there's something that really matters to an individual, it's important to me. I want people to know they have access to myself and my team and can reach out at any time.Continued from cover .Wellness Tips from the Top Upcoming EventsOCT. 10: Work Life Balance OCT. 18 and 19: Employee Only Mammogram Screenings* NOV. 1: Holiday Budgeting *See Breast Cancer Awareness article on page 6 for details.For more events and information visit the mySolutions portal, accessible through the Infonet.If you are not registered on Supportlinc, sign-up is easy and can be done in 60 seconds!

Jolene Keller is a board-certified nurse coach that empowers women through nature to take control of their health and wellness. | www.seasthedaywellness.comThe Healing Power of Nature h Boosted Immune System h Increased Energy h Improved Sleep h Lowered Blood Pressure h Reduced Inflammation h Reduced Rate of Obesity h Improved Development of Vision h Anti-Cancer Effects h Longevityh Stress Reduction h Restored Mental Energy h Improved Mood h Improved Concentration h Improved Short Term MemoryHave you ever noticed that you feel different after sitting on the beach or walking in the woods? Evidence shows that regularly spending time in natural settings has numerous physical and mental benefits. Simply having a view of nature leads to faster patient recovery times in hospitals and higher job satisfaction in office workers. Outdoor exercise increases energy and reduces depression, anxiety and obesity . Green exercise and play may lead to better health as opposed to the same activity done indoors. It's free and as simple as walking out of your front door! Our increased reliance on technology means we are spending less time outdoors. Our modern world is high-paced and stressful. Studies show that we spend an average of 5-6 hours on our phones daily not including work related use. We look at our phones over 260 times per day or every 5 \u00bd minutes. Our brain is constantly in overload and stimulated by incoming information. Our brains are not meant to be repeatedly processing all that data without a rest! Reconnecting with nature is like resetting your brain. In Japan, Forest Bathing (Shinrin-Yoku) has been used as preventative healthcare since the 1980's. Forest bathing is literally immersing yourself in the forest, slowing down and using all of your senses. It is literally the concept of using nature as medicine. Imagine your favorite sights, sounds, smells and feels in nature-most likely they are soothing and not stimulating. So how do you trade artificial light for sunshine and exchange sitting on the couch for a slow walk in nature? Time is often a factor in our busy lives. The key to successfully spending more time outdoors is to make it simple and fun. Start small and find an accountability partner. Any activity to disconnect from the chaos and digital world even for 10 minutes has so many benefits. Walk out your front door and leave your phone inside! LOOK AT TIME IN NATURE AS A DEPOSIT IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT instead of another task on your to do list. The more you put in, the less chance there is of an overdraft. You don't even need to be moving or exercising to reap the benefits. All you have to do is sit, look around, breathe and slow down.SIMPLE WAYS TO INCORPORATE NATURE DAILY: Walking (alone, with a friend or dog) Gardening or bring nature indoors with plants Sit outside for lunch or outdoor picnic Forest therapy, earthing or grounding Mindfulness in nature Adopt a sit spot routine Watch the sunrise, sunset or stargaze Open your windows or blinds Create a nature journal Outdoor scavenger hunt Sit outside (or in a hammock!) and read a book PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF NATURE: MENTAL BENEFITS OF NATURE: PAGE 4 PENN STATE HEALTH WELLNESS NEWSLETTER There was a time when the boundaries between work and home were fairly clear. Today , however, work is likely to invade your personal life, and maintaining work-life balance is no simple task. Technology that enables constant connection to work can eat into time at home. Still, work-life balance isn't out of reach. Start by evaluating your relationship to work. Then apply specific strategies to help you strike a healthier balance.Work-Life Balance FIND A HEALTHY BALANCE As long as you're working, juggling the demands of career and personal life will probably be an ongoing challenge. But if you can learn both to set limits and look after yourself, you can achieve the work-life balance that's best for you:INCREASED EXPECTATIONS If you regularly work extra hours, you might be given more responsibility , which could lead to additional concerns and challenges.CONSIDER THE COST It can be tempting to rack up hours at work, especially if you're trying to earn a promotion or manage an ever-increasing workload \u2014 or simply keeping your head above water. If you're spending most of your time working, though, your home life will take a hit. Consider the consequences of poor work-life balance: FATIGUE When you're tired, your ability to work pro- ductively and think clearly might suffer, which could take a toll on your professional reputation or lead to dangerous or costly mistakes. POOR HEALTH Stress is associated with adverse effects on the immune system and can worsen the symptoms you experience from any medical condition.LOST TIME WITH FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES If you're working too much, you might miss important family events or milestones. This can leave you feeling left out and might harm relationships with your loved ones. It's also difficult to nurture friendships if you're always working. h SETTING LIMITS You can't manufacture time. If you don't set limits, then work or other obligations can leave you with no time for the activities and relationships you enjoy. h MAKE A LIST Put family events on a weekly calendar, and keep a daily to-do list at home and at work. Having a plan helps you maintain focus. When you don't have a plan, it's easy to be sucked into the plans and priorities of others. h LEAVE WORK AT WORK Whenever possible, try to maintain appropriate boundaries between work and home. While it may be unrealistic to think that work responsibilities will never impact your personal or family life, it's important to maintain healthy boundaries between your work and personal life so that you are able to give your best to both.h LEARN TO SAY NO Whether it's a co-worker asking you to spearhead an extra project or your child's teacher asking you to organize a class party, remember that it's OK to respectfully say no. When you quit accepting tasks out of guilt or a false sense of obligation, you'll have more time for activities that are meaningful to you. h REMEMBER THAT YOUR EAP IS A RESOURCE Whenever life's challenges feel too difficult to handle on your own, consider calling your Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for help. Your EAP provides expert guidance and valuable resources to restore and strengthen your health, productivity and quality of life. All EAP services are free and completely confidential.h MANAGE YOUR TIME Cut or delegate activities you don't enjoy or can't handle, or share your concerns and possible solutions with your employer or others. Organize household tasks efficiently, such as running errands in batches or doing a load of laundry every day; don't save all the laundry for your day off. Do what needs to be done and let the rest go.h TRACK YOUR TIME Pay attention to your daily tasks, including work- related and personal activities. Decide what's necessary and what satisfies you the most.
