Continuity of primary care is essential for high-quality, cost effective patient care. Explore the percentage of adolescents who received the recommended immunizations by their 13th birthday in each state: - Tetanus, diphtheria toxoids, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) and the meningococcal vaccine (Combination 1 rate) - Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (HPV rate) Higher rates are better on this measure. The purple dashed line represents the median, or middle, of all values reported. This measure reports state performance on the percentage of adolescents who turned 13 years old during the measurement year and had up to date vaccinations on three types of vaccines: - Meningococcal vaccine - Tdap vaccine - HPV vaccine series States calculate a rate for each vaccine as well as two combination rates for this measure. These data show state reporting for (1) the Combination 1 rate\u2014the percentage receiving both meningococcal and Tdap vaccines\u2014and (2) the HPV vaccine rate. States voluntarily report on Immunizations for Adolescents (IMA-CH) as part of the [Core Set of Children's Health Care Quality Measures](/medicaid/quality-of-care/performance-measurement/adult-and-child-health-care-quality-measures/childrens-health-care-quality-measures/index.html). These data show performance rates for states that voluntarily reported the measure using Child Core Set measure specifications. The included populations and calculation methods for Child Core Set measures can vary by state. For example, some states report a single combined rate for both the Medicaid and CHIP populations, but other states report separate rates for these populations. In addition, states may include beneficiaries in some delivery systems, but exclude other delivery systems. For example, a state may include beneficiaries who are enrolled in managed care, but exclude beneficiaries who are covered on a fee-for-service (FFS) basis. States can also choose to calculate this measure using the administrative or hybrid method. This variation in populations and calculation methods can affect measure performance and comparisons between states.

Notes: The term \"states\" includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The following state did not report data for the HPV rate: GA. The following states did not report data for either the HPV or Combination 1 rate: AZ, AR, KS, ME, MT, and NY. The Child Core Set specifications include guidance for calculating this measure using the administrative method or the hybrid method. The hybrid method uses a combination of administrative and medical records data to identify services included in the numerator or to determine exclusions from the denominator based on diagnoses or other criteria. Unless otherwise specified, administrative data sources are the state's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) and/or data submitted by managed care plans; medical record data sources are paper and/or electronic health records. States may also use immunization registry data to calculate this measure. Unless otherwise specified: - States used Child Core Set specifications, based on National Committee for Quality Assurance 2020 specifications. The following states used National Committee for Quality Assurance 2019 specifications: NJ and OR. - Denominators are assumed to be the measure-eligible population for states using the administrative method; states using the hybrid method often reported the sample size for the medical chart review rather than the measure-eligible population. Some states reported exclusions from the denominator, as noted in the state-specific comments. - The measurement period for this measure was January 2019 to December 2019. MN and NJ reported data for calendar year (CY) 2018.
