The books were revised in 1995, 1997 and 2003 as a result of the feedback received from students, teachers and ELT professionals. The Board received feedback from teachers teaching in various school systems i.e., independent schools, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan and Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti in large numbers which suggested that a change was already overdue. Accordingly , the book was revised in 2009. The book has been designed to develop the student' s communicative competence in English. The extracts selected have been taken with the purpose of making students think on their own and inculcating in them the life skills necessary for facing the challenges of the present as well as the future. The present book includes a few more activities to enable students to explore communicative aspects in more depth. Teachers may adopt appropriate pedagogical practices to enhance the creativity of students. It must also be noted that language is not just a functional tool; it is rather a medium through which students interact with the world around them. Therefore, students should be encouraged to think on their own and express their ideas using their experiences, knowledge and imagination, rather than being text or teacher- dependent. The effort of the material developers and editorial board for all editions is acknowledged. Feedback/suggestions for further improvement are welcome.

Balasubramanian, Director (Academic), Mr. P. Mani, Education Officer (Humanities & Languages) ContributorContributorNote to ReadersNote to Readers Main Course Book (MCB) encourages and emphasizes self-directed education, creativity and discovery rather than rote memorization. The students are encouraged to incorporate their own interests into projects, within a set of broad guidelines. Leaning into student-led learning, the book offers educators an opportunity to learn alongside their students as they grow in a nurturing, creative environment. Competence in reading is the key to independent learning and has a direct effect on progress in all other areas of the curriculum. The vision is for the children to become fluent, frequent and lifelong readers. We want our children to be 'readers', not just children who can read. Hence, the themes of each unit of the MCB, such as Adventure, People, and Sports, include passages that have been carefully chosen accord ing to the age and interest level of the students. These offer an excellent resource, introducing the student to different kinds of texts that they should be familiar with. These reading extracts will help the students to learn the sub-skills of Reading. The book demonstrates how to use a range of comprehension strategies along with the skill of making inter-text connections. The varied themes provide opportunities for the children to interact and collaborate. The focus is to encourage children to ask the 'why' questions and plan opportunities to interpret and respond to the text. It also subtly aims for the children to develop a wider and more interesting vocabulary . The book offers to develop the learner's written expression of thought and provides opportunities to explore ideas. It demonstrates various writing forms/skills for example, in-class responses, journals, notebooks, reports, argumentative essays, articles and letters. The MCB also has an exciting unit on creating student Radio and Video shows. As the students take a break from their daily school routine and begin vacation, they can be initiated into creating Radio shows. As they explore the world of books, they can draw from their reading experiences from any of the genres given: mystery , horror , science fiction, comedy or fantasy . This is an ideal opportunity to not only allow the students to explore their creativity , but also learn to collaborate, work in teams, and learn yet another way of utilising the language effectively to communicate at a broader level. Main Course Book (MCB) is an invaluable resource that initiates a student into the world of Reading and Writing with clarity and purpose. Feedback is welcome for further improvement.ContentsContents UNIT 1 : PEOPLE Unit 2 : AD VENTURE Unit 3 : ENVIR ONMENT UNIT 4 : THE CLASS IX RADIO AND VIDEO SHO W Unit 5 : MY STER Y1 2 A.

AN EXEMPLARY LEADER Let's read a short story about an exemplary boss. Working 12 to 18 hours a day was not uncommon for scientists at the rocket launching station, Thumba. A group of such scientists was frustrated due to the work pressure and meeting their boss's demands; however, they were loyal to him. One day, a scientist gathered enough courage to go up to his boss and say, \"Sir, I have promised my children that I will take them to the exhibition this evening. Therefore, I have to leave the office by 5.30 pm. Can I leave early today, Sir?\" His boss replied, \"Alright. You may leave early today.\" The scientist was happy for having received the permission and continued with his work. He stayed on to work after lunch, and, as always, got so engrossed in his work, that he peered at his watch only when he thought he was done. Unfortunately, it was past 08:15 pm. With a jolt, he remembered his promise to his children. He looked for his boss who was not in his office. Having told him just that morning, he wrapped up his work and hurried home. As he drove home, he felt very guilty for having let his children down. When he reached, the children were not at home. His wife was busy reading. He felt that initiating any conversation with her would only add fuel to the fire, so he stayed quiet. Looking up at him, his wife asked, \"Do you want something hot to drink or would you like to have dinner right away?\" UNIT-1PEOPLEMAIN COURSE BOOK 9The man could only ask, \"Where are the children?\" His wife said, \"Don't you know? Your boss came here around quarter past five and took the children to the exhibition you had promised to take them to.\" He was surprised, but it did not take him very long to guess what had happened. The boss who had granted him permission had observed him working very seriously well past 5.00 pm. He realized that the scientist would not leave the work half done, but if he had promised his children a visit to the exhibition, then they deserved it. So, he took the lead in taking them to the exhibition himself. The boss did not have to do it every time. But once it was done, loyalty was established. No wonder, all scientists at the Thumba continued to work under this boss, in spite of the great pressure. This boss was none other than Dr APJ Abdul Kalam. A.6. Following are the eight incidents from the story, but their order is mixed up. Put them in the right sequence. (a) The scientist rushed home anticipating the disappointment of his children. (b) Scientists were working for 12-18 hours a day at Thumba. (c) The boss consented. (d) Scientists were under immense work pressure but they were loyal. (e) A scientist approached the boss for permission to leave at 5.30 pm to take his children to the exhibition. (f) To his surprise, he learnt that his boss had kept his appointment for him. (g) Suddenly, he remembered his promise to his children. (h) The scientist became so engrossed in his work that he continued working till 8.15 pm.UNIT-1PEOPLE10 MAIN COURSE BOOKA.7.

A woman lived with him, says the bedroom wall Papered with lilacs and the kitchen shelves Covered with oilcloth, and they had a child Says the sandbox made from a tractor tyre. Money was scarce, say the jars of plum preserves And canned tomatoes sealed in the cellar-hole, And the winters cold, say the rags in the window frames.

Stones in the fields Say he was not a farmer; the still-sealed jarsUNIT-1PEOPLE18 MAIN COURSE BOOKIn the cellar say she left in a nervous haste. And the child?

C.5. Imagine that a Social Worker comes to the abandoned farmhouse to find out what may have happened to the family. She makes the following observations in her note-pad : Clues Conclusions *empty house Have they left? Where could they have gone to? *boulders in the field, The owner might not have been a farmer. leaky barn *sealed jars in the cellar A woman lived there - family short of money - left in a hurry *toys scattered in Something went wrong ????? the yard On the basis of these notes, the Social Worker wants to present the facts to her Head of Department. Write the report in 120-150 words. You may begin like this: When I reached the farmhouse, I saw that the house was empty. I......... C.6. The poet draws conclusions about the family without having met them. He does this in lines such as: Something went wrong, says the empty house in the weed-choked yard...UNIT-1PEOPLEMAIN COURSE BOOK 21This is a style of English that is very suitable for a poem. But in ordinary speech or writing we use expressions such as: For example, we could say: * There are large shoes in the farmhouse, so it is likely that the farmer was a big man. * It seems that they had a child, because there is a sandbox made from a tractor tyre. * The kitchen shelves were covered with oil cloth. This suggests that a woman lived in the farmhouse. Make other sentences like this, using ideas from the poem. C.7.

She was last heard when she was around 100 miles from the tiny Pacific Howland Island on July 2, 1937. Let's read the story of her 'Final Flight'. On June 1, 1937 Amelia and her navigator Fred Noonan departed from Miami, Florida; bound for California. Their first destination was San Juan, Puerto Rico; from there, skirting the northeast edge of South America; and then on to Africa and the Red Sea. The flight to Karachi was another first. No one had previously flown non-stop from the Red Sea to India before. From Karachi, the Electra flew to Calcutta on June 17 from there on, to Rangoon, Bangkok, Singapore and Bandoeng. The monsoon prevented departure from Bandoeng for several days. Repairs were made on some of the 'long distance' instruments which had given trouble previously. During this time, Amelia became ill, and suffered from dysentery that lasted several days. It was June 27 before Amelia and Noonan were able to leave Bandoeng for Port Darwin, Australia. At Darwin, the direction finder was repaired, and the parachutes were packed and shipped home as they would be of no value over the Pacific. Karachi: Karachi was part of pre-partition British-ruled India, now in Pakistan Calcutta: now Kolkata UNIT-2ADVENTUREMAIN COURSE BOOK 29Amelia reached Lae in New Guinea on June 29. At this point they had flown 22,000 miles and there were 7,000 more to go over the Pacific. Amelia cabled her last commissioned article to the Herald Tribune. Photos show her looking very tired and ill during her time at Lae. The U.S. Coast Guard cutter, Itasca had been standing off Howland Island for some days to act as a radio contact for Amelia. Radio communications in the area were very poor as Itasca was overwhelmed with commercial radio traffic that the flight had generated. Amelia left Lae at precisely 00:00 hours Greenwich Mean Time on July 2. It is believed that the Electra was loaded with 1,000 gallons of fuel, allowing for 20-21 hours of flying. At 07:20 hours GMT Amelia provided a position report placing the Electra on course at some 20 miles southwest of the Nukumanu Islands. The last weather report Amelia was known to have received was before take-off. The head wind speed had increased by 10-12 mph, but it is not known if she ever received the report. At 08:00 GMT Amelia made her last radio contact with Lae. She reported being on course for Howland Island at 12,000 feet. There is no real evidence as to the precise track of the aircraft after Nukumanu. No one saw or heard the plane fly over.UNIT-2ADVENTURE30 MAIN COURSE BOOKSeveral short transmissions were received by the Itasca with varying signal strengths but they were unable to get a fix on her location because they were too brief. At 19:30 GMT the following transmission was received from the Electra at maximum strength. \"KHAQQ calling Itasca. We must be on you but cannot see you... gas is running low...\" At 20:14 GMT, the Itasca received the last voice transmission from Amelia giving positioning data. The Itasca continued to transmit on all frequencies until 21:30 hours GMT. They determined that Amelia must have died at sea and began to implement search procedures. It has been determined that the plane went down some 35-100 miles off the coast of Howland Island. A life raft was stowed on board but no trace was ever found of the raft. Some experts felt that the empty fuel tanks could keep the plane afloat for a period of time. President Roosevelt authorized a search party of 9 naval ships and 66 aircrafts at an estimated cost of over $4 million. On July 18, the search was abandoned by ships in the Howland area. George continued to seek help in the search, but by October he too abandoned all hope of finding them alive. Amelia had been sending letters to George at stopovers all along her route quite regularly. These were published in the book 'Last Flight'. The book has a note from her to George.... \"Please know I am quite aware of the hazards... I want to do it because I want to do it. Women must try to do things as men have tried. If they fail, their failure must be, but a challenge to others. \"UNIT-2ADVENTUREMAIN COURSE BOOK 31 Amelia created a number of aviation records: o The first woman to fly across the Atlantic in 1928 o The second person to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1932 o The first person to fly solo from Hawaii to California in 1935 Guided by her publicist and husband, George Putnam, she made headlines in an era when aviation had gripped the public's imagination.

'Ordeal in the Ocean' is the story of Slava Kurilov, a Russian, who faced a remarkable trial in the water. Slava Kurilov tells his own story. Read on........ When the liner had finally vanished over the horizon, I was absolutely alone in the stormy night sea. First I thought I had to swim one way, then another. It was not even midnight yet, and I had no hope at all of finding my way in this terrible night time ocean. I began to feel afraid. Waves of fear rolled through me, starting from my hands and feet, attacking my heart and then reaching through my neck to my head. Waves broke over me and water went into my snorkel. I realised I would not be able to last even half an hour in such a condition. I saw individual stars, but I could not distinguish the constellations they belonged to. Then dawn came and put out all my stars and I felt my solitude more keenly. The sky was grey at first, then blue-violet shades appeared. In a few minutes, the colours became brighter, with dark red strips cutting across the sky! The rising sun came up over the ocean. I was surrounded by large waves. The clouds turned pink and swept across the sky in all directions. It was a windy day. There was no land visible. I grew alarmed. Had I made a mistake in my calculations? Perhaps the current had carried me a long a way off the course during the night? A snorkel is an air tube that can rise above the surface of water, so that a swimmer can breathe under water. UNIT-2ADVENTUREMAIN COURSE BOOK 41An hour passed, perhaps two. \"Land!!!\" I could not deny myself the pleasure of shouting the magic word aloud and of hearing my own voice. Perhaps it was my ghostly island of Siargao? I almost felt I had succeeded - now at least I had hope. The sun looked out for the last time, as if it was saying goodbye to me, and hid itself away again. In a few minutes the sky was filled with all the colours of a rainbow, the bright shades changing and merging as I watched. At first the clouds became deep red and then their edges turned bright orange. A little while afterwards, the clouds turned lilac and dark violet. Darkness fell swiftly. My second lonely night in the ocean began. The stars came out unnoticed. I changed course and headed for the south west. As it turned out, this was an unforgivable mistake. Evening was approaching. The ocean around me was full of life; large fish often leapt out of the water and big birds flew right above my head. I could see the island distinctly now. A line of dancing palms stretched the length of its shore. The sides of the mountain were covered in many different shades of green. An hour passed, perhaps more. It was extraordinarily quiet. Then suddenly to my horror, I discovered my island had noticeably begun to move north and was drifting further and further in that direction right before my eyes. Before I had worked out what was happening and could sharply change my course towards the north, the southern tip of the island had appeared in front of me and, beyond that, open ocean stretched to the very horizon. I was totally at the mercy of the current and realised to my alarm that it was slowly carrying me past the land. My third night in the ocean crept up unnoticed. This third night in the ocean was very dark, much darker than the two previous ones. I almost decided to die as I had no hope of seeing another dawn. I was suddenly aware of a quiet voice: \"Swim to the sound of the breakers.\" Indeed, there had been a distant rumbling for some time, although I had paid no attention to it. Now, I started listening and I thought it sounded like the characteristic noise of jet aeroplanes constantly landing and taking off. The voice inside kept insisting that I should swim towards this thunder of waves.UNIT-2ADVENTURE42 MAIN COURSE BOOK At last I obeyed. Again I heard an approaching rumble. What I suddenly saw at a distance of about 30 or 40 metres has imprinted itself on my memory forever. It was a gigantic wave with steep, very slowly falling crests. Never in my life had I seen such an enormous wave - it even seemed to be touching the sky. It moved very slowly and was fantastically beautiful. The wave did not break over me as I assumed it would. An irresistible force dragged me up its steep slope right to the very foot of the falling crest. Instinctively I clutched my mask snorkel and managed to take a deep breath. The crest started to break over me and pulled me under it. For a moment, I found myself in the air under the crest as if in a cave. Then my body was in a swirling current of water; the inner power of the wave made me recover several times, twisting me in all directions before it subsided. I realised that I had to try to keep my body on the crest and I quickly took up a horizontal position. This time the wave quickly grabbed me and carried me at great speed for quite a long distance on its crest.UNIT-2ADVENTUREMAIN COURSE BOOK 43I got up to the surface easily and swam in the direction the waves were heading. \"Somewhere there, beyond the reef, there should be a lagoon,\" I hoped. Suddenly, I felt something hard under my feet. I could stand up to my chest in water! Around me I could see random currents of water, splashes of foam and phosphorescent spray, all swirling about. Before I fully came to my senses, another large wave approached and carried me some distance further. I was up to my waist in water when a new wave picked me up, taking me several metres forward. Now the depth of the water was only up to my knees. I had enough time to take a few tentative steps, to catch my breath and look around. I surfaced at the foot of a very tall palm tree. I left a trail of luminous water and my body glittered like some princess's ball-gown. Only now did I feel completely safe. The ocean was behind me.... C.4. Answer the following questions based on the given extract, by selecting the correct options. At last I obeyed. Again I heard an approaching rumble.

[You will find the information useful for your group discussion in A.5.] The Indian Rhinoceros or the Great Asian One-horned Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis ) is a large mammal primarily found in north-eastern India, Nepal and parts of Bhutan. It is confined to the tall grasslands and forests in the foothills of the Himalayas. The Indian Rhinoceros once ranged throughout the entire stretch of the IndoGangetic Plain but excessive hunting reduced their natural habitat drastically.UNIT-3ENVIRONMENT52 MAIN COURSE BOOKToday, about 3,000 Indian Rhinos live in the wild, 1,800 of which are found in Assam alone. In 2008, more than 400 Indian Rhinos were sighted in Nepal's Chitwan National Park. In size, it is equal to that of the White Rhino in Africa; together they are the largest of all rhino species. The Great One-Horned Rhinoceros has a single horn; this is present in both males and females, but not on the newborn young. In most adults, the horn reaches a length of about 25 centimetres, but has been recorded up to 57.2 centimetres in length. The nasal horn curves backwards from the nose. The horn is naturally black. This prehistoric-looking rhinoceros has thick, silver-brown skin which becomes pinkish near the large skin folds that cover its body. The male develops thick neckfolds. It has very little body hair aside from eyelashes, ear-fringes and tail- brush. These rhinos live in tall grasslands and riverine forests, but due to the loss of habitat, they have been forced towards cultivated land. They are mostly solitary creatures, with the exception of mothers and calves and breeding pairs, although they sometimes congregate at bathing areas. The Indian Rhinoceros makes a wide variety of vocalizations. At least ten distinct vocalizations have been identified: snorting, honking, bleating, roaring, squeak panting, moo-grunting, shrieking, groaning, rumbling and humphing. In addition to noises, the rhino also uses olfactory communication. In aggregation, Indian Rhinos are often friendly. They will often greet each other by waiving or bobbing their heads, mounting flanks, nuzzling noses, or licking. Rhinos will playfully spar, run around, and play with twigs in their mouth. Adult males are the primary instigators of fights. Fight between dominant males is the most common cause of rhino mortality. Indian rhinos have few natural enemies, except for tigers. Tigers sometimes kill unguarded calves, but adult rhinos are less vulnerable due to their size. Humans are the only other threat, hunting the rhinoceros primarily for sport or for the use of its horn. Indian Rhinos have been somewhat tamed and trained in circuses, but they remain dangerous and unpredictable animals.UNIT-3ENVIRONMENTMAIN COURSE BOOK 53In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the Indian Rhinoceros was hunted relentlessly. Reports from the middle of the nineteenth century claim that some military officers in Assam individually shot more than 200 rhinos. In the early 1900s, officials became concerned about the rhinos' plummeting numbers. By 1908 in Kaziranga, one of the Rhinos' main ranges, the population had fallen to around 12 individuals. In 1910, rhino hunting in India became prohibited. Some cultures in East Asia believe that the rhino hair has healing and potency powers and therefore, is used for traditional Chinese medicine and other Oriental medicines. The Indian Rhino Vision 2020 (IRV 2020), launched in 2005 was an ambitious effort to obtain a wild population of at least 3,000 great one-horned rhinos spread over seven protected areas in Assam by the year 2020. Various organisations like the International Rhino Foundation, Assam's Forest Department, World Wild Life Fund-India, and others collaborated towards IRV 2020. The Indian and Nepalese Governments have taken major steps towards Indian Rhinoceros conservation with the help of the World Wild Life Fund (WWF). The Kaziranga National Park and Manas National Park in Assam, Pobitora Reserve Forest in Assam (having the highest Indian rhino density in the World),UNIT-3ENVIRONMENT54 MAIN COURSE BOOKOrang National Park of Assam, Laokhowa Reserve Forest of Assam (having a very small population) and Royal Chitwan National Park in Nepal are homes to this endangered animal. The Indian Rhino is the only large species in Asia to be down-listed from endangered to vulnerable, in the IUCN Red list in 2008. A.3.

Read the following article on Global Warming and complete the flow chart given below. Global Warming is caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases - CO2, and methane in the atmosphere, resulting in the rise of Earth's over all surface temperature. India, a low latitude country, would face much of the misery due to climatic changes. Rainfall pattern is expected to undergo a major change in areas like Kerala, MP and the North-East. Himalayan glaciers are melting. This could prove catastrophic for those living downstream in the plains. Due to global warming, heat is trapped in the atmosphere causing the ice to melt. Rising sea levels would inundate many of the coastal cities. Extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfall is expected to occur soon resulting in loss of life and property.UNIT-3ENVIRONMENT64 MAIN COURSE BOOKB.7. Carbon Footprint Project Work A carbon footprint is a representation of the effect human activities have on the climate in terms of the total amount of greenhouse gases produced (measured in units of carbon dioxide). So, it is a measure of the impact we make individually on the earth; by the choices we make regarding our lifestyle. Many activities generate carbon emissions, which contribute towards accelerating global warming and climate change. UNIT-3ENVIRONMENTMAIN COURSE BOOK 65Total carbon footprint/emission quantification would include energy emissions from human activities - such as, from heat, light, power and refrigeration and all transport related emissions from cars, freight and distribution. By measuring the carbon footprint through such tools as carbon calculators, we can get a better sense of what the individual impact is and which parts of our lifestyle deserve strict regulation. In groups, choose and research on any one aspect of our carbon footprints and how we can modify our lifestyle. Each group will then make a project on the various aspects. Read the following excerpts from newspapers on various environmental issues. Ban the Bag The Indus Valley Civilisation left beautifully crafted pottery that speaks volumes of the advances its people made. After 3,000 years, if the ruins we leave behind are excavated, chances are only plastic bags would be dug up. It may sound like an exaggeration, but these bags are not biodegradable. Apart from causing emissions, when these are manufactured, noxious fumes are released while these are being burnt or disposed of. So, be kind to Mother Earth, the next time you go shopping for groceries, remember to carry a cloth bag with you. What India Should Do India has released the National Action Plan on Climate Change.

The potential of nature, of discovered and undiscovered elements in our world, persuades us to probe into some of her mysteries and what they may tell us. Prepare yourself then for a true odyssey of the Earth around us. Air France Plane Missing Near Bermuda Triangle June 1, 2009 An Air France plane is missing. The Agence France-Presse reported that an Air France Airbus A330-200 wide-body jet carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew members disappeared from the radar screens on Monday somewhere off Brazil's Atlantic coast. Flight AF 447, out of Rio de Janeiro, was headed for Paris. According to the Mirror, UNIT-5MYSTERY84 MAIN COURSE BOOKAir France reported that the plane had radioed in, that they were going through turbulence. They also reported that a message, signalling electrical circuit malfunction, was received before it disappeared. A search for the missing plane was conducted by the Brazilian Air Force. The French were also involved in the search. Another well known case of 1962, vividly brings home the need for careful behind-the-scenes probing. Once again, it involved an aircraft. The date was January 8, 1962. A huge 4 engine KB50 aerial tanker was enroute from the east coast to Lajes in the Azores. The captain, Major Bob Tawney, reported in at the expected time. All was normal, routine. But he, his crew and the big tanker, never made it to the Azores. Apparently, the last word from the flight had been the usual routine report, which had placed them a few hundred miles off the East Coast. FLASH! The media broadcasted, fed by a sincere Coast Guard, that a large oil slick was sighted 300 miles off Norfolk, Virginia, in the plane's proposed route. The mystery could be breaking... But that was the only clue ever found. Although never proved that it was from the plane, publicly the suspicions were obvious: the tanker and its qualified crew met a horrid and sudden death by crashing headlong into the sea. However, the report which was finished months later confirmed no such thing. Tawney had been clearly overheard by a Navy transport hours after his last message. This placed him north of Bermuda, hundreds of miles past the spot of the oil slick. There is no evidence, therefore, that the plane and its crew ever met any known fate.UNIT-5MYSTERYMAIN COURSE BOOK 85 UNIT-5MYSTERY86 MAIN COURSE BOOKBermuda Triangle Theories Bermuda Triangle Theories The Bermuda triangle is a stretch over the Atlantic Ocean, measuring less than a thousand miles on any one side. The name 'Bermuda Triangle' remained a colloquial expression throughout the 1950s. By the early 1960s, it acquired the name 'The Devil's Triangle.' Bordered by Florida, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, the location became famous on account of the strange disappearance of ships, as well as aircrafts in the area. A number of supernatural explanations have been put forward with regard to the mysterious disappearances. Many probable logical explanations for the missing vessels include hurricanes, earthquakes, as well as magnetic fields, which render navigation devices worthless. However, most people do not like to accept such boring explanations and instead opt for more interesting options like alien abduction, giant squids, or getting sucked into another dimension. Supernatural theories Death Rays from Atlantis Rays from the magic crystals, left from the time of Atlantis, deep down in the sea are responsible for the strange sinking of ships. However, several underwater expeditions have revealed places under the ocean that look man- made, but no such crystals have been found. In fact, no real proof that Atlantis existed, has been ever found. UNIT-5MYSTERYMAIN COURSE BOOK 87 Sea monsters The presence of sea monsters was the most widely believed explanation especially in the earlier times, when their existence was believed to be true. Presence of a time warp People claim to be lost in the time warp while going through the region. Alien abductions The Bermuda Triangle is a collecting station from where aliens take our people, ships, planes and other objects back to their planet to study. Scientific Explanations Magnetic Compass According to the scientists in the US Navy, this area is one of the only two in the world, where a magnetic compass points to true north rather than magnetic north. This probably caused some navigators to go off course, which is very dangerous because many of the islands in 'The Triangle' have large areas of shallow water where vessels can run aground. They can also sink a long way down as some of the ocean's deepest trenches, from 19,000 to over 27,000 feet below sea level, are found here.UNIT-5MYSTERY88 MAIN COURSE BOOKUnpredictable weather Since the island is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, the weather is influenced by several factors and can change instantly. That means that at one moment, the weather is stable, and at another, it becomes extremely turbulent accompanied by strong currents of wind along with the hurricanes. Formation of methane in the sea. Methane can lower the density of water, leading to the sinking of ships. Similarly, methane can cut out an aircraft engine, leading to crashes. Bermuda Triangle Survivors These witnesses constitute a long list of pilots, sailors and fishermen. 1. It is interesting to note that Christopher Columbus was one such witness. He wrote in his memoir on how his compass acted strangely while sailing through the Bermuda Triangle. He, along with another shipmate, witnessed a glowing globe of light that seemed to hover over the sea. 2. It is said that when clouds or fog enter the Bermuda Triangle, strange things start happening. Such a phenomenon has been witnessed with the Philadelphia Experiment in which the USS Eldridge vanished and reappeared later, miles away, with some of the crew men warped into the hull of the ship. 3. In 1901, Anne Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain stepped into a mist and claimed to arrive at a time period before the French Revolution. It is said, that the mist and the ominous clouds might be the key to time travel or entering into other dimensions. 4. Even a great pilot like Charles Lindbergh, witnessed unusual events while flying in the reaches of the Bermuda Triangle. It is said that when he was making a nonstop flight from Havana to St. Louis, his magnetic compass started rotating. His Earthinductor-compass needle jumped back and forth erratically. This has now all been revealed in his autobiography.UNIT-5MYSTERY MAIN COURSE BOOK 895. Another eyewitness account is that of Bruce Gernon, who flew his plane, a Bonanza A36, into the Bermuda Triangle and encountered a non-threatening mile and a half long cloud. As he neared, the cloud seemed to come alive. It became huge and engulfed his plane. However, a tunnel opened up in the cloud and he went through this tunnel. It had cloud trails swirling around his plane. He also reported that while going into this tunnel, he experienced zero gravity and the only thing that kept him in the cockpit was his seatbelt. Whatever be the actual reason, there is an involvement of more than one factor behind the disappearances of ships and aircrafts in the Bermuda triangle region. The Bermuda triangle continues to evoke a lot of interest. Most people like to read about it. In fact, in the last few decades, the island of Bermuda has emerged as a major tourist destination as well; mainly due to its close proximity with the Bermuda Triangle. A.5.

There are puzzling stories, detective / crime stories, and suspense stories. They all give the reader a chance to become involved in the solution of the story through clues and character descriptions. Characters Before you start to write, think about the characters you might put in your story. *What will each character do? *Why is he or she important to the story? *In what ways are your characters alike? *How are they different? *What can your characters learn from each other? *One last thing to remember: your characters don't always have to be human. If an animal plays a part in the story, that animal is a character, too Setting A story has to happen in a place. *The setting might be a place you are familiar with. *It might even be another planet! *A setting doesn't even have to be a real place. Details *Use your imagination. *Details help readers understand how something looks, how it feels, how it sounds - even how something smells or tastes!UNIT-5MYSTERYMAIN COURSE BOOK 99Plot * Your characters have to DO something! * What they do is the plot of your story. * To make the plot exciting add situations. Ending * The ending of a story is the solution to the conflict. * Solve the problem, dilemma or conflict faced by the main character. * Show that your main character has changed or grown in some way. * Tie up all the loose ends. Readers shouldn't have to choose between several hinted endings. The problem escalates- characters try to find a solution (Climax) Think of a problem that the characters are likely to confront.

What was the motive behind the evil act? How was the act committed? Murder at Manor House Birlstone:January 6th Manor House - state of wild confusion and alarm - white faced servants - frightened butler - man horribly injured- terrible marks - we have no clues yet C.4. Dr. Wood, the capable general practitioner, has been requested to solve this case. He gathers information about the murder from the inmates of the house. The information is presented in two parts. Part A: Background story by Arthur Conan Doyle Part B: Conversation between Dr. Wood and Cecil Barker Part A Background Story The village of Birlstone is a small and very ancient cluster of half-timbered cottages on the northern border of the county of Sussex. For centuries, it had remained unchanged but its picturesque appearance has attracted well-to-do residents. A number of small shops have come into being to meet the wants of the increased population.UNIT-5MYSTERY102 MAIN COURSE BOOKAbout half a mile from the town, standing in an old park famous for its huge beech trees, was the ancient Manor House, with its many gables and its small diamond paned windows. The only approach to the house was over a drawbridge, the chains and windlass of which had been rusted and broken. The family consisted of only two individuals - John Douglas and his wife. Douglas was cheery and genial to all and had acquired great popularity among the villagers. He appeared to have plenty of money. Thus, it came about that John Douglas had, within five years, won himself quite a reputation in Birlstone. His wife was a beautiful woman, tall, dark and slender, younger than her husband; a disparity which seemed in no way to mar the contentment of their family life. It was remarked sometimes, that the confidence between the two did not appear to be complete. There were signs, sometimes, of some nerve strain upon the part of Mrs. Douglas. Cecil Barker was a frequent and welcome visitor at Manor House. Barker was an easy going, free handed gentleman. It was on Jan 6th at 11:45 that the alarm reached the small local police station that John Douglas had been murdered. Dr. Wood seemed to be unnerved and troubled. Part B Conversation between Dr. Wood and Cecil Barker Dr. Wood: We will touch nothing until my superiors arrive. ( He spoke in a hushed voice, staring at the dreadful head ) C Barker: Nothing has been touched until now. Dr. Wood: When did this happen? C Barker: It was just half-past eleven. I was sitting by the fire in my bedroom when I heard the gun shot. In thirty seconds, I was in the room. Dr. Wood: Was the door open? C. Barker: Yes, it was open. Poor Douglas was lying as you see him. UNIT-5MYSTERYMAIN COURSE BOOK 103Dr. Wood: Did you see anyone? C. Barker: No, I heard Mrs. Douglas coming down the stairs behind me, and I rushed out to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight. Dr. Wood: But I have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all night. C. Barker: Yes, it was up until I lowered it. Dr. Wood: Then, how could any murderer have got away? It is out of question! Mr Douglas must have shot himself. C. Barker: That was our first idea. But see! The diamond paned window is open to its full extent. Dr. Wood: I think someone stood there while trying to get out. C. Barker: You mean that someone waded across the moat? Dr. Wood: Exactly! C. Barker: I agree with you. Dr. Wood: But what I ask you is, how did he even get into the house at all if the bridge was up? C. Barker: Ah, that's the question. Dr. Wood: At what time was the bridge raised? C. Barker: It was nearly 6 o'clock. Dr. Wood: Then it comes to this, if anyone came from outside - if they did - they must have got in across the bridge before six and had been in hiding ever since. The man was waiting. He shot him, when he got the chance. - Adapted UNIT-5MYSTERY104 MAIN COURSE BOOKC.5. Answer the following questions by ticking the correct options. 1.

Here's a glimpse of a naughty child whose life is full of fun and frolic. 1. One of the reasons why Tom's mind had drifted away from its secret troubles was that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had struggled with his pride a few days and tried to \"whistle her down the wind,\" but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father's house all night and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she should die! There was distraction in the thought. Tom Sawyer no longer took an interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to try all manners of remedies on him. She was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all newfangled methods of producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in these things. When something fresh in this line came out, she was in a fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing, but on anybody else that came handy 2. She tried every remedy she could. Yet, notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the boy with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his capacity as she would a judge and filled him up every day with quack cure-alls. 3. Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase filled the old lady's heart with consternation. This indifference must be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first time. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. MAIN COURSE BOOK 111She dropped the water treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith on Pain-killer. She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again; for the 'indifference' was broken up. The boy could not have shown a wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him. 4. Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So, he thought over various plans for relief and finally hit upon that of professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he became a nuisance and his aunt ended up by telling him to help himself and quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting-room floor with it. 5. One day, Tom was in the act of dosing the crack, when his aunt's yellow cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously and begging for a taste. Tom said: \"Peter, now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there ain't anything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it, you mustn't blame anybody but your own self.\" 6. Tom pried his mouth open and poured down the Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next, he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then, he went tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time to see him throw a few double summersaults, deliver a final mighty hurrah, and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over her glasses; Tom lay on the floor, hysterical with laughter. summersaults : somersaults, a movement in which someone rolls or jumps forward or backward, so that their feet go over their head.UNIT-6CHILDREN112 MAIN COURSE BOOK\"Tom, what on earth ails that cat?\" \"I don't know, aunt,\" gasped the boy. 7. The old lady was bending down, Tom watching with interest, emphasized by anxiety. Too late, he divined her 'drift'. The handle of the telltale teaspoon was visible under the sofa. Aunt Polly took it, held it up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual handle - his ear - and cracked his head soundly with her thimble. \"Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?\" \"I'd done it out of pity for him - because he hadn't any aunt.\" \"Hadn't any aunt! - you numskull. What has that got to do with it?\" \"Heaps. Because if he'd had one, she'd have burnt him out herself! She'd have roasted his bowels out of him 'thout any more feeling than if he was a human!\" Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity. \"I know you were meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It would have done him good, too. I never see him get around so -\" A.2. On the basis of your reading of the extract, tick the most appropriate answer: a.

One student will read the story of Shravan Kumar and the second student will read the story of Narendra Kumar. After reading the story, each student will complete his or her half of the table in B.3. SHRAVAN KUMAR His day begins when most other people's day ends. Thirteen-year old Shravan Kumar works in a tea shop on Delhi's Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, where several newspaper offices are situated. His work begins around seven in the evening when he starts preparing samosas , coffee and tea. He carries them to several offices, does the dishes, and goes around collecting his money well into the night. Around six in the morning, when all the newspapers are despatched for distribution and the press employees return home, he prepares his food, takes a bath and goes to bed. Shravan is an orphan who came to Delhi from his village in search of work. His father kept a shop, but was tricked out of it by a deceitful uncle. Despair drove him to alcohol and gambling, and he died of a stroke soon after. Shravan worked in a tea shop in his village for a while. \"When I first began washing other people's cups and glasses,\" he recalls, \"I used to feel very bad, I would cry.\" Shravan moved to the more lucrative environs of Delhi, where his elder brother Shatrughan had preceded him. A job in a shop selling ice , was his first taste of big city life. His mother came to visit him in Delhi, but she fell ill and died soon after. \"That was two or three years ago. I don't remember exactly when,\" the little boy says. Soon, Shravan lost his first job. His employer still owes him Rs 500. Following a brief spell of unemployment and a short spell as an assistant at a car park, he joined the tea shop where he is presently employed. The ruthlessness and loneliness of the world has left him shattered. \"I think I am all alone in this world,\" he says despondently. Of the Rs 300 that he earns every month, he deposits Rs 200 in the bank. His bank balance stands at Rs 2000, he says proudly. Survival is his immediate aim but there is a larger objective towards which Shravan is working. He intends toUNIT-6CHILDREN116 MAIN COURSE BOOKretrieve the land that was mortgaged by his father. Already, Shravan and Shatrughan have paid back the loan of Rs 8000 - only the interest remains to be paid. Shravan was a dedicated lottery buyer at one time; until he realized that it was adding nothing to his income. The cinema remains a favourite form of entertainment - he even wakes up early to see the noon show. \"I have no friends here. Who keeps awake late at night and sleeps during the day? I miss my village. There, I used to play gully danda and marbles and I had a lot of friends. When I went to the village last year, I met them. They are still studying and playing games. I want to join them, but it is a question of survival for me.\" Sharvan's mother wanted him to own a big shop - \"like the one his father had owned,\" he says wistfully. He dreams of fulfilling her wish. He dreams of getting back their mortgaged land, and returning to the village for good, \"I like being in my village. I like the films and the glitter of Delhi, but I prefer the greenery, the trees, and the fields of my village.\" Maybe the grit and intelligence he has shown, alone and friendless, in facing a hostile world, will also win for him his heart's desire. NARENDRA KUMAR Narendra Kumar, a thirteen year old Kendriya Vidyalaya student, was interviewed by The Illustrated Weekly of India. Read what he says about himself. Interviewer: Hello, Narendra! Narendra: Hello! Interviewer: Congratulations, Narendra! I saw your photograph in the newspaper last week, when you won the Soviet Land Nehru Award for drawing and painting. Our readers are anxious to know more about you. Narendra: Thank you, Sir. I think I was just lucky to get the award. The competition is held every year in my school and a large number of students take part in it. Interviewer: That's good, very good. It's evident that your school encourages students to take part in various activities. Narendra: Oh yes! Our teachers - especially my Art teacher, Mr. V. Sinha - gives us a lot of encouragement. My parents have encouraged me a lot, too.UNIT-6CHILDRENMAIN COURSE BOOK 117Interviewer: When did you start painting? Narendra: When I was three, I was attending the Shishu Vihar Nursery School. My teacher gave me a picture of a big kite one day. The picture was beautiful and that very day I asked my father to buy me some crayons and drawing paper... Soon, my room was full of crayons and paper! I kept drawing whenever I found time. I now have a mini art room of my own at home! Interviewer: That's great, really great! Do you want to become an artist when you grow up? Narendra: No. Drawing and painting are just hobbies, which give me a great deal of pleasure. I want to become a police officer when I grow up. That's the only thing I've ever wanted to be. Interviewer: Is that because your father is a police officer? Narendra: Yes, maybe. I've been watching my father and other policemen for a very long time. I suppose I want to be like him! Interviewer: Do you feel you have the qualities that a good police officer needs? Narendra: Yes, I think so. A good police officer needs to be physically fit and mentally alert. I'm trying my best to grow into a healthy young man. I'm a member of the local sports club. I play tennis in the evenings and I also swim regularly. Interviewer: How do you find time for all these activities? Narendra: Well, I suppose I'm busy the whole day. Immediately after school I like to paint or play. I study before dinner and usually get to bed at about 10 o'clock. Interviewer: Thank you, Narendra. It's been good talking to you. We wish you success. Narendra: It's been a pleasure.UNIT-6CHILDREN118 MAIN COURSE BOOKB.3. Complete the table for the story you have read.

Our study of the time spent by students at the computer and studying at home in three countries has revealed some interesting facts. First, the majority of boys and girls in the age groups of 14-16 in these countries spend more time at the computer than studying at home. Children in these countries spend an average of 20-30 hours per week in comparison to 10-15 hours of studying at home. The only exception is Burland where girls spend more time studying at home than at the computer. Secondly it is evident that in all three countries, time spent at the computer is having a serious impact on the number of hours spent studying at home. In fact, the greater the number of hours spent at the computer, the fewer number ofUNIT-6CHILDREN124 MAIN COURSE BOOKhours are being spent studying. For example, boys in Burland spend an average of 32 hours at the computer while they spend about 8 hours studying at home. C.7.

Sixteen year old Shreya, a student of XI, angrily outbursts at her parents and says, \"No one likes me\". She has not been able to develop an interest in any activity, be it painting, swimming, games or studying. She is not sure what types of relationships give her comfort. She has never had a good friend. She is not clear about her choice of career. Shreya is good-looking, as well as physically healthy. During the interview, she was preoccupied with what others think about her. When asked to talk about her positive qualities, she thought for a long time but could not list any. Nor was she able to mention her negative aspects.UNIT-6CHILDRENMAIN COURSE BOOK 127SELF AWARENESS Knowing your strengths and weaknesses will help you succeed. Knowing our strengths helps us in acknowledging our success as well as appreciating our capacity to do something with or without support from others. This gives us a sense of well being and we are able to learn new skills and develop assets, thereby developing our confidence. Confident people attract friends and other stable relationships In due course, we are ready to accept various challenges with the right kind of investment of energy towards task completion. Knowing our weaknesses helps us in accepting our limitations, and developing a willingness to take help when offered and enabling us to overcome our deficits. This paves the way to expansion of skills and qualities, which prove useful in the long run. It is worthwhile to introspect and reflect so as to realise our potential. This helps to bring about a change in us and we are able to meet challenges. If Shreya had introspected or had been helped by her parents or teachers to reflect on herself, she would have understood her positive and negative qualities, her likes, dislikes, strengths, weaknesses, feelings, emotions, outlook, choices, values and attitude towards life. Self-awareness paves the way to progress with respect to relationships, academic success, professional and personal fulfillment.

He seems to be wasting all his pocket money on these meaningless CDs. He cannot even study without this noise. Though he is good at studies, I remain disturbed about this new obsession. There are all kinds of strange-looking posters on the walls of his study and he always wears those gaudy T-shirts and faded patched jeans. Also, he is very fond of junk-food. I fear he is breaking all links with our culture. What shall I do? A bewildered father junk-food = eatables like burgers, chaat papri, etc!UNIT-6CHILDREN132 MAIN COURSE BOOKDear Helpful Avanti I love film music and I have bought a lot of CDs from my pocket-money allowance. But whenever I switch on my CD-player, my father frowns and orders me to switch off the 'jarring noise'. He calls it 'cheap' and 'uncivilised' stuff. It is not that I do not like classical music, but when I am with my friends, we listen to film music. I like Indian clothes and food. But, I also like to wear western clothes and eat continental food occasionally. I do not like to disobey my parents, but I do not want to give up my music and other interests. What shall I do?

Congratulations on your achievements in the World Grand Prix Women's Chess Championship in Istanbul recently! Koneru Humpy: Thank you! This is my biggest win in the women's circuit. This is very significant, considering that it has come in an event which had three former world champions. Avik: Indeed! Please tell us something about yourself , Ma'am! Koneru Humpy: I was Pradesh on UNIT-7SPORTS AND GAMESMAIN COURSE BOOK 139March 31, 1987. I was originally named 'Hampi' (which means champion) by my father Mr Koneru Ashok, who later changed the spelling to Humpy, to give the name a Russian flavour. I write my family name, Koneru, before my given name, as is the convention with the Telugu speaking people. I started playing chess when I was 5 years old. Avik: Who introduced you to the game? Koneru Humpy: My father acquainted me with the game. He is also my first coach. I first showed interest at the age of 6 years when I watched him play a game and suggested a move. Indeed, it was the move that actually got me into the game. Avik: Your father left his teaching profession to make you a champion! Koneru Humpy: Yes, when I secured the 4th position in the Indian Under 8 Championship in 1995, he decided to leave his career and dedicate his time to me. Avik: And you had won four World Championships at a very early stage. Koneru Humpy: Yes, the 'World Girls under-10', 'World Girls under-14' and 'World Girls Junior Championships.' I acquired my IM title in 1999 and in May 2002, I achieved my 3rd GM Norms in Elekes Memorial Grandmaster tournament in Budapest. Avik: You held the record from 2002 to 2008 for the youngest woman ever to become a grandmaster! Koneru Humpy: Yes, I achieved it at the age of 15 years, 1 month, 27 days, beating Judit Polgar's previous record by 3 months which was later lost in the Women's World Chess Championship in 2008 to Hou Yifan. I won the World Junior Girls Chess Championship in 2001 and won the edition or North Urals Cup, the Women's Super Tournament held in Krasnoturinsk. In 2006, I participated in the Women's World Chess Championship, but my campaign had to end early in the second round. I played in the first board of Monte Carlo Chess Club and won the last two editions of the European Club Cup.UNIT-7SPORTS AND GAMES140 MAIN COURSE BOOKAvik: Have you also got some awards? Koneru Humpy: Yes, Arjuna Award in 2003, Padmashri Award in 2007 and Raja-Lakshmi Award in 2008. Avik: In India, many young chess players are ready to take a break in education and are fully focussed on chess preparations. What are your views? Koneru Humpy: I don't think that taking up chess as a career and completely neglecting studies is necessary at an early stage. After getting to a certain level in the game, they themselves should decide their preferences, i.e., whether to play seriously or not. Avik: What advice would you offer to parents of enthusiastic and talented young chess players? Koneru Humpy: Parents should not compel children to play chess. If children are genuinely interested in the game, they should encourage them. But, they shouldn't, be in a hurry to get results. UNIT-7SPORTS AND GAMESMAIN COURSE BOOK 141Avik: How often do you exercise? Do you think daily physical exercise can help a chess player to cope with the pressure and increase the brain's ability to concentrate? Koneru Humpy: I spend around one hour per day on physical exercise. Exercise is a must for every chess player. As the proverb says, 'a sound mind can only exist in a sound body'. Exercise has a lot of impact on the brain. Avik: Thank you for talking to me and giving me your valuable advice. Koneru Humpy: Thank you! by: ...............................................................................................

Substantiate. A.5. Know all about Chess. Read and enjoy: You now know a little about Koneru Humpy, the chess player, but do you know how to play chess? Let's learn more about it: Have you ever played chess? Did you know that chess is the oldest skill game in the world? But chess is more than just a game of skill. It can tell you much about the way people lived in medieval times in Europe. If you look at the way a chess board is set up, then study the pieces and how they are used, you will realise that chess is a history of medieval times in miniature. The six different chess pieces on the board represent a cross section of medieval life with its many ceremonies, grandeur, and wars. UNIT-7SPORTS AND GAMES144 MAIN COURSE BOOKChess was played many centuries ago in China, India, and Persia. No one really knows for sure in which country it originated. Then, in the eighth century, armies of Arabs known as Moors invaded Persia. The Moors learned chess from the Persians. When the Moors later invaded Spain, the soldiers brought the game of chess with them. Soon, the Spanish were playing chess, too. From Spain, the popularity of chess quickly spread throughout all of Europe. Europeans gave chess pieces the names we know today; they probably had trouble pronouncing and spelling the Persian names, so they modernized them to reflect the way they lived. Today, the names certainly aren't modern but a thousand years ago they represented the very way in which both ordinary people and persons of rank lived their lives. The pawns on the chess board represent serfs or labourers. There are more of them than any other piece on the board, and often they are sacrificed to save the more valuable pieces. In medieval times, serfs were considered no more than the property of landowners or chattels. Life was brutally hard for serfs during this era of history. They worked hard and died young. They were often left unprotected while wars raged around them. They could be traded, used as a diversion, or even sacrificed to allow the landowners to escape harm. UNIT-7SPORTS AND GAMESMAIN COURSE BOOK 145The castle piece on a chess board is the home, or the refuge, just as it was a home in medieval times. In Chess, each side has two castles, or rooks, as they are sometimes called. The knight on a chess board represents the professional soldier or the knight of medieval times whose job it was to protect persons of rank, and there are two of them per side in a game of chess. Knights in a game of chess are more important than pawns, but less important than bishops, kings or queens. Their purpose in the game of chess is to protect the more important pieces, and they can be sacrificed to save those pieces just as pawns can. There is a bishop in the game of chess who represents the church. The Church was a rich and mighty force in medieval times, and religion played a large part in every person's life. It is no wonder that a figure that represented the concept of religion found its way into the game. A bishop was the name for a priest in the Catholic church who had risen through the ranks to a more powerful position. In the game of chess, there are two bishops for each side. The queen is the only piece on the board during a chess game that represents a woman, and she is the most powerful piece of the game. The king is the tallest piece on the board, and is defended on the chessboard as well as he was defended in medieval life. In medieval times, the surrender of the king would mean the loss of the kingdom to invading armies and that could mean change for the worse. It was to everyone's UNIT-7SPORTS AND GAMES146 MAIN COURSE BOOKadvantage, from the Lowest serf to the highest-ranking official, to keep the King safe from harm. The King is the most important, but not the most powerful piece in chess. If you do not protect your king, you lose the game. The next time you set up your chessboard and get ready to play a friendly game or two, think of chess as a history lesson. The pieces on the board represent a way of life that is no more, and the real life dramas that occurred in medieval times are now only a game. A.6.

Read and enjoy: Hockey Do you know when hockey was first played? Research in Ethiopia has discovered that it has been around for more than four millenia. A tablet in Greece has images of young people playing field hockey. Even in South America, Ireland, Egypt, Scotland and Rome, there are proofs and records of this game. The game in these countries was no different than the other even though it was known by different names. Hundreds of years ago, this game was known as 'Hockie' in Ireland and it is this name that has stuck with the game ever since. While current field hockey appeared in the mid-18th century in England, primarily in schools, it was not until the first half of the 19th century that it became firmly established. Prior to 1980, women were not permitted to take part in this game. The first club was created in 1849 at Blackheath in south-east London. During the 1600s and 1700s, hockey in England was a little dissimilar and it was more disorganised. People from all over the village would take part in the game. It was not unusual for a team to have 60 - 100 players. It was the goal of the team players to get the ball into the common ground of the rival team. This game required quite a few days to finish. Many players suffered injuries. Even though umpires were present, they were not allowed to say anything without the team members' request. Ultimately, good judgment prevailed. Firm regulations were introduced. In England, a headmaster restricted the number of players to thirty for one single team. During the 1860s, England's Eton College laid down some rules for the game. Additional rules were introduced after the formation of the Hockey Association in the year 1875. UNIT-7SPORTS AND GAMES152 MAIN COURSE BOOKFootball Football refers to a number of similar team sports, all of which involve (to varying degrees) kicking a ball with the foot in an attempt to score a goal. People from around the world have played games which involved kicking and / or carrying a ball since ancient times. However, most of the modern codes of football have their origins in England. The most popular of these sports worldwide is association football, more commonly known as just 'Football' or 'Soccer'. It is widely considered to be the most popular sport in the world. C.2. Form pairs - one student will read the text for 'Hockey', and the second student will read the text for 'Football'. Hockey The game was first played during the Olympics in the year 1908. At present, all the countries have hockey teams that participate in the World Cup, the Champion's Trophy and of course, the Olympics. Field hockey is the national sport of India and Pakistan. Hockey is one of the sports in which two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre a ball, or a hard, round, rubber or heavy plastic disc called a puck into the opponents' net or goal using a hockey stick. An official hockey ball is spherical, with a circumference between 224 and 235 millimetres. It should weigh between 156 and 163 grams. It may be made of any material, but should be hard, smooth and white in colour. Modern field hockey sticks are J-shaped and constructed of a composite of wood, glass fibre or carbon fibre (sometimes both) and have a curved hook at the playing end, a flat surface on the playing side and a curved surface on the rear side. UNIT-7SPORTS AND GAMESMAIN COURSE BOOK 153Now, the game is played between two teams. Each team consists of 11 players including the goal keeper. In the beginning, the captains of both the teams toss for the choice of ends. The duration of the game is divided into two periods of thirty-five minutes each with a break in between. At halftime, the team changes their ends. The hockey playground is rectangular in shape. It is 100 yards long and 60 yards wide. The longer boundary lines are called the side lines and the shorter ones are called goal lines. All lines are three inches wide throughout. At each end is a goal 2.14 m high and 3.66m wide and an approximately semi-circular area 14.63m from the goal, known as the shooting circle or 'D'or penalty area. A spot 0.15m in diameter, called the penalty spot is placed inside the 'D'. The game starts when the umpire blows his whistle for the opening pass back. The passback is made at the centre of the field to start the game (also after half-time and after each goal is scored). The ball, which may be pushed or hit, must not be directed over the centre line. All players of the opposing team must stand at least 5 yards from the ball and all players of both teams, other than the player making the pass-back must be in their own half of the field. There are two umpires to control the game and to administer the rules. These umpires are the sole judges of the game. The umpires are responsible for keeping time for the duration of the game. Penalties - A free hit is awarded for any foul committed outside the penalty area or when the ball is hit out of the playing area. A penalty corner is awarded if, within the penalty area, a foul is committed or the ball is hit outside his goal-line. A penalty stroke is given when a foul is intentionally committed in the circle. It is hit from the penalty spot with only the goal keeper defending the goal post. Cards are shown for rough or dangerous play, misconduct or intentional offences. The umpire issues an official warning to a player by showing the green card. Prior to that, the player would probably have been given a verbal warning. A yellow card means that the player will be off the UNIT-7SPORTS AND GAMES154 MAIN COURSE BOOKpitch for five minutes or more. A red card is given for more serious offences and sees the player leave the match for good. Each team is permitted to substitute any number of players during the game. A player who has been substituted may re-enter the field of play as a substitute for another player. The goal keeper is permitted to use pads, kickers, gauntlet, gloves and masks, body protection, elbow pads and headgear which is a full helmet incorporating fixed full face protection and cover for all of the head including back. Football It is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players, each using a spherical ball which is a round, leather-covered, inflated rubber bladder 27-28 inches in circumference and 397-454 grams in weight. The game is played within a clearly defined area on a rectangular grass or artificial turf with a goal in the centre of each of the short ends. The objective of the game is to score by driving the ball into the opponent's goal. The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to use their hands or arms to propel the ball; the rest of the team usually use their feet to kick the ball into position, occasionally using their body or head to intercept a ball in mid-air. The only time the players are allowed to use their hands is in case of a throw in, when the ball has gone outside the side lines. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra-time and / or a penalty shoot-out. In a typical game play, players attempt to create goal scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a team-mate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when the play is stopped by the referee. UNIT-7SPORTS AND GAMESMAIN COURSE BOOK 155Football takes place on a standard football field. All football fields, professional, college, and high school, are the same size and have the same basic markings. The length of the pitch for international adult matches is in the range of 100-110 m and the width is in the range of 64-75 m. The longer boundary lines are touchlines, while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are goal lines. A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws. In front of each goal is an area known as the penalty area. This is a rectangular area, 40.2m wide that extends 16.5m into the field where the goalkeeper operates. A standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. A team can substitute upto maximum three players anytime during the match. The game is controlled by a referee who is the official timekeeper for the match, and who may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. There are also two linesmen who guard the touchlines or sidelines, signalling when the ball crosses the boundary lines. The referee, alone, signals the end of the match. Handling the ball deliberately, pushing or tripping an opponent, or hitting a player from behind are examples of fouls, punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick. The referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution (yellow card) or send-off (red card). A player who is given a yellow card is said to have been 'booked'. Penalty Cards * Yellow - Warning card for dangerous play. A second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card, and therefore to a sending-off. * Red - Serious misconduct resulting in ejection from the game. If a player has been sent off, no substitute can be brought in his place.UNIT-7SPORTS AND GAMES156 MAIN COURSE BOOKC.3.

Listen to it and fill up the details that follow. Speech by Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam - The teacher will read out the text. Students will complete the details as they listen to the speech by Dr.APJ Abdul Kalam. I have three visions for India. In 3,000 years of our history, people from all over the world have come and invaded us, captured our lands and conquered our minds. Right from Alexander onwards, the Greeks, the Turks, the Mughals, the Portuguese, the British, the French, the Dutch, all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. Yet we have not done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture, their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them. Why? It is because we respect the freedom of others. That is why my first vision is that of FREEDOM. I believe that India got its first vision of this in 1857 when we started the war of independence. It is this freedom that we must protect and nurture and build on. If we are not free, no one will respect us. My second vision for India is Development. For fifty years, we have been a developing nation. It is time we see ourselves as a developed nation. We are among the top 5 nations of the world in terms of GDP. We have a 10 per cent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling. Our achievements are being globally recognized today. Yet, we lack the self-confidence to see ourselves as a developed nation, self-reliant and self-assured. Isn't this incorrect? I have a third vision India must stand up to the world. Because I believe that unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Only strength respects strength. We must be strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must go hand-in-hand. My good fortune was to have worked with three great minds, Dr. Vikram Sarabhai of the Department of Space, ProfessorANNEXURE160 MAIN COURSE BOOKSatish Dhawan, who succeeded him and Dr. Brahm Prakash, father of nuclear material. I was lucky to have worked with all three of them closely and consider this as the greatest opportunity of my life. I have seen four milestones in my career: One: In the twenty years I spent in ISRO, I was given the opportunity to be the Project Director for India's first satellite launch vehicle, SLV3. It is the one that launched Rohini. These years played a very important role in my life as a scientist. Two: After my ISRO years, I joined DRDO and got a chance to be a part of India's missile programme. It was my second bliss when Agni met its mission requirements in 1994. Three: The Department of Atomic Energy and DRDO had this tremendous partnership in the recent nuclear tests on May 11 and 13. This was the third bliss. The joy of participating with my team in these nuclear tests and proving to the world that India can make it, that we are no longer a developing nation but one of them made me feel very proud as an Indian. The fact that we have now developed, for Agni, a re-entry structure, for which we have developed this new material (a very light material called carbon-carbon) makes me very proud. Four: One day an orthopedic surgeon from Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences visited my laboratory. He lifted the material and found it so light that he took me to his hospital and showed me his patients. There were these little girls and boys with heavy metallic callipers weighing over three kg each, dragging their feet around. He said to me, \"Please remove the pain of my patients.\" In three weeks, we made floor reaction Orthosis 300 gram calipers and took them to the Orthopedic centre. The children didn't believe their eyes. From dragging around a three kg. load on their legs, they could now move around! Their parents had tears in their eyes. That was my fourth bliss!... We are such a great nation. We have so many amazing success stories but we refuse to acknowledge them. Why? We are the first in milk production. We are number one in Remote Sensing Satellites. We are the second largest producer of rice. Look at Dr. Sudarshan! He has transformed a tribal village into a self-sustaining, self-driving unit. There are millions of such achievements.ANNEXUREMAIN COURSE BOOK 161B. A BURGLARY ATTEMPT B.3. A teacher/ Student can read out an interview between a police inspector who is in-charge of the case, the house-keeper, Ms. Lakshmi and the watchman, Ram Singh. As you listen, note down the details of the burglar. Students complete the notes while listening to the interview - Inspector: Hello, madam! I am Inspector Maan Singh. I am in-charge of the burglary case which occurred in the flat of your employer, Mr. Ravikant. It must have been a harrowing experience for you. Lakshmi: Yes, it was a terrible experience. People like that should be locked up in a prison. Inspector: If you will cooperate with us, we will catch them in no time. Were you alone in the apartment at that time? Lakshmi: Yes, it was 11:30 in the night and I was alone as my master and his wife had left for Shimla. Inspector: How do you think the burglar gained entry into the house? Lakshmi: He might have come through the balcony and entered my room. Inspector: Now tell me something about his physique. What about his build? How tall was he? Lakshmi: He was about 6 ft tall. Inspector: What about his physique? Lakshmi: He was not thin. He was well-built and rather plump. Inspector: What about his dress? What was he wearing? Lakshmi: I think his clothes were rather old and faded. He was wearing a black shirt which was faded. Inspector: Do you remember the colour of his trousers? Lakshmi: They were of a dark shade -either black or blue. Inspector: Can you tell me something about his face?ANNEXURE162 MAIN COURSE BOOKLakshmi: Unfortunately no. When he entered my room, I panicked. But then I gathered courage and screamed and tried to run away. But I was a bit late. He struck me with a staff and I really don't remember anything after that. May be I was knocked out. Later on, I came to know that he broke into the bedroom and ran off with the jewellery. But Ram Singh, the watchman, who tried to catch him may be able to describe him better. Inspector: Ok, Lakshmi, thank you! If I need your help, I will come again. You may have to identify the burglar. Now, I will speak to Ram Singh. Inspector to Ram Singh: Ram Singh, you were on duty and you tried to catch the burglar. You may be able to give a good description of him. First, tell me about his hair. Ram Singh: He had straight black hair. Inspector: What about the shape of his face and his complexion? Ram Singh: He had an oval face with grey eyes and I think he had a dark complexion. Inspector: Did he wear spectacles? Ram Singh: Yes, with a plastic frame and his nose was rather sharp. Inspector: What else can you remember about him? What about his teeth and lips? Ram Singh: His lips were quite thick. Inspector: Is there anything else that you remember about him? Ram Singh: When I heard some noise from inside, I ran in. I tried to stop the burglar and we had a scuffle. During the struggle, I noticed that he had six fingers on his right hand. But he managed to run away and made his escape on a motor bike. Inspector: Thank you Ram Singh! We will make sketches on the basis of your description and nab him.ANNEXUREMAIN COURSE BOOK 163UNIT-2 : Adventure B. THE SOUND OF THE SHELL B.1 Listen to the first part and answer the two questions you are asked. Then, listen to the rest and answer the following questions: Background to be told to students AFTER they have completed B.I. \"The Sound of the Shell\" is an adapted extract from the novel 'Lord of the Flies', written by William Golding. A nuclear war has broken out in Europe. A school in England has been evacuated by an airplane so the students can be taken to an unknown destination. While flying over a tropical region, the plane is shot down and it bursts into flames , but the body of the plane containing the passengers falls to earth safely. A few boys (Ralph, Jack, Roger, Simon, Piggy and others) manage to scramble out. They have landed on an unnamed island which has coral reefs, beaches, caves and fruit trees. The novel tells their story. The teacher reads and stops after questions 1 and 2. Then the teacher reads further. Students answer questions (a) - (g) individually in writing, then have a class review. Script Narrator: The boy with light hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way towards the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead with sweat. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken tree-trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upward with a witch-like cry. This cry was echoed by another, ... Piggy: Hi! Wait a minute! Wait a minute - I got caught up. I can hardly move with these creeper things, (PAUSE)ANNEXURE164 MAIN COURSE BOOKVoice -Before we continue with the story, here are two questions for you to answer: 1. Where do you think the boys are at the moment? (repeat) 2. What do you think has happened to them? (repeat) The teacher must pause while the class tries to answer these questions. When they have done so, start the tape again. Narrator: The two boys scrambled out of the undergrowth into an open area. Ralph: This is an island. At least, I think it's an island. That's the reef out there in the sea. Perhaps, there aren't any grown-ups anywhere. Piggy: Aren't there any grown-ups at don't think so. Piggy: That pilot ... Ralph: He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn't land here - not in a plane with wheels. Piggy: We were attacked! Ralph: He'll be back all right. Piggy: When we were coming down, I looked through one of the windows. I saw the other part of the plane. There were flames coming out of it. Ralph: What happened to it? Where's it got to now? Piggy: The storm dragged it out to sea. It wasn't half dangerous with all the tree trunks falling. There must have been some kids still in it. (PAUSE) What's your name? Ralph: Ralph. (PAUSE) I expect there's a lot more of us scattered about. You haven't seen any others, have you? SOUND FX: SOMEONE TRIPPING OVER A BRANCH AND COMING DOWN WITH A CRASH Piggy : We've got to find the others. We've got to do something. Narrator: Suddenly, Ralph spotted something of a creamy colour, lying among the ferny weeds of the lagoon.ANNEXUREMAIN COURSE BOOK 165Ralph: What's that? Piggy: A stone. Ralph: No, a shell. Piggy: That's right, it's a shell. I've seen one like that before - on someone's back wall. A 'conch', he called it. He used to blow it and then his mum would come. It's so valuable. Narrator: Ralph had an idea. He tore out the stem of a palm leaf and began to poke about in the water with it, pushing the shell across the weeds till it rose, and Piggy could make a grab for it. Ralph took the shell from Piggy and shook the sand out of it. Piggy: Ralph! We can use this to call the others, then have a meeting. They'll come when they hear us. Ralph: How did your friend blow the conch? Piggy: He kind of spat. My aunt wouldn't let me blow it on account of my asthma. He said you blow it from down here - from your diaphragm. Narrator: Doubtfully, Ralph laid the small end of the shell against his mouth and blew. At first, it emitted only a faint sound of air rushing out. Then Ralph blew harder, and immediately the thing made a sound. SOUND FX: CONCH BLOWING, BIRDS, SOMETHING SQUEALING IN THE WOODS Ralph: Gosh! Piggy: Bet you can hear that for miles. SOUND FX: MORE BLASTS FROM THE CONCH Piggy: Here's one. What's your name? Johnny: Johnny Narrator: Ralph continued blowing the conch in growing excitement. Signs of life were now visible on the beach, as boys made their way from different directions towards the sound of the shell. Slowly, they crossed the hot sand - some naked and carrying their clothes, others half-dressed.ANNEXURE166 MAIN COURSE BOOKEven while he was blowing the conch, Ralph noticed a pair of young boys who reached the platform in front of a fluttering patch of black. These were twins who flung themselves down and lay grinning and panting. Piggy could be heard repeating their names... Piggy: Sam, Eric. You're Sam, and you're Eric, Sam, Eric. Narrator: Meanwhile, something dark seemed to be fumbling along the diamond haze of the beach. Ralph saw it first, and watched till the intensity of his gaze drew all eyes that way. Then the creature stepped from the mirage on to clear sand. It was a party of boys marching approximately in step in two parallel lines. When they were about ten yards from the platform, Jack (their leader) shouted an order and they halted. He came forward and said ... Jack: Where's the man with the trumpet? Ralph: There's no man with a trumpet. Only me. Jack: Isn't there a ship, then? Isn't there a man here? Ralph: No... We're having a meeting. Come and join us ...ANNEXUREMAIN COURSE BOOK 167UNIT-3: Environment B. SAVE MOTHER EARTH B.1 Listen carefully to your teacher reading the 'Meet the personality of the month programme' and fill in the details as you listen. Hello! Listeners, this is your favourite environment channel- 'Our World' and I'm your host, Anil Musafir. Today, we bring you two famous personalities who will be talking to you about the serious threat to the Ganges and the environment being caused by the tanneries of Kanpur. If you are concerned about Kanpur, you are requested to tune in and listen. At the end of the talk, you may ask questions. You can contact us at this number: 22831496.. Let me present Dr. Manu Srivastav, a prominent citizen of Kanpur who has been conducting research on the harmful effects of the tanneries on Kanpur Environment. Dr. Manu Srivastav: Srivastav: Anil, let me inform you that Kanpur has about 400 tanneries and over the years the environment of Kanpur has been seriously affected. These tanneries release at least 250 million litres of waste water into the Ganges on a daily basis. This waste water contains animal remains and chemicals like arsenic, cadmium, mercury and chrome. These chemicals have resulted in drastic reduction of the fish population and are also responsible for the weeds that are choking the Ganges. Moreover, the smoke arising from the factories has brought about increased levels of pollution. The air in and around Kanpur is no longer pure. Host: What are the efforts that have been taken by the authorities to prevent these toxins from contaminating our environment? Dr. Manu Srivastav: Though there is a sewage treatment plant that has been set up to treat tannery sewage, this does not always work. As a result, the water is contaminated by Chromium and the drinking water may no longer beANNEXURE168 MAIN COURSE BOOKsafe. Close to the city's source point from where water is sucked from the river are slaughter houses and burning ghats where the dead are cremated . This makes water unsafe for us. Water animals are feeling the effect of this pollution. Farmers are also feeling the brunt of this contamination because the crops are failing. Recurrent illnesses have compounded their burdens and miseries. We, the concerned citizens of Kanpur have to fight to save the Ganges and our beloved Kanpur. Host: Thank you, Dr. Manu Srivastav. I am sure that knowledge of the harmful effects of tanneries and their toxic waste will force citizens to demand more action. And now, I welcome a well-known human rights activist, Ms. Shraddha Shankar, who has been actively spearheading the project of 'Save the children of Kanpur.' Ms. Shraddha Shankar: Hello friends! I am grateful that I have been given an opportunity to address you and convey the gravity of the situation. Host: Ms. Shankar, what are your concerns regarding the youth of Kanpur? Ms. Shraddha Shankar: The future of a large number of children living in Kanpur is at stake. Thousands of them are working in the tanneries and are being exposed to serious risks. Host: What risk do these children face? Why do they work in the tanneries despite laws prohibiting child labour? Ms. Shraddha Shankar: A lot of them are there because of their abject poverty. This makes them open to exploitation. Their health is affected due to the working condition of these tanneries and the smoke coming from the factories. Moreover, they are drinking water which is not safe. These child labourers are deprived of the basic facilities of education and they miss out on the joy of childhood. Their parents do not realize that by sending them to these factories they are ruining their future prospects. As concerned fellow human beings, we have to fight for the cause of these child labourers. We have to counsel the parents and suggest an alternative solution to them. Moreover, we have to spearhead an agitation against the unscrupulous factory owners. We need your constructive support for the 'Bachpan Bachao Andolan'. Come, let us join hands and pledge support for the cause. Host: Thank you!ANNEXUREMAIN COURSE BOOK 169C. SAVE THE TIGER C.8. Listen to the extract read by your teacher on Tigers and as you listen, complete the summary given below by filling the blanks. Save Tigers The price of human greed is being paid by yet another animal species - the Tiger. Today, the tiger population is getting depleted at an alarming rate. According to a recent survey, a tiger is being poached everyday. If the present state of affairs is allowed to continue, the next generation will not get to see the majestic animal even in the zoo. It is high time that action is taken to protect and conserve the tigers in order to maintain the ecological balance. Stringent laws against poachers must be enforced. It has been over 40 years since the tiger became our national animal. As a result, the species ought to be protected. Ironically, they are closer to extinction now than ever before. Children, scientists, conservationists, NGOs and institutions in India and world wide have put their heart and soul into trying to save the tiger. Yet, there is little we all have been able to do. The responsibility and the power of protection lies with the government, specifically the forest department. Let us not forget that if we destroy nature, ultimately we will be destroyed ourselves. Tiger, an apex predator is an indicator of our ecosystem's health. Saving the tiger means we save the forest, since the tiger cannot live in places where trees have vanished, and this way it secures food and water for all. Tigers are now an endangered species. Today, there are about 5000 to 7,400 of them left in the world. Three types of tigers - The Bali, Javan and Caspian tigers have become extinct. The two reasons why tigers are endangered are: Loss of habitat and illegal killing. Illegal Killing One of the most concerning threat s to our national animal that needs to be recognised is poaching. Tigers are killed to make rugs and coats out of their skins.ANNEXURE170 MAIN COURSE BOOKIn many Asian cultures, medicines made from the tiger's organs are believed to cure diseases. Habitat Loss Forests where tigers live are cut by humans for farming, building houses and roads. This leads to tigers becoming homeless and without any food. Since other animals also die when forests are cut, it leads to tigers becoming weak and this leads to their death. Project Tiger Project Tiger is a wildlife conservation project initiated in India in 1972 to protect the Bengal Tigers. It was launched on April 1, 1973 and has become one of the most successful wild life conservation ventures. The project aims at Tiger conservation in specially constituted Tiger reserves representative of various biogeographical regions throughout India. It strives to maintain a viable conservation based on tiger population in their natural environment. Project Tiger was Indira Gandhi's pet project. The main achievements of this project are excellent recovery of the habitat and consequent increase in the tiger population in the reserve areas, from a mere 268 in 7 reserves in 1972 to above one thousand in 28 reserves in 2006. Tigers can be considered as the indicator of the integrity of the eco system as they are at top of the food chain. They can be found in a wide range of habitats, from the evergreen and monsoon forests of the Indo-Malayan realm to the mixed coniferous - deciduous woodlands of the Far east Russia and the mangrove swamps of the Sundarbans, shared by India and Bangladesh. Tigers are mostly nocturnal but in the northern part of its range, the Siberian sub-species may also be active during the day in winters. All wild tigers live in Asia, others live in the humid jungles of Sumatra. The body length is 140 - 280 cm and the tail length is 60 to 95 cm. The upper part of the animal ranges from reddish orange to ochre and the under parts are whitish. The body has a series of black stripes of black to dark grey colour.ANNEXUREMAIN COURSE BOOK 171UNIT-4 : Class IX Video/Radio show Project: A - THE CLASS IX RADIO SHOW A.1 First, you will listen to a local radio programme which will give you ideas for your own programme.

Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh - mind, I can't tell yeh everthin', It's a great myst'ry, parts of it...' (Hagrid pauses for a moment. Sound of chair being dragged). It begins, I suppose, with - with a person called - but it's incredible yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows- Harry Potter: Who? Hagrid : Well - I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does. Harry Potter: Why not? Hagrid: Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse than worse. His name was.... (Hagrid gulps but no word comes out).ANNEXURE176 MAIN COURSE BOOKHarry Potter: Could you write it down? Hagrid: (in a whisper) Nah - can't spell it. All right - Voldemort. (shudders) Don' make me say it again. Anyway, this - this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em, too - some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o' his power, \"cause he was gettin' himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn't know who to trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches.. Terrible things happened. He was takin' over.' Course, some stood up to him - an' he killed\" em. Horribly. One o' the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway. Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew. Head Boy an' Girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before... probably knew they were too close to Dumbledore to want anythin' to do with the Dark Side. Maybe thought he could persuade 'em.. maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Hallowe'en ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came to yer house an' - an' -' (Blows nose with a sound like a foghorn). Sorry. But it's that sad - knew yer mum an'dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find - anyway\"You-Know-Who\" killed 'em. An' then - an' this is the real myst'ry of the thing - he tried to kill you, too. Wanted to make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That's what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh - took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even - but it didn't work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided to kill' em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the best witches an' wizards of the age - the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts - an' your parents Harry.MAIN COURSE BOOK 177UNIT 6 : Children C. CHILDREN AND COMPUTERS C.4 Now listen to two speakers debating on the topic, 'School Uniforms Should Be Banned'. Two students can be designated for this task. Debate Motion : School Uniforms Should Be Banned Respected Chairperson and Members of the Jury, a very good morning to you all! Today, I, Manish stand before you to express my views in support of the motion, School Uniforms should be banned. While some of my friends may like having a uniform as it removes the pressure to keep up with the latest fashions, and it removes the barrier between the classes and it shows pride in the school, I feel that abolishing uniform allows a freedom of expression. I think school uniforms are not a very good idea because they do not allow students the freedom to choose what they want to wear. Why must students wear the same thing every day and not express themselves in the clothing they wear? Everyone should enjoy and love how they look and choose what they want to wear to school. Thus, a uniform is not a good thing because it takes away our personality and our identity. All pupils wear the same clothes and submit to regimentation as in the Army. Moreover, the uniform can be quite expensive for parents and can be a prohibitive expense for families, especially those struggling to make both ends meet or those with more than one child in school. In many cases, purchasing one school uniform is insufficient, as students will need multiple uniforms to wear throughout the week as well as separate uniforms suitable for different types of weather. While government schools supply uniforms for free, debate has resulted regarding whether the number of uniforms supplied is enough or whether the quality is satisfactory. My worthy opponent just pointed out that school uniforms create equality among students. While uniforms undeniably create some equality among students, they also give pupils the wrong idea. Uniforms teach children that whenever they face diversity, the solution is to simply make everyone the same. This is a178 MAIN COURSE BOOKproblem, especially since some differences, like race or size, cannot be changed. School uniforms should be banned because they give students the wrong idea. My friend just pointed out that school uniforms level the playing field and reduce bullying. However, I do not agree with her. Not all school uniforms are flattering to every body type. In all likelihood, the selected uniform will not fit well on every pupil in the student population. Overweight and even underweight students may hear taunting and harassing comments made by their peers because of their ill-fitting uniforms. Also, students who may have faced bullying continue to face the wrath of their tormentors, despite how they look in their uniforms, as bullies always find ways to harass their victims. Students who aren't able to explore their own personalities and express themselves as individuals, which occurs when wearing a uniform, may have their growth inhibited as they enter young adulthood. Despite the best efforts of educators to promote an inclusive environment for all students, cliques can be found in many schools. Regardless of their negative reputations, cliques allow students to express themselves and find acceptance within their individual peer groups. Having students wear uniforms may prevent students from forming peer relationships that are crucial to social development. Friends, with this I would like to conclude my case. I repeat once again, most forcefully, that school uniforms must be banned. AGAINST In some countries like India, the U.K., Japan, Hong Kong, and several African countries, school uniforms are worn in almost every school. In other countries, like the United States, France and Germany, school uniforms are only worn in a few schools. However, in these countries, too, the general opinion is changing. Both France and Germany have recently considered bringing school uniforms back, and in the U.S.A. the percentage of public schools in which children wear a uniform has increased from 11.8 in 1999-2000 to 17.5 in 2007-2008. On the other hand, some schools in the U.K. have got rid of school uniforms. This trend shows the need for wearing school uniforms. Respected Chairperson, Members of the Jury and my dear friends, I, Shweta stand before you to oppose the motion \"School Uniforms should be banned.\"ANNEXUREMAIN COURSE BOOK 179I strongly feel school uniforms should not be banned because in a country like India, where some people cannot afford many clothes, especially as trends change, it is better for students to wear a school uniform as they don't have to look for clothes to wear daily or worry about being teased because they don't have any fashionable clothes. Uniforms have take away this pressure because everyone is wearing the same clothing. Friends, think of all economically challenged families who spend money on giving their child a good education. Do they really need their less fortunate children to be teased and bullied by the more fortunate ones in school for their clothes that reveal their parent's economic status? Uniforms help to make all the students equal. Uniforms definitely shouldn't be abolished because they encourage discipline and make the wearer take pride in his/ her alma mater. The level of a student's academic achievement and their behaviour both in and out of school is reflected in their appearance. Pride in wearing the uniform of their school indicates a pride in their school as a whole, and shows that the individual is able to integrate and contribute to the whole social group. A study conducted in the United States of America by Gentile and Imberman found that test scores for elementary school students dramatically increased after uniform adoption. Scores somewhat increased for the higher grades too. The study went on to say that when students are wearing uniforms, they tend to behave better and disrupt the classroom less. Requiring uniforms also opens a venue for rewarding good behaviour. A teacher or the entire school can have a T-shirt day as a reward. Uniforms potentially make schools safer. Unauthorized visitors are easy to spot. Gangs cannot instigate fights by wearing their gang colors or insignia. Thefts may decrease because students can no longer wear expensive clothing items. Thus, I can safely conclude that there seem to be more benefits than drawbacks of the use of school uniforms. The evidence of less peer pressure, higher grades and more participation in extracurricular activities seem to outweigh any possible problems, like lack of individual choice of clothing that may arise. Schools should also address that when the students enter the adult world, they will need to look past the fact that not everyone will be dressed like them, and they will have to form a sense of community anyway.ANNEXURE180 MAIN COURSE BOOKE.
