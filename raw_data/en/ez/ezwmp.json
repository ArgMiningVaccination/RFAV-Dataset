Our nurses, physicians and staff understand how stressful the hospitalization of a child can be, and we are here to support your family in every way possible. Our medical expertise is profound; we also know that you are the real expert when it comes to your child. We will partner with you to ensure that your child receives excellent care, and that you and the rest of your family are comfortable, informed and included in all facets of your child's experience. Family Advocates whose own child has received medical care at Hasbro Children's Hospital are on staff to partner with patients, families, and hospital staff, and to bring the family experience and perspective into every area of the hospital. For your convenience, we offer a breakfast cart for parents, serving coffee and pastries. The Ronald McDonald Room on our fourth floor, the Izzy Family Room on the fifth floor and the Dunkin' Family Room on the sixth floor can provide you with additional refreshments, computers, a place to do laundry, or simply a quiet refuge for you to relax or rest, while never being far from your child.For entertainment, education and information to help ease your stay, the Get Well Network system in your child's room provides access to practical health and hospital information; movies, games, and television. This is an interactive system; we hope you will use the prompts and surveys to provide feedback so we can best meet your family's needs. We also have a full-service cafeteria as well as a coffee shop, ATM, and gift shop. Each patient room has a chair or couch that converts to a bed, if you wish to remain with your child 24 hours a day. If you know your child's stay will be an extended one, we can make a referral for lodging at the nearby Ronald McDonald House of Providence. We are happy to assist you with referrals to other services within Lifespan. If there is anything you would like to discuss during your stay or if you have immediate concerns that need to be addressed, please let a staff member know. You may also call one of us directly at 401-444-5581. We thank you for entrusting your child's care to Hasbro Children's Hospital.

We are the only Level 1 pediatric trauma center in the region. A private, not-for-profit institution, Hasbro Children's Hospital is the pediatric division of Rhode Island Hospital and part of the Lifespan health care system. Your Child's Stay We encourage you to be honest with your child about their stay in the hospital. Let your child know that you will be there whenever you can and that the hospital staff is kind and caring. To reassure your child, you can also talk about some of the fun, everyday activities available at the hospital, including the playrooms, games, arts and crafts, and special programs. We understand your desire to be with your child, and we encourage your participation in your child's care. Parents are welcome to stay with their child 24 hours a day. The patient's room accommodates one parent at night. We will provide a pillow and linens for the chair or couch that converts to a single bed. Visitation Rules Please scan the QR code to read the latest information on visitation to the hospital. Visitors are Welcome Parents are not considered visitors; you are part of your child's care team. Other family members and friends generally are welcome to visit daily. Patient/Parent Bracelets To ensure your child's safety, we ask that you wear an identification badge and/or bracelet at all times during the hospital stay. This bracelet and badge contains important information and must not be removed until your child leaves the hospital. The bracelet must be scanned for your child to receive medications. We may need to gently wake your child during the night to scan the bracelet before giving medication. Every patient's decision-making parent or legal guardian must wear a blue identification bracelet. For your child's protection, you will be asked to provide the last two digits of his or her medical record number, located on your bracelet, before any information about your child can be given over the telephone. If are visiting the hospital after hours, you will need to enter through the emergency department and show your bracelet to security staff, who will admit you. All other doors will be locked. Please wear your blue identification bracelet until your child leaves the hospital. Visitor Badges It is important to wear your visitor badge during your entire stay. Hasbro Children's Hospital requires that all visitors wear the provided ID badge while visiting any area within the hospital. When visitors arrive, we ask they contact the parent/guardian in the room. The parent/guardian will meet the visitors at the locked door, and accompany them to the child's room. In certain circumstances, visitors may use the phone outside the unit to contact the nurses' station and ask to be admitted. Using the Get Well Network The televisions at Hasbro Children's Hospital can do more than provide a diversion. We use the Get Well Network to provide education, entertainment, links to services, and more.

Please ask a care team provider if you need help. General Pediatric Units Hasbro 4, Hasbro 5, and Hasbro 6 At Hasbro Children's Hospital, the floors are divided into three \"pods\" - A, B & C. Each pod has eight rooms with a nursing station at the center, allowing nurses to have a clear view into each room. Nurses are always available to you and your child. There are well-stocked playrooms on the floors, staffed at different times by child life specialists. Each unit is locked to ensure our patients' safety. Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) contains all private rooms, located around a central nursing station. Glass walls allow nursing staff to see all patients, though curtains can be drawn to allow privacy for children and parents.If your child is in the PICU, one parent is welcome to stay overnight, and we provide bedside sleeping accommodations. If for some reason you are unable to stay and you would like to designate another adult caregiver to stay with your child, please ask your nurse for details. The PICU family room is just inside the main PICU entrance doors. The lounge includes a kitchenette, bathroom and shower. To request entrance into the PICU, please use the telephone located on the right side of the double doors. Be prepared to show your visitor badge upon entering the unit. Various medical professionals will care for your child in the PICU. Under the leadership of the attending physician, daily rounds take place, during which the health care team members from the nursing, respiratory therapy, nutrition, case management, social work, child life, and physical ther - apy departments work together to develop a plan of care for your child. You are encouraged to participate in the rounds to the extent you feel comfortable. 3 2 Pediatric Medical-Psychiatric Unit Hasbro 6 Our pediatric medical psychiatric unit is a 16-bed inpatient unit treating psychiatric patients, ages 12 to 17 years, who also have medical diagnoses. The interdisciplinary team consists of both psychiatric and pediatric specialists. This unit offers a structured program which includes individual, group, and family therapy, as well as many other therapeutic activities which enhance social skills and provide opportunities for your child to communicate his or her needs on an emotional level. This unit has special visiting hours. You will be given a handbook with specific details about the unit when your child is admitted. Medications While your child is in the hospital, please do not give your child any medication, not even medication that they had been taking at home, including prescriptions, over- the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal remedies. All medicine taken in the hospital is prescribed by your child's doctor, prepared by registered pharmacists, and administered by our nursing staff.Personal Items We will provide pajamas, slipper socks, and toiletries for your child. If your child feels more comfortable with their own personal items, you may bring them. We encourage you to bring a favorite blanket, stuffed animal, doll or other special possession for your child. These reminders of home are very comforting to children. YOUR CHILD'S HEALTH CARE TEAM All the members of our team - physicians, nurses, therapists, and other staff members - are committed to patient- and family-centered care. You are your child's best advocate. We welcome your participation and questions and encourage you to partner with us in caring for your child. It is also important to us to make sure that all of your child's needs are taken into consideration while in our care (i.e. they have fears, are sensitive to tags, bright light or loud sounds...) There are several team members you and your child may meet during a hospitalization. The following are brief descriptions of our team members. Attending Physician (MD) is the doctor who will lead your child's healthcare team, decide on necessary tests and coordinate a treatment plan with other team members. Resident and Fellow Physicians (MD) will also care for your child. Residents are physicians who have graduated from medical school and are receiving post graduate train - ing. Fellows are board certified pediatricians in training as specialists. Residents are directly responsible for the day- to-day care of patients, under the supervision of attending physicians. On duty 24 hours a day, residents are always available to answer questions concerning your child's care. Registered Nurses (RN) provide your child's daily care, and ensure your child's comfort, safety and well-being. Among many other duties, your child's nurse assesses and monitors his or her condition, checks your child's vital signs, administers medications, answers questions and provides patient and family education. Nurse Practitioners (NP) have completed advanced nursing training in specific areas of pediatrics and are supervised by physicians. Nurse practitioners help your child's physician with physical examinations and procedures, and also conduct assessments and order medications and treatments. Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSW) are an integral part of the multidisciplinary teams here at Hasbro Children's Hospital. They assist children and families in multiple ways, including assessing areas of need and providing resources, identifying barriers and stressors associated with patient wellness, and ensuring empathetic and equitable patient care within their programs. Social workers help families cope with difficult situations, such as medical crises and adjust - ment to illness; emotional and psychological distress; loss and bereavement; and the impact of abuse and trauma. Certified Child Life Specialists (CCLS) offer therapeutic play, preparation for procedures, education to reduce fear, anxiety, and pain and work in partnership with families and the healthcare team to meet the psychosocial, emotional, and developmental needs of infants, children, and adolescents. Family Advocates are parents whose children have received medical care here at Hasbro Children's Hospital. In this peer support role, they partner with families and hospital staff to help enhance the patient and family experience. They offer hospital and community resources and facilitate our Family Advisory Council to bring the family perspective into every area of the hospital. Respiratory Therapists (RT) evaluate and treat children with breathing disorders. They manage therapy to help your child recover lung function. They are able to administer medications in aerosol form to assist with breathing problems and help support respiratory functions.Registered Dieticians (RD) watch for changes in your child's appetite and weight and take care of special nutrition needs for food allergies, medical diet prescriptions, tube/ formula feedings and other conditions. Dieticians also pro - vide nutritional counseling and education. Physical Therapists (PT) work with your child to help improve strength and endurance, and regain mobility so that your child may be safely discharged from the hospital. The goal is to help your child function independently at home, school and in the community. Occupational Therapists (OT) work with your child on everyday activities such as dressing, feeding and participat - ing in school and play activities. They also help your child progress toward age-appropriate developmental milestones. Speech-Language Pathologists (SLP) work with children of all ages, including infants, who have difficulties in the areas of communication and feeding/swallowing due to injury, illness, or developmental delays. Speech-language pathologists can improve a child's understanding of language, help a child speak clearly, and help a child better express wants and needs. 5 4Hospital School Teacher is an experienced professional certified by the State of Rhode Island, who may maintain contact with your child's school and will present material appropriate to your child's academic needs during hospital - ization. The teacher provides group classes and individual sessions for students in Grades 6-12. Patient Care Attendants (PCA) are members of the treat- ment team whose role is to monitor patients for safety. They interact with patients to maintain safety but they do not provide physical care of the patient. PCAs usually sit with patients that are admitted to the medical units while await - ing admission to a psychiatric setting. Pediatric Behavioral Interventionists (PBI) are members of the care team whose role is to work with patients with be - havioral and mental health issues. PBIs create a therapeutic environment for patients through the use of coping skills building, developing therapeutic relationships with their pa - tients, and creating a safe space for healing to begin. Mental health workers will support your child in creating a therapeutic environment on the pediatric medical-psychiat - ric unit. Mental health workers facilitate therapeutic activities in groups and partner with the interdisciplinary team in the treatment of your child.Many others will contribute to your child's stay, including the unit secretary, who facilitates unit functioning; the unit assistant, who delivers your food tray or linens; the nutrition hospitality associate, who can help you and your child with menu selections; the housekeeper, who maintains a clean environment during your hospital stay; and the transporter, who will take you and your child for tests, procedures and other places you need to go in the hospital. Students from The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and from schools for nursing, respiratory therapy, physical therapy and others may observe or help care for your child under an instructor's supervision. Healing Arts The Healing Arts program at Hasbro Children's Hospital is an integral part of patient care and treatment. Creativity, in the form of art making, music, dance, writing and performance, has been shown to reduce fear, anxiety and nervousness in individuals receiving medical treatment. The creative process is a powerful healing modality, treat - ing mind, body and spirit, while fostering deep relaxation and the reduction of pain perception. The arts transform consciousness by shifting focus from bodily sensation and thoughts of limitation to the limitless arena of imagination. Weekly programming and services available by request as schedule permits. Meals Hasbro Children's Hospital offers the Treat Yourself Room Service Program. A host will provide you with a menu to select breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Hosts will visit daily to obtain meal selections for each meal.

Here are some helpful tips for ensuring a safe experience for your child's stay. 1. You are your child's best advocate. Feel comfortable asking questions or raising safety concerns. Write down any questions that you may have and share them with your nurse or bring them to the team during rounds. 2. Share unique details about your child. Things that you recognize about or do naturally for your child, may be helpful for the care team to know. We want to make sure that all of your child's needs are taken into consideration, while in our care. 3. Wash and ensure that we wash also. \"Please Foam In & Foam Out\" - our way of saying please wash your hands when entering and exiting the hospital, your room, the bathroom or any treatment areas. Also, since you are part of the health care team, do not be afraid to remind anyone working with your child to wash their hands before treatment begins. 4. Watch for changes in your child. Again, as an important part of the health care team, you know your child best. Please report any changes you notice in your child's symptoms, skin or overall appearance. 5. Know your medications. The health care team will check your child's identification band before giving any medication. If you don't see this, please ask staff to double check that the medications are for your child. Ask for the names of the medications your child is receiving in the hospital and how they are expected to help. 6. Be prepared when going home. It is helpful to arrange a ride when you are made aware of your child's discharge. Early planning helps to make the transition to home easier for you and your child. Also, it's important to ask what you can expect once at home: Is there anything you should look for that may require you to contact your child's doctor, and which doctor to call if questions come up. You might say: I have a few questions; would you mind answering them for me? You might say: Excuse me, I like to be sure everyone's hands are clean, did you \"foam in\"? You might say: Hmmm? I'm not familiar with that medication, can you tell me a little about it?Notes:Lifespan now uses LifeChart, an electronic health record system that gives you access to your own medical information and enables private communication with your physicians.
