Acupuncture Aesthetics Cosmetic acupuncture is the method of applying needles to achieve benefits of circulation, detoxification, and more efficient repair. It is different than regular acupuncture because the needles only penetrate 3mm deep! At this depth, we target the dermal layer: the elastin and collagen matrix just beneath the skin. Cosmetic Acupuncture focuses more on lifting, firming, and tightening skin, as well as reducing inflammation and increasing collagen production. Both methods are based on Chinese Medicine principles of moving Qi and blood and stimulating facial meridians. Cosmetic Acupuncture takes 6-10 treatments to achieve lasting results. Many people find benefit in an additional single treatment as maintenance when seasons change or before an event.

Acupuncture Aesthetic Services Consider pairing Cosmetic Acupuncture with [Bio-Injections](https://rebelmednw.com/aesthetics/bio-injections/) or [Micro-Needling](https://rebelmednw.com/aesthetics/microneedling/)/ [Nano-Needling](https://rebelmednw.com/aesthetics/nano-needling/). Bio-injections help infuse resources into the dermal matrix while the Cosmetic Acupuncture tells the body how to use those resources in the form of a controlled inflammation process. With Micro-Needling, you are not penetrating as deep of a layer. Micro-needling is a comprehensive exfoliation method that helps to reveal new skin to the surface. Nano-needling is even finer and more superficial. For best results, consult with a provider to come up with a plan for your specific skin, constitution, and age. [Bio-Injections](https://rebelmednw.com/aesthetics/bio-injections/) When paired with Cosmetic Acupuncture, this treatment is as close to botox as a natural treatment can get! Instead of botulinum, we use homeopathics and herbs to help support skin detoxification and reconstruction. Micro-Needling / Nano-Needling As a deep \"resurfacing\" type of treatment, [Micro](https://rebelmednw.com/aesthetics/microneedling/) & [Nano](https://rebelmednw.com/aesthetics/nano-needling/)-Needling is a comprehensive exfoliation process. Apple-stem cells are paired with Hyaluronic Acid and Chinese Medicine herbs to create specialized serums for each client depending on their needs. Our skin absorbs the stem cells and nutrients from the herbs and utilizes these resources in its repair and reconstruction process. Cosmetic Cupping & Guasha As a popular Add-On, Cosmetic Cupping and Guasha are ancient massage techniques that stimulate circulation and help release muscle tension. When applied to the face, it generally helps to round out your skincare regimen at Rebel Med NW. If you get your own set of tools, our providers can teach you tips and techniques for giving yourself an at-home facial massage.

Find Your Zen with Cosmetic Needling Are there any side effects to Cosmetic Acupuncture? There are minimal risks and side effects associated with cosmetic acupuncture because the needle does not insert as deep as with traditional acupuncture. The main side effect that might be experienced is bruising and this is minimized by the use of refined needling technique and Arnica gel. In fact, many side effects of cosmetic acupuncture, much like conventional acupuncture, are actually positive! The beauty of cosmetic acupuncture is that you're becoming healthier from the inside out because every treatment comes with internal constitutional balancing based on traditional Chinese medicine principles because, in Chinese medicine, the only way to get healthier is from the inside out. You will get a protocol of acupuncture, nutrition advice and support, and lifestyle advice and support according to your level of health and your health and beauty goals. "}
