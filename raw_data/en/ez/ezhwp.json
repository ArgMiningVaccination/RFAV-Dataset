The C ontinued on page 1 0 _________The AIDS Policy Center at George Washington University issued a survey last week on state funding of AIDS programs. It showed that states spent $495 million on AIDS in fiscal 1989, up about $200 million fix)m the previous year. States paid an average of 51% of program costs, the federal government paid 47%, and 2% came from private corporations and foundations. Only ten states spent their own money on research with California heading the pack at $18 million. The next closest state was Massachusetts, which spent a distant $462,000 on AIDS research. New York, which has the highest number of AIDS cases, spent a meager $88,000 on research. The Center for Disease Control reports 102,621 AIDS cases nation\u00ad wide, with an estimated 1.5 million infected with the virus. Since the federal government is picking up much of the tab on research, states have been burdened with the cost of AIDS education, hospice care, and treat\u00ad ment. However, many states are not picking up their fair share of costs and many legislatures are struggling to find money for AIDS in already tight budgets. North Carolina is a prime example of a state that has not responded properly to the AIDS epidemic. Even though there were two task force reports on the epidemic, one from the governor and another from the legislature, there was no additional state money allocated to fight AIDS in 1989. Gov. James Martin, a moderate Republican, appointed a to k force of his own department heads, that recommended $13.5 million over the next two years. Included was money for AIDS education, case management, hospice care, residency programs, and money to purchase anti-retroviral drugs for the needy. The governor ended up recommen\u00ad ding nothing for AIDS and instead declared October AIDS Awareness Month. The governor did not even go ahead with his own task force recommendation on anti-discrimination laws, but David Jones, of the North Carolina AIDS Services Coalition, said that they did manage to lobby the legislature \" to enact anti-discrimination laws (\u00bbvering hous\u00ad ing, employment, public transportation and accommodations, etc., that will take effect on October 1st.\" David Jolly, the manager of the State Department of Enrivonment, Health, and Natural Resources, told theSentinel that \" it's a tough year fiscally in North Carolina. Money is tied up in the construction of new j prisons and roads, so there's not much money left over for soci^ pro\u00ad grams .... we did manage to get an additional $294,000 in additional revenue for AIDS for fiscal 1990, bringing the State's total to $700,000.\" David Jones countered, \" It's a lie! I realize he has to answer like that, but that $294,000 comes from indirect federal cost receipts designed to bear the costs of overhead. It is not an appropriation of state money.\" North Carolina ranks 19th in AIDS cases, but is 39th in state spending, with most of their money coming from the CDC, which pro\u00ad vides North Carolina with $1.4 million to fund the AIDS Control Pro\u00ad gram.

Decker says that the estimated half million signatures he needs to put the measure on the ballot could be easily gotten if every AIDS organization in the state solicited 1,000 signatures. As for getting the measure to pass, he says that people \" will see four words: 'AIDSInstead, gay leaders in Northern California declined to campmgn for the \" AIDS Research Tax Credit Initiative Statute,\" saying that it would take too much time, money and effort to even get it on the ballot, let alone launch a statewide campaign to pass it. The proposal would give state in\u00ad come tax credit for voluntary contribu\u00ad tions by individuals ($25), trusts and estates ($5,000), and corporations ($10,000), to an AIDS Research Fund. A board would be set up to solicit and distribute the revenues. The measure is not new. In 1987, a similar measure was passed by the California legislature, but vetoed by Governor Deukmejian. A coalition then tried to qualify it for the 1988 ballot and failed. But many of the people who attempt- I ed to qualify it in 1988, including some of the biggest names in California gay politics, turned down sponsor Bruce Decker's request for support in this latest drive and expressed skepticism that it could succeed. They say that q u ailin g the initiative for the ballot would take $5(X),000, and getting it to pass would cost another $2 to $5 million. But Bruce Decker, the Los Angeles activist behind the in\u00ad itiative, says the cost will be negligible.sibilhy for gathering the signatures, Boneberg points out that most AIDS groups are not political organizations, and besides \"they are already swamped trying to meet the commitments they have now.\" Brandy Moore, chair of the San Francisco Black Coalition on AIDS, sees little hope for the initiative. \" It's a great idea, I support the concept,\" he says, \" but it's almost September and there's little information in northern California. I don't even see the gay and lesbian community going for it.\" Dana Van Gorder, who is organizing the 1990 AIDS conference and was in\u00ad volved in the last drive to get an AIDS research tax credit on the ballot, said \"There didn't seem to be much en\u00ad thusiasm for it then, and there doesn't seem to be now.\" Besides, he says, \"in the end, there's a question of how much money will be generated.\" Van Gorder is also reluctant to take on the governor and the California Republican party, which he predicts would oppose the measure, making it even more expensive to pass. Some of the negative response to the campaign seems to stem from the way Decker has been running it. Boneberg said that Decker waited until too late to involve AIDS organizations. \" If you want to do something for a group, in-T V e To Be M onitored GALPAC Opens Orange County Chapter b y Tim Sam uels GALPAC, the Gay and Lesbian Politkal Awareness Committee, will open its second chapter in Orange Coonty this fal.

As for AIDS groups taking respon-volve them,\" Boneberg said. \" (Decker) was repeatedly urged not to proceed without a consensus, and he did.\" Even though gay leaders say they do not support the initiative, they say they do not oppose it.

That group is current\u00ad ly fighting the repeal of an anti- discrimination law at the local level in Irvine.

According to L ^dini, \"we would like to see moregay; as well as the hiring of more minorities. \"Both chapters of GALPAC plan to integrate their activities, rather than function as separate entities. Lou Sheldon maintains his residence in Orange County, but makes frequent ap\u00ad pearances in the Contra Costa area and press.This month he was quoted in the Contra Ckista Times as saying that GALPAC was coming into Orange County because the gays in the region were \" so incompetent.\" Said Ken Stanley, \" Sheldon has ad\u00ad mitted that we are the major thorn in his . side here in the East Bay.

The first point was won when the Santa Ana City Conncil refused to buckle under fundamentalist iwessnre to stop this weekend's Gay Pride Festival at Centennial Parit, the first in conservative OrangeCoonty. The second point was won just lastweek, when activists picketed the Anaheim home of the Rev. Lou Sheldon, the right-wing political lob\u00ad byist who heads the hyper-conservative Traditional Values Coalition. Some 80 activists organized by the Orange County Visibility League demonstrated peacefully for about 45 minutes in front of Sheldon's home Aug. 26, even gamering moral support from some of Sheldon's neighbors. \" We encountered no harassment at all from neighbors,\" said activist Bill Hein. \" Most of them feel that while Sheldon has been a good neighbor, he had no right to enact this campaign against us.\"Among the more amusing chants to emerge from the protest was \"Two, four, six, eight, Sheldon should redecorate,\" Hein said. Sheldon ap\u00ad parently was not home during the demonstration. Meanwhile, festival organizers say everything is running on schedule. Janet Avery, president of Orange County Cultural Pride, Inc., the non-profit group sponsoring the event, said the group has sold some 40 booth spaces, which was their initial goal. Festival security, a long-standing worry of local lesbian and gay residenLs, also should pose no prob\u00adlems, according to Avery and the San\u00ad ta Ana Police Department.Santa Ana Poice Lieutenant Bob Helton said he anticipates no violence, either from fundamentalist agitators or from local youth gangs. \" We have contingency plans available in case of any eventuality,\" Helton said. Helton declined to com\u00ad ment when asked how many police of\u00ad ficers will be on hand for the event and what security measures will be taken. \" We don't publish the resources we have available,\" he said. The festival and parade will take place entirely vrithin Centennial Park, located at Fairview and Edinger Streets in Santa Ana. The parade is scheduled for noon on Sunday. The two couples selected to serve as grand marshalls areGates open both days at 10 a.m. Entertainment kicks off both days at 10:30 a.m. and includes such per\u00ad formers as Monica Palacios, Romanov- sky and Phillips, Monica Grant, the Laurie Williams Band, Love That Dares, John McKinly, Deidre McCalla and others.Admission is $10 per day for tickets purchased at the gate and $7.50 per day presale.Avery anticipates a more extensive festival next year. Citing inexperience as its greatest weakness, Avery is quick to acknowledge her group has suffered from numerous organizational prob\u00ad lems.By next year, however, the festival *'We encounter no harrassm ent a t a ll fro m neighbors.

Stil dogging Orange County Cultural Pride is outright opposition from moreestablished county lesbian and gay ac\u00ad tivists, and from older organizations, Avery said. Some activists fighting to save the sexual orientation clause in the Irvine Human Rights Ordinance believe the festival and Orange County Cultural Pride will detract from their efforts and adversely affect public opinion, Avery said.\" 1 don't see any point in having a Human Rights ordinance and then pretending you don't exist,\" Avery said. She added that \" some egos on the part of our community's establishment have been bruised.\" Despite the event's admittedly modest proportions, Avery urged peo\u00ad ple to attend, saying, \"This is history.\" The Sentinel California's Only Statewide Gay Newsweekly POLITICS\\ \\ i: ( , r A R A V IT K T H K LO\\H F.ST P R K I S O N 1 1 T O N S ANT) FR A M E S Reconciliation with R om e S o u ^ Dignity Enters Post-Sexual Era b y Steve Warren 1)ollowing six years of work concerning sexual ethics, Pat Roche, the newly-elected president of Dignity/USA, feds it's time for the organization to move on to other issues. He outlined a five-point agenda after his election at Dignity's Ninth Biennial Convention, held last week in San Francisco: the need for special Church Domestic Partnen ordinance of the City and County of San Francisco.\" It en ministries to persons wtih AIDS and a compassionate perspective by all Catholics on the AIDS crisis; 2) the need for strenuous opposi\u00ad tion in Catholic pulpits, schools and homes to violence against gays and les\u00ad bians;3) the need for the Church to remove barriers to women's full par\u00ad ticipation in the Church; 4) the need for consistent Church support for laws protecting the basic human rights of gays and lesbians; and 5) tne need for Church respect for individual consciences of all persons and the r i^ t to dissent. In line with these principles, the governing House of Delegates p a ^ a number of motions, to rn broadly worded ones endorsing those concepts to the more specific calls for a \" memorial to all Dignity members who have died, jespecially] those who have died of AIDS\" ; and aimual Eucharistic celebrations \"for the observance of women's contributions, concerns and feminist issues\" and \"in recognition of women's gifts and their contributions to the Roman Catholic Church.\" The convention also adopted unanimously a resolution supporting \" legislation recognizing the legal status of domestic partners. . such as thecouraged Dignity chapters to develop and practice their own rituals to bless non-traditional unions. \" I think people go to church mainly for rituals,\" outgoing president lim Bussen said. His home chapter in Chicago recently held a blessing for couples within the group, while others have created their own variations on the marriage ceremony. Two San Franciscans were dected with the Seattle-based Roche, incum\u00ad bent Beth Gorman as vice president and Sophie Miranda as treasurer. Also elected was Michael Flynn of Philaddphia, secretary. The convention's House of Dd^ates unanimously accepted the report of the Task Force on Sexual Ethics, which should forever dispd cliches of Catholic guilt and myths of celibacy among les\u00ad bian and gay Catholics. It was based on interviews, discussion, grass-roots input and an admittedly unscientific survey in which, according to Bussen, \" \u00ab\u00bfity percent of respondents said they were sexually active and 90 percent of those said they fed good about it.\" The organization's voting body was also unanimous in agreeing to add to its official Statement of Position and Pur\u00ad pose a sentence from a resolution ap-proved at the 1987 convention in Miami Beach: \" We affirm that gay and lesbian people can express their sexuality physically in a unitive manner that is loving, life giving a life affirming.\" The House of Ddegates approved \" A Call from Dignity/USA to AU Our Sisters and Brothers in Faith,\" which calls for dialogue and an attempt at reconciliation between Dignity and the Roman Catholic church. It reads in part:\" Come, let us sit before the Lord. Let us reconcile one with the other. Let us heed the Lord's caU for mutual love. Let us create a climate in whidi we might better hear the truths each of us has to share in a dialogue for understanding; the truth our God longs to speak to us this day. Let us recognize and uproot prejudice and injustice, especially within our church.

The president-elect said he hoped the situa\u00ad tion could be more like those of Reagan and Gorbachev or Begin and Sadat who, because they were human, could find issues they apeed on to bridge their differences and help them deal with more difficult questions. \" Twenty years ago,\" Roche said, \" I wouldn't have believed there would ever be an official ministry to gay and les\u00ad bian Catholics in any archdiocese in this country.\" Such ministries have been establi^ed in some areas in an at\u00ad tempt to force ttgnity out, but they are meeting the needs of some lesbian and gay Catholics who are afraid to step away from the established church. Although a few Dignity chapters still meet in Catholic churches and most still have priests celebrating mass for them\u2014in spite of being forbidden by Rome to do so\u2014the organization as a whole is further from the church than ever. Father John McNeill, who was ex\u00ad pelled from the Jesuits two years agobecause of his ministry to gays, spoke informally at the convention about Dignity forming its own parishes as other groups have done which could not conform to official edicts, such as those who continue to say mass in Latin. This year's convention theme was \" Twenty Years o f Dignity: A Pilgrimage of Hope,\" and the more than 600 registrants spent much of their time in a structured processing of the past to help find a direction for the future. \" In looking back over the past 20 years,\" Roche said, \" we saw where the spirit has led us\u2014from a small group attending home liturgies in San Diego to one of the five largest gay and lesb ian o rg a n iz a tio n s in the country . . . \" Between 1983 in Seattle and 1989 in San Francisco, Dignity went from the cathedral on the hill James Cathedral, where Dignity hdd a mass during the Seattle conventron] to the Cathedral Hill Hotel [the San Francisco convention site].

Supreme C o v t. The case, C m a n v. Cruzan, wBl consider whether the constitutional right of privacy indndes the right to dte. The case is considered one of the most important cases before the Court this term because of its potential impact on a broad range of constitutional privacy issues, including the right to abortion. \" The Supreme Court has already delivered a crushing blow to the sexual privacy rights of gay and lesbian Americans,\" said attorney Benjamin Schatz, Director of National Giqf R i^ ts Advocates' AIDS Qvil R i^ts Project. \" We cannot allow the Court to further erode our privicy rights by tak\u00ad ing away our right to medical privacy as well. The right to medical privacy is particularly crucial for persons with HW d is e ^ because it encompasses such important concerns as access to treatments and freedom from forced testing,\" Schatz added. NGRA filed its brief in the case in\u00ad volving Nancy Cruzan, a 31-year-old Missouri woman who sustained devastating injuries following an automobile accident six years ago. She is described as being in a \" state of per\u00ad sistent vegetation.\" Nancy's family and friends have maintained that she would not want to be kept alive under these conditions.Nonetheless the state supreme court, citing a Missouri anti-abortion law, rul\u00ad ed that the state's \" policy strongly favoring life\" outweighed Nancy's right to die by discontinuing artificial life support. The A m erican Academ y of Neurology has urged the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the Missouri dedsion. This is the first time that the Supreme Court, after four previous requests, has agreed to hear a case involving an in\u00ad dividual's right to terminate extraor\u00ad dinary medical life support. \" Tiiis case has obvious implications for people with AIDS and their loved ones who may have to make similar decisions,\" said NGRA Executive Director Jean O 'Leary. \" The need for gay persons to make decision regard\u00ad ing medical life support requires an ex\u00ad panded definition of the family which includes gay families and life parmers,\" she added.Machine Politics b y M ichael Colbruno y There is something rather strange occuring in the gay community reg a ^ n g the upcoming vote on the stadium in San Francisco. The entire gay leadership has bowed down to kiss the ass of Mayor Art Agnos and enthusiastkaOy back him on his stadium proposition, yet 1 cannot find a handful of non\u00ad activist gays who support the new ballpark. A recent Target Research Poll show\u00ad ed that only 41% of San Franciscans support the new ballpark. 1 remain firmly undecided on the issue and therefore hope that I can objectively raise a few questions. 1 personally love the Giants and seldom go a week without attending a game, unless they're on the road. I also think that Bob Lurie is a wonderfully progressive team owner and applaud him for his support of domestic partners and his $5,000 check to get the campaign off the ground. But, 1 must confess, that 1 I voted against the last stadium proposi\u00ad tion because I resented Lurie's \" vote my way, or I'll move the team attitude,\" and 1 know that I was joined 1 by many others. I also question linking I domestic partners and the stadium, as Lurie and Agnos seem intent on doing. Voten are smarter than politicians give them credit for, and will decide each issue on their own. Agnos knows he has gay voters in his clutch and is using the gay machine to get grassroots support for his beloved ballpark by linking it to domestic partners. Meanwhile, he con\u00ad tinues to woo the business community and the more conservative west of Twin Peaks voters with the stadium. Doesn't this reek of machine politics, ala Richard Daley?1 also think that there is another message being sent to Lurie and Agnos: traffic in San Francisco sucks, why build a downtown stadium near the crowded financial district and the already backed-up bridge? 1 really believe that the mayor is being a little selfish in wanting the sUdium in San Francisco, which he may be surprised to learn does not sit on the Equator, and no place in its borders is it much warmer, or less windy, than the Stick. San Francisco is already tight on real estate, and perhaps a lot of people just don't want a big ballpark blocking their view of cormorants and Navy planes flying in perfect harmony over the bay. 1 I admit that the Stick is awful for baseball. It was clearly designed for football, the foul ball area is much too large and the swirling winds can make a Gold Glover look like a little leaguer. An option I still like is building a stadium outside of the city. The majori\u00ad ty of the fan base has been proven to be outside of the city, so why should we give up the revenue and the land? Santa Q ara is not a bad drive and a good Giants-Dodgers game would be a great excuse to \" get out of the city\" for a day. Teams do not have to play in the city that they're named for. The Dallas Cowboys play in Irving, the New England Patriots in Foxboro, and The New York Giants in New Jersey! 1 In all honesty. I'd love a Fenway Park in San Francisco. It would indeed be a boon to business and would look great against the skyline, however I don't think the citizenry and Mother Nature feel the same way. Agnos needs to be realistic and spend his energy solv\u00ad ing traffic congestion and parking prob\u00ad lems. Mr. Lurie needs to realize that the San Francisco Giants can remain just that, even in the balmy ' burbs. Doo-Uttie, Doo-Wrong, Doo Wah Doo W ih /knti-gay Republican State SenatorJohn Doolittle, a candidate for in\u00ad surance commissioner, who in the best tradition of William Dannemeyer, Jesse Helms, and the Third Reich introduced SCR 65, which urged the Governor to reject his own AIDS panel's recommen- dmions, continues to move ahead with the resolution. The Sentinel learned that with bipartisan blessings he has continued to put heat on the already \" poor on AIDS issues\" Governor Deukmejian. Doolittle's primary objections to the recom m endations were condom distribution in prisons, needle exchange for drug abusers, and AIDS education. He also wanted to add mandatory AIDS testing to the recommendations. 1 was shocked by the bipartisan support that Doo-Doo had for SCR 65 and decided to find out why. Well, I am happy to report that all fourteen co-sponsors do not think that they are better versed in AIDS policy recommendations than an expert panel. 1 found no senator who objected to AIDS education and little support for mandatory testing. Needle exchange programs and condom distribution in prisons were the primary reasons everyone signed on. Bill Gage, an aide to Democrat Cecil Green, provided a typical response, citing that Green was a former narcotics commissioner and could find little justification for needle exchange. He also said Green talked to the gay organization MECLA and to Senate President David Roberti's staff about condom distribution, yet still has personal objections. On the Republican side. Sen. Ed Davis, who drew fire in the U.S. Senate primary for his pro-gay sentiments, also objectwl to the needle exchange and condom distribution provisions. Davis' aide, Charles Fennessey, told me that the Senator could not support condom distribution in prisons, but it didn't really matter because the Governor will never go for it anyway. He said the Senator objects to needle exchange pro\u00ad grams because \" the use of intravenous drugs is illegal,\" but said Davis might support certain measures. He pointed out that Davis did support methadone clinics and their funding in the past and is open to suggestions. The bottom line remains that prisoners do have sex in prison, it can't be stopped and AIDS needs to be, and condoms are still the best known way besides abstinence, which remains the most unrealistic approach. Drug abusers continue to shoot up, and clean needles remain the best way of stopping the spread among IV drug abusers.

The point is a united statement and action, not a dribble of different events. The number of people who would travel to both parades is miniscule \u2014 probably all concentrated in the leadership of Christopher St. West. No!! C.M. Jones New Aiiiance Party To the Editor: 1 wanted to respond to Geoffrey Minter's article entitled Lefi Wing Group Courting Gays and correct some of the mi.stakes and charges by some of the people interviewed for the article. Firstly. I would like to thank the Sentinel for providing such extensive coverage of the New Alliance Party's work around this forum entitled: Which Way For Lesbian \u00a3 Gay Em\u00ad powerment? It is precisely this public dialogue in front of the community, so that they can decide the validity of independent politics, that is vital to our growth and development as a community. I would like to take issue with Pat Norman's charge that \"the New Alliance Patty (NAP's) actions, in ef\u00ad fect, 'keep people who a conservative in power.' '' Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, it was the Democratic Party controlled Congress which supported Reagan's right-wing nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court which recently voted to gut Roe vs. Wade. Not a single policy, budget cut. political appointment, or.Jesse Helms amendment could have passed Congress without the explicit support of the Democratic Party which con\u00ad trols it. Most of us know this but don't know that we have a progressive choice. That's why this public dialogue is so important. What the New Alliance Party is building is an independent community-based people's party that is challenging this dirty deal between the Democrats and Republicans which keeps the right wing in power. We need democracy not dealmaking! I would like to respond to the tone and content of the attacks by Robert Bray of the Human Rights Campaign Fund. At one point during his inter\u00ad view, Bray states that \" (NAP is)cashing in on our movement.\" Now as a gay activist, I consider myself part of our movement. Since when did Bray define who was included in that. It's exactly this type of exclu\u00ad sionary politics that we in the New Alliance Party are challenging. Our movement must be inclusive of all points of view \u2014 even independent points of view. While Bray goes on to claim that he \" is not a puppet of the Democratic Party.\" he reveals his real intentions when he states that the problem with NAP is that it takes votes away from the Democrats. He finally got it!NAP is an independent. Black-led. multi-racial, pro-gay political party. We have no oath to the Democrats or the Republicans \u2014 only to the com\u00ad munities who support us. As the fastest growing political party in AmerW. we are very proud of our 10 -yearliistory of militant and pas\u00ad sionate work in the Black. Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, women's and lesbian and gay communities. Let this dialogue continue. We must put aside the vicious attacks and get down to the real issues of empowerment for our community. Is the Democratic Party our road to empowerment \u2014 or should we begin to explore our in\u00ad dependent options? That is a question for our community to decide, not a few self-appointed leaders on the Democratic Parly payroll! Jim Mangia Abortion To the Editor: I am writing in response to two re\u00ad cent letters in the Sentinel whose authors argue that gays and lesbians should oppose abortion on demand. Both Mark Miller and Sheila Graves raise the spectre of a prenatal genetic test for homosexuality, and claim that the mere possibility of such a test means that \" gays and lesbians stand to lose the most\" if abortion on de\u00ad mand is available. Furthermore, Mr. Miller contends that gays and lesbians should oppose the right to choose abortion because \" unwanted pregnan\u00ad cies and the abortions that often follow them are a heterosexual prob\u00ad lem . . . if heterosexuals are burden\u00ad ed with unwanted pregnancies, then they have obviously not been follow\u00ad ing the advice they so freely give the gay/lesbian community. Use protec\u00ad tion . . . just say astound\u00ad ing degree of political short\u00ad sightedness. as well as a deplorable lack of compassion on their authors' parts. First, and most obviously, recriminalizing abortion will not change the deeply-seated homophobia which might prompt some people to abort \" gay fetuses\" if a prenatal genetic test for homosexuality were ever constructed (which I think is highly unlikely anyway, considering contemporary understandings of both sexuality and genetics.) Gays and les\u00ad bians already have plenty of ex\u00ad perience in a far more humane \u2014 and effective \u2014 strategy for preven\u00ad ting the development of such an in\u00ad herently homophobic test. We are already adept at fighting limited and limiting genetic constructions of sex\u00ad uality and constructions of homosex\u00ad uality as a frightful abnormality, whether these conceptions arise from scientific or religious communities, legislatures, or the courts. To point to only one notable example of our hard-won gains, we are successfully contesting the construction of AIDS as a \" gay plague\" caused by \" the in\u00ad herent unhealthiness of the gay , lifestyle.\" Yes. there are still many people who see AIDS as a \" gay scourge.\" and yes. there may always be people who would abort \" gay fetuses\" if they could, but we cannot deny millions the right to choose because some will make choices to which we are opposed. To do so is to contribute to the mentality of those who would deny gays and lesbians the very means of life because they do not agree with our choice of sexual/emo- tional partners. * Mr. Miller's assertion that abortion is primarily the messy consequence of irresponsible heterosexual sex and his thinly veiled implication that women who get pregnant must \" live with the consequences'' are also eerily reminis\u00ad cent of right-wing arguments. Hasn't the right-wing been telling us that AIDS is the consequence of irrespon\u00ad sible (read: inherently immoral) gay sex. and that people with AIDS deserve what they get since this epidemic began? I'd like to remind Mr. Miller that condoms break, diaphragms fail, and that no one in this culture, heterosexual, homosexual or otherwise, has been encouraged to think about or talk about sexuality honestly. Therefore \"responsibility\" is not really the issue \u2014 desire, misin\u00ad formation. fear, shame, and confu\u00ad sion are. Not to mention rape and in-cest, which happen to lesbians as well as heterosexual women and girls. Finally, in response to Mr, Miller's fatuous and patronizing claim that his \" lesbian sisters\" who choose to become mothers are an \" example to the aborting heterosexuals.\" I'd like to ask Mr. Miller to ask all his \"les\u00ad bian sisters\" how many of them had or considered having abortions when they were involved with men, how many of them are survivors of rape and/or incest, and how many of them think abortion is primarily a question of \"responsibility.\" Wise up, Mr. Miller \u2014 your ideas are far more dangerous to gays and lesbians (and everyone else) than legal abortion on demand could ever be. Usa Nash Yes On S and P To the Editor: We feel the two writers opposing the new ballpark and its linkage with Domestic Partners ^ n tin e l letters, 31 Aug) have overlooked the once-in-a- lifetime opportunity given gay voters by Prop. P, the Downtown Radium Measure. For decades we minority gays have sought acceptance and respect from the majorty non-gays. We have mov\u00ad ed toward this goal \u2014 as the last substantial constituency relegated to the \" back of the bus\" by too many bigoted straights \u2014 by evidencing that we differ from non-gays on/y by vir\u00ad tue of same-sex love. We now ask all San Francisco voters to recognize us as complete citizens and total humans by affirming Domestic Partners. We must not, therefore, default on our half of what may in effect be a ballot quid pro quo by contributing to the defeat of a new ballpark which will bring to all citizens \u2014 irrespective of age, political or sexual orientation \u2014 economic, recreational and social ad\u00ad vantages and benefits. Passage of Prop P, the Downtown Stadium, will prove to San Francisco that we gays have matured beyond \" one issue voting.\" Passage of Prop S., the Domestic Partners Measure, will likewise prove to America that the people of San Francisco have cast off the last vestiges of homophobia. Thomas F. Lundqnist Thomas M. EdwardsLurie'S Toys To the Editor:After reading a recent article in the S.F. Chronicle I found myself getting very angry. 1 am a native San Fran\u00ad ciscan and have been a loyal Giants fan for many years. I'm not very hap\u00ad py about the stadium, I voted against it last year and will vote against it again this year. Who are the Gay political groups to speak for the whole gay community as a whole? I think that it's a sad day when the people of this city let a man like Bob Lurie and the Giants ball team hold this city hostage. They act like a bunch of lit\u00ad tle children, Hf we don 'I get our way we will take our toys and play elsewhere.) I for one say let them go, and how dare they think that the gay community of this city can be bought out! The hollow promises made by Mr. Lurie and our Mayor need to be filled with more than just air. Please keep your stadium and your petitions out of my face, thank you.

''We Want Separate Parade Dates b y M arsha Levine and B artholom ew C asim ir Regarding your article on the San Francisco Parade Gimmittee's decision not to alternate dates with Christopher Street West/Los Angeles \u2014 We'd like to dear up some mis-infonnation with some missing information. First of aU, a vote on the proposed hy-law change that would institute the alternating date plan actually happened at the July General Membership meeting, not the last General Membership meeting (Aupist), as Mr. White stated. And the vote was far from being unanimous, it was closer to a 60%-40% split. Secondly, there was a subsequent motion passed by about 85% of the voters that requested we keep the com\u00ad munications open between the two cities and try to come up with other possibilities.What Mr. White was not present to witness, since he walked into the August meeting as we were getting ready to ad\u00ad journ, was the lack of interest in bring\u00ad ing the by-law change issue back up for discussion at this time. He would have also learned that an unofficial task force was set-up to discuss this further. Right now that group consists of two main facilitators and hopefully the persons who contacted us through approx\u00ad imately 10 phone calls and 12 letters. Should anyone desire to attend a meeting of this group and contribute to the discussions, they should call 864-3733 about upcoming sessions.CSW/LA did not initiate the alter\u00ad nating dates proposal. Our Vice- President Bart Casimir asked Los Angeles why they had to be on the same weekend as San Francisco, at the an\u00ad nual California Pride Coordinators Conference in Long Beach last November. A long time ago. CSW/LA was told they would not have adequate police participation if the event was held on Father's Day weekend. They also have a clause in their by-laws that states that they will hold their event on the 4th weekend of June. And there are other reasons that have to do with insurance policies and/or the scheduling aroundthe dates of other local street fairs/statewide lesbian & gay pride celebrations. Both cities were approached at that conference by members of the San Jose, Long Beach, San Diego, and Orange (bounty Lesbian/Gay Pride Committees and asked if they could please try to work out a plan that would enable groups to participate at both events. Our represenUtives agreed and devised such a plan. That plan waspassed by the San Francisco and Los Angeles Board of Directors in April of 1989. Since this would require a by-laws change, we had to announce that we would be discussing this at the General Membership meeting, and the proposed am endm ent would require two readings. The first reading took place at the July meeting and it failed. This meant that there would be no second reading. Those who voted against the by-law amendment and voted for the subsequent \" open communicatbn mo\u00ad tion\" , when quizzed publicly, said that they had voted dovm the by-law change because they felt that there had been in\u00ad adequate time for discussion and pro\u00ad cessing. They felt that the decision was being railroaded through. They just wanted some more time to think about it.Mr. White is wrong if he thinks this is a \" dead\" or \" non\" issue. Since the General Membership passed the subse\u00ad quent motion, and since there has been an unofficial task force established, this issue will remain as old business on the agenda until some resolution happens. And just because the by-law amend\u00ad ment failed this time, it doesn't meanthat people can't bring this item up again, and again, and again. While Mr. White may have been the Media Coordinator (a paid position) for the Parade and Celebration the last two years, he has extremely limited knowledge of how the organization is structured and how it operates. Witness when he states that he feels that CSW /LA's motivation could be economical, he goes on to say that peo\u00ad ple pay to get into the LA parade, but that \"ours is free and you just join in as it goes along.\" LA's parade application fees are 25% to 50% lower than San Francisco's parade fees. You must register to be in both parades. Allen knows that we use these application forms to determine the line-up forma\u00ad tion and official estimates for the press, and that we will take steps to prevent unregistered groups from appearing in our parade. This senseless competition has got to stop! And just what is there to compete against and compare to anyways? Comparing both cities is like comparing apples and oranges. Compare a two- day festival produced by a total self- sufficient organization that grossesover $500,000 annually \u2014 to a one-day parade and celebration that depends upon city funds, outside grants, and heavy fundraising that might possibly gross over $15,000? Compare a grassroots committee to an organiza\u00ad tion that has bought and financed the reconstruction of a building to be used as an AIDS hospice ftt was originally supposed to be a gay and lesbian senior retirement home), and makes donations Se n t in e l III POINT Q if VIEW Sports Kdilof: Jack Irait' Fried.

The car we drive, the clothes we wear, how we live and how we look are frequently in the forefront in determining our self- image. Although this is a mainstream American cultural value, it is a value that is in conflict with the dual reality that self-esteem and integrity also come out of the coiraniuncnt in human rela\u00ad tionships. Our continuing positive iden\u00ad tity has much more to do with being heard, understood and valued. AIDS1 has challenged our identities, re-defined our sense of security and made the need for ongoing human relationships more I immediate, and sometimes more threatening.AIDS has shaken our sense of con\u00ad stancy, for what we have believed to be constant, including our lovers, our friends, our extended Emilies and evenI our survival have been jeopwdized. The first relationship we had in tlie worldto community organizations that send volunteers to work at the festival? We can see no similarities, therefore no real (or imagined) basis for competition \u2014 financial or otherwise! The real reason behind the alter\u00ad nating dates plan was and will remain the desire of our sister cities in pride wanting to be able to participate in ALL California Lesbian/Gay Pride events. Not just those geographically conve\u00ad nient and economical. We hoped that during our tenure with this organization that we would proudly watch San Fran\u00ad cisco welcome and embrace our southern California brothers and sisters, and we will continue to work towards extending that hand as long as we are members of the San Francisco Lesbian/Gay Freedom Day Parade Committee. Marsha Levine is President and Bar- tholomew Casimir is Vice President o f\\ the San Francisco Lesbian/Gay ' Freedom Day Parade Committee. Andrew Peirini.M K IJ V iA H A W K I N V some relationships tliat we rely upon have been threatened with the constan\u00ad cy of a disease called AIDS. We may appear fine to the outside world, but in- s i^ we remain in conflict. The crisis stage may be over, and we have done wdl with adapting to living with AIDS. But even th o u ^ we have learned new coping skills, tlie epideimc is not over. You may find yourself shut\u00ad ting down to conversations about it, avoiding intimate relationships, escap\u00ad ing the City for vacations or time out, not wanting to answer the phone or not calling a friend who is oveivfhelmed by his diagnosis; these are all means of adaptation. They are natural coping techniques in an uimatural situation. In the meantime, I still sh at my desk at Shanti Project with a waiting list of 40 clients. Tbe Emotional Support Pro\u00ad gram's volunteer body is doing an outstanding job, yet the number of volunteers h i remained the same for tbe last year and a half while the I number of clients calling for servicecontinues to increase. Something is not coming together. And tliat somethmg is an individual waiting to meet another person, both committed to affirming and acknowledging the continuing struggle of AIDS. People sdll need the contact of peer counselors in learning how to adapt and be supported for their independent liv\u00ad ing. It's hard to keep promising the constancy of emotional support when volunteer applications diminish instead of increasing. 1 can think of many reasons why; Maybe H's too hard, maybe you're afi^d, maybe you're tired of this, maybe the politics of AIDS or of Shanti Project obscure your view of this work, maybe your best friend just died. While it makes sense to pull away, it also makes sense to come togOher and enter into a volunteer body which offers recognition of your qualities, your feelings and tbe commit\u00ad ment to significant relationships nuddng a differena in living with AIDS. It's difficult to imagiDe living in San Francisco and not having some sort of reaction to AIDS. We need your reac\u00ad tion and will pay attention to what you know, how you feel and what you can do with other people to acknowledj^ their accomplishments in the epidemic.Like the kid on the bicycle, outgrown that need to be witnessed, to have attention paid to them. Volunteer programs rely on com\u00ad munity involvement. And in the com\u00ad munity, we have taken care of each other, not only as volunteers but as friends. I want to personally thank the thousands of volunteers who choa Shanti Project as their way of helping in the epidemic. We need people to keep choosing, to keep saying yes to becom\u00ad ing a volunteer. Consider becoming a Shanti Emotional Support Volunteer for just a little while. Your six month commitment will teach you more about yourself, and will give someone on the waiting list an opportunity to be understood and supported. We're all taking turns.

It's unfor\u00ad tunate, with the lack of response we're getting, we're going to go from a low prevalency state to a hi^i one.'' Texas has probably had the worst response to the epidemic of any state, they are fifth in AIDS cases and 33rd in per capita spending. Emily Untermeyer of the Texas Senate Health and Human Services Committee says that there are many reasons why Texas has been bad in responding to the AIDS crisis, \" We were in a serious economic slump when AIDS funding first came before the legislature and Texas had no money to spare. Remember, Texas has had more banks close than any other state. We'ie also a more decentralized state with numerous state health agencies, and the Department of Health has a sketchy relationship with local health organiza\u00ad tions, which are county based and in\u00ad dependent ........... Also, Medicaid is much more restrictive here, than say in California, this is the south and like Alabama or Mississippi, we don't tradi- tioDally fimd health and human service cases.'' Untermeyer did add encourag\u00ad ing words for the future, pointing out that Texas has allocated $7.9 million for AIDS in FY 1990 and $10.5 million for FY 1991. In contrast. New Jersey, which has about the same number of cases, spends $13 million on AIDS, which is twenty-eight times more per capita in state fimding. Untenneyer add\u00ad ed, \" Because of our L ^ a tiv e Task Force recommendations, we have taken a quantum leap forward, but Texas will always have to depend on private fund\u00ad ing.\" Of states with at least 1,000 AIDS cases, Colorado has the lowest per capita allocation of state fiinds for AIDS. Colorado has 1,068 AIDS cases, with an estimated 30,000 more who are infected. The CDC estimates that the state will have around 4,000 cases by 1991, yet Colorado spends a meager nine cents per capita on AIDS. In contrast, the state just ahead of Col\u00ad orado in AIDS cases, Michigan, spends nearly ten times as much. Ann Ran\u00ad dolph of the Colorado AIDS Project told the Sentinel that \" the governor ispaying attention, but little has come from the legislature.\" Colorado is known to have a very conservative l^islature which is currently in recess and we were unable to reach legislators for comment. However, Julian Rush, director of the Colorado AIDS Project, did explain that not only are they con\u00ad servative \" but predominately rural and have a very territorial attitude. They feel the problems of the cities are not theirs. They are poorly informed and ir\u00ad responsible. We receive no dty, no county, and no state funding.\" Ran\u00ad dolph did say that they have \"pretty good funding from local grants and trusts, including $10,000 fiom both AT&T and Prudential Life Insurance, plus an additional $20,000 fiom the dty of Denver, where 85% of the slate s AIDS cases occur.\" In contrast to states like Texas, Col\u00ad orado, and North Carolina are states like Hawaii, South Carolina, Alaska, and Rhode Island, which all contribute heavily even though they have been on\u00ad ly moderatdy effected by the crisis. Alaska has the benefit of a healthy state surplus and Rhode Island was forced to respond to an Omnibus AIDS Bill with heavy state fimding. Rhode Island's law required costly testing of inmates at the Adult correctional Facility, prostitutes and their customers, people caught with hypodermic needles, and requires offer\u00ad ing of testing for pre-natal and pre\u00ad marital cases, STD dinic patients, and those at drug treatment centers. Ann Marie Silvia, of Rhode Island Project AIDS, says, \"The money for pre-natal and pre-marital cases could be much better used for support services, prevoi- tion, education, and counseling. But these are the compromises one has to make.\" The Project received $425,000 in state funds to provide services, the same amount that the state of Arizona provides with over three times the caseload. When Senator Edward Kennedy P-M ass) announced his tenpoint plan to combat AIDS recently, he stressed that \" Funding is urgently needed at the local level to create front-line partner\u00ad ships to address the full spectrum of AIDS and HIV care needs.\" HAKUrr-ASHBURYTRACK & FIELD/ROAD RACING SPECIALISTS WEIGHTS SHOES APPAREL ATHLETIC ACCESSORIES BALL SPORTS ' 1632 HAIGHT STREET (415 ) 861 4697 \"10% OFF W ITH THIS AD'' L A L C S A FORM ALW EAR 1711 HAIGHT ST.

SAN FRANCISCO (415) 668-3746Gay and C atholic Walking With Dignity b y Frederic M illen Gentle reader, when was the last time you were in a room with several hundred lesbian and gay folk for some purpose other than cocktaib? To be gay and Catholic on Labor Day weekend in San Francisco meant lifting our voices in song with over 700 compatriots. It meant hstening to Mant criticism of the Roman hierarchy. It meant wekoming feflow Catholics from Anglican and Greek traditions. It meant women and men worshipping together as equals. Convention co-facilitator Evelyn Whitehead said, \" Dignity is a grassroots organization working for social change. To be a member is to understand that change must come from below.\" Incoming national president Pat Roche of Seattle said, \" Dignity members are committed to the deeper values of a 20-year-old, woridwide movement. If we won't stand up for the goodness in our relationships, who will?\" Delegates responded enthusiastically to Roche's remarks. Representatives were present from Dignity/Dignit\u00e9 of Canada; (^ est of Great Britain, and Acceptance of Australia. Dignity chaplain Bernard Lynch of New York City described the work of Reach, an Irish organization of lesbian and gay Anglicans and Roman Catholics. \" They meet for worship in a Redemptorist priory,\" said Lynch. \" This would not be possible without the Protestant connection. Their work is vitally important for the eventual solu\u00ad tion to the conflict in the north.\" At a week-long series of meetings, delegates developed a vision of what it means to live in freedom as children of God. Legislative sessions afRrmed Dignity's interest in healing, social justice, equality between women andPittsburgh Priests. The group is organized around a core membership of married priests with a 20 year history as antiwar, civil rights and sexual equality activists. APP supports a proposed gay rights ordinance against the opposition of the local Roman bishop. The measure is up for reconsideration next year. Priests from the association serve as presiders at Dignity services and as substitutes for vacationing rectors. Edmund Dwyer said, \" Dignity New York is without clergy, but so are straight Catholics in many parts of the country.\" Like outgoing national presi\u00ad dent Jim Bussen, he sees a great oppor\u00ad tunity for networking among Catholics who are alienated from the official church over divorce, married priests and women's issues.The parade of banners at the 9th Biennial Dignity Convention Spirituality And The Gay Community A Continuing Series men, integration of spirituality with sexuality, and maturity in the relation\u00ad ship between lesbians, gay men and self-appointed church authorities. Co-facilitator James Whitehead hail\u00ad ed the \" revolutionary energy\" of Dignity. \" You are embarked on the latest stage of the centuries old journey of Jews and (Christians,\" he said. Bill Nist of Pittsburgh said, \" The future belongs to those willing to be op\u00ad posed.\" He described his chapter's close relationship with Association of\" We're a consciousness raising group,\" said Dwyer. \" For the first time m history, lesbians and gay men are visible.\" He ministers among gay prisoners at Rikers Island. The Washington D.C. chapter has doubled in size since being evicted from Georgetown University, according toFrank Nigro. Liturgy takes place at St. Margaret's Episcopal church. \" We've accomplished so much more from hav\u00ad ing to f i^ t for our rights.\" Nigro said. Noreen Whipple, a nurse from Long Beach, conducted a seminar on living creatively as a single lesbian. \" The great gift we have in these gatherings is our own resources,\" she said. Uppermost in the minds of seminar participants, and perhaps for most les\u00ad bians at the convention, was how to meet a good (Catholic girl. The women were agreed that there is a lack of sup\u00ad port for single women and bars are fre\u00ad quently the only place to socialize. Gay men are perceived as more supportive of single women than lesbian couples are. Dignity is seen as much more welcoming than formerly but still not a good place to meet women. \" 1 receive a great deal of love and support from men in Dignity,\" Whip\u00ad ple said, and other women had similar experiences to share. In Los Angeles the women's rap group Connexis was men\u00ad tioned as a good resource. Meetings are friendly and always crowded. For at least two of the women, the seminar was more than theoretically helpful. They were seen dancing cheek to cheek afterthe banquet on Saturday. \" Dear Abby was right, you can meet a man in church,\" was the theme of a men's relationship seminar. It was given by Mel Stenger and Vince Morgante, who met at a Dignity mass seven years ago. Stenger is a sixth grade teacher in Oakland public schools. Morgante is a psychotherapist with a large lesbian, gay and family practice. They have been approved by Alameda county to adopt a five year old boy from an abusive home. About 90 percent of the men in the seminar were in relationships, which ranged from 34 years to two months in duration. The couples met at Dignity, in bars or in more public places. One couple was married in a Roman Catholic church in Cincinnati. Two others were wed in an Episcopal church. One man said, \" My partner is an atheist and he's the one who got me in\u00ad volved with D ip ity .\" Another man, married to a priest, said, \" My mother in law is the church.\" The biggest prob\u00ad lem in male relationships was describ\u00ad ed as the difficulty of achieving equali\u00ad ty- W a l t O d e t s , p h .o .

Trax is the lone holdout, pride flags hanging from the ceiling and a crowd of staunch regulars at the bar. \" 1 fed more comfortable here fm the Haight) than in the Castro,\" says Alan Spears, who moved to San Francisco a year ago from Oklahoma. \" There's not so much . . . emphasis on gay. I feel like 1 can relax more.\" However, not everyone seems to feel that way. \" It's very tatty,\" says Gerad Kite, a native of England who has lived here three years. \" I think a lot of (gays) are very prissy and .... prefer nicer areas,\" such as the Castro and north Fillmore. But the shopping in the area is far more eclectic than in the more \" prissy\" areas. Thrift stores and head shops abut vintage formalwear shops and toy I stores. Gay owned businesses are a strong presence in the Haight, although several owners have died of AIDS, and there are no gay merchant assodations in the Haight. In fact, gay business owners tend to be very low key. Several referred to their shops as \" businesses whose owners happen to be gay.\" Siege of Distractions noted that his gay-oriented merchandise is not selling as well, and says he is buying for a broader clientele, including more lesbians. PoliUcally, the Haight is even more liberal than the Castro, and it votes consistantly for gay candidates. But most of all, the Haight is just a nice place to hang out. Even the lower Haight has a certain draw as more bars and clubs become popular with gays and straights. Cafe's, unique shops, and some swell restaraunts make the neighborhood well worth a visit, but the area is still tough. From the top to the bottom. Haight Street is happening.

But let's not forget that winter is just around the comer, and our September sun will soon give way to December drizzle. Yes, the days of battered umbrellas and soggy tennis shoes are drawing near. But don't get depressed \u2014 get even and get away to a sunny spot this winter. Better start planning your escape now, or you may be left out in the coM. Here are some hot ideas for your next vacation. Hawaii Hawaii has plenty to offer gay vaca\u00ad tioners, particularly Californians who can take advantage of economical air\u00ad fares and a relatively short travel time. Those looking for nightlife should stick with Waikiki, where Hula's and Dirty Mary's still dominate a very lively scene (the daylife in front of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel or at Queen's Surf Beach is quite festive as well). Ham\u00ad burger Mary's on Maui has been closed for more than a year; gays now gather at a bar called Betino's, which is nothing to write home about. The real action on the outer islands is definitely the beach: Little Makena on Maui and Donkey Beach on Kauai. For a real taste of a gay Hawaiian lifestyle, consider staying at a gay- owned guesthouse or hotel. Right in the middle of Waikiki, Hotel Honolulu has been welcoming gay visitors for several years. Located in the gay Kuhio District, Hotel Honolulu offers fully- furnished studios or cme-bedroom apart\u00ad ments at very reasonable rates. A minor drawback is that all rooms are furnish\u00ad ed with one king-size bed rather than separate beds, so it might not be ap\u00ad propriate if you're bringing your mother along (which is too bad, because she would be charmed by the tropical ambience and friendly staff). Kauai boasts three gay-owned guesthouses, one of which, Mahina Kai, is like a gay Zen retreat in paradise. Japanese architecture, modem and oriental art, and lush foliage all combine to create a uniquely relaxing and enlightening environment. One good reason to spend some time onthe Hana side of Maui is Hana Planta\u00ad tion Houses. Not a guesthouse or hotel, Hana Plantation consists of individual vacation rental homes, some of which can accommodate up to six people. The young, energetic proprietors (ex- Califomians, of course) will be happyhave to generate their own electricity). Located close to Volcanos National Park, a stay here gives you the oppor\u00ad tunity to explore an other-worldly en\u00ad vironment of lava flows, natural steam baths and hot pools. Hot tip: ask your travel agent about Pacific Ocean Holidays, a gay-owned Hawaii package vacation company. They can put together competitively- priced packages including airfare, car rentals, and accommodations at either standard or gay-owned properties. Their Waikiki packages also include a welcome orientation breakfast at Ham\u00ad burger Mary's. ___________ Mexico ___________ The ads invite you to \" feel the warmth of Mexico,\" and during the Catching some rays \u2014 and your breath \u2014 in Key West. to point out the special attractions of this remote, beautiful area. On the Big Island, RBR Farms is a secluded macadamia nut and coffee farm about twenty minutes from Kailua-Kona. With only three guest units you should definitely be looking for privacy, but the views of the ocean from a 700-ft. elevation are spectacular, the breakfasts are made-to-order, and there is a small swimming pool. On the opposite side of the Big Island, 45 minutes from Hilo, Huliaule'a is even more rustic (theyvrinter months lots of gay vacationers do just that. Surprisingly, many of the major resort areas such as Mazatlan, Ixtapa and Cabo San Lucas, have no visible or organized gay presence. California gays seem to be drawn primarily to ^ e rto Vallarta, and it's not hard to understand why. It com\u00ad bines the charm of the sleepy fishing village it once was with the sophistica\u00ad tion of a jet set resort, it's accessible by short, non-stop flights, it has accom\u00ad modations ranging from budget roomsto luxurious cliff-hanging villas, and there is a relatively open gay beach scene and two gay bars. It will be in\u00ad teresting to see if Alaska Airline's new direct service to Acapulco from San Francisco will increase gay traffic there. Acapulco is a much larger city than Puerto Vallarta and has more gay nightlife; it's also the only beach resort area in Mexico with py-identified ac\u00ad commodations. If you enjoy traveling with a group, ask your travel agent about Advance Tour's Thanksgiving trip to Acapulco. For an interesting change of pace, you might want to consider the Yucatan. Merida, the clean and attrac\u00ad tive capital city of Yucatan province, is surrounded by fascinating Mayan ar\u00ad cheological sites such as Uxmal and Chichen Itza. In the middle of town is a comfortable p y guesthouse, Casa Ex- ilio, run by former Key West hoteliers. And of course, a visit to the Yucatan must include some time at the glorious beaches of Canc\u00fan, Cozumel, Playa del Carmen or Akumal. FLASH: weekly non-stop charter flights are now operating from San Francisco to Can- cun, making this area much more ac\u00ad cessible to Bay Area residents. _________Mardi Gras ________ I almost decided not to mention Mar\u00ad di Gras in New Orleans in this article about warm winter getaways: last year's revelers froze their buns offl But this year's festivities happen a little later in the season (they climax on February 27), and even if the weather doesn't cooperate, the party will go on. It's vir\u00ad tually impossible to find accommoda\u00ad tions in any of the gay establishments during Mardi Gras, but if you act soon you might be able to find something de\u00ad cent in the French Quarter (be prepared for outrageously inflated prices.) Good weather is virtually assured in Sydney for Gay Mardi Gras, a unique celebra\u00ad tion which combines the best of Hallo\u00ad ween, Camaval and Gay Freedom Day (I990's Gay Mardi Gras culminates on February 24.) It's a great time of year to visit Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific; plan on spending at leastKey West has been a popular gay vacation spot since the early '70s, and it's still going strong. There's not much of a beach, so during the day activity centers around the numerous gay pesthouses. The new owners of Island House, one of the larger establishments primarily for men, recently purchased The Chelsea House and have turned it into a guesthouse for women. The Brass Key Guesthouse now has a swimming pool to supplement the large jacuzzi. Among the more than thirty other gay properties include perennial favorites Alexander's, Curry House, and Early House. Accommodations should be booked well in advance during winter months. Unfortunately for Bay Area residents wishing to visit Key West, the recent upheaval with Eastern Airlines has left San Francisco with no non-stop flights to Florida, so what has always been a long trip just got longer. But once you get to Florida, direct commuter flights into Key West are offered from Orlan\u00ad do, Fort Lauderdale and Miami, so you might want to sample the scene at one of these hotspots on your way. ________ Palm Springs ______ Palm Springs now boasts more than twenty gay hotels and guesthouses. The largest concentration is on or near Warm Sands Drive, where longtime favorite H Mirasol Villas has just been joined by Hacienda En Sueno, Vista Grande Villas, Whispering Palms and Alexander Resort. In Cathedral City, close to the gay nightlife, the Desert Palms and the Villa provide a central gathering place during the day. A hot tip about getting there: flights from the Bay Area directly to Palm Springs are limited, and the lowest roundtrip airfare as of this writing is J128. But Ontario airport is only 1 V i hour's drive from Palm Springs, flights are more frequent, and right now roundtrip tickets can be purchased for as little as $58. Since you'll probably be renting a car anyway, you might want to consider flying into Ontario and driv\u00ad ing from there.

Here are two \u2014 from very different eras. HARE. The hare' s association with male homosexuality appeared in the first century Epistle of Bamabus, which cited various prohibitions set forth by Moses. Eating a hare, the book said, would make one a pederast because the hare grows a new anal opening each year. RHINOCEROS. In 1974, two Boston activists initiated a campaign promoting the lavender rhinoceros as a symbol of gay people. Why a rhino? \" The rhino is a m ^ ig n ^ and misunderstood animal and, in 2u:tuality, is a gende creature \u2014 if you don' t cross it!\" Also, as someone else pointed out, it' s always horny. NEW!

R R T Lately, there has been an increasing preponderance of encouraging news for those HIV positive and their loved ones. Increasing options and alternatives exist, as well as more promising new ones being investigated. All these developments create a sense of hope, and are certainly a much needed respite from the unabated toll of AIDS. It has also, unfortunately, given rise to some unintended, and potentially destructive, side effects. For your own sake and health, or that of your loved one. let's take a closer look at some examples. The recent study on AZT (see 8/24 edition) and its implications, has stimulated a lot of interest and discus\u00ad sion in those who have not yet express\u00ad ed any. That's good. However, the undercurrent sense being felt isn't. While the news created renewed hope and determination, some unfortunately have greeted the same news by exaser- bating the problem with a return to risky lifestyles. Recent studies, in more detail later, have indicated a steadily in\u00ad creasing rise in new HIV infections. The paradox is developing in which new drug treatment conditions somehow are also deferring the spectre of AIDS itself. Confounding as it is. announcements like the AZT study, foster an impres\u00ad sion that the \" safe sex and less risky lifestyle\" behavior attitude that has long and successfully been integrated, can now be relaxed. The new genera\u00ad tion of sexually active youth have not seemingly come to grips yet with what present day survivors live with, because, hey, like now there's like, you know, cool stuff happ'ning and all. Let's use zidovudine as a counter\u00ad point for a moment. The flipside to the announcement does not belie the fact that not all is good news. Many retrovir taking patients swear they owe their continued existence to the drug, and that this study reinforces this belief. Others, quite vocally, strongly feel otherwise. Some, like/Vew York Native writer John Lauritsen seemingly foam at the mouth at the mere mention of the subject, ranting and raving about how the treatment is a myth, perpetuated by false FDA data, not being scientifically or fully developed, and is indeed a \" poison by prescripion.\" I do not feel either stance is war\u00ad ranted. The fact is. zidovudine is a \" poison.\" But it is also a treatment \u2014 not a great one perhaps, but at present a viable one \u2014 and certainly no/ a license to cause a sigh of relief for anyone. Retrovir still cannot be tolerated by a great many (with the recent study in\u00ad dicating those with a history of OIs be\u00ad ing the key.) Some anecdotal evidence given me demonstrated that some who have initially shown good results, lessen over time after a year or so. Viral resistance seems to develop after eigh\u00ad teen months, and toxicity problems are sometimes evident by that time if not before. Discontinuance rates are high. No, the news regarding AZT will create more problems than it solves \u2014 particularly in regards to the financial aspect. More encouraging prospects for the drug seem to lie in early intervention \u2014 taking AZT while symptom free with T-cell counts relatively high \u2014 before the disea.se progression ensues. Some leading AIDS specialists are prescribing zidovudine for those yi\\\u00fa\\ greater than 200 T<ells (the current federal \" labeluse\" ) if symptoms \u2014 unexplained fevers, diarrhea, early dementia, low platelet counts, rising p24 antigenemia levels \u2014 are present. Concerns over cost and resistance can be mitigated by taking half-doses \u2014 which proved to be as effective as the previously recom\u00ad mended range. Also, dozens of other clinical trials are being conducted using AZT along with other compounds, and preliminary results show this is pro\u00ad bably the most effective way to go. But I hesitate proclaiming such, for what will thereo/ effect be: encourage the \" fence- sitters\" into making a commitment to themselves, or. embolden the masses in\u00ad to further denial and apathy? Another participant in the \" Com\u00ad pound Q\" study (this one at UC Hospital San Francisco) has lapsed in\u00ad to a deep coma \u2014 apparently from tox\u00ad ic encephalopathy (a drug reaction af\u00ad fecting the brain centers.) It has been reported in this, and other news forums, that \" Q \" indeed has shown in\u00ad itial promising results in selectively neutralizing HIV-infected cells. Butcaution was also strongly included because of the numerous, and poten\u00ad tially harmful, unknowns regarding the effective enzyme component, trichosan- thin. This has been especially true of those associated with clinical manifesta\u00ad tions of AIDS dementia and other related CNS-disorders. Two other published reports of deaths \" linked\" to \" 0 \" (one ruled a suicide, the other a case of aspiration following emerging ' from a coma) have underscored the need for careful and thorough evalua\u00ad tion, monitoring, and intervention. However, an ad has recently ap\u00ad peared in a number of gay newspapers that has caused some personal alarm. Seems these people don't read for they have ignored the FDA' s warning regard\u00ad ing taking any more of \" Q \" until the complete data is in (which is, inciden\u00ad tally, scheduled to be released in med- September.) \" Royal Aftorient Herbs\" a group in Texas, is offering \" Giinese Trichosantes\" |sic|, or \" Q\" in an oral form. The ad (rather misleadingly) states \" in tests kill H1V/AIDS/AR(T virus.\" Given the information just dispensed, you may wish to indeed con\u00ad tact them \u2014 but not to order any samples from them mind you.

I said to the virus; 'You're so safe inside my body, you can go to sleep if you want to.' \"Melton said when he was diagnosed, \"It was the,first time in my life anybody had ever told me there was nothing I could do about something. At that point you have to go to your spirituality and get a second opinion. \"There are no incurable diseases, but there are diseases that demand you go beyond the body,\" he said. \" Maybe there is not a cure, but there is no disease that cannot be healed. Cure is what they do to ham and bacon \u2014 it means 'to preserve.' \" A lot of people, especially gay peo\u00ad ple, are afraid of spirituality because they think it means religion,\" Melton said. \" If everytime you hear the word 'Jesus' you freeze, then you have something you have to forgive. \" The past is over and the future never gets here. Forgiveness allows you to let the past go. Now is the only m o -. ment that is real. \" Gay men already know how to die better than anyone who has ever lived on this planet. We have to leam how to live. \" You don't have to kill the vims, but you do have to make peace with yourself.

Most of RSVP's 1990 program takes place dur ing February and March, including their tried-and-tnie New Orleans-Key West-Yucatan itinerary and their Mex ican Riviera cruise out of San Diego Their newest offering, a Carribbean cruise out of Miami visiting the U.S Virgin Islands, St. Barts and the Dominican Republic, has proven so popular that two departures are already sold out and a third has been added (March 4-11 .) This means that if all the RSVP winter cruises go out full, as they have in the past, over 3,000 gay men and women will ship out with RSVP in the space of just two months. Why are these cruises so popular? Just ask any hve people who have been on one. You'll probably get five com pletely different reasons why they loved it, and that's the point: there': something for practically anyone Warm weather, exotic ports of call, top notch entertainment, great food, relax ation combined with stimulation, and most important of all, a unique spirit of camaraderie which embrases everyone from the madcap costume queen to the solitary bookworm, h all adds up to truly memorable vacation \u2014 hence the slogan \" A Cruise to Remember.\" And when you consider that the cruise price includes all meals and entertainment, compares favorably to a lot of other one-week vacation options. Ask a travel agent for the RSVP color brochure even if you don't go on the cruise you' ll definitely enjoy the pictures/(\u00bb IN e d a* sFLOW ERS & GIFTS ^ a i g h t c ^ s h b u r y ' S in c e 1952 FLOWERS & PLANTS FOR ALL OCCASIONS DELIVERY SERVICE -we aeuo n.owem\u00bb womawme\" CHARGE BY PHONE\u00ab\u00abOCT CfUDIT CAIUM ACCCTTEO BASKETS FRESH & SILK FLOWERS SYMPATHY ARRANGEMENTS 552-2920T \u00d3 S I HA IGHT S T .

Of coorx, I always keep in mind the fact that if 1 were to attempt to communicate with any of the people responsible for bizarre and different uses of the Queen's tongue, their command of English would be far superior to my command of, say, Cantonese, Japanese or even English, at times. Having said that, as any responsible joumafist would, I wiD now proceed to amuse you aU by quoting the presskit of two excellent Italian bands, Birdmen of Alkatraz and Steeplejack. Francesco Alaimo of Contempo Records writes me that he \" really likes to hear good news from the W est,'' and would \" be very glad to see some reviews appeared in [his| favourite town.'' Okay, so 1 guess you have to read the whole letter to really appreciate it. So it's a cheap shot. Look, my deadline's early thb week and cheap shots are about all 1 can get./\u00abr. o ^ l \u00e0 ! 1 Anyhow, the two albums truly are \" milestones of great value,\" maybe not \" one of those ten records to save in case of catastrophe,\" but \" absolutely rele\u00ad vant\" nonetheless. Florence-based Groundhog Blues\" than Mick Jagger ever did on \" Girl With The Faraway Eyes.\" Their lyrics tend to sound like the result of Bruce Springsteen channelling Salvador Dali, with boy and girl running away into the Vesti Iji Guibba!; Rirdmen Birdmen of Alkatraz, and their album From the Birdcage nms all over the place in big, looping, psychedelic circles. Everything that was great about the early Rolling Stones, Velvet Underground and Iron Butterfly is pulled screeching into the '90s, all bass-heavy and gloriously trippy. (Hav\u00ad ing listened to this album under the in\u00ad fluence of nothing more than decaf tea, I know it must be them and not me.) Their unique grasp of English only helps emphasize their somewhat ethereal/surreal titles and lyrics. They provide brief explanations to the Oscar Meyer Weiner Wagon - \" If you look out of your window you'll see me standing there, gazing up at the moon a 'shining, wishing you care.\" Or how about this: \" Jack O 'Diamonds: Drains fish brains,as he shoves he never loves.\" Steepiqack lean a little more towards blues than towards psychedelia, but Pow Wow is no less relevant nor any less surreal than From the Birdcage. Their vocalist puts on a better countrynight as scenery melts and turns colors around them. \" Say Green Say Yellow\" is a puzzle for sure; \" little young child, eating chips, spitting down, on sunset's tail,\" but my favorite line comes from \" You Walked Away\" : \" Come into this butcher shop with me pretty girl, we will touch the meat 'til we won't know if we're alive or dead in our heads.\" 1 give both albums five bats.

The standard for Wagnerian singing in this country was set between the two world wars. For purity of style matched with ex\u00ad pressiveness of character, those singers have never been equalled. A useful col\u00ad lection focusing on this period is EMI's iVagner on Record. 1926-42. The Lohengrin selections give one a taste of what one might have encountered in the opera house during those years. The limpidly pure voice of a young Bisabeth Rethberg gets B sa's Dream. Lotte Lehmaim's sumptuous control of character can be experienced in Elsa's Tower song, and Helge Roswaenge's shining top notes and even production can be heard in the hero's last two solos. But the glory of this group is Tiana Lemnitz's Bedroom duet with TorstenKnight, but his convincing way with the words and his sovereign command of the music make his recordings very in\u00ad teresting indeed. His recording of the Bedroom duet with Emmy Bettendorf is not only one of the fullest from that period, but also a model of passion and refinement (DACO-117). Two last inter-war Lohengrins need to be men\u00ad tioned: the Italian Aureliano Fertile, whose imaginative grasp of the Knight's mysterious mission is unique (GB 1019). and Richard Tauber, who. though he never sang the full role, fre\u00ad quently sang \" In femem Land\" in recitals (see LCD-139). Of the modem recordings, the greatest is Rudolf Kempe's glowing ac\u00ad count with Jess Fischer-Dieskau Ralf. Lemnitz's ethereal loveliness, her tone floating softly yet richly over Wagner's orchestra, makes a perfect em bodim ent o f E lsa 's angelic goodness. The curious connoisseur will want to search out Lemnitz's other Lohengrin recordings, including B sa's Dream and Tower song on LV 101, as well as the Elsa-Ortrud duet with the magisterial Margarete Klose on LV 160. As Lemnitz had the perfect voice (and musicianship) for Elsa, Franz Volker was the perfect poet for Lohengrin. A Telefunken record (KT1I017) features his shimmeringly effortless hero, together with the radiant Elsa of Maria Muller. Lauritz Melchoir's voice was too heavy and baritonal for him to be an optimal Swanyouthful shine of her voice and the ex\u00ad ceptional purity of her musicianship. Her Bedroom duet is all smiling eagerness and her Ortrud duet all heavenly innocence. Ludwig's Ortrud is quite simply the finest on record, titanically evil yet sumptuously beautiful. If you want just a taste of this brilliant performance, try Elisabeth Schwarzkopfs \" Romantic Arias\" on EMf-CD, on which the two sing the se\u00ad cond act duet. Where Kempe's recording falls down, however, Solti's London- CD set most triumphantly supple and sen\u00ad Thomas is frequently Bsa. which might look too earth- mothery on stage, manages to sound CONVENtENTL Y LOCA TED IN THE HEART OF THE FINANCIAL DtSTRICT 9 8 BATTERY STREET SAN FRANCISCO.

Of these I would choose the Sawallisch. Its sound is better and it allows you to make up your own mind about the music Bohm cut. Bohm is the greater conductor \u2014 on the one hand, tightening the screws more painfully and. on the other, pacing the dialogue more pertly. But Sawallisch has the bet\u00ad ter cast. Studer is a bright and sharply focus\u00ad ed Empress, who puts real angst into the Nightmare scene. Rysanek was, of course, one of those who led the Frau revival in the '50s and '60s, but by 1977, her voice was worn. It isn't until the third act that you get a true pitch, and for all the expert characterization, the flat singing is a trial. I deeply wish Frau impresarios would realize that the crucial role of Barak's Wife ought to go to a youthful, lyric soprano rather than an over-the- hill. dramatic one. Strauss wrote the part for the 30-year-old Lotte Lehmann, who was to become a famous Marschallin. the most compell\u00ad ing Sieglinde. a loving Elsa and an inReba - S till Number One by Tyler Sweatman Four weeks after its release, S w ea Sixteen was the number one country album. Fifteen weeks later, still on its first single, the album went gold. And this week it became the first album by a female country artist to maintain number one for 11 straight weeks accorefing to Billboard Magazine. This is Reba's sixteenth album and of \" Walk O n.\" We don't get many I'm beginning to wonder if she shouldn't change her name to Remake Reba. No just kidding, it's nice when an artist such as Reba can outdo the original artist. Reba has co-written three songs on the album, and all I can say is that all of the songs on the album are good.We know about \" Cathy's Gown\" and \" Till Love Comes Again,\" so let's move on to the rest of the album. Onesongs like this one, but when one comes along we get real excited.The final cut on side two is another good uptempoed two steppin song en\u00ad titled \" A New Love.\" From the sound of Reba's voice, one can tell that she really enjoys singing this one, perhaps it's that she has a new husband. For those of you who don't know, Reba married her manager Narvel Blackstock July 1 in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. Reba A l/M S llO IJ V n i|.V f* P K T H \u00abK S I W Strauss as conductor Dyer's Wife is still less strained than her Brunnhilde. Both Muff and Berry are attractive singers for the role of the patient hus\u00ad band. Barak, with Muff providing the younger and warmer sound. But neither rivals the greatest of his predecessors. For them you must go to either Bohn's timate lieder singer, but never a Brunn\u00ad hilde or Isolde. Nilsson is at least bet\u00ad ter (more in tune and more supple) than she was here five years later, but it is still an over-blown approach. Vinzing's rendition of the Dyer's Wife shows that she was a lyric pushed into parts too heavy for her. Such over-extension rob\u00ad bed the warmth from her voice, but herfirst set on London or to Joseph Keilberth's on DG. But before we get to those works, we need to look at another CD set, which has popped up recently in the stores; Herbert von Karajan's live performance from Vienna. 1964 (Nuova Era). It is the most cut of the series, and Karajan even takes it upon himself to rearrangethe scenes in the second act. but there are moments of such inspired lyricism that you want to reach out and kiss the old man. When Barak, for example, explains to his brothers that his wife is bitter not from shrewishness but from the hardness of her life. Karajan and a young Berry shape the passage with an unsurpassed melodic surge. Karajan also has the only singer who brings to the pan of Barak's Wife the right vocal equipment. Christa Ludwig's voice is a fountain of beauty, and her characterization is marvelously apt. It is a performance not to be miss\u00ad ed. For those who want just a taste of it. there is a big chunk of the third act that Ludwig and Berry recorded for Seraphim in 1967, but it's hard to find. Even for Karajan Rysanek took some time to warm up, so if you want to hear the great diva at her best \u2014 and it is an awesome performance \u2014 you must either wait for London to reissue the 1955 Bohm performance on CD or go out searching for the LPs in used record stores. Here there is a delicacy of ap\u00ad proach. mixed with that shining top. for which Rysanek is best remembered. Unfortunately Christel Goltz had sung too many Elektras before she tackled the Dyer's Wife. But Paul Schoeffler is a noble Barak, and Bohm has the singers completely under his will. The result is Straussian music-drama of the highest order. The only other set. Keilbenh's live performance from Munich, 1%3. is. like Karajan's exten\u00ad sively cut. but it does boast an extraor\u00ad dinarily warm and compelling pair of earthly lovers in Inge Borkh and Fischer-Dieskau.of the cuu she co-svrote, entitled \" It Always Rains on Saturday,\" is a definite torch song worthy of a music video and some good airplay, be sure to request this one to your local disc jockey, when you're gettin' that lovin' feelin'.On down the line of the album, \" Am I the Only One Who Cares?\" will be a good song for a little shadow dancin', this one was also co-written by Reba. \" Somebody Up There Likes Me,\" is a little more of an uptempoed two- steppin' song for you to really strut your stuff. Side two has a couple that really stick out. \"Say the Word\" is an instrumental that will get those toes a tappin', and put you in a festive country mood. Now for you swingin' cowboys and girls, you will really get a whirl outand Narvel are expecting a little critter sometime in March. Don't panic, in a recent interview she said that she would keep on touring right up until the little one arrives.The Country Music Awards show is scheduled for October 9 on CBS. Reba has been nominated again for CMA's Entertainer Of The Year. And of course she has also been nominated for CMA's Female Vocalist of the Year. As a final note, everyone that does not already own Reba's \" Sweet Sixteen\" should run, don't walk and get the first copy you can get your hot little hands on. Expect good things from this one.

And given the trend over the last three years of theatres closing\u2014S.F. Repertory, One-Act Second Stage, and then the One- Act Theatre itself, Bannam Place, etc., etc.\u2014this is significant news. The Hungry Id Theatre is an intimate space (about 70 seats) located in the basement of Sporty's Bar, next to Banducci's Restaurant\u2014on Broadway\u2014in North Beach. So get there early, have a drink or dinner and then venture down the stairs to North Beach Repertory's hot, hot, HOT production of F ool fo r L ove by Sam Shepard.The Mojave Desert and a seedy motel room with greenish walls and yellow door bring together a natural wasteland and a man-made one to provide the set\u00ad ting for two of life-and-love's human flotsam. May (Edith Bryson) and Eddie (An\u00ad thony St. Martin) alternately sweet-talk and scream, cling and claw, love and hate. T h ro i^ the course of the play, they come together only to separate again and again. \" We're connected. May,\" Eddie ex\u00ad plains. \" We got a pact.\" And con\u00ad nected they most certainly are. Though they sprang from different mothers, they have a father in common. That makes May a half-sister to Eddie. \" Which h if? \" asks Martin, May's would-be date for the evening. And when he learns that May and Eddie have \" fooled around\" Martin rather stupidly mutters, \" That's illegal, isn't it?\" It might be, but these two can't control their grasping hands. \" We couldn't breathe without thinking about each other.\" Bryson and erode Bryson (recendy seen as Estelle in N o Exit at the Phoenix Theatre) embodies an ear\u00ad thy, sensuous May who spreads her legs, hugs walls and definitely means \" yes\" when she screams \" no.\" 1 mean, if you're trying to keep your homy brother away from you, would you slip into a clingy red dress? Well? The significance of St. Martin's opening scene is somewhat ambiguous. He sen\u00ad sually rubs a brown leather glove then \" rides\" in slow modon a chair as if it were a bucking bronco. Very sexy in tight jeans with ankles to the wind, but what's the point? But once the play gets rolling, his portrayal of the lusty.wandering rodeo performer/cowboy is powerful\u2014rippling with internal ten\u00ad sions and external intensides. Also ex\u00ad cellent, though in smaller roles are Bill Hall as the Old Man and Richard Lind- strom as Martin. A superb production for a company created to focus on the work of the actor.North Beach Repertory is almost as new as their playing space. This small coalition of students from the Jean Shelton acting school first gathered in a basem ent in June 1988. Their workshop, dedicated to strengthening stage<rajl technique, focused on the basics of Stanislavski's Method. St. Martin had studied with Stella Adler (internationally famous for her insights into the Method) and acted Off- Broadway before returning to San Francisco vvith a sense of purpose. \" Our goal is to continue to develop as an ensemble, and, through careful play selection, create a style of theatre which is not only entertaining and pro\u00ad vocative, but also believable.\" After eight months, a company was formed whose \" emphasis is on actors' discovery rather than directorial con\u00ad cept.\" And little more than a year from its inception, NRT isstill in a basement (albeit one more accommodating to au\u00ad diences), but now it is the well- appointed, subterranean Hungry Id Theatre. Linda Pacino and Margie Prat- chenko both make their directorial debuts mFool/or Love. Their approach is appropriately simple. This works well with the company's goals as well as Shepard's script which demands un\u00ad pretentious staging but complex psychological homework on the parts of the actors. As a result, each moment grows from the words of Sam ShepardAnthony St. Marlin and Edith Bryson in San Shepard's Fool For iMve. and the ntinds of these powerful actors. True to North Beach style, the Hungry Id Theatre is flashy, complete with a full-sized sports car (remember, we are directly below Sporty's Bar) suspended from the ceiling directly over the heads of the audience. Of course, given my preference (m light of recent, much less perpetual, local earthquakeactivity). I'd rather sit through a show without a car hanging over my head, but flash is flash. Motor vehicle aside, the theatre space is long and narrow, adorned along one side with a genuine, old-fashioned brick wall. With less than ten rows of less than ten seats each, there's not a bad seat in the house. So check out one of San Francisco'snewest theatrical production companies in the City's newest theatre.

Antoine uses Dominique to explore his own sadistic tendencies. Domini\u00ad que's massages are brutal. Often leav\u00ad ing Antoine bloody and bruised. Finally the boss walks in on them and finds Dominique holding Antoine down on the table while he beats him. He throws the two out. Antoine is hospitalized. And it is here that the movie finally picks up. Dominique sneaks Antoine out of the hospital. The two get a hotel room together (where they sleep in separate beds) and the beatings continue until Dominique leaves. Antoine becomes sicker and sicker. When Dominique returns he says to him, \" Hit me Dominique, hit me as hard as you can,\" Dominique obliges and expresses his only feeling throughout the film, that he is afraid. The fact the movie is in black and white adds credibility to its almostFrancis Frappat from Noir et Blanc. unbelievable premise. Through this technique Devers manages to create an eerie feeling throughout the film that evokes some degree of emotion allowing her to push sado-masochism to its darkest limits. What's most disturbingabout this film is its ending. Without giving it away. I'll only say that there is a lot more to little Antoine than anyone expects.

The American champions, from Trumbull, Connecticut, which is, I am proud to say a suburb of my home town. . . nobody makes winners like Bridgeporters. won the world crown by defeating the talented Taiwanese youngsters 5 to 2. Teams from Taiwan had won the last three Little League World Series and 18 of the last 22. This year's Taiwanese team hadn't given up a run during their pre<hampionship games and were heavy favorites to defend their cham\u00ad pionship. It didn't turn out that way. The American kids did us proud. While watching and sharing in the pride and joy of their families and friends I was carried back to two similar victories that 1 had shared with gay ballplayers and their friends and families. 1 was reminded of the day in June of 1974 when our Twin Peaks team beat the S.F. Police 9 to 4 and a late August afternoon in 1983 when my 'Sidetrack'team from Chicago won the NAGAAA gay 'World Series'. Both times our fans cried and jumped with joy while the players and I pound\u00ad ed and pushed each other all over the field much like the Trumbull team and their followers did in Williamsport, PA. I thought how alike we all are . . . If only we would all remember that. Rather than stress the differences in our lifestyles we should emphasize the sameness. Only together can all San Franciscans ensure an economically healthy and socially comfortable city. We must stand as a unit to meet the awesome responsibility of the AIDS crisis as well as of the homeless and theinsidious crack epidemic running ram\u00ad pant across our neighborhoods.Everything cannot be painted 'gay or straight' . What is good for the city is good for all of us. If you think 1 am leading up to the China Basin Ball Park Issue you are right. Proposition 'P ' can and would stand on its own two feet among gay voters without coupling it with 'our' Proposition S on Domestic Partnerships. However there is absolutely nothing wrong or sinister with voters not par\u00ad ticularly interested in one or the other of the questions deciding to vote for Pro\u00ad position 'P ' because he or she believes it will bring in votes on Proposition 'S' . . . or vice versa. Politics is a lot like baseball . . you play to win. And winning politics means geting the most votes . . Any legal way you can. The alternative . , as Harry Truman would say. .is to get out of the kitchen.For all those doomsayers and effete politico types who think that the Ball Park issue is of no interest to gays in general, Irene suggests you get off your high horse and talk to the people for whom you presume to speak. Last Sun\u00ad day 1 spent a few hours interviewing and getting signatures in M .i'ivr at Mayor Agnos' ball park proposal.Without one referral to buying 'Part\u00ad ners' votes and with only seven refusals Irene garnered 100 signatures and could have had at least seventy more. Those gays who keep insisting that keeping the Giants is not a gay concern are doing all of us a disservice.- Gays are a diverse community with tastes and needs that are as varied as the straight community. Noone, including Irene, should or can speak for everyone.If you disagree with any Proposition that is your prerogative. But don't vilify those who disagree. Be positive not negative in opposing any proposition that will effect all of us. The most unfair tactic that anti-ball park people are using is that of con\u00ad tinual raising the specter of AIDS and the cost of combatting it as if any one for the Ballpark is insensitive to that problem. It is cruel. 1 have lost so many friends, including my and Harry's brother and have so many now living with AIDS that it is without heart to in\u00ad sinuate that 1 or others are not concern\u00ad ed. My answer is quite simple. A city cannot carry the present upcoming burden of AIDS funding unless it is fiscally sound. I believe that San Francisco will be better off financiallywith the new Ball Park and the Giants than we would be without them. None in opposition has shown me any figures to the conUary. And while 1 am at it. Let me ask a question. Presume that the nay-sayers win and there is no China Basin ballpark. Will the out-of-state developers who seek to inundate China Basin with 'Market-value' housing . . . themselves . not affordable . . . put aside housing units for AIDS Hospices or otherwise contribute monies or rent- subsidies for AIDS patients? 1 think not.1 also agree that such an idea might be impractical and a little unfair but it certainly is as reasonable a point as those being made by the opponents. If someone has genuine information showing that the AIDS situation will be worse, financially speaking, because of the new ballpark, let them quote specifics and not throw out scare figures.Both propositions should be judged on their merits. . if that is done I hope they will both come up winners. *** * Till next time, keep winning. And remember, if you can't play a sport, be one.

The two are tied to opposite ends of the same rope to ensure each other's safety. A strong bond, built on trust and interdependence, emerges as they continue the ascent. A blur of physical exertion, delicate movement, fear and exhilaration fill them as they face the unique challenge of the vertical worid. FinaOy the top is reached with a feeling of satisfaction and pride. A handshake. An embrace. For years gay climbers have shared these powerful experiences, but seldom with other gay climbers. Until this year. Earlier this summer gay, lesbian and bisexual climbers from Masssachusetts, Rhode Island, Washington D.( ..Penn\u00ad sylvania and Texas gathered at the Shawangunks, a major East Coast climbing area I'/j hours from New York City, to found Stonewall Climbers. Climbers from more distant places\u2014 Ontario, Minnesota, Califor\u00ad nia\u2014while not in attendance, soon enlisted.Many of the founding members had previously climbed together, sometimes driving hundreds of miles to explore new climbing areas. For dedicated climbers, distance is no object. Each classic climbing area has its own per\u00ad sonality and characteristic features: cracks or overhanging ceilings, low-A stonewall climber scaling the heights al the Shawangunks. angle slabs or vertical walls. Climbers love to visit areas that differ from their local haunts. It made sense to form a club to publicize trips happening all over. According to John Yanson, the club's public relations officer, \" Our in\u00ad tent is to serve as an umbrella group to encourage climbing within the structure of local gay and lesbian outdoor organizations. Virtually every major U.S. and Canadian city (and many European and Australian cities) have such groups which sponsor an array of outdoor activities\u2014hiking, biking, ski\u00ad ing, white water canoeing, etc. For many of these activities it's easy to find enough interested people locally to run trips. But for climbing\u2014particularly iceclimbing\u2014we have to look beyond our own back yards.\" Climbing trips planned for the near future include a trip to the Banff area in the Canadian Rockies near Calgary and a climb in the Joshua Tree National Monument Park in Southern Califor\u00ad nia, both in November of this year. Carla-Krystin Andrade, president of Out & Out (the Toronto outings group), who was elected to the Stonewall Climbers executive committee in absen\u00ad tia, sent a clear message to new members, \" There are gay climbers everywhere\u2014we just need to get the word out!\" Write to Stonewall Climbers at P.O.
