UNM is committed to maintaining affordable, quality healthcare for employees. The UNM Medical Plan is self -insured , mean ing UNM is responsible for paying medical and prescription drug claims incurred by Participants. Over 90% of the premiums paid by UNM and employees pay for claims costs. Administrative costs account for less than 10% of the premiums paid by UNM and employees. Administrative costs include expenses for contracting with Third Party Administrators and UNM's Pharmacy Benefits Manager for claims processing, provider network contracting, customer service , and other services . UNM contracts with Presbyterian Health Plan (PHP) as your Third Party Admin istrator (TPA) for the administration of your medical benefits . Your TPA act s on behalf of the Plan in administering your medical benefits based on the Plan provisions outlined in your Participant Benefit Booklet (PBB) . Your PBB describes the benefits and limitations of the Plan. It explains how to file claims (if applicable), how to request review of a claim, or file a claim appeal or grievance . As healthcare costs continue to increase nationally and regulatory oversight grows through Healthcare Reform, healthcare plans are becoming more complex. It is vital for UNM Medical Plan Participants to read the PBB carefully in its entirety to ensure that they maximize their UNM Medical Plan benefits . UNM contracts with CVS Caremark as its Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM). Please refer to your CVS Caremark Benefit Booklet for det ail information about your prescriptio n drug benefits. The CVS Caremark Benefit Booklet is available on the UNM Division of Human Resources website at: https://hr.unm.edu/benefits/pres criptions . Please take the time to read the PBB care fully and keep it in a safe place for future reference. Your PBB is also available online at https://hr.unm.edu or at www.phs.org. If you have questions, please refer to the Contact Infor mation section on page four. It is best to call for clarification before services are rendered to ensure proper Plan procedures are followed in order to afford you with the maximum level of benefits available under the Plan.CONTACT INFORMATION ______________________________ ____________ 2 When you have questions about your Plan, knowing your resources is the best way to proactively ensure efficient use of your Plan and resolve issues quickly.

The plan, which covers the Participant as a Dependent, pays second. Birthday Rule for Dependent children of parents not separated or divorced. The plan, which covers th e parent wh ose birthday falls earlier in the year, pays first. The pl an, which covers the parent whose birthday falls later in the year, pays second. The birthday order is determined by the month and the day of birth, not the year of birth. FILING CLAIMS ___________________________ _______________ 86 If both parents have the s ame month and day of birth, the plan that covered the parent longer, will pay claims first. The plan, which covered the parent for a shorter period of time, pays second. Dependent children of separated or divorced parents.

In the case of a Participant who is the contract holder under more than one Employer health insurance policy, then the plan that ha s covered t he Participant for a longer period of time will pay first. The start of a new plan does not include a change of insurance carrier by the employer. No Coordination Provision. In spite of rules listed above the plan that has no provision regarding coordinati on of benefits will pay first. If a Participant is covere d under a motor vehicle or homeowners insurance policy which provides benefits for medical expenses resulting from a motor vehicle accident or accident in the Participant's own home, the Participant shall not be entitled to benefits under this Plan for inj uries arising out of such accident to the extent they are covered by their motor vehicle or homeowners insurance policy. If such benefits have been provided by you, your TPA shall have th e right to recover any benefits provided from the motor vehicle or ho meowner's insurer or the Participant to the extent they are available under the motor vehicle or homeowner's insurance policy. In no event shall the benefits received under this Plan and all other p lans combined exceed the total reasonable actual expenses for the services provided under this Plan.

Medicaid Benefits payab le by this Plan on behalf of an Enrollee who is qualified for Medicai d will be paid to the state Human Services Department, or its designee, when: The Human Services Department has paid or is paying benefits on behalf of the Enrollee under the state's Medi caid progra m pursuant to Title XIX and/or Title XXI of the Federal So cial Security Act. The payment for the services in question has been made by the state Human Services Department to the Medicaid Provider/Practitioner. Subrogation (Recovering Healthcare Expenses fr om Others) The benefits under this Plan will be available to a Participant who is injured by the act or omission of another person, firm, operation or entity. If a Participant receive s benefits under this Plan for treatment of such injuries, your Plan will be subrogated to the rights of the Participant or the Per sonal Representative of a deceased Participant, or Dependent Participant, to the extent of all such payments made by your Plan for such benefits. This means that if your Plan provides or pays benefi ts, you must repay the Plan the amounts recovered in any l awsuit, settlement, or by any other means. This rule applies to any and all monies a Participant may receive from any third party or insurer, or from any uninsured or underinsured motoris t insurance benefits, as well as from any other person, organization or entity. By way of illustration only, your Plan's right of subrogation includes, but is not limited to, the right to be repaid when a Participant recovers money for personal injury sust ained in a car accident. The subrogation right applies whether the Pa rticipant recovers directly from the wrongdoer or from the wrongdoer's insurer, or from the Participant's uninsured motorist insurance coverage. The Participant agrees to sign and deliver to the TPA, on FILING CLAIMS ___________________________ _______________ 88 behalf of the Plan, such documents and papers as may be necessary to protect the Plan's subrogation right. The Participant also agrees to keep the TPA advised of: Any claims or lawsuits made against any person, firm or entity responsible for any injuries for which the Plan has paid benefits . Any claim or l awsuit against any insurance company, or uninsured or underinsured motorist insurance carrier. Settlement of a legal claim or controversy without prior notice to your TPA, on the Plan's behalf, is a violation of this Plan. In the event a Participant fails to cooperate with the TPA or takes any action, through agents or otherwise, to interfere with the exercise of the Plan's subrogation right, the Plan may recover its benefit payments from that Partic ipant. When reasonable collection costs and reasonable leg al expenses have been incurred in recovering sums which benefit both the Participant and the Plan, the Plan will, upon request by the Participant or the Participant's attorney, share such collection costs and legal expenses, in a manner that is fair and eq uitable, but only if the plan receives appropriate documentation of such collection costs and legal expenses. Appeals and Grievance s Appeals Your TPA will administer Level I and Level II appeals on behalf of the Plan according to the procedures set forth b elow. These procedures apply to appeals of adverse benefit determinations based on medical necessity, appropriateness, healthcare setting level of care, effectiveness of a Covered Service , and/or re scission of coverage in the event of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact. ( Note : your TPA responds to all urgent or expedited requests within 24 hours of receiving the request) . Level I Appeals To initiate a Level I appeal, a Plan Part icipant (all references to Participant in the Appeals and Grievance section of the PBB include the Employee and/or covered Dependent(s)) must submit a request for an appeal to the TPA within 180 days of receipt of a notice of denial of items or services un der the Plan.

Time frames for Processing Appeals of Adverse Determinations : Level I appeals inv olving the review of a denial of coverage for services bef ore they are received (pre -service) will be completed within 15 calendar days of FILING CLAIMS ___________________________ _______________ 89 receipt of a standard appeal request. Appeals involving the review of a denial of coverage of services aft er they are received (post -service) will be completed within 40 calen dar days. The TPA may extend the review period for a maximum of 10 calendar days for pre -service requests and 20 calendar days for post - service requests if the TPA can: 1) Show reasonable c ause beyond the TPA's control for the delay . 2) Show that the delay will not result in increased medical risk to the Participant . 3) Provide a written progress report to the Participant and the related provider within the 25 -day or 60 -day review period. Particip ants must agree, in writing, to a request to extend a deadline. Some appeals of pre -service denials relating to claims involving urgent care are processed on an expedited basis. Expedited decisions are made when a Participant's life or health, or ability t o regain ma ximum function, would be jeopardized by following the stan dard appeal process and time frames; or, in the opinion of a provider with knowledge of the Participant's medical condition, would subject the Participant to severe pain that cannot be ad equately ma naged without the care or treatment that is the subject of the claim. In cases that require an expedited decision of a pre -service request, based at the request of a participating provider or Participant, a decision will be made within 72 hour s of the re ceipt of the request. The TPA will not conduct expedited appeals for services already provided (\"post service\") to a Participant. If a Participant requests an expedited decision, the TPA medical director will review the request. If the medical d irector det ermines that the request for an expedited appeal is medica lly necessary, a decision will be made within 72 hours of the request. All required information will be transmitted between the TPA, the applicable provider, and the Participant by the qu ickest mean s possible. If the medical director determines that a requ est for an expedited appeal is not medically necessary, the TPA will notify the applicable Participant and then process the appeal within 15 calendar days. Internal Review of Appeal of Adverse De termination by Medical Director Level I : The appeal will b e reviewed by the TPA medical director not involved in the initial determination, nor by a subordinate of the person resolving the claim initially. The medical director will re -review th e request t o make a determination regarding whether the requested hea lthcare services are medically necessary and covered under the Plan. If medical judgment is involved, the TPA medical director will utilize input from a healthcare professional with train ing and exp erience in the relevant field. Notice of Decision on Appe al of Adverse Determination by Medical Director : FILING CLAIMS ___________________________ _______________ 90 If the medical director decides to reverse an initial adverse determination, the TPA will approve coverage of the services.

Written notification must be provided in a linguistica lly appropriate manner. The notice will provide the opport unity to request diagnosis and treatment codes and their meanings.

If the Participant does not wish to pursue the appeal, the TPA will mail to the participant written n otification of the decision and confirmation of the Participant's decision not to pursue the appeal within three calendar days of the Medical Director's decision. If the TPA is unable to contact the Participant by telephone within 72 hours after making the decision to uphold the initial adverse determination, then the TPA will notify the Participant by mail of the decision.
