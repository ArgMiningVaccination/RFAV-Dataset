The bivalent COVID vaccine is not currently available in our clinics, but patients can stop in the pharmacy before or after their visit to receive their vaccine. The bivalent COVID vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna brands) offer increased protection against the Omicron subvariants of COVID (which are the current common strains). As a result, the monovalent vaccines (the original vaccines) are no longer authorized for use as boosters because they have been replaced by the bivalent vaccines. Monovalent vaccines are no longer available in our MFA clinics. We recommend the bivalent COVID vaccine for ALL patients and recommend they get it when it becomes available, wherever it is offered. Patients must wait at least two months from their last COVID vaccine to get this booster. Either brand is an acceptable option, regardless of the brand you received for your prior doses. Note: The GW MFA COVID-19 vaccine clinic is now closed and no longer offering COVID vaccines. To find a vaccine center in your area, please "}
