Are you having trouble sleeping, or are you facing digestive issues? Is chronic fatigue making everyday life difficult? If so, you may have a build-up of toxins in your body. At the Mindful Healing Clinic, Dr. Maria offers naturopathic detoxification services which may help with a variety of health conditions. Why Detox? As humans, we evolved to live in harmony with the natural world. Our organs are designed to take care of the toxins commonly found in nature. But the toxins we face today are hardly natural. These toxins are often present from birth. In fact, many known toxins - more than 200 of them - were found in the umbilical cords of newborn babies, [according to a study](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/newborn-babies-chemicals-exposure-bpa/) by the Environmental Working Group (EWG). The presence of these toxins can have wide-ranging health effects for young children and adults alike. Research has associated them with increased risk of: - Obesity - Certain types of cancer - Diabetes - Thyroid disorders - Reproductive issues - Sexual dysfunction - Heart disease - And much more However, there are naturopathic solutions which may help you reduce or eliminate some of these toxins in your body and live a happier, healthier life. Here are some of the more common toxins you may find in the modern world, called the \"dirty dozen\". Naturopathic Bisphenol-A (BPA) Detoxification BPA is a chemical additive to many different plastics used to make containers stronger and longer lasting. It's also used in many cash register receipts, and to make epoxy and other resins. BPS and BPF are often used as alternatives to BPA but have similar effects - so purchasing BPA-free plastics may not cut it. If you take a look at your plastic containers and see the number 3 or 7 beside the recycling symbol, there's a good chance it has BPA in it. So why is this important? BPA can imitate the hormone estrogen in your body. This means it bonds with your body's estrogen receptors, which increases your risk of many different disorders, including: - PCOS - Infertility (in males and females) - Breast cancer - Prostate cancer - Obesity - Heart disease - Disruptions during puberty In general, avoiding BPA products is a good idea. However, Dr. Maria also offers natural detoxification services which may reduce the amount of BPA in your system and, as a result, your risk of developing the above disorders. Contact the Mindful Healing Clinic to find out more. Natural Dioxin Detoxification Dioxins are highly toxic substances that are produced as a by-product of some industrial processes as well as natural disasters like forest fires and volcanoes. [According to the World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs225/en/), 419 different types of dioxins have been found, with 30 of them presenting the largest health hazard. Because dioxins are fat-soluble substances, they can remain in your body for a long time, up to 11 years. The presence of dioxins has been associated with certain types of cancer, as well as reproductive issues, developmental issues in children, and a weakened immune system. While the presence of dioxins is concerning, Dr. Maria offers detox plans that can help you reduce the presence of dioxins in your life. Natural Atrazine Detoxification Atrazine is a substance used in many weed killers and pesticides. It's most commonly used for lawn and turf areas like public parks and golf courses, as well as on corn. In humans, it's linked with reproductive problems, birth defects in newborns, and certain types of cancer. However, it's likely we don't fully understand its effects. Atrazine has also been shown to actually change the sex of frogs from male to female. That may sound bizarre, but it has been confirmed by many scientific studies. Here are four examples of such studies: [Atrazine feminizes sex ratio in Blanchard's cricket frogs (Acris at concentrations as low as 0.1 g/L.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29028124) [Atrazine-induced hermaphroditism at 0.1 ppb in American leopard laboratory and field evidence.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12676617) [Effects of nitrate and atrazine on larval development and sexual differentiation in the northern leopard frog Rana pipiens.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16494226) [Hermaphroditic, demasculinized frogs after exposure to the herbicide atrazine at low ecologically relevant doses.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11960004). Atrazine detoxification may help you eliminate this substance from your body. Natural Phthalate Detoxification Phthalates are chemicals commonly used to soften plastics and vinyl, and to make cosmetics last longer. You might find them in vinyl flooring, siding, or blinds, raincoats, PVC products, detergents, adhesives, shampoos and other personal care products, and in baby toys made before 1999. The health impacts of phthalates are still being studied, but some are known to disrupt your endocrine system and have been linked with cancer and sexual and reproductive failure. They also send a signal to your body's cells triggering apoptosis, or cell death, [according to this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27581038). Dr. Maria offers solutions which may help you reduce the amount of phthalates in your system. Natural Perchlorate Detoxification Perchlorate is found naturally in small quantities, but it's mostly a by-product of rocket fuel, signal flares, missiles, fireworks, and other explosives. Because of its widespread use, mainly by military activities, perchlorates are present in just about everybody's bloodstream today. They've been identified as carcinogenic and can also interfere with your endocrine and reproductive system. However, natural perchlorate detoxification may help you reduce the level of this substance in your body and decrease your risk of developing health complications. Natural PBDE Detox PBDE stands for polybrominated diphenyl ethers. These substances are added to a wide range of consumer goods, including clothes, cell phones, remote controls, computer components, paint, foam cushioning, and carpet padding, among others. Their main purpose is to help make these products flame retardant. While most countries are either phasing out the use of these - or have banned them completely - a large number of products still contain them. Research is still ongoing as to the effects of PBDEs on the body. However, there's good reason to suspect they're linked with reproductive and neurological failures, decreased thyroid and endocrine function, liver damage, skin irritation, diabetes, and a weakened immune system. Flushing these chemicals from your system may help reduce your risk of the above issues. Natural Lead Detox Lead is a substance which is extremely harmful to nearly every part of your body. Lead exposure has been associated with increased risk of a long list of health concerns, including: - Neurological defects - Chronic fatigue - Chronic headaches - Irritability - Memory loss - High blood pressure - Heart disease - Kidney disease - Fertility issues - Cancer Thankfully, lead has been banned from most commercial goods. However, there is still enough lead in the environment that lead poisoning is possible. Natural Arsenic Detoxification Arsenic is a heavy metal element found naturally in many locations, but it's also used in the manufacturing of electronics and lasers, and was used in the past as a pesticide. Arsenic was known as the \"king of poisons, and the poison of kings\" because of its deadliness as well as its common use as an agent to assassinate kings. This is due to its lack of taste or odour. Arsenic poisoning can cause a variety of health problems, including lower IQ, birth defects, and higher risk of cancer and heart disease, and in large enough doses, death. Natural Detoxification For Other Substances As well as the above substances, there are many others you may need to detoxify from your body. These include: - Mercury - PFC's (perfluorinated chemicals) - Dichlorobenzene - Toluene - Glycol ethers - Styrene How To Know If You Need A Detox Each of the above substances comes with its own list of symptoms, so it's difficult to say. However, it's nearly impossible to avoid some of these, since they're in the air we breathe every day. These toxins have, though, been linked with many chronic diseases. If you're dealing with a chronic illness, a detox plan may help. The first step in a detox is to limit your exposure to new sources of the chemical affecting you. Dr. Maria can help you identify the major culprits in your life. From there, Dr. Maria can offer a plan designed to support your liver as it filters the toxins from your body, as well as the kidneys, digestive system, lymphatics, and skin. Each of these is considered an organ of elimination, since it plays a role in removing waste from your body.
