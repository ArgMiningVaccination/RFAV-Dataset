Success in India was the most remarkable milestone, deemed \"magnicent\" by the Independent Monitor- ing Board (IMB) of the GPEI. Long considered one of the most challenging countries in which to eradicat e polio, India accomplished what the IMB called the \"s ys- tematic enforcement of best practice\" to reach over 9 8% of children with polio vaccine. The country freed it self of endemic polio and nally laid to rest the question of whether polio eradication is technically feasible. Globally, polio cases fell to half the level of the previous year. In two of the four countries with re-established transmission of polio, no cases have been reported in the Republic of South Sudan and in Angola since June 2009 and July 2011, respectively. In the other two, Chad geo- graphically restricted polio in the second half of the year and cases plummeted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, after aggressive response to exten- sive outbreaks in early 2011. All of the eight outbreaks recorded in previously polio-free countries were successfully stopped, all but one within six months. On the other side of the scales, the three remaining endemic countries 2012witnessed an unexpected and serious upsurge of polio. In Nigeria and Paki- stan, the continued circulation of two wild poliovirus serotypes - and a vaccine- derived poliovirus in the former - had the rip- ple effect of international spread to two neighbours. In Afghanistan, the number of cases also increased, with the national programme unable to reach enough children to stop outbreaks in the insecure Southern Region. At the end of 2011, the three endemic countries were off-track for eradicating polio. The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) warned in Oc- tober 2011 that polio eradication would not be achieved on the programme's current trajectory. In November, a n alarmed Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immu- nization (SAGE) warned that failure to eradicate pol io would constitute a failure of public health. By Janu ary 2012, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Execu- tive Board had called for polio eradication to be decl ared a programmatic emergency for global health. Completing polio eradication is now a global emergency because of the clear - and, as stated by SAGE - \"unac- ceptable\" consequences of failure. The children of Nige- ria, Pakistan and Afghanistan bear the brunt of current polio transmission, but the consequences reach much farther. In recent years, the international spread of polio has become deadlier. Recent outbreaks on three conti- nents -Tajikistan, Congo and China, all far from polio- endemic areas - paralysed mostly adults. In some of these outbreaks, half the affected adults died. When the virus affects adults who have grown up in previously polio-free countries and have received little or no vaccination, it kills far more frequently. These consequences have triggered emergency actions among countries and the interna- tional polio partners. The Global Polio Emergency Action Plan 20122013, and the revised national emergency action plans that underpin it, capture the fundamental changes that polio- INDIA POLIO- affected countries and their partners are making in their approach and FREE structure, to ultimately bring about po- lio eradication. Compounding this emergency is a 50% gap in nancing needed to fully carry out the necessary ac tivi- ties in 20122013 (as of April 2012). In the rst quar- ter of 2012, this has already dictated the scale-bac k of activities in 24 countries in Asia and Africa, incr easing the risk of unchecked spread if poliovirus from endem ic areas enters these countries. The emergency eradication programme is about speed, focus and most of all accountability. From heads of state to chiefs of multilateral agencies and donors, from parent to vaccinator, every link in the chain must be tempered and strengthened to bring about a polio-free world.

GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 7 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE Stopping transmission of polioviruses 1 | On track: India, the Republic of South Sudan and outbreaks India, the Republic of South Sudan and all polio-fr ee countries that reported outbreaks following impo rtations ended 2011 on track to meet the milestones set out in the GPEI Strategic Plan 2010-2012. With no new c ases since January 2011, India appears to have stopped t he transmission of indigenous wild poliovirus. Sout h Sudan last recorded a case in June 2009, and all new outb reaks save one (Mali) caused by poliovirus spread f rom an endemic area were stopped within six months. India Situation When 2011 began, India was mopping up a persistent trickle of polio cases in West Bengal. Although no cases had been reported in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, India's last endemic states, since April and September 2010 respec- tively, the outbreak in West Bengal had proved tenacious. Poliovirus originating from Bihar had found under-immu- nized children in northern West Bengal, where immuniz a- tion activities had failed to reach the necessary coverage. Wild Polio Virus Cases in India, 2011 !^ \u0000 \u0001 \u0002 \u0003 \u0004Data at HQ as of 30 April 2012 Wild Polio Virus Type-1 On 13 January 2011, Rukhsar Khatoon, a toddler livi ng in the peri-urban fringes of Kolkata, developed pol io- paralysis. Actions When Rukhsar was infected, India was already imple- menting intense and focused polio eradication ac- tivities, holding local governments responsible for reaching every child during the frequent immunizati on activities. These revolved around: U\u00ca The implementation of a specially developed strat- egy to seek out the traditionally under-served mi- grant, nomadic and mobile populations; U\u00ca The deployment of the formidable apparatus of the National Polio Surveillance Project - a joint proje ct of the Government of India and WHO; U\u00ca The deployment of experienced personnel in target communities to enhance the effectiveness of operations and provide a more comprehensive social mobilization. Rukhsar Khatoon is India's only case of polio in 20 11, an achievement made possible by India's wholehearte d diligence in applying the GPEI Strategic Plan 2010- 2012, as demonstrated by the unprecedented coverage rates of up to 99% achieved in Uttar Pradesh and Bi har, and conrmed by rigorous monitoring and serologic surveys. The central Government: U\u00ca ensured unwavering funding for polio eradication activities, largely through its own funds; and U\u00ca in cooperation with concerned state governments, oversaw the implementation of the Plan at every level, persevering through all obstacles. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 8 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE Outlook There is much work to be done if India is to protect its success. For the entire WHO Region for South-East Asia to be ofcially certied \"polio free\" by January 2014, India will have to remain polio-free for the next two years. Given \"WHO will remove India from the list of countries with active endemic wild poliovirus transmission\" Letter from Director-General of WHO, Margaret Chan, to Minister of Health and Family Welfare Shri Ghulam Nabi Azad , 25 February 2012 Despite enormous challenges - the sheer size and di - that high population immunity is critical in protec ting versity of the population combined with enviro nmen- this achievement, the Government has declared 2012 tal, behavioural and other factors - India, traditi onally the year of intensication of routine immunization. considered one of the toughest places from which t o eradicate polio, has proven its detractors \"This gives us hope that we can nally eradicate wrong.

[...] I commend each one of them for their dedication, commitment and selfless service\" Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the Polio Summit in New Delhi, 25 February 2012 Indian people, but also the rest of the world. Until recently, India was one of the world's main exporters of wild poliovirus, spreading as far away as Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ta - jikistan. The world's largest wild poliovirus reser voir has now been shut down. The IMB's January 2012 report stated that \"success in India [...] shows that unwavering political comm it- ment, outstanding public health leadership, clear l ines of accountability, intolerance of weak performance and the systematic enforcement of best practice can stop polio.\" It now remains to adapt the les- sons learnt from India's polio eradication programme to the world's last three endemic countries. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 9 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE Rukhsar - the face of success ROD CURTIS/UNICEF India's last case of indigenous wild poliovirus, th ree-year-old Rukhsar Khatoon, is carried by her mot her in Howrah, near Kolkata, West Bengal. Rukhsar Khatoon is the face of India's polio eradic ation success the last child to be paralysed by ind ig enous wild poliovirus. Following physiotherapy sess ions at the hospital, Rukhsar is now able to walk a lmost normally and has no pain, although she is unable to run with her siblings. Rukhsar was always a sickly child, so her parents w ere reluctant to allow her to be vaccinated: \"I did n't know what polio was. I thought the polio drops were for general good health,\" her mother, Sabera Bibi, expl ains. While the rest of Sabera's children have received o ral polio vaccine, Rukhsar has never received a sin gle drop. Now Sabera worries what her daughter's future will hold. Married herself at 15, Sabera is concerned ab out her daughter's prospects for schooling and marriage . Abdul, who works in the zari (ne embroidery) ind us try like most of his neighbours, frets about the n ancial costs of Rukhsar's treatments. \"The doctors have been very kind,\" Sabera says, \"but we have to think of the future and our other children.\" When reading charts and trends, it is easy to forge t that each case is a person whose life has been ch anged forever. The vast majority of polio cases are children, ofte n living in the poorest and most marginalised com munities, where there is often no infrastructure fo r those with disabilities. By eradicating polio, we are helping to ensure that thousands of children, who would otherwise have be en paralysed by the disease, can reach their full pote ntial and take their rightful place as productive m embers of their communities. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 10 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE Republic of South Sudan Situation When 2011 dawned on the soon to be Republic of South Sudan, the polio eradication programme was on alert. In December 2010, an environmental sample from a sewer in Aswan, Egypt, had read positive to a form of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) closely relat - ed to a virus last seen in what is now South Sudan in 2008. Sudan, which had put an end to its indigenous transmission in 2004, had been re-infected with WPV 1 originating from Nigeria in 2008, causing the count ry to be classied as having \"re-established transmiss ion\". Cases had been reported in the northern part of Su- dan until June 2009, making the detection, hardly 1 8 months later, of a related virus in Egyptian sewage a cause for concern. Actions In May 2011, the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region deemed con- tinuous undetected polio transmission in Sudan un- likely, rapid assessments having found acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance sufciently sensitive, even among mobile populations. The TAG was instead con- cerned that the virus could still be circulating in South Sudan. As a result: U\u00ca South Sudan and the other countries of the Horn of Africa were advised to undertake a systematic map- ping of populations likely to have been missed by AFP surveillance, polio vaccination rounds and rou- tine immunization in 2011. U\u00ca Additional measures were undertaken to improve the quality of supplementary immunization activi- ties (SIAs) and surveillance. Outlook Meeting again in June 2011, the TAG expressed its satisfaction with the measures undertaken as well a s with the subsequent Sub-national Immunization Days (SNID) conducted in South Sudan. Almost 18 months after WPV1 was detected in Aswan, South Sudan is still polio-free and sewage samples in Egypt have remained negative. Meanwhile, despite uncertainties in the short-term political situation , the Government is committed to: U\u00ca continue supplementary immunization activities, and U\u00ca establish strong routine immunization systems. However, South Sudan's best protection against poli o is to end transmission of the virus in northern Nig eria. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 11 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE New outbreaks Situation In 2011, 79 polio cases were reported during outbre aks compared to 961 in 2010. With transmission halted i n India - one of the world's biggest exporters of pol io- virus - there is now one less source from which wil d poliovirus can spread. The Central African Republic, China, Congo, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea, Mali and Niger all reporte d outbreaks in which the virus had travelled from en- demic areas, and Kenya reported one case. Only Mali failed to stop the outbreak within six months, the limit introduced by the GPEI Strategic Plan 2010-2012. A further 58 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) cases - all of which but two were type 2 serotype - were reported in Afghanistan, the Democratic Repub- lic of the Congo, Niger (where the one reported case was genetically linked to the outbreak in Nigeria), Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen. The bulk was reported in Nigeria where circulating VDPV type 2 transmission is ongoing since 2006. Circulating VDPVs are subject to the same outbreak control measures as wild poliovirus outbreaks, and the rapid implementation of outbreak response strat- egies has been successful in all affected countries, except Nigeria. Outbreak response continued late into 2011 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Yemen. Actions U\u00ca In all, 66 vaccination campaigns were conducted in affected countries in 2011. U\u00ca While two of the outbreaks were considered ongoing as of 12 April 2012 - the Central African Republic (where the most recent case was reported on 8 December 2011) and Niger (12 December 2011) - transmission in these countries has not yet exceeded six months. U\u00ca The IMB's January 2012 Report noted that all out- breaks had been \"strongly dealt with in the main\". Outlook Over the past three years, about half of all wild poliovirus cases reported worldwide occurred in previously polio- free countries as a result of importations from an endemic country. Several lines of defence are in place against the risk and consequences of international spread of polio: China responds to outbreak of polio - A school pupi l is vaccinated with oral polio vaccine in candy-coated formulation. U\u00ca The rst is preventive vaccination to pre-emptively shore up immunity; U\u00ca Once the spread occurs, full implementation of in- ternationally agreed protocols for outbreak respons e help reduce the consequences; U\u00ca Innovative strategies such as the Short Interval Ad - ditional Dose (SIAD) - in which two doses of vac- cine are given in rapid succession - were introduce d in 2011 to strengthen these protocols. Initially co n- ceived to vaccinate children in insecure areas by taking advantage of each opportunity, the SIAD has proven effective in outbreak response as well. U\u00ca Vaccinating children up to 15 years of age or adult s up to 30 (in addition to the traditional children under ve) is another strategy that appears to help raise rapidly the overall immunity in places where it is signicantly lower among older children or young adults, such as in China and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This practice seems to lead to shorter outbreaks infecting less people. U\u00ca Innovative VDPV management is being nalized con- currently with the intensied efforts to eradicate t he remaining strains of wild poliovirus transmission. This is a development on previous strategies, which envisaged dealing with the long-term risks of VDPVs only after certication of polio eradication.

WOLFF GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 12 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE Polio eradication: the gender perspective The intense vaccination schedule and high levels of coverage required for polio eradica tion have ensured an equal vaccination status for girls and boys. However, further scrutiny of the gender perspective in polio eradication reveals an interesting story. In the few areas where endemic polio persists, it is often found among the most socially con servative communities. The house to-house vaccination strategy can come up against local norms that do not allow male vaccina tors to enter a home and vaccinate children or male supervisors or monitors to interact with females in a household. Vaccination, so cial mobilization and monitoring often rely on women. Able to speak woman to woman, mother to mother or grandmother to mother, female vac cinators hold great sway over the process. By showi ng that they are willing to have their own children vac cinated against polio, vaccinators who are mothers demonstrate to wary parents that they have the chil dren's best interests at heart. And in parts of Nigeria, w here the advice of older women is greatly respected , the inclusion of senior women in vaccination teams has a positive effect on the number of parents who want their children to be vaccinated. In India alone, an estimated 80 85% of the 2.3 mill ion vaccinators participating in each round of Nati onal Immunization Days (NIDs) are women they include aux iliary nurse midwives, accredited social health activists (known as ASHAs), employees of the social welfare department (Anganwadi workers) and volun teers. Nearly 70% of the 155 000 supervisors overse eing the work of these vaccinators are also women. In the once traditional polio reservoirs of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, more than 92% of the 128 000 vaccina tion teams include at least one female vaccinator. UNICEF India's 8000-strong Social Mobilization Netw ork, which goes door to door spreading messages about polio and routine immunization, exclusive bre astfeeding, nutrition, hand washing and diarrhoea t reat ment, is made up almost exclusively of women. In Ni geria's Kano, Kebbi and Sokoto states, the 970 soci al mobilizers at the settlement level of the Volunteer Community Mobilizer network are all women. Polio teams do not aim for numbers alone. The recru itment of women is done only when it is appropriate both socially and from a security perspective. In A fghanistan, 12% of those employed during a polio va ccina tion campaign are female, working mostly as volunte ers and supervisors. In many parts of the country, it can be very perilous for a woman to work outside he r home. In Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Federally Administered Tribal Areas and parts of Balochistan, families prefer their children to be vaccinated by women but do not want their own women to work outside the home as vaccinators. So in 2011, while the proport ion of teams with at least one female vaccinator reache d 88% in Punjab, it never and 57% in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan respectively. Measuring the quality of vaccination activities is anot her area where the female workforce is critical. In Nige ria's 12 worst performing states, quality monitoring, both durin g and after a campaign, is conducted by teams com posed almost entirely of women. Kano, for example, has 352 female independ ent monitors and not a single male. The role that women play in polio eradication bene ts not only parents and caregivers but also the wom en themselves. Indeed, the programme has offered many a rare opportunity for professional fullment, as e vi denced by the status of the Lady Health Workers in Pakistan, who enjoy a high level of respect in comm uni ties as health providers.

GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 13 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 2 | Back on track: Angola, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo Angola, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Con go (DRC) are showing the rst signs of victory afte r a year of stalemate and even defeats in their battle again st re-established polio transmission. No cases have been report- ed in Angola since July 2011 and while Chad and the DRC have experienced extensive outbreaks early 201 1, polio has since been geographically contained and transmi ssion appeared to be abating in the second half of the year. Angola Situation Angola reported only ve WPV cases in 2011, a signi- cant decrease compared to the 33 cases in 2010. Four oc- curred in the rst quarter of the year due to re-established WPV1 transmission in the south-east of the country. This particular lineage has not been detected again since March 2011. In July, a single WPV1 case was reported in the northern Uige province, re-introduced from Band- undu and Bas Congo provinces in the neighbouring DRC, where polio transmission was active at the time. Wild Polio Virus Cases in Angola, 2011 \u0005 \u0006 \u0007 \b \u0007Data at HQ as of 30 April 2012 Wild Polio Virus Type-1 Actions This 85% reduction in the number of cases between 2010 and 2011 is the result of tremendous efforts t o improve the coverage and quality of polio eradicati on activities. The nine consecutive SIAs (four NIDs an d ve SNIDs) conducted in 2011 reached more children than ever before because: U\u00ca Strong government leadership was established at the central level, complemented by the decentralization of nancial resources for supplementary activities to the municipal level, and a more systematic engage- ment of traditional and local leaders at ward level in Luanda and Benguela provinces; U\u00ca Innovative and flexible strategies were adopted to reach and vaccinate all targeted children; and U\u00ca Routine immunization services were systematiccally strengthened in 29 municipalities. The results of these campaigns showed around 8% missed children in out-of-house monitoring. Luanda, the historical focus of polio transmission, reporte d between 9% and 20% missed children in five cam- paigns. Outlook Despite this progress, there is a high risk that lo w-level circulation continues in parts of the country or th at the virus could be re-introduced. In 2012, the programm e focuses on: U\u00ca New micro-planning strategies with greater com- munity participation, an approach that has been successful in raising the numbers of immunized children in high-risk communities; U\u00ca Influential voices and inter-personal communication to support social mobilization efforts and advocacy ; U\u00ca Continuous decentralization of coordination and su- pervision to ensure an optimal level of preparation for SIAs as well as better participation, monitorin g and evaluation. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 14 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE UNICEF/ UNICEF/NYHQ2011-0137/WILLIAMS UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake chats with c hildren in Cacuaco municipality on the outskirts of Luanda, the capital, during polio vaccination activities. What lies ahead in Angola depends on maintaining th e trend of local commitment and innovation, specical ly: U\u00ca The leadership of municipal administrators, which will help sustain the good implementation of polio eradication strategies and scale up routine immuni- zation interventions; U\u00ca Logistics, which can help reach scattered popula- tions in some hard-to-reach municipalities and flood-prone areas and which will therefore require particular attention. To ensure nal success, the funding gap must be ll ed. The Government currently covers more than 88% of the operational costs of polio vaccination campaign s. However, the costs for supervision and monitoring in provinces and municipalities, as well as for log is- tics and social mobilization, remain unfunded. On i ts current track, and with sufcient funding, Angola c an close 2012 without poliovirus. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 15 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 Chad Situation 2011 was a difcult year for Chad. The country recorde d 132 cases of polio, nearly a fth of all cases reporte d worldwide and more than in any single year since 2003. The virus also crossed into the Central African Rep ub- lic and Niger shortly after WHO informed its Member States of the risk of international spread from Chad. Chad was affected by two epidemics: a WPV1 outbreak , which started in N'Djamena in September 2010, and a WPV3 outbreak in the eastern district of Am Dam, which started in November 2007 and re-established transmission. Both were caused by importations from Nigeria. Although the second epidemic is considered to be under control (with no cases detected since Marc h 2011), sub-optimal surveillance warrants caution. After a period of high transmission during the rst p art of 2011, the epidemiological situation improved and the number of cases declined by 75% in the second half of the year.

GIBOUX Tailored strategies now focus on reaching populations no matter where they live, including nomadic groups Actions Given the magnitude of the epidemic, President D\u00e9by Itno instituted in August a monthly brieng on the sta- tus of polio eradication during regular meetings re lated to the health sector. In September, Bill Gates, Co- Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, advocated f or national leaders and health ofcials to prioritize polio eradication and routine immunization. In response to this public health emergency, Chad c on- ducted six NIDs and three Local Immunization Days (LIDs) and followed the TAG's recommendation - give n in September 2011 - for the formulation of an exten ded Emergency Plan to cover the period January to June 2012. Following these recommendations: U\u00ca The September and October campaigns gave greater involvement and ownership to central government ofcials and provincial governors; U\u00ca The three-day countrywide immunization strategy was reinstated; U\u00ca WHO and UNICEF stepped up their technical sup- port, setting up six hubs throughout the country and providing nearly 100 polio and communication professionals to improve the planning, coordination and implementation of campaigns; U\u00ca Post-campaign monitoring was strengthened and Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) was intro- duced as a method of quality control after the Octo - ber and November rounds. Outlook Six NIDs and two large-scale SNIDs are planned for 2012, to which more than 100 new staff members from various partners will participate. Effective manage - ment of, and accountability for their performance, is critical. The Emergency Plan outlines a series of s teps to strengthen implementation at the district and su b- district level. They include: U\u00ca the management of partner agency human resource surge; U\u00ca the re-training and re-orientation of government health staff in the provinces; U\u00ca the engagement of nongovernmental organizations active in the provinces; U\u00ca enhanced communications and social mobilization; and U\u00ca careful attention to selection and training of vacc i- nation teams. In 2012, Chad will introduce a number of innovative approaches to complement the eradication effort, su ch as GPS technology to improve micro planning in key high-risk areas. Chad succeeded in putting a stop to polio transmission once before. This success can be repeated presently. To reach that point, the momentum created by the Govern- ment and international partners must continue unabated. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 17 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE Democratic Republic of the Congo Situation Although the level of polio transmission did not va ry much between 2010 (100 cases reported) and 2011 (93 cases), the geographic reach of the virus shrank co n- siderably. Of the 93 cases, 76% occurred in the wes tern provinces of Kinshasa, Bandundu (in a limited zone) and Bas Congo, as well as in the capital city Kinsh asa, which reported 33 cases alone.

It a lso became more focal, so that by the end of 2011 the only rem aining active transmission zone appeared to be in south-ea st Ka- tanga and in neighbouring areas of Maniema. An outbr eak of circulating VDPV type 2 late 2011 further attest s to the poor immunization status in Katanga. The persistence of the outbreak in the west and the cases reported in the east have multiple causes: th e poor quality of campaigns in some areas, pockets of missed villages in remote and difcult-to-reach are as (Katanga, Bandundu) and the refusal of a number of re- ligious sects in some communities of northern Katan ga (although virtually all of these communities accept ed vaccination once contacted).

GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 18 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE Actions Several measures were taken to improve the quality of SIAs conducted in 2011: U\u00ca Consultants were deployed to priority infected ar- eas, with very clear geographic focus (30 consul- tants were in place by the end of the year); U\u00ca The target age for vaccination was raised in places where older children and young adults were affected ; U\u00ca The number of teams was raised in high-risk areas and the quality of transportation improved; U\u00ca Advocacy and information campaigns addressing reli- gious leaders and faith-based refusals were scaled up. At the invitation of President Kabila, WHO Director - General Margaret Chan and UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake visited the country to discus s the support of their agencies to the Government. Outlook If the Government and polio partners commit to trea t- ing 2012 as an emergency, the eradication of polio in DRC may very well become a reality by the end of th e year. Two NIDs and six SNIDs are planned for 2012: U\u00ca Trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) will be used in at least one national and one sub-national round; U\u00ca In areas with recent circulating VDPV transmission, trivalent OPV will be used in multiple rounds; U\u00ca Remaining rounds will be conducted with bivalent OPV to ensure high levels of immunity against the two WPV serotypes. Some areas are difficult to access specially during the rainy season.

Nigeria and Pakistan were the only countries in the world with conrmed WPV3 circulation, Nigeria being also affected by an outbreak of circulating VDPV type 2. Wild polioviruses from Nigeria and Pakistan were also associated with outbreaks in previously polio-free countries. In its February 2012 Report, the IMB said that Pakistan and Nigeria represented the gravest risk to polio eradication. Addressing polio transmission in these three countries must be considered an emergency in 2012. It is from there that polio will continue to spread to polio-free countries.

In the rst t ri- mester, national elections distracted political and civil leadership from focusing on polio eradication. In t he second trimester, a deadly car-bomb attack on the U N House in Abuja struck a terrible blow to the United Nations family (see Box). Finally, increasing insec u- rity during the third trimester, particularly in Ab uja in Borno and Kano States, drastically complicated ongo - ing operations for polio eradication. Nonetheless, immunization coverage has increased in key areas of the northern states. In the 109 know n high-risk local government areas (LGAs), the proportion of children to have received three or more OPV doses rose from 51% in 2010 to 60% in 2011. This gure even reached 79% across the non high-risk LGAs. However, the polio eradication programme continues to miss too many children in key geographic areas and population groups. Despite dozens of vaccination campaigns over the past years, no more than 65% of children have re - ceived four or 11% of children have never received a single dose. The picture is also mixed regarding surveillance. N a- tionally, AFP surveillance remains strong, with a n a-tional non-polio AFP rate of 8.8/100 000 population and a specimen collection rate of 94% in 2011 (see the section Polio surveillance: Chasing down the virus ). While all states have met their operational targets, clus ters of under-performing LGAs remain, as evidenced by the periodic detection of \"orphan\" viruses (viruses sho w- ing genetic evidence of long periods of undetected cir- culation). Although their number has declined betwe en 2010 and 2011, their continued presence is proof of subnational surveillance gaps in key areas and/or p op- ulation groups. Actions Several adjustments were made to address the extern al factors affecting the programme and maintain immuni - zation and surveillance operations: U\u00ca The security situation was evaluated round-the- clock to adapt the day-to-day logistic of operation s; U\u00ca The groundwork was laid for a new emergency ac- tion plan addressing specically operational chal- lenges; U\u00ca Activities focused on improving the implementation of basic polio eradication strategies, in particula r in worst performing areas; U\u00ca Greater effort was put into improving the perfor- mance and motivation of front-line health workers.

OLSEN UN House in Abuja, Nigeria: target of devastating a ttack GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 21 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE At the same time, innovative approaches - when pos- sible optimizing the use of new technologies - were es- tablished to supplement the basic eradication strate gies: U\u00ca The use of geographic information systems (GIS) has improved the mapping and implementation of SIAs while geographic positioning systems (GPS) have helped track the progression of vaccination teams; U\u00ca Special strategies were developed to reach under- served and nomadic population groups; U\u00ca Targeted social mobilization efforts were used to clearly identify the core motives behind ongoing re - sistance to polio immunization in some areas, and t o tailor strategies accordingly; U\u00ca Rapid surveillance reviews were used to strengthen subnational surveillance in areas with identied gaps. Particularly vulnerable areas and populations (nomadic groups and migrants) were given particu- lar emphasis; U\u00ca Environmental surveillance was introduced in Kano to further validate programme performance and provide a clearer epidemiological picture. Outlook Nigeria is treating the setback experienced in 2011 and the persistent spread of polio well into 2012 a s an emergency. The National Polio Emergency Plan was - nalized and ofcially launched by His Excellency Pr es- ident Goodluck Jonathan in March 2012. The Presiden t also announced that US$ 30 million per year would b e made available for polio eradication activities, a clear sign of the country's commitment to end polio trans - mission for good. A Presidential Task Force, chaired by the Minister of State for Health, Dr Mohammad Pate, will oversee the imple- mentation of the plan, of which the main points are: U\u00ca The establishment of state-level task forces mirror - ing the administrative structures at the federal le vel; U\u00ca Close linkages between the national and state task forces to clearly dene indicators at all levels; U\u00ca Active tracking, through the state and national tas k forces, of LGA leadership involvement to ensure ac- countability for programme performance; U\u00ca Proper review, by the state task forces, of prepare d- ness indicators before each SIA and deferral in are as where preparations are not up to scratch. In March 2012, the Expert Review Committee on Polio Eradication and Routine Immunization concluded that Nigeria has all the tools to improve rapidly the qual ity of immunization operations and to eradicate polio, but that success depends entirely on the full and consi stent implementation of the Emergency Plan. This is an op- portunity that Nigeria cannot miss, not only for the s ake for its children, but for that of all children across Africa.

They include a wide range of faith and community based associations, religious leaders and humanitarian institutions.One such im portation new partner is the eminent social worker Abdul Sattar Edhi, founder of the Edhi Foundation. The Edhi Foundation is a trusted non prot or ganization based in Pakistan, specializing in the provision of social services and medical care to the country's most destitute populations. The Edhi Foundation is providing vital assistance to Pakistan's polio eradication effort, by contribut ing vehicles from its fleet of ambulances and xed vaccination posts to advertise and facilitate acces s to polio vaccination. The Edhi Foundation's renown will provide a much needed boost to polio opera tions across Pakistan. Actions Operational challenges continue to hamper the quali ty of immunization and surveillance activities in ende mic transmission areas, preventing Pakistan to reach al l children with OPV. Challenges include: U\u00ca poor management and inadequate commitment and accountability from the leadership at the district and union council levels, and U\u00ca access issues due to insecurity in some areas, nota - bly in FATA. A National Polio Emergency Action Plan was launched early 2011 to address these challenges. Although the Plan received strong support from the national leader - ship, its impact at district level remained limited and its implementation was complicated by the devolution of the Federal Ministry of Health to provincial authorit ies. Outlook To address the increase in polio transmission, the Fed- eral Government has introduced new sweeping chang- es to the country's eradication efforts. His Excell ency Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani appointed Ms Shahnaz Wazir Ali as his Focal Person for Polio Era di- cation, who is overseeing the development and roll- out of an augmented national polio emergency plan for 2012. The plan seeks to: Eminent social worker Abdul Sattar Edhi, founder of the Edhi Foundation (left), meets WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Ala Alwan, at the Edhi Foundation off ices in Karachi, Pakistan, in March 2012. U\u00ca ensure that sufcient staff is available, especiall y at the lowest administrative levels of the worst-per- forming districts and union councils; U\u00ca promote staff accountability; U\u00ca strengthen preparations ahead of SIAs; U\u00ca mirror the national oversight and accountability structure at the provincial level, as activities in the provinces will be overseen by the highest provincia l ofces. Several signicant changes were also made to improv e performance and accountability at the district and union council levels: U\u00ca District Commissioners are responsible for the over - all operational implementation; U\u00ca Union Council Medical Ofcers are responsible for overseeing local planning and implementation quality; U\u00ca Zonal Supervisors, previously responsible for local activities, were abolished due to chronic underper- formance and corruption; U\u00ca in the worst-performing districts and union coun- cils, preparations for SIAs and participation of th e local leadership are tracked ahead of each event; a nd U\u00ca SIAs are delayed when preparations are deemed to be inadequate, to uphold the programme's quality. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 24 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE Wild poliovirus type 3 down to one district in Asia Khyber Agency, in FATA, appears to be the only rema ining wild poliovirus type 3 reservoir in Asia. Two WPV3 cases were reported there in 2011 and one in early 2012. A key priority for the GPEI in 2012 will therefore be to interrupt rapidly and denitely any residual transmis sion of this serotype in this area. Eliminating the second of the three polio serotypes from Asia woul d signi cantly boost the global eradication effort. The only other known transmission area for type 3 a ppears to be in northern Nigeria. With only seven WPV3 cases reported in 2011, type 3 could soon become a thing of the past, along with type 2, leaving wild poliovirus type 1 as the sole survi ving wild poliovirus serotype. The following operational innovations are being sca led up: U\u00ca systematic and targeted social mobilization activi- ties, based on assessed community perceptions; U\u00ca special strategies to identify and reach mobile pop u- lations and underserved groups, particularly the Pashtun populations; and U\u00ca active review of vaccinator team performance and composition, as well as a new system to recognize high-performing vaccinators. Finally, in order to increase vaccination coverage to newly accessible areas or population groups: U\u00ca the target age group is expanded to 15 years; U\u00ca the SIAD approach is expanded to build up immu- nity levels more rapidly; and U\u00ca campaign monitoring is enhanced through strength- ened independent monitoring and targeted use of Lot Quality Assurance Sampling. These measures have already proved effective: acces s to children has risen between the end of 2011 and the be- ginning of 2012, and better team composition has im - proved coverage in some high-risk areas, particular ly in Karachi, Sindh and Quetta. The history of polio eradication in Pakistan demon- strates that with strong government ownership and oversight and broad community commitment, children can be reached wherever they are. The most recent measures taken by the Government are precisely thos e needed to achieve a rapid and lasting success. Reviewing the evidence, the TAG in Pakistan conclud - ed in March 2012 that the Augmented National Emer- gency Action Plan has all the components required f or the success of polio eradication. The full and cons istent implementation of the plan will make the difference .

Most of the cases (85%) occurred in the tradition- ally endemic Southern Region and Farah prov- ince in Western Region. The other cases were re- ported in nine previously polio-free provinces, the re- sult of importations from this endemic zone and from neigh- bouring Pakistan. However, they remained isolated and did not lead to the re-establishment of the virus in these areas. In the endemic zone, SIA quality has been declining steadily during the past three years, so that the i m- munization status of children was worse in 2011 tha n it was in 2008. The proportion of children who have never received a single dose rose from 9% in 2010 t o 21% in 2011. Wild Polio Virus Cases in Afghanistan, 2011 In addition to problems accessing children in insec ure areas, serious flaws in the management and account- ability of the polio eradication programme persiste d in 2011. Poor access and management were compounded by poor advocacy and a failure to sufciently commu - nicate to parents and communities the importance of polio eradication. Actions In 2011, activities focused most of the available resources on the 28 worst-performing districts of Hilmand, Kandahar, Uruzgan and Farah prov- inces by: U\u00ca implementing SIAD approach whenever build up im- munity levels more rap- idly; U\u00ca negotiating greater access to underserved popu- lations. Activities met with varying degrees of success, depending on the district, and while some immunization campaigns did well, others failed to reach enough children. A s many as 20% of children were missed during a cam- paign conducted in September. The programme was more successful in preventing wild poliovirus from re-establishing a foothold in non- endemic areas. Although isolated cases were reporte d in other provinces, a combination of higher levels of pre-existing immunity and effective outbreak respon se preserved polio-free status in these areas. Wild Polio Virus Type-1 Wild Polio Virus Type-3 Endemic Zone Data at HQ as of 30 April 2012 GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 26 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE Outlook In 2012, the programme will focus on: U\u00ca improving the quality of SIAs in the same 28 dis- tricts of the endemic zone; and, U\u00ca ensuring high immunity levels in polio-free areas t o keep polio from re-establishing itself in the event of a re-infection. Early 2012, the Government and its polio eradicatio n partners nalized a National Polio Eradication Emer - gency Action Plan to dene and address the key chal - lenges for missing too many children. To address access problems in conflict areas, the Em er- gency Plan aims to: U\u00ca renew efforts in the worst-performing districts to more fully engage local leaders and stakeholders; U\u00ca engage with humanitarian organizations active in conflict areas; U\u00ca negotiate access using local-level access negotiato rs; U\u00ca continue to scale-up proven operational approaches, such as SIADs; and U\u00ca roll-out new innovative operational approaches, in- cluding the \"permanent polio teams\" approach (see Box for more). Permanent polio teams in districts where security is compromised \"Permanent polio teams\" are vaccination teams that include locally respected community mem bers and that are based in key districts for a period of three months at a time. During that pe riod, teams are able to participate in large scale NIDs and SNIDs and administer additional OPV doses in communities living in hard to reach and insecure areas. It is but one example of the many new approaches being undertaken in Afghani stan to eradicate polio once and for all. To improve management and accountability, the Plan w ill: U\u00ca strengthen programme capacity at the district level by appointing dedicated full-time district polio managers in each of the 28 endemic districts; U\u00ca closely monitor and assess activities through provi n- cial level polio teams; and U\u00ca rene post-campaign monitoring to obtain a clear pic - ture of programmatic performance in near-real time, enabling corrective measures to be implemented. To support the managerial aspects of planning, impl e- menting and monitoring of SIAs and surveillance ac- tivities, the Emergency Plan aims to: U\u00ca raise the number of technical staff; U\u00ca strengthen micro-planning at the local level; and U\u00ca increase the recruitment of local personnel for vac - cination teams and supervision, and ensure that new staff receives appropriate training. Finally, to generate greater demand for immunizatio n in communities, the Emergency Plan will: U\u00ca build up communications activities; and, U\u00ca continuously assess community perceptions using techniques such as knowledge, attitudes and prac- tices (KAPs) surveys, using ndings to inform socia l mobilization strategies. Of the three remaining endemic countries, Afghanist an is probably the one where interrupting transmission would be the least technically challenging. Only on e geographically contained serotype remains, and the reasons for its continued circulation are clearly i den- tied. Committed and unwavering implementation of the National Polio Emergency Action Plan can only lead to a polio-free Afghanistan. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 27 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 4 | Protecting polio-free areas Preventing and managing international spread to polio- free areas Most countries have successfully stopped polio tran s- mission at great nancial, political and social exp ense. Yet, nearly half of the people paralysed by polio d ur- ing the past three years lived in polio-free countr ies, and were infected by a virus imported from an endem ic country. As long as the virus is not eradicated in these reservoir countries, polio will continue to spread and re-infect polio-free areas, as it did in 2011, when a vi- rus of Pakistani origin caused an outbreak in China 's Xinjiang province. All the WHO Regions, save that o f the Americas, have suffered importations of poliovi rus since becoming polio-free. The few remaining areas with polio are now threatening the polio-free world With most of the world now polio-free, some areas a re affected by declining vaccination coverage, and the re- fore a growing numbers of young adults are immuno- logically susceptible, also never having been expos ed 'natural immunization' due to exposure of endemic circulation of wild poliovirus. The tragic conseque nces are an increase in the number of outbreaks affectin g adults and signicantly higher case fatality rates. In the recent outbreaks in the Republic of Congo (2010) an d China (2011), half the victims were adults. In the Re- public of Congo, nearly half of them died. Outbreak s with such devastating consequences will occur at an increasing rate unless polio is eradicated. In 2011, experience in dealing with outbreaks in po lio- free areas has conrmed four key lessons that compl e- ment the internationally agreed response protocols for in these domains. U\u00ca First, preventive polio vaccination campaigns, par- ticularly when synchronized across several coun- tries, build an immunity barrier. The west African \"polio importation belt\" reported fewer cases in 2010-2011 than it did during the 2003-2005 out- breaks largely thanks a series of preventive cam- paigns to improve immunity. In 2011, 128 polio SIAs were held in 37 polio-free countries at risk o f importation. However, these campaigns had to be discontinued or scaled-back in 24 countries during the rst quarter of 2012 due to lack of funds. Proportion of cases in non-endemic areas 2009 - 201 1 1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0Non-endemic Endemic 2009 2010 2011 GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 28 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE U\u00ca Second, surveillance is an essential underpinning o f rapid response because it enables a faster detectio n of the spread. This was clearly demonstrated in the 2011 outbreak in China, where improving the qual- ity of surveillance was an integral part of respons e activities. U\u00ca Third, response must be swift. The sooner the im- munization campaign is launched, the shorter the duration of the outbreak and the lower the number of cases. U\u00ca Fourth, the response should be tailored to the nature of the outbreak and to the affected population's prole. China and the Republic of Congo provide examples of successful innovative approaches, such the SIAD, where two doses of vaccine are delivered in quick suc- cession to boost immunity among children, or raising the vaccination age to 15 years or higher to improve rapidly the overall immunity in places where it is sig- nicantly lower among older children or young adults. Responding to polio outbreaks in polio-free countries cost US$ 336 million in 2011 The recent outbreak in China is a perfect example o f the danger posed by polio even in countries with hi gh reported national vaccination coverage. This is why the WHO Executive Board recommends that countries: U\u00ca identify any areas with suboptimal immunization coverage and rapidly ll these gaps; U\u00ca strengthen surveillance to more rapidly detect a vi - rus importation (allowing for a more rapid outbreak response); and U\u00ca fully apply vaccination recommendations for all travellers to polio-infected areas. Surveillance indicators 2010 vs 2011 Polio-free countries also have a responsibility to help fun d the global polio eradication effort, and to make available the technical support required to complete the task. Polio surveillance: chasing down the virus Situation High levels of immunity must be associated with strong surveillance to truly minimize the risk and consequences of re-infection. The quicker polio is detected, the faster it can be dealt with, and expe ri- ence has shown that a rapid response directly trans - lates into shorter outbreaks, limited spread and fe wer cases. Since 2009, new procedures within the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) have halved the tim e needed to conrm the presence of poliovirus in clin ical specimens, markedly reducing the size and duration of new outbreaks. AFP surveillance remains the core strategy to detec t both wild and vaccine-derived poliovirus in a timel y manner. Three performance indicators are used to de - termine whether AFP surveillance is of certication standard: U\u00ca detecting and investigating more than one non-polio AFP case per 100 000 population aged less than 15 years (in priority countries, the target is more th an two cases per 100 000); U\u00ca collecting adequate specimens from at least 80% of reported AFP cases; and, U\u00ca processing all specimens in an WHO-accredited GPLN laboratory.

All priority countries - polio endemic, re-establis hed transmission and \"polio importation belt\" - achieve d the augmented recommended AFP detection rate of more than two per 100 000 population, except Guinea - Bissau where the rate was 1.7. In a number of key c oun- tries however, the detection of \"orphan\" viruses an d/ or of polioviruses from non-AFP sources (for instan ce from environmental samplings of sewage water) attes ts to continued gaps in subnational surveillance. Actions Several mechanisms were scaled up in 2011 to enhanc e poliovirus detection and help rapidly identify and ad- dress subnational surveillance gaps: U\u00ca Comprehensive surveillance reviews were conducted i n 20 countries spread over the WHO Regions for Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia as well as Europe (following outbreaks in Kazakhstan, the Russ ian Federation Tajikistan and Turkmenistan in 2010). < 0.5 0.51 to 0.99 > 1 No AFP Surveillance Data Data at HQ as of 01 May 2012 U\u00ca Innovative \"rapid assessments\", rst piloted in 201 0, were implemented in key areas of Nigeria. These new tools - a quick survey of surveillance sensitiv ity by joint national and international experts, follow ed by immediate deployment to help develop opera- tional plans to address identied surveillance gaps - provided crucial insight into the epidemiological picture affecting Nigeria. U\u00ca To further validate the performance of surveillance programmes, environmental sampling was expand- ed to Kano in Nigeria, and to Patna and Kolkata in India, and the groundwork was nalized to intro- duce the system in Luanda in Angola, in the rst half of 2012. The GPLN, a network of 145 laboratories all accredi ted by WHO, continued to work overtime throughout 2011 to support the GPEI. Although a cornerstone of poli o eradication, much of the network's activities take place behind the scenes so that its contribution is all t oo often unrecognized. Without the GPLN's tremendous work, polio eradication would be operating essentia lly blindly. It is largely thanks to its input that pol iovirus GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 30 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE transmission can be accurately tracked and mapped, allowing epidemiologists to target strategies more ef- ciently. The GPLN's primary responsibilities are to analyse AFP clinical specimens and characterize poliovirus isolates. However, testing increasingly includes sp eci- mens from non-AFP sources (such as sewage samples, specimens from healthy children or blood samples). This work helps better understand the dynamics of poliovirus transmission and characterize population immunity levels therefore ensuring optimal immuniza - tion interventions. In 2011, more than 104 000 AFP cases were detected, and more than 201 000 specimens were analysed by the GPLN, a more than 10% increase compared to 2010. Global environmental surveillance sites at national level - 2011 The genetic analysis of poliovirus isolates (regard less of the source) provides crucial information to epid e- miologists and public health specialists. The analy sis helps detect potential surveillance gaps, track the bio- diversity of virus lineages and identify the origin of im- ported viruses (such as the 2011 outbreak in Xinjia ng Province, China, which was linked to a poliovirus c ir- culating in neighbouring Pakistan). Outlook The global network for the surveillance and detection of poliovirus, created 25 years ago, is one of the great suc- cesses of the GPEI. Over the years, it has become increas-Environmental Site in 2011 Planned in 2012 Data at HQ as of 01 May 2012 ingly sensitive and efcient. In 2012, the GPEI will work on making it even stronger, faster and more focused: U\u00ca Within WHO, a new data and monitoring team is being established to ensure a multi-pronged ap- proach to systematically capitalize on all availabl e data sources. U\u00ca Across all levels of the spearheading technical partners, in particular WHO and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), dedicated teams of experts will continuously ana- lyse data sources to provide near real-time trackin g of poliovirus circulation and identication of prob - lem areas. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 31 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE U\u00ca Data sources will be expanded to include not just core AFP data information, but also population im- munity levels (obtained by analysing the vaccinatio n status of non-polio AFP cases, routine immunization data, SIA coverage and seroprevalence surveys) and environmental surveillance data. U\u00ca Surveillance activities will be further strengthene d among key population sub-groups. U\u00ca Community-based surveillance will be expanded. U\u00ca Rapid assessments will be further rolled-out, parti c- ularly in insecure areas with known orphan viruses. U\u00ca New technologies, including mobile phone SMS services, will be prompted for active surveillance in priority areas. U\u00ca Environmental sampling will be further expanded, including in outbreak settings and along recognized transmission routes. As the identication of problem areas improves, ex- perts on standby will be able to shift rapidly the ap- propriate technical, personnel and nancial resourc es to support the development and implementation of corrective operational plans. The aim is to speed u p the detection of polioviruses in all areas and comm uni- ties, and to ensure surveillance gaps are immediate ly detected and addressed. Strengthening immunization systems Ensuring strong immunization systems for the delivery of routine childhood vaccines, one of the GPEI core strate- gies since 1988, remains a key objective in the Strategic Plan 2010-2012. High-quality routine immunization ser- vices greatly enhance the effectiveness of polio eradica- tion strategies, and signicantly minimize the risk - and consequences - of international spread to polio-free areas. In the remaining endemic countries, strengthening rou- tine immunization is a key component of national pol io emergency plans because it helps increase polio vacc ina- tion coverage in the highest-risk areas and improve capaci- ty in polio-free areas. Its progress is monitored b y national technical advisory groups for polio eradication in line with the latest epidemiology and programmatic updates. India provides perhaps the best example of how the polio infrastructure can be used to strengthen immu - nization systems. The nationwide network of surveil -lance medical ofcers of the National Polio Surveil lance Project (NPSP) supports central and state governmen ts for monitoring and evaluation, the introduction of new vaccines, training and capacity building, adver se events following immunization and vaccine-prevent- able disease surveillance, giving priority to high- risk and low-performing areas . In 2011, the NPSP helped monitor nearly 8000 routine immunization sessions every month, and veried the vaccination status of more than 60 000 children aged 0-23 months. At district-level, NPSP task force meetings - original ly es- tablished to review the preparation and performance of SIAs - have become the main forum for sharing routi ne immunization data and information. Following the re - cent success in polio eradication, the network has also begun supporting measles and other vaccine-prevent- able disease surveillance in high-burden states. It s long record of evidence-based decision makes the NPSP th e ideal partner to help India strengthen its immunization system in a strategic and pragmatic manner. India in not the only example: an increasing number of countries have begun using existing polio infrastruc ture to strengthen their immunization systems. At global, r e- gional and national levels, the GPEI is systematically en- gaging with the GAVI Alliance to improve collaboration on routine immunization and coverage in priority areas. Building on the lessons learnt in India, polio eradi cation activities and routine immunization are increasingly be- ing aligned, especially in high-risk areas and amon g un- derserved populations. This means that: U\u00ca Polio monitoring mechanisms are used to identify gaps in routine immunization systems; U\u00ca Polio personnel deployed to complete the eradica- tion programme are used to support the strengthen- ing of routine immunization, U\u00ca Polio communications and social mobilization strat- egies, capacities and activities are used to system ati- cally promote routine immunization; U\u00ca Opportunities for collecting social data/research for polio are increasingly informing the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) communications strategies; U\u00ca Routine immunization plans are harmonized with polio microplans to ensure their completeness. The years of accumulated experience and structures established for polio eradication are now helping t o improve access to vaccines for children most at ris k of vaccine-preventable disease, particularly those fro m difcult-to-access and underserved populations. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 32 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE Polio Eradication - An Emergency POLIO- FREE INDIA2012 PAKISTAN AFGHANISTAN 2012 NIGERIA POLIO- ENDEMICPOLIO- ENDEMIC 2012 012222 On 21 January 2012, having reviewed the global epi- demiology and nancing situation of the GPEI, the WHO's Executive Board adopted a landmark resolu- tion, declaring the completion of polio eradication a programmatic emergency for global public health. Since the launch of the GPEI Strategic Plan 2010-20 12, the incidence of polio has fallen by more than 50%, and India has proven beyond a doubt that it is tech - nically feasible to eradicate polio. At the same ti me, countries with re-established poliovirus transmissi on have shown signs of encouraging progress. If these achievements are to be preserved in 2011, two emergencies must be tackled as a matter of urgency. The rst is epidemiological: poor implementation in Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan has resulted into an upsurge of cases in all three countries. In Nigeria and Pakistan, where both wild poliovirus type 1 and type 3 continue to circulate, it was further accompanied b y the exportation of cases to previously polio-free count ries. In its latest report, the IMB straightforwardly bla med a \"performance of variable quality that [...] consisten tly [fell] below best practice in polio-affected areas\" . As a result all three countries are off track, having mi ssed the 2010 and 2011 end-of-the-year milestones set by the GPEI Strategic Plan 2010-2012. The second is nancial. Only half the funding requi red for the period 2012-2013 has been received so far, put- ting in jeopardy the progress achieved everywhere. In the rst quarter of 2012, activities essential to p revent the risk of re-infection had to be cut down in 24 h igh- risk countries due to acute cash shortage. Unless poliovirus is rapidly eradicated from the la st endemic zones, it will continue to spread and re-in fect polio-free areas. About half of all cases reported dur- ing the past three years occurred in polio-free cou n- tries. Meanwhile, lack of exposure to endemic wild GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 33 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE poliovirus has given rise to a growing Emergency mode: The GPEI switched to emergency mode number of immunologically susceptible at the start of 2012. CDC activated its faster, focused and young adults, or in other words, peo- Emergency Operations Center, UNICEF ple with no \"natural immunity\". The fully accountable! ofcially activated an inter-Divisional consequences of this phenomenon are tragic: an increase in the number of outbreaks affe ct- ing adults, and signicantly higher case fatality r ates. Mathematical modelling shows that failure to eradic ate the remaining 1% puts the world at signicant risk of polio resurgence, potentially leading to over 200 0 00 children paralysed annually within a decade - a pro s- pect the IMB called \"unthinkable\". In order to put an end to this very serious threat, the GPEI Emergency Action Plan 2012-2013 was devel- oped in cooperation with Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. The goal is straightforward: to help all three countries get their respective eradication efforts back on track rapidly, and ensure polio is eradicated fr om these areas once and for all. The Action Plan banks on three factors: faster, focused and fully accountabi lity. Polio eradication activities must be faster at detecting problems, even more focused in effectively addressing them and all stakeholders and staff fully accountable to ensure the full and timely implementation of Pla n. Emergency Coordinating Committee operating directly under the Deputy Executive Direc - tor, and WHO moved its polio operations to the Stra te- gic Health Operations Centre (SHOC). These measures, usually reserved for global threats such as the H1N1 pandemic or extreme disasters such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, allow a massive surge in technical capacity, a near real-time track ing of programme performance and the immediate imple- mentation of corrective action plans, as necessary. Perhaps more importantly, it means that the polio emergency is now overseen at the highest level of t he partnership. The supervision provided by the new Polio Oversight Board - which includes the heads of the ve partner agencies (WHO, Rotary International , CDC, UNICEF and the Bill & Melinda Gates Founda- tion) - ensures greater accountability and better u se of each organization's strengths. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION CDC Emergency Operations Center (EOC) serves as command center for monitoring and coordinating CDC's emergency response activities to public health threats. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 34 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE WHO Centre for Strategic Health Operations (SHOC) is the nerve centre of WHO's global epidemic response providing a single point of coordination for response to acute public health crises including infectious disease outbreaks, natural disasters and chemical emergencies. In the last three endemic countries, national emerg ency plans have been augmented and strengthened, and thei r im- plementation will be monitored at the highest gover nment level. The plans are based on the following six pri orities: U\u00ca ensuring accountability at all levels for programme implementation, U\u00ca addressing key operational challenges, U\u00ca more robustly monitoring tactics, U\u00ca improving subnational surveillance sensitivity, U\u00ca further creating community awareness and demand, and U\u00ca strengthening routine immunization. Upon reviewing the status of implementation and the pri- orities laid down in the emergency plans, national techni- cal advisory bodies in Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan concluded that all was in place to achieve success, pro- vided the plans are implemented swiftly and fully. The funding crisis must be addressed concurrently a s continued lack of funding will preclude the full im ple- mentation of the national emergency plans, and put the goal of a polio-free world at risk. Innovative management of the polio endgame The GPEI is setting the path for an innovative and more efcient medium-term strategy to address the long-term risks of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). The new polio endgame will combine VDPV management with the eradication of residual wild poliovirus transmission. This is a development on previous strategies, which envisaged dealing with the long-term risks of VDPVs only after cer- tication of polio eradication. In 2011, 56 of the 58 circulating VDPV cases were caused by type 2 serotype contained in trivalent OPV. As WPV type 2 transmission has been successfully interrupted, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) has endorsed in principle a switch from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV (containing only type 1 and 3 sero- types) before the interruption of the remaining strains of WPV type 1 and 3 is conrmed. This view was echoed by WHO's Executive Board in January 2012. In 2012, policy development will be largely guided by the new SAGE Polio Working Group. It will advise on the best way to proceed with the switch from trivale nt OPV to bivalent OPV, and provide SAGE with appropri- ate guidance to formulate related policy. Such a swit ch will be contingent rst on the successful eliminatio n of all persistent circulating VDPV type 2, and second on the availability of an affordable inactivated polio v ac- cine (IPV), which would enable countries to maintain immunity to type 2 poliovirus. The introduction of a supplementary dose of IPV could further accelerate t he eradication of WPV type 1 and 3 transmission, depend- ing on the timing and extent of its introduction. If properly implemented, the switch from trivalent O PV to bivalent OPV would have signicant public health be nets. Over the past ten years, more than 80% of all circu lating VDPV cases were due to type 2. Of the estimated 250 -500 annual vaccine-associated paralytic polio cases, up to 38% are due to type 2. Once the change is done, these wi ll dis- appear. In addition, the switch would be a signican t step towards the end of oral polio vaccines. Successfully termi- nating type 2 OPV would establish the feasibility o f with- drawing the remaining serotypes of oral polio vaccin es and guide the management of associated risks. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 35 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE Financing 2011 was a year of unprecedented political and nan - cial support, despite a bleak beginning marked by a US$ 335 million funding gap in January against a US$ 982 million budget. The gap had been reduced to US$ 125 million at the start of the fourth quarter when, by a combination of new and forward funding targete d particularly at west, central and east Africa, the total of contributions for 2011 suddenly rose to over US$ 1.1 billion, the largest amount ever received b y the GPEI. During the May 2011 World Health Assembly, del- egates' focus was divided between the \"signicant a d- vances\" against polio achieved in 2010 and the fund ing gap which the IMB had called, in its April 2011 Rep ort, the \"single greatest threat to the GPEI's success\". WHO Director-General Margaret Chan told the assembled health ministers that the job was not nished and t hat \"we must see this through to the end\". During the World Economic Forum in Davos on 28 Jan- uary 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron announced a doubling of the United Kingdom's funding for the next two years in a challenge grant. Underlining the impor - tance of strengthening routine immunization as a key part of the bigger picture, Mr Cameron said that for ev- ery additional US$ 5 pledged by other donors between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012, the United King- dom would increase its support by US$ 1 up to a maxi- mum of \u00a340 million over the period. \"There is never a wrong time to do the right thing. [...] We have a once - in-a-lifetime opportunity to rid the world of the evil of polio. We have the vaccines and the tools to do it. A ll that's missing is real and sustained political will to see this effort through to the end,\" concluded Mr Camero n. On 26-27 May 2011, G8 nations unanimously re-af- rmed their commitment to polio eradication at thei r Summit in Deauville, France: \"We stress our continu - ing commitment to the eradication of polio. Our pas t support has contributed to the 99% decrease of poli o cases in the developing countries. We flag the need for a special focus on this issue and renewed momentum. To this end, we will continue to support the GPEI.\" Finally, on 31 October 2011, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, the \"We must see this [effort] through to the end...\" Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General, WHO leaders of Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Nig e- ria and Pakistan joined Bill Gates in pledging more than US$ 100 million in new funds to help deliver a polio- free world. In announcing the Australian pledge of AU$ 50 million pledge, Prime Minister Julia Gillard said: \"We are within grasp of declaring the end of polio world- wide. We need to keep this action going. We know it will yield real results. At the end of the day, it's a simple ac- tion of two drops of vaccine. We can do that in our world and end polio forever.\" When Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced a further CAD$ 15 million in funding, he added \"now is the time for the nal push.... If we don't stamp out polio we risk its re-emergence, not just in the region but around the world.\" The response: unprecedented financial support in 2011 Acknowledging the nancial benets of eradicating p o- lio (an estimated US$ 40-50 billion through 2035) a nd the humanitarian consequences of failing to do so, the international donor community provided more than US$ 866 million which, combined with domestic fund- ing, met the requirements for 2011. In addition to the signicant contributions provided by G8 nations, th e Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Rotary Internation al and UNICEF, new commitments were received from Brunei Darussalam, Cyprus, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Romania, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Turkey as well as the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, the Arab Gulf Fund for Development, the Google Foundation, the Islamic Development Bank and Shinnyo-en. In all , 31 donors contributed external funding to the GPEI. As nancial support from development partners reached unprecedented levels, domestic funding from the remain- ing polio endemic countries and those affected by out- breaks due to importations remained strong. Domestic funding accounted for about 27% of the total GPEI con- tributions for 2011. Of note, India's self-nancing topped US$ 249 million at end-2011, with US$ 240 million pro- jected for 2012 and US$ 174 million for 2013. Nigeria committed US$ 9.90 million and during the Common- wealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, President GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 36 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE Jonathan also announced an increase in annual funding of up to US$ 30 million starting in 2012. Angola provided US$ 12.53 million to sustain its achievements. Going beyond traditional financing Innovative nancing represents an increasing portio n of GPEI funding. New funding for the period include d extensions of the World Bank \"buy-down\" mechanism for OPV for Pakistan (US$ 41 million) and Nigeria (US$ 60 million) for the period 2011-2012, co-nanc ed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CDC and Ro- tary International.

Australia announced a new four-year commitment of AU$ 50 million (approximately US$ 49 million) to be operational by early 2012. Australia also continued sup- porting Uruzgan province in Afghanistan and provided US$ 340 000 to respond to the VDPV outbreak in Myan- mar, bringing Australia's total funding to US$ 18 million. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided an additional US$ 125.85 million in supplemental grant s to WHO and UNICEF as well as third party funding for the World Bank buy-down for Nigeria and Paki- stan, bringing the Foundation's total commitment fo r 2011 to more than US$ 300 million. It also granted Rotary International an additional US$ 50 million t o extend their partnership over 2013-2015. These gran ts bring the Foundation's total contribution to the GP EI, including matching grants to Rotary International, to US$ 1.47 billion. Brunei Darussalam provided US$ 150 000 for the period 2011-2013. This is the Sultanate's second mu lti- year commitment, bringing its total contribution fo r the period 2008-2013 to US$ 300 000. Canada disbursed US$ 23.97 million for Afghanistan and sub-Saharan Africa as part of a multi-year commitment announced in November 2010 following the Muskoka Initiative for maternal and child healt h. A further CAD$ 15 million, to be made available ear ly 2012, was announced during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth. Canada is the fth-largest public sector donor to the GPEI, havin g provided more than US$ 306.67 million. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) responded quickly to funding appeals for the VDPV outbreak in Myanmar, providing US$ 370 000 to UNICEF. CERF has provided US$ 5.13 million to date. In addition to its role as a spearheading partner, the United States Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) provided funding for OPV, operation- al costs and programme support to UNICEF and WHO and continued to dispatch its epidemiologists, virologists and technical ofcers to assist polio-affected countries i n implementing polio eradication activities. US Congress appropriations to CDC for polio eradication in its scal year 2011 totalled US$ 101.6 million, bringing CDC's to- tal contributions to more than US$ 1.6 billion. The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi , His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, provided US$ 17 million to WHO and UNICEF to deliver polio vaccines in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This contribu - tion was part of a larger partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Cyprus provided US$ 2000 through its partnership with the United Nations Foundation. This complement s a previous contribution, bringing the country's tot al support to US$ 4000. The European Commission provided \u20ac 20 million for activities in Nigeria in 2011 and 2012. ECHO also provided \u20ac 782 110 for the outbreak in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and \u20ac 420 000 for the VDPV outbreak in Myanmar. The European Commission is the sixth largest public- sector donor to the GPEI, with contributions totall ing US$ 224 million. Finland provided US$ 260 000, the second instalment of a three-year 10:1 matching grant with Rotary International for activities in Afghanistan, bringi ng its total support to US$ 1.64 million. Germany disbursed US$ 2.54 million as part of its 2011 commitment to WHO and the programme in India. Germany's total support to the GPEI has reac hed US$ 390.94 million, making it the fourth largest pu blic sector donor. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 38 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE The Google Foundation provided US$ 4 million to address the critical funding gap for OPV for outbre ak response. The donation enabled UNICEF to secure its vaccine pipeline and sustain its polio eradicat ion programme in 2011. The Islamic Development Bank granted Afghanistan US$ 470 000 for OPV to be purchased by UNICEF. Italy provided US$ 600 000 in global unspecied funding through WHO. Italy's total support to the GPEI is US$ 39.76 million. Japan reinforced its strong commitment for polio eradication and continued to provide critical suppo rt for the procurement of OPV via UNICEF in 2011. Ja- pan provided more than US$ 24 million for OPV and operations costs for Afghanistan, Angola, DRC, Indi a, Liberia and Pakistan. Japan, together with JICA and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, initiated a ne w loan conversion mechanism, \"JICA Loan Conver- sion\" , for Pakistan, totaling US$ 65 million to cover OPV procurement and operational costs for the perio d 2011-2013. Multi-stakeholder dialogue was enhanced during the Asia Pacic High-level Meeting on Innova - tive Partnership for Health in October, and a chari ty reception for World Polio Day 2011 was hosted by th e Japan Institute for Global Heath, along with Rotary In- ternational and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . It included the participation of the Diet Task Forc e on Global Polio Eradication, established in 2011. Japa n is the third largest public sector donor to the GPEI, with contributions totalling more than US$ 426.93 millio n. The Principality of Liechtenstein provided CHF 15 000 as a year-end contribution, bringing its total support to US$ 50 000. Luxembourg contributed US$ 700 000 as part of a multi-year commitment covering the period 2009- 2013. Luxembourg is the second largest per capita contributor with a total of US$ 15.06 million. Monaco became the GPEI's largest per capita contributor. For the rst time, Monaco concluded a multi-year agreement for 2011-2013, contributing \u20ac 375 000 for activities in Niger. This brings Monaco's total funding for polio eradication activities in Niger to US$ 1.06 million. Norway continued to provide critical unspecified contributions to the GPEI. In 2011, it provided US$ 9.78 million, bringing its total contributions to US$ 85.80 million. Romania made its rst-ever contribution to the GPEI, totalling US$ 20 000, through its partnership with the United Nations Foundation. Rotary International , in addition to being a spearheading partner in the GPEI, is also the secon d- largest private sector donor. By January 2012, Rota ry International announced that Rotary Clubs worldwide had succeeded in meeting the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's US$ 200 million match in funding for polio eradication - reaching the fundraising milest one six months early. In 2011, Rotary International disbursed US$ 72.83 million to the GPEI. By 2013, Rotary International will have contributed more tha n US$1.23 billion. The Russian Federation disbursed US$ 2 million as part of a US$ 5 million multi-year commitment (2010 - 2012) made in response to the 2010 G8 communiqu\u00e9. Russia has provided US$ 33 million to the GPEI sinc e 2003. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia provided US$ 15 million as part of a US$ 30 million 2011-2012 commitment for OPV and operations in west Africa and the Horn of Africa. Shinnyo-en provided US$ 100 000 to support technical assistance and surveillance activities in the Western-Pacic Region, bringing its total contribut ion to date to US$ 1.22 million. Spain contributed \u20ac 520 000 as part of a 2009-2011 commitment for surveillance activities in Africa. T his was complemented by US$ 390 000 in additional un- specied funding. Since joining the GPEI in 2004, Spain has contributed US$ 14.18 million. Turkey continued its support, providing a year-end contribution of US$ 50 000, bringing its total supp ort to US$ 780 000. GPEI | ANNUAL REPORT 2011 39 GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE On 28 January 2011 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced a doubling of the United Kingdom's funding for 2011- 2012 in a challenge grant. For every additional US$ 5 pledged by other donors between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012, the United Kingdom will increase its support by US$ 1 up to a maximum of an additional \u00a340 million over the period. For 2011, the match require- ment was fullled by May. Coupled with its multi-year global commitment, matching funds and specied sup- port for the DRC, the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) disbursed US$ 107.84 million. The United Kingdom is the second largest public sector contributor with total contribu tions of US$ 962.08 million. In 2011, spearheading partner UNICEF continued to see polio eradication as priority and provided signicant funding to its country ofces. In total, UNICEF prov ided more than US$ 37 million for polio eradication activitie s through several channels: US$ 15 million for OPV from the discretionary core funding, US$ 18.9 million for OPV and staff costs from country ofces core resourc es (Board approved budget) and US$ 3.3 million for polio eradication activities in priority countries fundraised by UNICEF National Committees. The United Nations Foundation (UN Foundation) continued its support of the GPEI's resource mobiliz ation efforts with a contribution of US$ 200 000. In addition to its nancial support, the UN Foundation played a key role in facilitating support from non-traditional donors, such as Cyprus, Liechtenstein and Romania. The UN Foundation's total support for the GPEI is US$ 43.54 million. The US Congress in its scal year 2011 allocated US$ 31.9 million to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for polio eradication activities. Funds were used to support so cial mobilization, surveillance and laboratory activities, outbreak response and monitoring in priority countries, bringing USAID's total support to US$ 444 million. An innovative nancing mechanism with the World Bank , commonly referred to as \"IDA buy-downs\", was developed to allow the use of credit issued by the In- ternational Development Association (IDA), the con- cessionary lending arm of the World Bank, for OPV procurement. Third-party donor funding (provided by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CDC, Ro- tary International and UNF) is used to \"buy-down\" IDA credits and turn them into grants. In 2011, US$ 33.61 million was disbursed under the buy-downs for Pakistan and Nigeria. The total amount of suppo rt committed until 2012 under this mechanism, called \"the World Bank Investment Partnership for Polio\", is US$ 316.37 million. In addition, the World Bank pro - vided a grant of US$ 4.8 million for the DRC.
