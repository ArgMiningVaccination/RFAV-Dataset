These 'points' are carefully selected for you by the practitioner from hundreds of others. These acupuncture points are where the 'Qi' or Bio-energy can be influenced by needling. Qi flows beneath the skin in channels of energy popularly known as 'Meridians' or 'Channels'. Traditional acupuncture theories are both broad and deep and their richly sophisticated technologies have been validated by today's Western Scientific tradition. Once viewed as very mysterious and poorly understood in the western world, acupuncture is fast becoming recognised the world over as a safe and reliable method of treatment for a great many conditions - millions of people world-wide have benefited. What conditions may acupuncture treat? The World Health Organisation (WHO) has produced a long list of disease categories for which Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has demonstrable benefit. The following list is by no means exhaustive: Asthma, Bronchitis, Sinusitis, Migraine, Nausea, Indigestion, Constipation, IBS, High blood pressure, Obesity, Diabetes, Neck-Shoulder/Back/Knee pain, Arthritis (both Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis), Strains and Sprains and other soft tissue injuries, PMS, Irregular or Painful Periods, Menopausal Syndrome, Fluid Retention, Skin Disorders, and Neurological Disorders such as Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Dementia, Insomnia, and the sequelae of Cardiovascular Accidents (CVA) such as Stroke. In addition acupuncture is used for addictions to Smoking, Alcohol and other substances. How does acupuncture work? There are many theoretical models in existence offering explanations for the effects commonly seen during and after acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture has been shown to raise the levels of specific hormones, prostaglandins, white blood cells, 'gamma globulins' and antibodies generally. The 'Endorphin' theory explains how acupuncture can stimulate its own painkillers and 'feel good' chemicals - the Endorphins. Interestingly, these are the body's own naturally produced 'opiates' and some are 200 times stronger than morphine. Other 'modern' theories involve the Central Nervous System, the Cardiovascular System and others. Although many of them are based on excellent research there are no clear simple answers. Unless that is, we look to what the Ancient Masters themselves have said about this mysterious matter - simply that 'Qi' or 'Vital Force' or 'Bio-Energy' does exist and that it moves throughout the body flowing in and out of clearly defined 'Channels of Energy' promoting health and resisting disease. Is acupuncture safe? Acupuncture is widely regarded as a safe and reliable therapeutic modality in today's clinic. This notwithstanding, patients must ensure that their practitioner has a licence to practice and is suitably qualified. Are the needles sterile? Today acupuncture needles are made according to a great many exacting quality control procedures. Like Herbal Medicines, Acupuncture needles are subject to GMP stipulations (Good Manufacturing Practice). All needles are gas or gamma sterilised and have clear 'best-before' information. They are also designed to be disposed of after a single application. Does acupuncture hurt? Acupuncture needles are hair-fine with a point configuration similar to that of a bullet, quite unlike the hypodermic needle of modern medicine which is beveled. Great care is taken when inserting so acupuncture needles will not damage the structures beneath the skin. In fact acupuncture needles have been observed under high microscopy to gently push aside nerve tendrils. Acupuncture is a painless and often enjoyable experience. Patients can be reassured that if they relax they should not feel the needle insertion at all, feeling only the accompanying subtle sensations induced by the practitioner moments afterward. "}
