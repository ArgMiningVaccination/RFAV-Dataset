In a healthy person, balance is usually quickly restored, but when the healing capacity of a person is compromised, help in healing is needed. Naturopathic physicians use natural, effective, and non-toxic therapies to support the body's natural healing process, stimulate the body's vital force, and prevent further disease from occurring. Dr. No\u00e9 is a leader in the integrative approach to cancer treatment and has been practicing integrative naturopathic oncology for over 28 years. Dr. No\u00e9 uses nutrition (both dietary and supplemental), medical herbalism, counseling (that encompasses spiritual as well as practical issues), and physical therapies all specific to the patient's diagnosis and current conventional treatment. bottom of page "}
