So he created Greenhouse Holistic, an intimate, integrative wellness and healing center that incorporates massage, movement, and heat work. Renovated in 2004, the space now houses a massage room; a sauna, shower, and changing area; and a 25-person studio where five or six classes (yoga, Pilates, and tai chi among others) are taught every day. A few buildings away, an annex includes a steam room and another massage room, this one equipped for facials and body treatments. Greenhouse specializes in integrated hot-stone massage, a technique in which smooth, dark volcanic rocks that have been heated in 150-degree water are used as tools to work stressed muscles. An active, intense treatment that's full of movement, this service differs from the more static traditional hot-stone rubdowns; shiatsu and Swedish massage is also available. Yoga classes include Ashtanga, Vinyasa, and Iyengar, with most open to all levels, and some designated as beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Pilates classes are traditional mat-based, but there's also unexpected fare like belly dancing classes, feng shui consultations, and acupuncture treatments.Extra To attend Greenhouse classes, customers can pay as they go, buy multi-class enrollment cards, or purchase three-month or one-year memberships. All classes are first come first served. Sales During the week, 2 p.m. \"community\" classes are significantly cheaper than the rest of the day's offerings. "}
