The Chair now recognizes herself for an opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANA D EGETTE, A REP- RESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF COLO-RADO Today we continue our oversight of the Nation's COVID-19 re- sponse efforts. Throughout the pandemic, this subcommittee has conducted ro- bust oversight over a range of critical issues, including vaccine de-velopment and distribution [audio malfunction] enter a new phase of the pandemic, today's hearing addresses one of the most con-sequential COVID-19 issues that this subcommittee has examined: the pressing need to increase COVID-19 vaccine confidence and uptake in the United States. And it is simple, why. If not enough people get vaccinated, the massive investments that we have made to develop the vaccines and the extraordinary efforts that we have made to make them widely available will never reach their full po-tential. Now, fortunately, we are making significant progress. In just 5 months, more than 160 million Americans have received at least 1 COVID-19 vaccine. And over 85 percent of seniors have received at least 1 dose. In the 2 weeks since the FDA authorized Pfizer's vaccine for children ages 12 to 15, more than 2 million children in this age group received their first dose. Thanks to the millions of Americans who have chosen to get a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, we do have a shot at return-ing to normalcy. So, if you want to take off your masks, if you want to get together with friends and family safely, if you want to go on vacation, then join the millions of Americans who have done it, and get vaccinated. Here is the bad news, though: We are not out of the woods yet. Although it is easier to get a vaccine, millions of Americans remain unvaccinated, and immunization rates in many places remain alarmingly low. In some States, less than 30 percent of the popu-lation has received even\u2014I am sorry, less than 40 percent of the population has received even a single dose. And since peaking in mid-April, we have seen a decline in the number of daily doses ad-ministered across the country. This is worrying. And, frankly, it is going to take a collective push to get to the Biden administration's goal of 70 percent of American adults having at least 1 shot by the Fourth of July. That VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec subcommittee is working tirelessly to support vaccina- tion efforts nationwide, including today's hearing, which explores why some people so far haven't gotten vaccinated. So that is the big question: Why haven't some people gotten vac- cinated? Polling indicates that many unvaccinated Americans have safety concerns or unanswered questions about how the vaccines work. Compounding these problems, rampant misinformation and out-right lies are spreading on social media platforms, in many cases igniting viral hoaxes and fueling vaccine hesitancy. But low vaccine confidence isn't the only reason for the slow up- take. Some unvaccinated Americans, especially in rural areas and communities of color, still confront access challenges, like the in-ability to take off of work or to get a vaccine from a trusted source. Additionally, far too many Americans\u2014in particular, young adults\u2014they just don't have the urgency or motivation to get vac-cinated. They don't understand that, while they are likely to have a mild case, they could get a serious case or even die\u2014and worse, infect others who are at risk. Clearly, this is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It often takes the right message, from the right source, delivered at the right time. We are going to need a variety of strategies and incentives to over-come the range of reasons keeping unvaccinated Americans on the fence. I believe that our witnesses today can shed light on these chal- lenges, and I want to thank every single one of them for being with us. I look forward to discussing, at the end, what is working and what needs to be done. And so I just want to say a few things, in conclusion. If you are worried about the vaccine's safety, you should know millions of doses have been administered throughout the country and around the world. The data is in. The vaccines are safe. If you are unsure about the vaccine's efficacy, you should know extensive, real-world data is available, and it shows the vaccines are extremely effective. They prevent hospitalization and severe ill-ness, and they save lives. And if you question the benefit of getting vaccinated, you should know that fully vaccinated Americans can resume their prevaccine lives and go around without wearing a mask or physical distancing. So you can get back to your normal life. I was at a press conference yesterday at the State legislature, and everybody had a vaccine, and nobody had a mask, and it was wonderful. The facts are not in dispute. The only question is, how can we help unvaccinated Americans get their shots? I know, if we work together in a bipartisan fashion, we can do just that, and that is why I am so pleased again to have our witnesses. [The prepared statement of Ms. DeGette follows:] P REPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DIANA DEGETTE Today, we continue our oversight of the Nation's COVID-19 response efforts. Throughout the pandemic, this subcommittee has conducted robust oversight over a range of critical issues, including vaccine development and distribution challenges.

So why are some people still not getting vaccinated? Polling indicates that many unvaccinated Americans have safety concerns or un- answered questions about how the vaccines work.

It often takes the right message from the right source, delivered at the right time. We will need a variety of strate-gies and incentives to overcome the range of reasons keeping unvaccinated Ameri-cans on the fence. Thankfully, our witnesses here today can shed light on these challenges. I look forward to discussing what is working and what more needs to be done to increase vaccine confidence and uptake. At the end of the day, I hope that any American watching this hearing who is unsure whether to get vaccinated takes away these key facts: If you are worried about the vaccines' safety, you should know that hundreds of millions of doses have now been administered throughout the country. The data is in. The vaccines are safe. If you are unsure about the vaccines' effectiveness, you should know that exten- sive, realworld data is available and shows the vaccines are extraordinarily effec-tive. They prevent hospitalization and severe illness, and they save lives. And, if you question the benefit of getting vaccinated, you should know that fully vaccinated Americans can resume their pre-pandemic lives without wearing a mask or physically distancing. So, if you get vaccinated, you can start getting back to nor-mal life. These facts are not in dispute. The only question is how we can help unvaccinated Americans get their shots. I am confident that if we work together, in a bipartisan fashion, we can build trust and increase uptake-and make our shot at normalcy a reality. Ms. D EGETTE . And I am also pleased to now yield 5 minutes to the ranking member, Mr. Griffith, for an opening statement. We have got some background noise somewhere. Everybody needs to make sure they are muted. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH, A REP- RESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA Mr. G RIFFITH . Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate that. If I may take a brief moment of personal privilege, and just say that all of us in Virginia are mourning the passing of former Senator John Warner, who served Virginia ably and was a very nice man. And so we are mourning his passing overnight. That being said, I do appreciate you holding this hearing on building COVID-19 vaccine confidence. I also want to thank the witnesses for taking the time to join us today, especially Dr. Karen Shelton, who is from the 9th District of Virginia and doing some great work to serve all of the people in southwestern Virginia. We have come a long way since the first confirmed case of COVID, as SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID, and that was diag-nosed in January of 2020. Today we have three safe and effective vaccines with enough supply for every American aged 12 and up who wants one. So far, over 61 percent of the U.S. population have received at least 1 dose. While we are well on our way to returning to normalcy, we still have to work to reach the higher rates of vac-cinations necessary to eliminate the virus. The virus is a signifi-cant threat to our public health. At the beginning of the national vaccination campaign, demand exceeded supply. Now the U.S. faces the opposite problem: the vac-cine supply is plentiful and exceeds the number of people in line to be vaccinated. The current unvaccinated population varies in its demographics, intentions, and concerns about the COVID-19 vac-cines. There are about 13 percent of individuals who say they will defi- nitely not receive the COVID-19 vaccine, yet there is a slightly larger share of individuals, 15 percent, who are waiting to see how the COVID-19 vaccine is working on other people before they re-ceive their shot. These individuals could be persuaded to get COVID-19 vaccines by receiving answers to their questions and concerns. The leading concerns that contribute to vaccine hesitancy are that COVID-19 vaccines are not safe as they are said to be and that individuals will experience side effects following vaccination. Individuals are also concerned about what is actually misin- formation about infertility and other possible long-term effects from getting the COVID-19 vaccines. Trusted messengers need to meet these Americans where they are, by listening to their concerns and asking permission to share accurate information to help them reach the right decision for each individual, while reinforcing their safety, dignity, choice, and autonomy. My home district is a region of rural communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study last week that people in rural areas are receiving the COVID-19 vaccines at a lower rate than those in urban areas. My district is actually doing fairly well, but this study demonstrates a need to identify the bar-riers in many rural communities and to find solutions to remove them. Additionally, I have heard from my district on reasons why there are lower rates of vaccination. Two common factors contributing to VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec lower rates are a lack of information on the technology of the COVID-19 vaccines as well as a lack of access to receive the vac-cine. The good part about these barriers is that they can be re-moved. We can provide accurate information on the decades of de-velopment for the mRNA technology in two of the vaccines, and that there were no cuts in safety requirements, just cuts in red tape. We find innovative ways\u2014we can find innovative ways to bring vaccines to the people through mobile vaccination clinics. Public health practitioners should continue collaborating with healthcare providers, pharmacies, employers, faith leaders, and other commu-nity partners to identify and address barriers to COVID-19 vac-cination in rural areas and other communities. Another key group of individuals who benefit from receiving the vaccine are children. Yes, COVID-19 is usually milder in children as compared to adults, but some children can get very sick and suf-fer complications from COVID-19. It is crucial to target messaging and provide accurate information and resources to this population so parents can make the best decisions for their children. According to the CDC, more than a half-million children between ages 12 and 15 received a Pfizer vaccine just 1 week after it was approved for this age group. This is a great accomplishment, and I hope we can continue to work with advocacy groups to provide parents with the necessary information to make this decision so they are confident in getting their children vaccinated. I look for-ward to hearing from our witnesses today on what messages and strategies work best to remove barriers to a much higher level of COVID-19 vaccination throughout the United States so that we can all return to normalcy. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I yield back. [The prepared statement of Mr. Griffith follows:] P REPARED STATEMENT OF HON. H.

Thank you, Madam Chair, I yield back. Ms. D EGETTE . The gentleman yields back. The Chair now recog- nizes the chair of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for an opening statement for 5 minutes. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, J R., A REP- RESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JER-SEY Mr. P ALLONE . Thank you, Chairwoman DeGette, and thanks for this continued effort of the Oversight and Investigations Sub-committee to do critical oversight of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in our country. Through the collective efforts of the American people over the past year, we have overcome the initial challenges of developing, producing, and distributing safe and effective vaccine. But now we face the more difficult task of reaching those Americans who have yet to embrace this important tool. The fact is, vaccine doubts and fears are not new challenges. In fact, this committee has a history of addressing these issues in a bipartisan manner. In 2019, for example, we held a hearing on the VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec and renewed our efforts to provide resources to support vaccine confidence and uptake throughout the Nation. And we followed that with bipartisan legislation led by Representative Schrier. It finally passed late last year. And that bill authorized a campaign to educate and inform Americans on the benefits of vac-cine. Earlier this year we significantly expanded upon those activi-ties in the American Rescue Plan, which invested $160 billion in COVID-19 response efforts, and that included $20 million in dedi-cated resources for vaccine distribution clinics, mobile units, and an awareness campaign. So, while these issues of awareness and confidence are not new, the gravity of the challenges facing us today is unprecedented be-cause of the pandemic. Millions are stricken ill, more than a half a million lives tragically lost, and the enormous toll on the mental and financial well-being of Americans. But in the face of all this, we have risen to the occasion. We have worked together at a Federal, State, and local level through public and private partnerships and across political lines to develop sev-eral safe and effective vaccines. And we have solved supply issues and continue our work to ensure equitable distribution. And the re-sult of this collective effort, if you are 12 years or older and you want a COVID vaccine, there is one waiting for you now. So I just wanted to mention not only decisive action by Congress and the Biden administration's leadership, now we have more than 116 million Americans who have received at least 1 dose of the vac-cine, and more than 130 million of those are fully vaccinated. So the number of new daily cases and deaths have fallen signifi- cantly since the start of the year. This is, obviously, cause for cele-bration. But we can't stop until more Americans are protected from COVID-19, and that is what we are going to hear about today. What are the next steps? What we know so far is there is no single factor causing eligible unvaccinated Americans to sit on the sidelines. Some people are skeptical of the vaccine's safety or worry about long-term effects. Some have been misled by bogus and misleading information. Still others have a distrust of the medical system or the government's role in developing vaccines. And many Americans, particularly in rural communities and in communities of color, are open or even eager to be vaccinated, yet continue to face barriers to access. So this\u2014there is not one reason, Madam Chair, why some Americans remain unvaccinated, and there is no single solution. But the encouraging news is that our efforts have been successful so far. Poll after poll shows increasing confidence in the COVID- 19 vaccines. And that progress, though, did start to plateau rel-atively recently. So that is why we have to redouble our efforts to understand who could be reached and how best to reach them. We have to do a lot of hard work, really, to just go out and meet people where they are. As we enter this vaccine campaign and its new aspects of it, I am pleased to be working alongside our Republican colleagues to encourage Americans to roll up their sleeves. I think that if we really want to be\u2014go back to normalcy, we need every eligible American to make the right choice, get a shot, protect themselves, their community, and the Nation. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec again, I am just looking forward to the witnesses. I want to say to everyone\u2014they may already know\u2014that Chairwoman DeGette has been outspoken in continuing this oversight of the vaccine campaign, and today is a manifestation of that. And I appreciate your prioritizing this in your subcommittee. It is very important. And thanks to Morgan Griffith, as well. I yield back. [The prepared statement of Mr. Pallone follows:] P REPARED STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE , JR. Today we continue our critical oversight of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States\u2014our best shot at containing the virus and beating this pan-demic. Through the collective efforts of the American people over the past year, we have overcome the initial challenges of developing, producing, and distributing safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. But we now face the difficult task of reaching those Americans who have yet to embrace this life-saving tool. Vaccine doubts and fears are not new challenges. In fact, this committee has a history of addressing these issues in a bipartisan manner. In 2019, for instance, we held a hearing on the measles outbreaks and renewed our efforts to provide resources to support vaccine confidence and uptake throughout the Nation. We followed that with bipartisan legislation led by Representative Schrier, finally passed late last year. The legislation authorized a campaign to edu-cate and inform Americans on the benefits of vaccines and increase our under-standing of how best to reach unvaccinated individuals. Earlier this year, we significantly expanded upon those activities in the American Rescue Plan, which invested $160 billion in COVID-19 response efforts. This in-cluded $20 billion in dedicated resources for vaccine distribution and administration, vaccination clinics, mobile vaccination units, and a vaccine awareness campaign. While issues surrounding vaccine confidence are not new, the gravity of the chal- lenges facing us today is unprecedented as we continue to combat this pandemic. Millions stricken ill. More than half a million lives tragically lost. And enormous tolls taken on the mental and financial well-being of too many Americans. In the face of all this pain and hardship, this Nation has again risen to the occa- sion. We have worked together at the Federal, State, and local levels; through public and private partnerships; and across political lines to develop several safe and effec-tive vaccines. We have also solved supply issues and continue our work to ensure equitable distribution throughout the country. As a result of this collective effort, if you are 12 years or older and you want a COVID-19 vaccine, there is one waiting for you. And, thanks to decisive action by Congress, combined with the Biden administra- tion's bold leadership and determined commitment to science, more than 160 million Americans have received at least one dose of a vaccine, and more than 130 million of those are fully vaccinated. Because of this, the number of new daily cases and deaths have fallen signifi- cantly since the start of the year. This is cause for celebration. Our efforts, however, must not stop until more Americans are protected from COVID-19. And, as we will hear today, more work is needed. Today, there is no single factor causing eligible, unvaccinated Americans to sit on the sidelines. Some people are skeptical of the vaccines' safety or worry about long- term side effects. Some have been misled by bogus and misleading information that pollutes social media. Still others have an understandable distrust of the medical system or the government's role in developing the vaccine. Many more Americans\u2014 particularly in our rural communities and in communities of color\u2014are open, or even eager, to be vaccinated, yet continue to face barriers to access. Just as there is no one reason why some Americans remain unvaccinated, there is no single solution to building vaccine confidence to get more people vaccinated. The encouraging news is that our efforts have been successful so far: Poll after poll has shown increasing confidence in COVID-19 vaccines since the first one was authorized more than five months ago. But that progress has begun to plateau while millions of unvaccinated Americans still remain vulnerable to the virus. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec why we must redouble our efforts to understand who can be reached and how best to reach them. We must do the hard work of meeting people where they are. The importance of this work cannot be overstated. As we enter a critical juncture of our vaccination campaign, I am pleased to be working alongside our Republican colleagues to encourage Americans to roll up their sleeves. If we are to have a true shot at normalcy, we need every eligible American to make the right choice: Get a shot and protect themselves, their community, and the Nation. Thank you to our witnesses for being here today, I yield back. Ms. D EGETTE . Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and the Chair is now pleased to recognize the ranking member of the full com-mittee, Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, for 5 minutes for an opening state-ment. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CATHY M CMORRIS RODGERS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON Mrs. R ODGERS . Thank you, Madam Chair and Republican Leader Griffith. Thanks to the innovative work of the private sector, the Trump administration, Operation Warp Speed, and the continued work of the Biden administration, America has led the way with safe and effective vaccines. It is a historic and remarkable example of American innovation that is giving people the courage to dream again. As we work to get a vaccine to every person who wants one, building trust and confidence is foundational. Our goal today is to equip people with the information they need to make the best deci-sions for themselves, their children, and their families. That is the American way: to lead with trust, not fear. So I want to thank our distinguished panel for being here to share their expertise and answer questions people may have about the COVID-19 vaccines. I would now like to yield the remainder of my time to Dr. John Joyce, who is leading, with other doctors in Congress, to encourage people to talk to their doctors about the safety of COVID-19 vac-cines. [The prepared statement of Mrs. Rodgers follows:] P REPARED STATEMENT OF HON. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS Thank you, Chair DeGette and Republican Leader Griffith.

VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec like to thank\u2014\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . The gentleman is recognized. Mr. J OYCE . I would like to thank Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers for yielding me time, and for Chair DeGette and Ranking Member Griffith for holding this hearing on such an important topic. Safe and effective vaccines are critical tools as our Nation seeks to eradicate the COVID-19 pandemic and restore our normal way of life as Americans. Thanks to the success of Operation Warp Speed under President Donald Trump's leadership, multiple safe vaccines were developed and produced in record time. As a physician, I believe that every American who wants a vac- cine should be able to get one, and this choice must remain be-tween an individual and their doctor and pharmacist. Alongside other doctors in Congress, I have encouraged every American to talk to their own doctor or healthcare provider or pharmacist. Dis-cuss the vaccine. I chose to get the vaccine as soon as it was avail-able to me. Doctors, nurses, and pharmacists nationwide rec-ommend that the COVID-19 vaccine is received by their patients, and over 90 percent of doctors in the U.S. have already chosen to become vaccinated. There are many reasons that some people, even those who want to be vaccinated, still have not been vaccinated. This is a concern to all of us. These include those who do not have the time; those who do not have the ability to sign up to get a vaccine; and those who are concerned about taking time off from work, especially if they have side effects; those who still have questions about con-cerns of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. These are all indi-viduals who have yet to be vaccinated. We have also heard about access challenges, including for those who live in rural areas of the country. For instance, there are peo-ple who do not have internet, a computer, or a smartphone. They don't know how to sign up for an appointment without those re-sources. We have also heard instances of people who live far away from the closest place offering COVID-19 vaccines. These are some of the hurdles that need to be overcome so that those who live in rural areas are not disproportionately impacted in their ability to get a COVID-19 vaccine, simply because of where they live. Widespread vaccination is the key to restoring our freedom and getting our communities back to normal. I look forward to working with the members of this committee in achieving these goals. Thank you, and I yield back, Madam Chair. Ms. D EGETTE . I thank the gentleman. Does the gentlelady yield back, as well? Mrs. R ODGERS . Yes, Madam Chair, I yield back the remainder of our time. Ms. D EGETTE . Thank you. OK, thank you. The Chair will ask unanimous consent that all Members' written opening statements be made part of the record. And without objection, so ordered. I am now going to introduce our witnesses for today's hearing. But before I do, I just want to note so often\u2014just yesterday, for ex-ample, I was in a panel discussion where people were lamenting the lack of bipartisanship in Congress. This is the Oversight Sub- VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 of Energy and Commerce, and I just want to say how anybody watching this should recognize that, in a strong bipartisan way, the leadership of this committee, which has oversight over healthcare policy in the U.S. Congress, is bipartisan in their strong urging of all Americans to get the vaccine. And I want to thank my colleagues for their strong commitment, and Dr. Joyce, and all the other doctors on the committee, for being so outspoken. With that, I want to introduce our witnesses. Our first witness is Nick Offerman, and my sheet here says ''Actor and Woodworker.'' And I would like to say welcome. I am a big fan, and I know the other members of this committee are, as well. Dr. Saad Omer, who is the director of Yale Institute for Global Health at Yale University. Dr. J. Nadine Gracia, executive vice president and chief oper- ating officer of the Trust for America's Health. Amy Pisani, executive director of Vaccinate Your Family. And now I am going to recognize Mr. Griffith to introduce our last witness. Mr. G RIFFITH . Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. D EGETTE . Mr. Griffith, you are muted. Mr. G RIFFITH . Thank you, Madam Chair, I appreciate it. It is my pleasure to welcome Dr. Karen Shelton. A native of Bris- tol, Virginia, she received her bachelor of science in biology from Wake Forest and her doctor of medicine from the University of Vir-ginia. She practiced for 19 years in OB/GYN, as an OB/GYN, before joining the public sector. Today she serves the Virginia Department of Health as director of the Mount Rogers Health District and act-ing director of Lenowisco and Cumberland Plateau Districts. And Dr. Shelton, we are glad to have you here today, and so proud of the work you are doing for southwestern Virginia. Thank you. Ms. D EGETTE . I thank the gentleman. To the witnesses, I know you are all aware that the committee is holding an investigative hearing. And when we do so, we have the practice of taking testimony under oath. Does any witness have an objection to taking\u2014to testifying under oath today? Let the record reflect the witnesses have responded no. The Chair will then advise you that, under the rules of the House and under the rules of this committee, you are entitled to be accompanied by counsel. Does any witness request to be accom-panied by counsel today? Let the record reflect the witnesses have responded no. And if you would, then, would you [audio malfunction] sworn in?

And so now I would like to start with our first witness. Mr. Offerman, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENTS OF NICK OFFERMAN, ACTOR AND WOOD- WORKER; SAAD B. OMER, P H.D., DIRECTOR, YALE INSTITUTE FOR GLOBAL HEALTH, YALE UNIVERSITY; J. NADINE GRACIA, M.D., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OP-ERATING OFFICER, TRUST FOR AMERICA'S HEALTH; AMY PISANI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY; AND KAREN SHELTON, M.D., DIRECTOR, MOUNT ROGERS HEALTH DISTRICT, VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH STATEMENT OF NICK OFFERMAN Mr. O FFERMAN . Thank you, Subcommittee Chairwoman DeGette, Ranking Member Griffith, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you so much for this opportunity to discuss this issue of vac-cines. As an actor, author, and woodworker, I will not be offering med- ical advice today. I will leave that to the scientists and medical ex-perts on the panel, also known as the smart people. Instead, I would like to lead with my ignorance in these matters to represent the rest of the citizens who are not epidemiologists and doctors, but feet-on-the-ground, hands-in-the-dirt people across our country whose lives and livelihoods have taken a pounding from this pan-demic. Ignorance is an area in which I can claim some authority. And it is from that perch I would like to communicate that I am not only an actor and author and woodworker, but I am also a small business owner and a proud Midwesterner. It is from those per-sonal perspectives I would like to communicate why it is so impor-tant we all get vaccinated. Now, I understand that some Americans with experiences and backgrounds similar to my own are hesitant to get the vaccine. So I wanted to jump on this opportunity to get a positive message out to them. There is nothing more positive than the vaccine itself. I even hear people refer to it as a miracle. Now, this makes sense, given the magnitude of death and destruction that the virus has caused and the speed with which the vaccine prevents that death and destruction once it is administered. But I don't think that ''miracle'' is quite accurate. A miracle is something inexplicable that appears from nowhere, sent by unseen forces. The vaccine is not a miracle. The vaccine is a gift from the world's greatest scientists and thinkers and activists. It is the prod-uct of human ingenuity, the absolute pinnacle of achievement cre-ated out of whole cloth by a bunch of dang geniuses who have saved us from endless death and destruction by solving a complex problem of microbiology in record time. Now, as we have heard, unfortunately, the very expedience with which the vaccine has arrived is also a source of confusion, causing people to fear that it was rushed. Well, you are damn right, folks. It was rushed. It is a pandemic. But you can rest assured the VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec not applied to the safety of the vaccine. The science didn't arrive overnight. The science is based on 40 years of work. The hustle was just applied to getting that science to you and me by bypassing the usual bureaucratic hurdles, the red tape. So when the pandemic hit, all of my own acting work was can- celed. But after a few months we were able to start up again, care-fully shooting TV and film. And the reason for this is because, on each show, about 200-odd crew members looked each other in the eye, and we all agreed to behave like we loved each other. We were ignorant to the medical science, so we agreed to trust the world's smartest doctors and follow every strict protocol so that we could go back to making our livings and taking care of our families. Three different shows I completed because we listened to the doc-tors and we thought about each other. I also run a small custom furniture outfit in Los Angeles called Offerman Woodshop that was crippled by the pandemic. The vac-cine is going to save our business. We at Offerman Woodshop also help run a nonprofit called Would Works that trains individuals ex-periencing homelessness to be wood workers. Now, because of the heightened medical vulnerability of the unhoused population we serve, that program has been officially closed since March of 2020, losing us a year of revenue and leaving our artisans out in the cold. But now, due to the ubiquity of vaccines in L.A. County, we are poised to relaunch all of our programs this summer. Finally, I am close with my family of 38 people in the village of Minooka, Illinois. Unfortunately, because of disinformation from so-cial media platforms with no oversight, a few of them have refused masks from the get-go, and they now refuse the vaccine. We also have a couple of immunocompromised nephews, which means we all have to avoid the antivaxxers, whom we love, for the safety of the rest of the family. It breaks my heart, and we can't wait when we\u2014so we can all be reunited. On January 5th of this year, Los Angeles County had 8,098 peo- ple hospitalized with COVID-19. A few days ago that number was 319. That is more than 96 percent lower in just 4 12months. That is the gift of this vaccine. I urge anyone who has not yet been vaccinated to catch my en- thusiasm and hear the smart people who are about to speak. Medi-cine doesn't care who you voted for. We amazing humans have cre-ated a vaccine that serves the common good. The vaccine doesn't take sides, unless you count alive versus dead. I am so sincerely grateful to the committee for hearing me today. Thank you very kindly. [The prepared statement of Mr. Offerman follows:] VerDate Mar 15 . Thank you so much. I don't think any of us could have said it better. But now it is time for the smart people to talk, and I am first going to recognize Dr. Omer for 5 minutes. Doctor? STATEMENT OF SAAD B. OMER, P H.D. Dr. O MER. Hi, my name is Saad Omer, I am the director of Yale Institute for Global Health, and it is my privilege to be here. Thank you. With the U.S. vaccine supply outpacing the number of doses being administered, there is no shortage of diagnosis for what ails the\u2014or what are the barriers to increasing this coverage even fur-ther. However, 20 years of research on vaccine acceptance and data from this pandemic show that the reality is a bit nuanced. And a lot of these things were appropriately covered by the various Mem-bers who spoke before me. Here are a few observations based on this research. First of all, we must recognize that vaccine acceptance behavior is a spectrum. On the one end, we\u2014of this spectrum\u2014are individ-uals who actively demand vaccines, and on the other hand are peo-ple who would refuse vaccines in all situations. Even if you put Mom and apple pie in a shot, some people would refuse it. Then, you know, in this pandemic, active vaccines\u2014seekers were so vociferous that it created the impression that, as soon as the supply improves and major delivery bottlenecks are resolved, there will be persistent increases in immunization rates until herd im-munity is reached. However, for several weeks there is more vac-cine available in the U.S. than there are seekers. Fortunately, we must recognize that strict refusers are a rel- atively small group, estimated to be approximately 10 to 13 percent of eligible adults. This is larger than other vaccines. But neverthe-less, it is not 20, 30, 40 percent of the population. There is much larger\u2014there is a much larger group of so-called fence sitters, who have questions about the vaccine but can be per-suaded with the right interventions. And then there are those who do not have a lot of concern about immunization but are not particularly enthusiastic about it, either. They don't wake up every morning and think about vaccines, un-like some of us, whose job is to think about vaccines when we wake up every morning. So\u2014but they are still susceptible to\u2014amenable to nudges, and that is good news. So, given the range of enthusiasm about vaccines, there is an interplay between vaccine demand and vaccine access. Those who actively demand vaccines go the extra mile of\u2014for getting it, some-times traveling long distances to be vaccinated. However, now that most of the vaccine enthusiasts have been immunized, practical issues such as how easy it is to get an appointment have become relatively prominent reasons for nonvaccination. So we know from data that ethnic and racial minority groups in the U.S. have been disproportionately harmed by the pandemic. Af-rican Americans, for example, had a COVID-19 mortality rate twice that of White Americans. And many nascent efforts to bring vaccines directly to communities, including programs that work VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec of Dr. Omer has been retained in committee files and is available at https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF02/20210526/112684/HHRG-117-IF02-Wstate-OmerS- 20210526-U1.pdf. with local, civic, and religious leaders, are playing a role in ad- dressing barriers for getting vaccinated. These programs need to be sustained and scaled up. Getting communities engaged with the vaccine will be easier with a scalable template. And I have proposed an approach that in-volves pairing a community validator\u2014for example, a church lead-er\u2014with an expert\u2014for example, a physician\u2014with roots in the same community, and replicating this model across the country. Another group that the data have identified are conservative men, who have emerged as another group particularly hesitant to vaccines against COVID-19. Trying to persuade this group through messages that don't speak to their values could be counter-produc-tive. And we have done some research on how to speak to people who emphasize liberty, and there are ways to doing so. Overall, vaccines have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support, and our data show that support is important in instilling and in-creasing confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, as well. One of the things that I would highlight that\u2014irrespective of the reason for nonvaccination, healthcare providers are the most trust-ed source of vaccine information, even among those who are highly hesitant. A strong endorsement by a healthcare provider is a con-sistent predictor of vaccine acceptance. And so how do we make\u2014 enable our healthcare providers to do so? And one idea is to have a national continued medical education program that trains them in these up-to-date, evidence-based com-munication methods that have been developed and evaluated through Federal funding over the last 5, 10 years, generally around vaccines, and then scale it up at the national level. Yale is devel-oping such a program, and others are welcome to do so, as well. While physician and healthcare providers are best suited to per- suade vaccine-hesitant individuals, having an effective vaccine con-versation requires time. And currently, doctors can charge for ad-ministering a vaccine, but they\u2014if the vaccination doesn't happen, there is no reimbursement. So, since they cannot predict the fu-ture, it would be useful to make this counseling itself reimbursable. So I will stop here and would be happy to answer questions as my turn comes. 1 Ms. D EGETTE . Thank you so much, Doctor. I am now pleased to recognize Dr. Gracia for 5 minutes. Dr. G RACIA . Thank you\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . Doctor? J. NADINE GRACIA, M.D. Dr. G RACIA . Thank you, good morning. My name is Nadine Gracia, and I am the executive vice president and chief operating officer at Trust for America's Health, which is also known as TFAH. TFAH is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public health policy, research, and advocacy organization which has focused attention on the im-portance of a strong and effective public health system as well as on making health equity foundational to policymaking at all levels. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec am honored and very pleased to be before you today to discuss the issue of vaccine confidence during this critically important time in our Nation. By way of background, I previously served as the Deputy Assist- ant Secretary for Minority Health and the Director of the Office of Minority Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented and devastating pandemic for the U.S. and the world. While we have certainly seen disparities in public health emergencies in the past, the COVID- 19 pandemic has greatly exposed our Nation's systemic inequities. Prior to the pandemic, communities of color already faced inequi-table opportunities for health and well-being. And we urge policy-makers not to lose sight of the need for continued outreach, edu-cation, and access for communities that are both at higher risk from COVID-19, and may have greater barriers to vaccination. In October of last year, TFAH, in partnership with the National Medical Association and UnidosUS, cohosted a national convening on building trust in and access to a COVID-19 vaccine in commu-nities of color and Tribal nations. As an outcome of the convening, we published a brief in December with recommendations for policy action. Our recommendations addressed six key areas: First, ensuring the scientific fidelity of the vaccine development process. Second, meaningfully engaging and providing resources to trust- ed community organizations and networks in vaccination efforts. Third, providing communities the information they need to un- derstand the vaccine, make informed decisions, and deliver mes-sages from trusted messengers and pathways. Fourth, ensuring that it is as easy as possible for people to be vaccinated. And vaccines must be delivered in community settings that are trusted, safe, and accessible. Fifth, ensuring complete coverage of the cost associated with the vaccine. And sixth, funding and requiring disaggregated data collection and reporting. Now, while these recommendations are most immediately appli- cable to the COVID-19 vaccine, many will remain essential beyond this pandemic and will be important in earning vaccine trust in these communities into the future. While the focus of this hearing is on vaccine confidence, the data also show that access remains an issue for many populations. A re-cent Kaiser Family Foundation survey highlighted that Latinos are most eager to get the vaccine but continue to face barriers in ac-cess. In another example, vaccination sites may be inaccessible for people who are homebound, including many older adults and peo-ple with disabilities. TFAH released an issue brief in March on ensuring that this population and their caregivers are prioritized for vaccination. The report highlights innovative programs such as one in the chair's home State of Colorado, where the Health Department partnered with a service that provides primary care at home to administer thousands of doses of the vaccine to people who are homebound. Leveraging community partnerships and trusted services that en- VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec with the population can provide important lessons for building community resilience before the next emergency. Some of the COVID-19 vaccination funding provided in the last Congress and through the American Rescue Plan Act has been tar-geted to increasing vaccine confidence and access in communities of color in rural and underserved communities. And it appears that this focus is paying off. Last week the White House announced that, after months of receiving a disproportionately smaller share of vaccinations, 51 percent of those vaccinated in the U.S. were people of color in the prior 2 weeks. We urge Congress and policy-makers to carry forward these lessons for funding and prepared-ness programs to ensure equity is central to the responses. In closing, we urge Congress to build upon the lessons of the pandemic. We must modernize public health infrastructure and workforce. We must invest in community organizations that work with underserved populations and maintain these partnerships long after the pandemic. And we must provide long-term invest-ments, both in the systems that develop and deliver the vaccines and those that build bridges to the communities that are most af-fected. Now certainly is the time. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Gracia follows:] VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Thank you so much, Doctor. Ms. Pisani, now I am very pleased to recognize you for 5 minutes for your opening statement. STATEMENT OF AMY PISANI Ms. P ISANI . Thank you, Chairwoman DeGette and Ranking Mem- ber Griffith and members of the subcommittee, including Congress-man Burgess, who has hosted several Vaccinate Your Family brief-ings over the years on vaccines and disinformation, as well. My name again is Amy Pisani, and I have had the pleasure to serve as the executive director of Vaccinate Your Family for the past 25 years. Vaccinate Your Family was founded by former First Lady Rosalynn Carter and former First Lady of Arkansas Betty Bump-ers, who was the wife of Senator Dale Bumpers. That was 30 years ago this summer. And they founded our organization on the heels of a massive measles outbreak that took the lives of many children and hospitalized over 10,000 people. Our founders traveled to every State in the Nation, building statewide immunization coalitions which continue to thrive. And one thing was clear to them back then and remains true today: Vaccination efforts need Federal sup-port and guidance for certain, but they are best implemented at the local level, where community members can work together to make the greatest impact on their neighbors. I want to take this moment to thank the Members of Congress and both administrations for the work that you have done to pro-tect and promote public health and to really protect us and keep us from economic ruin while we awaited those lifesaving vaccines that Mr. Offerman so clearly, generously spoke about. As you know, everyone is now eligible at 12 years and older, and families are being tasked with making a monumental decision. So\u2014whether to vaccinate their family members of all ages, and where to go to access those vaccines, which is not always a simple procedure in this country. Now, I know that having access to science-based information is really essential to building confidence, and that is what we are going to be talking about a lot today. I actually experienced hesi-tancy while I was pregnant with my first child 20 years ago, in the year 2000. Just after a few years in my role as executive director, I attended the House Committee on Oversight and Government Re-form hearings where Andrew Wakefield, who has since been stripped of his medical license, was given the opportunity to share his now-retracted Lancet study that proclaimed that MMR vaccines caused autism. And that became a spotlight of the Nation. As a pregnant person who was really learning the science of vac- cines still, I became susceptible to the gravitas of Wakefield, and I became bewildered by the data he was presenting to members of the committee. But fortunately, I was able to reach out to Vac-cinate Your Family's board members, including Dr. Walter Orenstein and Dr. Paul Offit, renowned vaccine experts, and they answered each one of my questions with patience and compassion. And they helped me to move from hesitancy to confidence by the time my child's vaccines were due. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 my confidence was built on information provided by experts that I trusted, and from that experience I became even more com-mitted to ensuring that our organization builds educational and so-cial media efforts that bring the science to the public so that they, too, can make informed decisions on vaccines for their own fami-lies. Now, we have learned the two key tenets to building confidence are transparency and respect. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our organization has focused not on encouraging people to just blindly accept an eventual vaccine but to learn about the safety systems in place that ensure the ongoing safety of our vaccines. We called for companies developing vaccines to hit all the usual milestones in the development, keeping in mind that some steps could be conducted simultaneously, and that would speed up the process without compromising their safety or efficacy, as many of the Members have discussed this morning. We also called on the FDA to adhere to the normal review proc- ess, ensuring that each vaccine would be vetted in the public eye, as it would be for any other product. And to build trust in COVID-19 and routine vaccines, we are col- laborating with who we consider\u2014who we think are trusted stake-holders in their communities, one of which is the Good Health WINs program, Women's Immunization Networks. And we are doing so with the National Council of Negro Women to reach their 12 million members with vaccine resources for their family, friends, and neighbors. We have also begun working with D \u00b4a de la Mujer Latina, to not just translate materials into Spanish but to create culturally rel-evant resources that engage and motivate Spanish-speaking people. We are also continuing to work with immunization coalitions to develop new programs to raise vaccination rates in both rural and conservative areas, enlisting new partners, such as agricultural ex-tension workers and evangelical leaders. So, Congress, you can help us on the path to good confidence to\u2014 to confidence by supporting great public health policies. First, let's improve access. Plain and simple, poor children and those in rural areas are up to a third less likely to receive some vaccine. And among adults, we spend $27 billion preventing\u2014on vaccine-preventable diseases that could have been prevented through vaccines. Public health officials need good, timely data to evaluate their ef- forts, and you can help us by supporting four bills, which\u2014many of which are sponsored by E&C Committee members, actually: the Strengthening Vaccines for Children Act; the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act; the Helping Adults Protect Immunity, or HAPI, Act, and that helps eliminate cost-sharing for vaccines for Medicaid beneficiaries; and the Immunization Infrastructure Mod-ernization Act. Finally, it is important to remember that people need other life- saving vaccines. And I do urge the public to come visit VaccinateYourFamily.org, learn about our Don't Skip Vaccines and our Good Health WINs collaborations, and for educational mate-rials on all diseases. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 for Congress, we have a special report that we write for you every year called the State of the ImmUnion, which is on our website. Thank you so much for the opportunity to testify. I look forward to answering questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Pisani follows:] VerDate Mar 15 . Thank you so much. And I urge all the Members to read your report, because it is an excellent snapshot of where we are. And now the Chair is very pleased to recognize Dr. Shelton. You are recognized for 5 minutes for an opening statement. STATEMENT OF KAREN SHELTON, M.D. Dr. S HELTON . Good morning, Chairwoman DeGette, Congress- man Griffith, and members of the committee. My name is Dr. Karen Shelton, and since 2016 I have been the director of the Mount Rogers Health District with the Virginia Department of Health. I am also acting director for a Lenowisco and Cumberland Plateau Health Districts. I am honored to be with you today to dis-cuss the importance of vaccines and vaccine education, as well as the role that local health departments like mine play in improving vaccines, access, and acceptance. We are very proud of our work in the far southwest region of Vir- ginia, in Mr. Griffith's district. I serve a geographic area with 16 localities that is larger than Connecticut. End to end, it takes me about 4 hours to drive across our jurisdiction, with many commu-nities that lack access to broadband internet or even cell service. Situated in the heart of Appalachia, practicing public health in southwest Virginia might look different from public health in other parts of the country. But what all local health departments have in common is the shared goal of protecting and promoting the health of our communities. The response to COVID-19 pandemic has been the epitome of what public health does for our community. We know our commu-nities well, including the assets and barriers to care, distinct local culture, the industries and living situations that might pose chal-lenges, as well as the community-level partners and organizations that must be included to be successful. We live in our community and serve our neighbors. In the fall of 2020, prior to the authorization of COVID-19 vac- cines, our region experienced a surge of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Our area already was experiencing disproportionately poor health outcomes and is at increased risk from COVID-19 due to chronic disease and elderly population and limited healthcare ac-cess. In the winter, district daily caseloads spiked, and we could no longer conduct full case investigation or contact tracing. We ad-vised schools to go fully virtual, and our local hospital capacity tee-tered on the brink of being overrun. At the peak of our disease burden, vaccines became available, and the ability to vaccinate our healthcare workers and first re-sponders, followed by our most vulnerable elderly population, brought inexpressible joy. When vaccines began to roll out late De-cember 2020, the Far Southwest Health District\u2014had the advan-tage of a long history of partnerships, providing vaccines in our communities, and being service-oriented health departments with large staff, allowed us to begin giving vaccines rapidly. With these partnerships, we led the State in percentages of popu- lation vaccinated from the onset of the vaccine campaign through March. We vaccinated our high-risk essential workers and prioritized teachers, because they had been teaching in person VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec the fall. We watched as our case rates fell and healthcare ca- pacity was restored. We realized early on that the vaccination rollout heavily favored the tech savvy, those with internet, cell service, smartphones, and computers. As vaccine supply increased and demand decreased, we transitioned to our mobile units in May to reach the areas of the community that were more remote and had less broadband access. We are working with county administrators, emergency coordina- tors, schools, faith communities, and local businesses to increase vaccine uptake. We are scheduling outreach and mobile clinics at farmers markets, festivals large and small, high traffic areas such as convenience stores, and places people are already gathering: res-taurants, breweries, wineries, churches, hiking trails, sporting events, food banks, parks, music events. We are partnering to give tickets as incentives for vaccines and creating messaging with trusted local voices. Some of our challenges have been in data acquisition. Currently, vaccines given out of State do not show up in our counts. And as we border North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Vir-ginia, this makes it challenging to discern our true vaccine num-bers. Virginia is working to access this data. Another challenge is technology needs. Our existing network is so poor that we cannot reliably participate in Zoom or Google Meet. We know there is some vaccine hesitancy in our community. However, many labeled as hesitant have simply not had access to vaccine or opportunity to have their questions answered. We feel it is important not to label our population, in order to avoid cre-ating resistance where it may not truly exist. We know there are multiple reasons why people choose not to be vaccinated: medical, religious, political. We feel our role is to provide education and op-portunity for vaccination by meeting people where they are in their own community and being champions for the vaccine. We are grateful to Congress, emergency funding, and attention to the needs of public health response of COVID-19. This response would benefit from single-dose vaccine packaging, streamlined na-tional vaccine data, coordinated messaging that speaks to many different populations, and continued resources for local public health outreach. We know that some of the most important components of a suc- cessful vaccination campaign are access, education, opportunity, and respect. We appreciate the support of the Federal Government to create access to vaccine, and we will continue to work respect-fully with our communities for education and opportunity. We will continue to seek to learn from others' successful vaccination strate-gies. Thank you again for inviting me to testify today, and I look for- ward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Dr. Shelton follows:] VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 . Thank you so much, and thanks to all of our wit- nesses for their testimony. It is now time for Members to ask questions, and the Chair will recognize herself for 5 minutes. We know that COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective, and our shot at a return to normalcy. And, as the panel has been discussing today, the main issue is, are Americans choosing not to get vac-cinated, or do they simply not have the opportunity, and how can we help them? Dr. Omer, you testified that there is a large group of ''fence sit- ters'' who have questions about the vaccine, that\u2014but can be pro-vided with the right interventions. Can you very briefly tell us what some of those interventions that the data shows us might work are? Dr. O MER. Yes\u2014no, so this is a group that\u2014which doesn't ac- tively think about vaccine but can be persuaded, or\u2014either their beliefs are\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . Yes, can you tell us some of those methods that can work? Dr. O MER. Yes. So one of them, one of the approaches, is to pro- vide basic information about the immunization process itself. So that is number one. The second thing is making\u2014bringing the vaccines closest to them, but also informing them that it is there. The third is these community outreach efforts\u2014sorry, can you hear me? Ms. D EGETTE . Yes. Dr. O MER. Yes, so I will\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . We can hear you. Dr. O MER. I will continue, yes. So\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . Yes, please. Dr. O MER [continuing]. Then community outreach efforts that are\u2014so the administration has announced, in terms of investing in community health workers and individuals going door to door, there are existing programs there, as well, that are coordinated by community-based organizations. Empowering them with evidence- based messaging, but also the ability to schedule there and then. So these are some of these approaches\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . Right. Dr. O MER [continuing]. That can bridge the gap between demand and supply. Ms. D EGETTE . Thank you very much. And Dr. Shelton, you talked about some of the unique needs of rural individuals. I am wondering if you could tell us some of the strategies that you think work with rural Americans. Dr. S HELTON . Thank you. Yes, we have been working\u2014like I said, one of our greatest problems is access, and\u2014to the vaccine, as far as going out to populations where they have not been able to take advantage of registration and sign-ups online. So going out into the communities where there is not\u2014where they don't have the broadband access or cell service or computer service. So we have been taking our mobile units out into the community to try to reach them. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec would benefit from greater education opportunities with these. We do have some community health workers beginning to come online. But again, training them, and getting them up and rolling to be able to actually answer those questions on the spot with people who were there to give vaccines would be very helpful in our ongoing strategy there. Again, taking opportunities also where there is\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . Great, thanks. OK, thank you. Ms. Pisani, you have been working on these vaccine issues for years, as you said. And one of the greatest pockets of vaccine hesi-tancy is, obviously, with children, which you have been working on. My home State of Colorado has one of the largest groups of these parents. Very briefly, what would you say to the parent of a child who is eligible for a shot, who isn't sure about the benefits? Ms. P ISANI . Congresswoman DeGette, were you calling on me? It broke up for a second. Ms. D EGETTE . Yes, I was calling on you. What would you say to the parent of a child who is reluctant to get a shot for that child about what the benefit would be? Ms. P ISANI . Yes, and I think that that is a big decision that fami- lies need to make. And everyone should be asking about any med-ical product. And that is something that Vaccinate Your Family, we feel really strongly we want to be the sort of no-judgment zone. So really, what you need to think about are, first of all, we know that millions and millions of children have now been vaccinated safely. But also, really thinking about what are the risk-benefit ra-tios, I don't think that some parents are really recognizing that. Even though we haven't had a huge number of children who have died from COVID, we know that they can have multisystem inflam-matory disorder. We don't know what the long-term consequences will be of COVID. We know that people who got polio decades ago are back in their wheelchairs today. We know that, if you get chickenpox, you can get shingles later in life, which I got last year and, let me tell you, it is no picnic. So we don't know what the future will be. And it is\u2014you know, that is why I vaccinate my own kids. I want to make sure that they don't end up suffering something in the future. Ms. D EGETTE . Thank you so much. OK, I am going to finish with you, Mr. Offerman, because I think one of the reasons you have chosen to be a spokesperson urging people to get the vaccine is because you are well known for playing the TV character Ron Swanson, who has a [audio malfunction] gov-ernment programs, even though he worked for the government. And so I want to ask you, what is your message to Americans out there who are wondering if they should get the vaccine, or if they should have their family members get the vaccine? Mr. O FFERMAN . Sorry, can you repeat the\u2014just the last part of your question? Ms. D EGETTE . Sure. Mr. O FFERMAN . Wondering if they should get a vaccine, or\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . What is your best\u2014or tell their family members why they should get a vaccine. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec . Well, to me, it really just comes down to, as Ms. Pisani just pointed out, the risk-benefit ratio, the\u2014what is likely to occur at the hands of COVID-19 is much more catastrophic than what has now been proven to be a harmless vaccine. And so it is not a sensibility of deciding for oneself and saying, ''Oh, my immune system will take care of me.'' Instead, act as a member of a community, or as a good neighbor or a good citizen and say, ''Ah, the experts have made it clear that, for the health of all, we absolutely have to achieve this herd immunity. So let's all get our shots.'' Ms. D EGETTE . Thank you so much. And now, Mr. Griffith, I am very pleased to recognize you for 5 minutes. Mr. G RIFFITH . Thank you, Madam Chair. I took my headset off because, apparently, I was the cause of the previous\u2014my headset was causing the previous buzz. Hopefully this is better\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . We are not judging, though. Don't worry. Mr. G RIFFITH . All right, I appreciate it. And I do appreciate this hearing being held today. In recent months we have seen a variety of efforts by the State, local, and Federal Government to educate and inform the public about vaccines. We have also seen efforts by the private sector, such as public service announcements from our cable providers and other TV and radio providers, and website tools that seek to bring awareness. It is important that we continue to find creative ways to communicate this information, as there are still many pockets of unvaccinated individuals. And Dr. Shelton, I was wondering if I could speak with you about that. You mentioned the proximity of the States and\u2014that are near us, and the committee has heard me talk about that many times, how you could actually be in five States in a single day down in our corner of southwest Virginia. That being said, you are getting the information from the States, but I read an article\u2014or you are hoping to get that information from the States. You haven't yet. I also read an article last week that the Federal Government was starting to share that informa-tion with localities. And I was just wondering if the VA was shar-ing that information, because both Mountain Home there in John-son City and the VA center in Salem have vaccinated a lot of 9th District constituents. And I am just wondering if that is showing up in your records of people in our district that have been vac-cinated. Dr. S HELTON . No, sir, not yet. We don't have the Federal doses calculated\u2014in one instance, but we did talk with one of the local penitentiaries about the number of vaccines given. It actually raised our percentage points 3 points in that county, just\u2014but that was\u2014access to\u2014at this time. Mr. G RIFFITH . And that was the\u2014was that the Grayson facility or the Lee facility? Was it Federal or State? Dr. S HELTON . Federal facility. Mr. G RIFFITH . A Federal facility, OK. Dr. S HELTON . In Lee. Mr. G RIFFITH . Yes, ma'am. And you have talked somewhat about it, but\u2014I know you are learning about the pockets of unvaccinated VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec and I am glad to hear you have mobile units out there. Do we need to do more to get the mobile units out, and maybe not just units that do the vaccinations but, as you have indicated, educate the public about the history of the vaccines and the safeness of them? Are there other things that we should be doing or encouraging Virginia to do in that regard? Dr. S HELTON . Well, we have a messaging campaign, and we are looking to kind of adapt this messaging and work toward our local-ities in things that speak to them. As Dr. Omer said, message about liberty and freedom along a lot of our constituents who may not be wanting to get vaccinated, but also to answer their ques-tions. A lot of people have concerns. Concerns about\u2014is huge in our area, and there are other\u2014some of these more distinct cultural, rural areas, messaging would be very helpful. Also, we do have health education that we are beginning to send out in advance\u2014to answer these questions one on one. And so we are\u2014and how to really\u2014and to be the boots on the ground, and to answer those questions\u2014and more people out doing this would be helpful. Mr. G RIFFITH . And I appreciate that, and I also appreciated in your comments that you talked about not labeling people or pres-suring them, because the people in our area are very proud people. And you want to turn folks off, come in and say, ''We are from Richmond'' or ''We are from Northern Virginia, and we are going to tell you how to do it.'' That doesn't work in our area, as you know, and I appreciated you making those comments. Do you want to amplify that at all? Dr. S HELTON . Well, the health department in southwest Virginia provides a lot of\u2014for our community, and we are a trusted source of information to them. So we do respect all the viewpoints that we do hear, and we try to work with people in their own community and to address their concerns, specifically\u2014again [audio malfunc-tion] people without a lot of\u2014they ought to have all their questions answered. Mr. G RIFFITH . Yes, I appreciate that, and I think it is very help- ful that you are a native of the area and have long served both pa-tients and the community, and I think that helps you get that mes-sage out. If there is anything that we can do to help get that mes-sage out, not only in our part of southwest Virginia but in east Tennessee or rural parts of North Carolina, West Virginia, all of which border our territory, and\u2014we are more than happy to do it. And as you can see, as as the chairwoman pointed out, this is not a Democrat or Republican issue. This is about all of us working together. And we have had some counties that have been hit pretty hard, even over the border in West Virginia. I had a county over there, not in my district, but one that was really hit pretty hard. So we are trying to do it, and we appreciate what you are trying to do and what all the witnesses are doing here today. Thank you. I yield back\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . I thank the gentleman. The Chair now recognizes the chair of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes. I don't see Mr. Pallone. Mr. Pallone? VerDate Mar 15 2010 have lost him briefly. And so, Ms. Kuster, are you ready to go? Why don't I recognize you for 5 minutes? Ms. K USTER . Thank you, and I apologize, I am just trying to pull up my remarks. Thank you so much, Chairwoman DeGette\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . Take your time. Ms. K USTER . Can you hear me? Chairwoman DeGette, can you hear me? Ms. D EGETTE . Yes, yes. Ms. K USTER . Great. Thank you for holding this important hear- ing today, and thanks so much for our witnesses, for your testi-mony and preparation. The progress we have seen these past few months in beating back COVID-19 has been nothing short of remarkable. In just over 1 year, we have undertaken an incredible effort to manufacture multiple highly effective and safe vaccines. And we have under-taken, literally, a warlike vaccination campaign to get shots into the arms of the American people. On January 20th, when President Biden took the oath of office, only 1 percent of adults were fully vaccinated. But today over 50 percent of American adults are fully vaccinated. And not to brag on New Hampshire, but over 70 percent of adults in my State have at least 1 dose. While these statistics are encouraging, more must be done as we begin to see the signs of vaccine hesitancy among certain popu-lations. A key component to our continued vaccination efforts is en-suring that we have hard data collected to ensure that we can im-prove access in rural communities, including my district. And that is why earlier this year I introduced the Immunization Infrastruc-ture Modernization Act, bipartisan legislation that would improve and expand information sharing between State and Federal govern-ments, as well as public and private healthcare providers, to en-sure that vaccines are being administered effectively, efficiently, and fairly across all States and territories. Immunization information systems, IIS, are secure, multifaceted systems that allow for the sharing of crucial information and the maintenance of records. My bipartisan legislation aims to bolster these systems and support real-time immunization record data ex-change and reporting. Dr. Gracia, you identified in your testimony deficiencies in our immunization information systems, many of which could be im-proved by advancing my bipartisan legislation with Congressman Bucshon. Can you discuss why it is so important for immunization information systems to be consistent in the type of data collected and reported? Dr. G RACIA . Yes, thank you for that question and for your leader- ship with regards to addressing the importance of a strong and ro-bust immunization infrastructure. That is, indeed, really, a core part of what we need with regards to our public health system and our public health infrastructure. What we have seen, for example, has been\u2014over the years that, actually, the immunization information systems have not kept up to pace with regards to the need for funding to ensure that we have really robust, comprehensive immunization systems that can do the type of surveillance, whether it is in the detection of outbreaks, VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec to tailor interventions\u2014because you identify that there are certain populations in communities that, either for hesitancy or for access, have not been immunized\u2014and then being able to en-sure that there is interoperability of these systems, as well as en-suring that the programs themselves\u2014and that the immunization program itself has the ability to do the type of vaccine education and outreach. And so, as we think about, certainly, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, how critical that is for the local communities, as well as States, to be able to tailor interventions to be able to get resources to those communities that are undervaccinated, it is also important in the longer term, as we think about shoring up our im-munization infrastructure to be able to detect and assess and ad-dress the next emergency. Ms. K USTER . Great. And Mr. Offerman, thank you for joining us and using your platform to encourage Americans to get the COVID vaccine. You speak to the effects the pandemic has had on your work in the entertainment industry and how, by listening to doc-tors and trusting each other, you and your colleagues were able to safely get back to work last year. Since this was a successful strategy, how do you think this can help our national vaccination effort, particularly in rural areas like the one you grew up in? Mr. O FFERMAN . Well, you know, I think it is just a matter of ex- tending the leadership that the\u2014our other witnesses are talking to, and getting this clear messaging to all of our citizens who are con-fused by the information they are getting. That comes from a vari-ety of reasons: misinformation, conspiracy theories, mistrust, et cetera. And I think we just need to turn up the volume on the clear information that it is safe, everyone should do it. It is your duty, as a family member. You know, if you love your- self, your family, your community, it is beholden on all of us to step up and be a good neighbor and a good family member and just shout that to the hills. Ms. K USTER . Great. Well, thank you for helping us shout that to the hills. And with that, I yield back. Ms. D EGETTE . I thank the gentlelady. The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, for 5 minutes. Mrs. R ODGERS . Thank you, Chair DeGette and Morgan Griffith. As ranking member, I really appreciate the approach of today's oversight hearing, and thank you to all our witnesses. I, too, just have some followup questions. Dr. Omer, I wanted to ask the simple question: Do you have con- fidence in the three COVID-19 vaccines that are available today in the United States and the ways in which they were developed, re-viewed, and authorized? Dr. O MER. Absolutely. And as an independent academic, I would have said so if I did have any lack of confidence in them. Mrs. R ODGERS . Thank you. Ms. Pisani, I wanted to ask, do you believe it is important for people to get the best and most accurate information? VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 you stated that, that you believe it is important. How do you believe that they can, and allow them to make the best decisions for that\u2014themselves? Because right now, some of the most common questions we have from people are that they are concerned about getting\u2014you know, they want to make sure that they have the best and most accurate information when it comes to getting the COVID-19 vaccine, and just any insights you have, as far as addressing those concerns. Ms. P ISANI . Well, I mean, I think there's a combination of issues, obviously. And maybe we'll talk a little bit more about social media disinformation, and that is a really important issue that we have to deal with. But we do know that people do trust their providers. And so they are the most important source of information right now, no matter where you live. But, you know, hearing from some folks in rural and urban, the challenges are so different, depending on where you live. And I lit-erally traveled the Nation with Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Bumpers. And if you're in Wyoming, and you are an hour and a half away from your medical care, that type of message that you need to get is a little bit different than a person who could just go down the road and go to any clinic and get vaccinated. So that trusted messenger issue, I mean, we are getting a little tired of hearing it, but it is so essential. Like, if you trust your evangelical leader, that is the person who needs to encourage your vaccinations. If you trust your local football coach, if you are from Penn State, those are the folks that you want to encourage to talk about vaccines. So I think it is different, no matter\u2014depending on where you live. Mrs. R ODGERS . Thank you. Dr. Omer, I wanted to ask you to address the issue of people being concerned about side effects, because the fear of the fever, the fatigue, especially following the second vaccine, is one of the leading reasons why people are choosing not to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Would you just address what you think is the best way to approach someone who is concerned about the side effects and the potential of losing a day of work or two? Dr. O MER. Yes. I think that is a really good question. So there are two things that should be emphasized for the individual. First of all, that this is the transient side effect. We get fatigue, pain, sometimes fever. They are expected. They were seen in the trials, and they are not connected to the serious adverse events, et cetera. So if you are getting that, it is just that, it is inconvenience. It is hard, in its own right, to be down with fever or fatigue, but it is not a sign of something more\u2014sort of ominous, it's not an omi-nous sign for a more severe and long-term side effect. That is num-ber one. The reason why it is happening is that, when your body is trying to mount a strong immune response, for some people\u2014not for ev-eryone, I did not get these side effects. That did not mean that I did not mount an adequate immune response. But for some people, that means that that inflammation, that immune response, leads to these transient side effects. And so those are the things we need to communicate. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec . Thank you. And my final question, Dr. Shelton, in your written testimony you note that in the rural areas it is especially important to build the cross-sector partnerships in order to meet the needs of the com-munity. And I just wanted to ask if you could share any examples of those partnerships and why you believe it is critical in the rural communities, in particular. Dr. S HELTON . Yes, we have built these relationships over time. It is very important, the relationships we have with our hospitals, as well as our pharmacies and healthcare providers with the roll-out of the vaccine. But we also have long-term partnerships with our county administrators, emergency coordinators, and schools. When it came time to go out and give the vaccine to the students, for those who were 16-plus and then 12-plus, we, you know\u2014begin to provide vaccines within the schools. Also, working in our larger\u2014emergency coordinators, just having the whole community pitch in and help with these efforts went a long way toward increasing\u2014and the number of people we were able to vaccinate. Mrs. R ODGERS . Super. Thanks for your work. Madam Chair, I yield back the remainder of my time. Thank you. Ms. D EGETTE . I thank the gentlelady. The Chair now is pleased to recognize the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes. Mr. P ALLONE . Thank you, Chairwoman DeGette. My questions, a lot of them are the same ones that Ranking Member Rodgers asked, so I guess we think alike, Cathy. But let me try to ask those that maybe you didn't cover. I wanted to ask Dr. Omer about these, you know, misconceptions. You know, we hear fears from Americans about vaccine safety, that they were developed too quickly, or the process\u2014review proc-ess wasn't rigorous enough, and there is also this thing about the side effects with\u2014that vaccines can cause fertility problems. Just, you know, set the record straight for us. Why should we not be worried about this type of misinformation that is swirling, par-ticularly online? Dr. O MER. Yes. So this is a misconception that is out there that we\u2014the corners were cut. The corners weren't\u2014you know, nobody took a shortcut. It is just that we built a highway. And that is why the\u2014streamlining the process, cutting the\u2014some of the bureau-cratic process but also increasing efficiency by how we recruited in trials. If I may take the liberty of giving you one example. So if you need 30,000 people in a trial, which were an average size, 30 to 40,000 people, you can have 30 sites with 1,000 people, or you can have 60 sites with 500 people, or 120 sites for recruitment for 250 people. So that is why\u2014that is one example of how efficiently we expanded the number of sites, because resources were available, et cetera, so that we did these trials quickly, rather than doing it\u2014 you know, waiting for each site to enroll, let's say, 1,000 people, or 3,000, if you were going with 10 sites. So that is important. The processes that were used to ensure safety and efficacy are time tested. This was\u2014these were the processes, the data collec-tion, the evaluation. And just to remind everyone that all\u2014with all VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 these trials, by regulation they have to have an independent data and safety monitoring board. So, even beyond the outside com-mittee independent review that FDA performed while these trials were going on, there was weekly, ongoing safety review and effec-tiveness review after the data became available was happening. And then now, the\u2014there is an unprecedented effort to ensure that there is robust vaccine safety surveillance. And that is why you hear about certain signals. You know, if you look for\u2014you do robust surveillance, you hear about these signals. And FDA and the CDC has done\u2014taken a rational\u2014conservative, in a sense\u2014to protect the safety\u2014to protect the general public against any uncer-tainty, as well. That path, by leveraging those data and having a short timeframe from signal emergence to signal evaluation, and then a recommendation. So this has enabled us to trust the proc-ess, and to trust the outcome of this development and deployment process. Mr. P ALLONE . Well, thank you. Another [audio malfunction]. Ms. D EGETTE . OK, Mr. Chairman, can you start your question again? Mr. P ALLONE . Yes. [Audio malfunction] come down today to meet with the vice president on broadband. So I had to get on the road. But this is about whether people who previously had COVID-19 should still get vaccinated. Dr. O MER. So I don't know if\u2014\u2014 Mr. P ALLONE [continuing]. Understanding around that. Dr. O MER. Sorry, I\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . Go ahead, Doctor. Dr. O MER. Yes, so\u2014OK, I was unclear if the question was for me, but I would answer it. Mr. P ALLONE . Yes, it is OK. Well, I guess it\u2014actually if Dr. Gracia wants to answer it, about whether people who previously had COVID-19 [audio malfunction]. Dr. G RACIA . Yes, the recommendation is that people who have had COVID-19 should still get the COVID-19 vaccine. You know, there is natural immunity and antibodies that are developed through infection with COVID-19. However, that is not as robust as what we know from\u2014with regards to vaccination. And so\u2014and we don't know how long that natural immunity can last. And so the recommendation is, indeed, for those who have COVID-19 to also get the COVID-19 vaccination. Mr. P ALLONE . All right, thank you so much. Thank you, Chairwoman DeGette, I appreciate it. I yield back. Ms. D EGETTE . Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chair is now pleased to recognize Dr. Burgess for 5 minutes. Mr. B URGESS . I thank the chair, and I thank all of our witnesses for being here today. This is such an important panel that we have put together. And I\u2014you know, the\u2014one of the things that leads to hesitancy, of course, is not being consistent in the information that is deliv-ered. And I think Mr. Offerman, actually, said it at the beginning of his testimony. He is\u2014''Here I am, just a regular guy, and we have to defer to all the scientists.'' But let me just tell you, Mr. Offerman, this is a novel disease. And the scientists were sometimes embarrassed, because what they VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec beginning wasn't what they ended up saying sev- eral weeks or months later. And I can think of no area where that has been less pronounced\u2014or where it would be more pro-nounced\u2014as where did this virus originate. And the stories that we were told early on are now not comporting with the stories that we are hearing now. And Chairwoman DeGette, I think it would be incumbent upon this committee, being the primarily investigative committee of the subcommittee of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, to ask those questions, and ask them thoroughly. I realize\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . Will the gentleman yield? Mr. B URGESS . Yes, I would be happy\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . Will the gentleman yield? So I agree. I think it is very important that we find a\u2014that we investigate where\u2014particularly, if the virus escaped from some lab, because that, of course, has implications for international health. Mr. B URGESS . Yes\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . And I have already spoken to the ranking mem- ber. Whatever we can do\u2014I don't think China is going to produce any documents to this committee. Mr. B URGESS . No\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . But we are going to do whatever investigation is appropriate. And Mr. Griffith and I are on the same page. Mr. B URGESS . So reclaiming my time, because it is\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . I will give you a little extra time, too. Mr. B URGESS . All right. Ms. D EGETTE . I will give you a little extra. Mr. B URGESS . I have got more than I can get through, anyway, and I, obviously, will be submitting questions for the record, as is my habit. But that is\u2014if we can reestablish some credibility, even after the fact, I think that is going to be so critically important, because not only do we have a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, we had it on top of a once-in-a-lifetime political year, and it left people, in many cases, confused. And now the challenge for all of us is to\u2014how do we get to people and help them understand what is\u2014what I believe would be in their best interest. Chairman Pallone, I guess we have lost you to the ether some- where, but I have asked for your help in interceding with the Speaker. All of us, or most of us, took the vaccine in December. The Speaker told us we were\u2014it was necessary for the continuity of government, and so\u2014fully vaccinated, to be sure. And yet we behave as if we are still frightened of the disease. And that does not send\u2014in my opinion, that does not send the right message. So, in conjunction with other doctors in the Doctors Caucus, we have asked the Speaker for clarification. We have to vote in these odd ways. We are doing this hearing in a virtual for-mat. This should be in our main hearing room. This should be\u2014if we are, indeed, all vaccinated, and we\u2014or those of us who are vaccinated believe that we can no longer trans-mit the illness or contract the illness, we should behave that way. And if there is someone who says, well, for whatever reason, I don't feel comfortable being in that setting, sure, let's have special ar-rangements. But we shouldn't be doing hearings remotely. We VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec doing voting on this intractable schedule that just seems to never end. It doesn't allow us the opportunity to amend bills and have the appropriate legislative input. So I just make that plea. It is time. It is time for us to get back to normal. Now, I do have to ask Mr. Offerman a question, because this is absolutely critical, and I need to know the answer to it. With your vast experience as a wood worker, do you find that English walnut has no sense of humor? Mr. O FFERMAN . Thank you for your question. I want to hit one point you just mentioned, and that is I believe, once you are vac-cinated, you can still transmit the virus. It doesn't eradicate that possibility. The vaccination is simply a protection. But the reason that we are\u2014I believe we are still trying to be safe, is because you can still catch it and pass it to others. Mr. B URGESS . Yes, well, the\u2014reclaiming my time again, the CDC guidelines that came out a week ago Thursday seemed to have\u2014 seemed in a different place than that. And I recognize that there is new information coming all the time, and we have\u2014many of us have been\u2014have issued pronouncements that turned out then to be inoperative later on. That is part of dealing with an novel virus that is of this severity. But it does appear that those who have been vaccinated are\u2014if the virus is recoverable from their nasopharynx, it is no longer in-fective. And we need to know the answer to that, to be sure. But you just look at the broad graphs of the prevalence of disease in the United States of America, and, clearly, something is different now than it was in January. And do we need to be behaving the same way we were in January? And if we believe that the vaccine is what has brought us to that point, why don't we model that behavior? Thank you, Madam Chair. I will yield back, and I have got a ton of questions I will submit for the record. Ms. D EGETTE . I thank the gentleman. The Chair now recognizes Miss Rice for 5 minutes. Miss R ICE. Thank you, Madam Chair. And Dr. Burgess, I couldn't agree with you more. I would love to get\u2014for all of us to get back to our prepandemic life. And I would encourage you to speak to your colleagues on your side of the aisle as to why they are preventing us from doing that, and be-cause they are not getting vaccinated. Mr. Offerman, if I could ask you, if you had every unvaccinated Member of Congress before you, what would you say to them? How would you convince them? What would you say to convince them to get the vaccine? Mr. O FFERMAN . Well, thank you for your question. And just to answer Dr. Burgess quickly, English walnut is indeed humorous. If I had the unvaccinated Members of Congress before me, I would simply try to appeal to their common sense and say, ''Look, as our conversation just now pointed out, we are humans, which means we are always learning more information. Sometimes we think we have got it figured out, but then things continue to evolve. Even if we have a solution, the variants show up. We will VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 have to be vigilant. There will be more, you know, there will be more, ostensibly, SARS viruses coming in our future.'' And so I would just say, ''Look, all we\u2014with the information that we have, the decent thing to do to\u2014is to pitch in for the common good, regardless of any other misinformation, and get the shot.'' And if you guys\u2014you know, if you need a cookie, or a lottery ticket, or I will take you down the street for a glass of single malt, if that is what it will take, then I will be happy to pick up that bar tab. Miss R ICE. You might have some Members take you up on that, Mr. Offerman. The daily average vaccine administration in the U.S. reached a peak of 3.4 million doses in April of 2021. Unfortunately, that aver-age has declined to approximately 1.8 million daily doses in recent weeks. So this is the issue that we are talking about. Mr. Offerman, you mentioned you had some family members back home in Illinois who are told\u2014look, we are not going to be able to get\u2014I have someone in my own family who is \u2014knows\u2014 you know, has family members who knows the science of this, that were experts in infectious disease. Do you know\u2014and I am not ask-ing you to out any of your relatives by name, but is the reason\u2014 is it mis- and disinformation? Because there is so much of that on social media. We can't con- trol where people are getting their information from, but we know that there are, you know, a handful of people, Robert Kennedy Jr. being one of whom, who posts mis- and disinformation regarding this vaccine every day on social media. So have you been able to figure out the source of the hesitancy in people in your family, and how do you address that, specifically? Mr. O FFERMAN . Well, I mean, yes, the\u2014one of the family mem- bers in question actually used to work as a phlebotomist. And so they feel they have, you know, a sense of authority. And their in-formation streams are, you know, both news channels, or ''news channels,'' and social media platforms that turn this issue somehow into a political football and say, you know, ''Is this administration telling you the truth? Should we listen more to this administra-tion?'' And this\u2014you know, I understand that that is, you know, the state of affairs in modern-day America. But this\u2014what we say to this family member is, ''Your children, two\u2014arguably, the cutest children in the family\u2014haven't gotten to see their grandparents for over a year because of the danger of''\u2014you know, it is a perfect storm. We have a couple of immunocompromised kids, as well. So we have to be incredibly vigilant. ''Can't you just do this for the good of the family?'' And, you know, because of their incredible will and their wonder- ful Midwestern stubbornness, they so far refused. So we just try not to pull our hair out, and keep taking a deep breath and say, ''Hopefully, we can all get together soon.'' Miss R ICE. Mr. Offerman, I just want to thank you so much, be- cause, you know, you say that you are not one of the smart people here and not one of the scientists, but you\u2014your ability to reach millions of people is unmet by anyone on this Zoom. And so I really appreciate you being\u2014and willing to talk about this, and to do it VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec a way that, you know, can reach regular people. You are talking specifically to people who don't have medical backgrounds, and many of whom admire the work that you do. So thank you so much. And thank you to all of the other smart witnesses who testified here today, and I yield back. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. D EGETTE . I thank the gentlelady. The Chair now recognizes Mr. McKinley for 5 minutes. Mr. M CKINLEY . And I thank you, Madam Chairman, and thank you for getting this panel together, because this is going to be an interesting discussion. But before I raise further questions, I would like to go to Dr. Omer because, based on his written testimony, there were some\u2014 he revealed he had quite a knowledge of the process of the vaccina-tion. So I am asking you if\u2014without Operation Warp Speed, would we have a vaccine today in just 8 months? Dr. O MER. I think it is correct to say that the efforts that hap- pened over the last year have really helped develop and sort of evaluate these vaccines. But I also point out\u2014\u2014 Mr. M CKINLEY . If I could, if\u2014let me just\u2014that is what I wanted to point\u2014I think back on the other, as to why we are not getting\u2014 I think we are sending mixed signals. We elected officials, public statements, public\u2014I think we are sending confusing and mixed signals out to the public. No wonder they are\u2014look back on just last year, just\u2014not even 7 months ago, 8 months ago, we had the then-Senator Harris saying that she would not take a vaccine if it were approved by the Trump administration. Now, think about that. And then we have\u2014for decades all of us were taught, once we get a vaccine, we are protected against a disease. But then\u2014and then, on May 13th is a\u2014a couple of weeks ago, the CDC announced that vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks. That sets the tone. But now, follow through with that. The next statement, just a few days later, a week later, the President was at the Ford Rouge plant in Michigan, wearing a mask after he had been vaccinated, after the CDC had already come out. Dr. Fauci was wearing a double mask, and he was asked about that, the issue, again, challenged on that. So, Dr. Omer, again, do you think the actions of our political offi- cials and\u2014their statements and their actions, are they impacting us on the vaccine hesitancy? Dr. O MER. So, unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to track back, you know, sort of\u2014since I wasn't following exact specific day or time where everyone was\u2014anyone was wearing a mask, but I can do\u2014I can speak broadly, because we tested this in our messaging trials, as well, that bipartisan support and endorsement of vaccines are extremely important. And so I agree with a clear, bipartisan message on this issue is helpful. Mr. M CKINLEY . OK. So let me say\u2014build off a little bit what Dr. Burgess was saying, because I think we are all frustrated about this, because Speaker Pelosi has said she is not going to let us go VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec into session until all the Members are vaccinated. But unlike the Senate\u2014they are back, and they are not wearing masks. They are back on the floor. They are working in committees. But we are still\u2014like this hearing today\u2014still being done virtually. Now, this is contradictory towards what the Attending Physician has said and what the CDC's guidelines are saying. So, Dr. Omer, do you think that Nancy Pelosi is following the science in con-tinuing to keep the House shut down and extending proxy voting? What is the end game? Dr. O MER. So Congressman, unfortunately, I am not in the posi- tion of evaluating specific House policies because I haven't looked at it. But I will say that, when these trials were done, they did not in- clude end points for transmission. So when the data came out, it was very appropriate to say that, to prevent transmission to others, we should wear masks even if you are vaccinated. Since then, the state of evidence has evolved. And for several weeks, or actually, you know, a couple of months, we had\u2014we started seeing studies that say that even transmission is drastically reduced. But there is a nuance to this. The nuance is that if you know\u2014 if you can verify that everyone is vaccinated, then it is perfectly safe. And CDC has said that, for people to interact like, you know, pretty much normal, with the exception if you are in a healthcare facility, et cetera. Mr. M CKINLEY . Then, if I could, just in\u2014\u2014 Dr. O MER. We could\u2014\u2014 Mr. M CKINLEY [continuing]. Go back, if I could\u2014reclaiming my time, but are we ever going to get\u2014it is not realistic to get 435 Members of the House to get vaccinated before we go back into ses-sion again. Are we going to continue this nonsense? I think it\u2014let me hear from you. Dr. O MER. So I would\u2014again, without commenting on specific policies, because I am not sort of that knowledgeable about the de-tails, but I would say that, even if you cannot verify, a lot of activi-ties can happen indoors. CDC has said that, with masking and\u2014 but then it depends on what the compliance is for masking, et cetera, if you don't know who is vaccinated and who is not. So that\u2014there is a nuance there. I do think that we have evi- dence of high protection and decreased transmission. Mr. M CKINLEY . Thank you. Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. D EGETTE . Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Congresswoman Schakowsky, the birthday girl, for 5 minutes. Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . I thank the chair and all our witnesses. It is so great to celebrate with you today. In March the Center for Countering Digital Hate and Anti-Vax Watch found that 65 percent of antivaccine social media content stemmed from just 12 individuals called the Disinformation Dozen. Despite being brought to the attention of the social media compa-nies, a review one month later found that at least nine of those in-dividuals still maintained active accounts on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter. VerDate Mar 15 2010 alarming, a sample review of Facebook posts over the last week showed that online\u2014that only 19 posts had fact-checking la-bels applied to them. The posts that are left say things like ''asymptomatic people can't spread the virus'' and that the ''COVID-19 vaccine is a genetic mutation.'' One post alone reached approximately 62,500 people. Ms. Pisani, although vaccine myths continue to be accessible on social media, we understand that your organization had a chal-lenging time getting factual vaccine information posted on social media. Can you briefly tell us about your experience, and how long did it take to be resolved? Ms. P ISANI . That is a really great question. It happened\u2014it has happened to us on several occasions. And so at Vaccinate Your Family we started Facebook\u2014I believe it was almost the year it began. We jumped right into social media. We felt like it was a really important place to be. And what happened was, years ago, we ended up being drowned out by these larger organizations that have a lot of money. And they were sharing disinformation. And it was a\u2014just a few people, but with the most amount of money. While the rest of us were starting to realize that we had to provide information in order to be allowed to post, we hadn't realized it yet. And so they had beat the algorithms. We didn't know about them yet, so we hadn't fixed our problem. Most recently, during the COVID year, we were no longer able to get comments on our Facebook page for almost 7 months. We never were able to speak to a single person at Facebook. That is a really big deal, because we are the largest social media group on vaccines in the nation, and we have people from around the world. So when we can't\u2014when our posts don't get boosted because we don't have a lot of movement on our pages, that makes a really big difference. So the companies can fix our algorithms. They\u2014there is a lot that they can do. They can stop feeding people disinformation based on their search terms, on the information that they are al-ready reading. They could whitelist groups like Vaccinate Your Family, Voices for Vaccines, the Academy of Pediatrics, and other groups that share fact-based information. There is so much that could be done to fix the problem. Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . Well, thank you for that. That is very dis- turbing, and I want to work with you to see if we can make that better, so that factual information doesn't have barriers to getting out. Dr. Gracia, unfortunately, as you mentioned in your testimony, misinformation campaigns have targeted people of color and low-in-come communities, often without accessibility to antivaccine\u2014to\u2014 without accountability. The antivaccine movement has been able to exploit justifiable, historic distrust, and the media companies have helped to further their antivaccine goals. Can you talk to us a little bit about that? I am almost out of time, but I would love to hear that. Dr. G RACIA . Yes, thank you for that question. It is important, be- cause when we talk about why certain communities may not be VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec issue of misinformation is so critically im- portant, and it is important as it relates to communities of color. There are efforts underway. One of the efforts that we have, for example, at Trust for America's Health, is through our Public Health Communications Collaborative, in which\u2014it is a collabo-rative between Trust for America's Health and a partnership with the CDC Foundation and the de Beaumont Foundation, where we actually do tracking on misinformation and provide guidance, in particular, for public health officials at the local and State levels to be able to address misinformation. And then there are also other efforts. For example, the cam- paigns Between Us, About Us, where you have, for example, a cam-paign specifically for the Latino community that was recently launched through UnidosUS and the Kaiser Family Foundation, creating PSAs and other tools featuring Latino healthcare pro-viders and other Latino health workers that can be used in the community to be able to combat some of that misinformation that is happening. And there is, likewise, a campaign specifically featuring Black healthcare providers that the Black Coalition Against COVID and others are engaged in. And that way they have the tools and the resources to be able to address some of the many myths about the COVID-19 vaccine. Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . Thank you so much. And trusted messengers, I think, are so important. So thank you for your important work. I yield back, and I appreciate\u2014\u2014 Ms. D EGETTE . I thank the gentlelady. And the Chair now recog- nizes Mr. Palmer for 5 minutes. Mr. P ALMER . Thank you, Madam Chair, and happy birthday, Jan. And following up on your last question, I think that there is a role for faith-based organizations in increasing the confidence in the vaccines and maybe even serving as a familiar distribution site. And what I would like to ask Dr. Gracia is, has anyone looked into reaching out and partnering with the faith-based organizations for vaccine distribution or for public service announcements as a communication vehicle to raise the confidence among people, par-ticularly in minority communities, which we know have an aver-sion to certain vaccinations? Dr. G RACIA . Yes, absolutely. The faith community, faith leaders are such important partners as it relates to being trusted mes-sengers and trusted institutions, as far as places of worship in com-munities. And in certain communities of color, it is actually one of the entities we highlighted in our policy brief as a core and trusted messenger. There are, indeed, many messengers. The administration has certainly been engaging with the faith community but also seeing, you know, local health departments, State health departments that have worked with faith leaders, where it is either to be able to get messages out to communities or to serve as potential vaccination centers, utilizing, for example, a church parking lot, doing virtual town halls to be able to deliver messages that they trust from their faith leaders. Mr. P ALMER . Dr. Shelton, along the same lines, there are cer- tain\u2014there are unique issues that rural communities face when it comes to vaccine distribution. And I think that working through VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec faith community in rural areas could be helpful. But can you comment on how State and local governments could increase access to and confidence in the vaccines in rural communities? Dr. S HELTON . Yes, thank you. Certainly\u2014has been a great asset to our vaccine distribution\u2014we had\u2014\u2014 Mr. P ALMER . Madam Chairman, I can't hear her answer. I\u2014sus- pend my time for a moment. Ms. D EGETTE . Yes, yes, we are having difficulty hearing you. Dr. S HELTON . OK, can you hear me now? Ms. D EGETTE . Yes. Perfect, thank you. Mr. P ALMER . OK. Dr. S HELTON . OK, yes, certainly, our faith communities have been a huge asset\u2014sites that we had\u2014\u2014 Mr. P ALMER . Madam Chairman, suspend again, if I may. Ms. D EGETTE . Yes, yes. This is the other issue this committee needs to work on, is our broadband access in rural areas. Mr. P ALMER . Yes. Ms. D EGETTE . So let's try it again. Mr. P ALMER . If she can't\u2014if we can't understand her, can she just answer the question in writing, submitted to the committee? We will try it one more time, but if we can't hear her, we will just ask for her to submit it in writing. Dr. S HELTON . OK. Can you hear me now? Mr. P ALMER . Oh, yes. Ms. D EGETTE . Yes. Dr. S HELTON . OK. Certainly, our faith-based communities have been a very important part of\u2014many of our large\u2014that we have had over the last several months have been in faith\u2014we do this for our\u2014also for local outreach to our neighborhoods, actually some of our\u2014communities, including our Black and Hispanic communities. So that's a very important thing. As far as our State and local governments, I think working with our faith communities\u2014there. Mr. P ALMER . OK. I couldn't understand all of it. So, if you don't mind, submit it in writing. I would also like you to respond to\u2014I have had some people speak to me about people having excess to vaccine and not knowing what to do with it, and concerned about it expiring. So, if there are some things going on in your State and local gov- ernments in that regard, I would like to know about that. And I would also like to point out that we are all focused on injectable vaccines, and there is research being done right now\u2014 there are clinical trials being done on another internasal vaccine that not only has shown promise in mucosal immunity, but it will protect against infection, but it also protects against transmission. And I\u2014Doctor, I just hope that we will continue to focus on the de-velopment of new vaccines that there might not be as much opposi-tion to. And the last thing I would like to say, Madam Chairman, I don't know how many of you have had a chance to look at Mr. Offerman's website for his wood working, but the canoe that he made out of cedar is absolutely, stunningly beautiful. And I don't know if he built it, or someone in his shop built it. They built a dresser out of walnut, apparently, a solid piece of walnut. It is VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec I don't know if any of us could afford a canoe or a dresser like that. But they are really beautiful pieces. And I want to commend you for your outreach to the homeless. I think one of the great tragedies of the welfare state and home-lessness is the loss of incredible talent and ingenuity and imagina-tion among those people. And the fact that you are bringing them in, giving them a chance to demonstrate their artistic ability is amazing. And I want to congratulate you on that. And I yield back. Ms. D EGETTE . The gentleman yields back. The Chair now recog- nizes the chairman of the Environment and Climate Change Sub-committee, Mr. Tonko, for 5 minutes. Mr. T ONKO . Thank you, Chairwoman DeGette. Can you hear me? Ms. D EGETTE . Yes, we can hear you. Mr. T ONKO . OK, thank you. And I thank you and Ranking Mem- ber Griffith for hosting this wonderful meeting. We have heard today that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to\u2014for increasing COVID-19 vaccination rates. While we have made tremendous strides in just a few short months to increase vaccine supply, we know that availability does not equal access. And the reality is that many Americans remain unvaccinated due to access barriers to getting vaccinated. Dr. Gracia, you emphasized in your testimony, and I quote, ''lack of culturally and linguistically appropriate information and serv-ices, less access to technology required to sign up, less access to transportation, and a lack of paid sick leave may be hindering vac-cine access for some populations.'' So how are these barriers pre-venting unvaccinated Americans from accessing COVID-19 vac-cines, especially those who make up the movable middle? What populations are most likely to face these challenges? Dr. G RACIA . Certainly. Thank you for that question. So if we think about, for example, low-income communities, many commu-nities of color, with regards to being disproportionately, actually, those that work in some of the frontline jobs, some of the jobs that were deemed as essential jobs in the COVID-19 pandemic, that ac-tually\u2014many workers of color did not have access to paid sick leave. And so the challenge of, for example, being able to take time off or being worried about\u2014and losing income, or losing their job, being able to get the vaccine, and worrying about the side\u2014poten-tial side effects and having to take time off can be a barrier. And so addressing those types of issues, such as sick leave, as well as access to child care that families may need in order to get the vac-cination, are addressing some of the issues of equitable access. As it relates to providing information that is culturally and lin- guistically appropriate, that is ensuring that, for the diversity of communities that we are serving, that information is available, that it is respectful and responsive to the needs of the communities that are being served. And so that is where partnership with trust-ed community organizations is so critically important. It is one\u2014certainly, if it is a community that has limited English proficiency, ensuring that communications materials are translated into the languages that the community speaks, to ensure that they have access to information to make those informed decisions. But VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec is also understanding what might be some of the concerns and how to message that most appropriately. So it is, as many have said, it is the message and the messenger, and that is where it gets to understanding the cultural appro-priateness of the messages that are being shared, and not doing so in a judgmental way that is a concern of why people aren't being vaccinated, but really getting to the causes of understanding why there may be limits in vaccination. You also look at other barriers. For example, access with regards to the sites. Are the sites open and accessible during hours that they can actually go to, if they have to work one or more jobs? And so these are the types of things that we are seeing, certainly now with these investments, and the\u2014or these strategies with re-gard to pop-up clinics and mobile clinics, and extending clinic hours or the vaccination site hours. These are critically important ways to ensure that access is not a barrier to actual vaccination. Mr. T ONKO . Thank you. And Mr. Offerman, as an owner and operator of a small business, you have the opportunity to work with the nonprofit Would Works to provide training opportunities to people experiencing homeless-ness or living in poverty, individuals likely to face access barriers. Like many others, we understand that operations of both the woodshop and Would Works were affected by COVID-19. Has vac-cine uptake allowed normal operations to resume for you? Mr. O FFERMAN . At the woodshop we are just about, you know, back up on our feet. Everybody's vaccinated. And so we still are employing masks, just erring on the side of safety. I don't see why we wouldn't do that. And at Would Works we have just announced today, coinciden- tally, we are opening the program back up. That is a much more vulnerable population, so we are taking extra precautions. But it's a wonderful organization. We are very happy to support it. So many of the people who are without homes just need an oppor-tunity. They all want to go to work. They just need a chance. So I love\u2014I wish we would\u2014Would Works nationwide. Mr. T ONKO . Well, thank you. And alleviating access concerns among unvaccinated Americans is, clearly, just as important as ad-dressing other reasons why some people have yet to get the COVID-19 vaccine. So I am encouraged by the strategies being de-ployed across the country and certainly hope we can amplify these efforts. And with that, Madam Chair, I yield back. And again, thank you. Ms. D EGETTE . Thank you. And I am now pleased to yield to Dr. Joyce 5 minutes. Mr. J OYCE . Thank you for yielding, Madam Chair, and to this panel for testifying on this important subject today. Dr. Omer, some clinicians had concerns that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's recommended pause on the Johnson & John-son vaccine might increase vaccine hesitancy and reduce public confidence in the overall approval process for the other vaccines, as well. Dr. Omer, do you feel that the FDA's actions instill a higher degree of confidence in the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines that have received the emergency use authorizations from the FDA? VerDate Mar 15 2010 O MER. Yes. I think that was the right thing to do. As they were evaluating they had a temporary pause, communicated the reason for that pause. They\u2014you know, whenever you have an emerging event, there are several difficult options. But they chose the best\u2014the most appropriate, in my perspective\u2014of those dif-ficult options. So, yes, in the long run, it will instill confidence in our vaccine safety and regulatory system. Mr. J OYCE . Dr. Omer, can you comment on how common the se- vere blood clotting, combined with low levels of platelets, that re-sulted in the FDA's recommending a pause of the J&J vaccine\u2014 would you say this is a rare, a very rare event? Could you comment additionally, please? Dr. O MER. So, depending on the group, it is a rare to very rare event. And looking at the risk versus benefit, it heavily favors ben-efit. But then it was appropriate to evaluate that, take a pause, evaluate that risk-benefit ratio, and then resume that\u2014the vac-cination drive with this vaccine. Mr. J OYCE . Dr. Omer, how does the rate of severe events for the J&J COVID-19 vaccine compare to other vaccines that we more commonly see people get, the chicken pox vaccine, the MMR that has been discussed previously in today's hearing, which have been proven to be safe and effective? So what is the rate of severe events comparing J&J's COVID-19 vaccine with other, more commonly administered vaccines? Dr. O MER. Well, it depends on the event. But overall, it is at par or favorable compared to other commonly used vaccines. So, you know, I would be happy to provide specific details between\u2014based on the risk group and age group, et cetera. But I think it is reason-able to say that, qualitatively speaking, or sort of broadly speaking, that this vaccine is\u2014has similar safety profile or, in certain cases, certain groups, better safety profile than some of the\u2014our other commonly used vaccines, as well. Mr. J OYCE . Yes, I would like to see that additional data, if you could, please. And then finally, Dr. Omer, on another subject, how common is it for someone to have an allergic reaction after receiving one of the COVID-19 vaccines? And is the risk the same among the\u2014all three vaccines that have received the emergency use authorizations from the FDA? Dr. O MER. So there are different databases that were used. It is also considered within the rare side effect range. And it is one of the ways this is mitigated, because right now we are in a situation where it is mitigated by having people wait an extra 30 minutes if\u2014extra 15 minutes, a total of 30 minutes, who have, you know, a predisposing situation, have a history of allergy, et cetera. So it is more, in the context of mRNA vaccines, if you look at the the absolute numbers. But even for mRNA vaccines, it is in the terri- tory of rare events. So it ranges from, you know\u2014so there are a few ranges around that. But, you know, it is in the rare category for\u2014even for mRNA vaccines. VerDate Mar 15 2010 And Dr. Omer, could you please comment for us, Dr. Omer, on the safety, from your perch, for the use of these new vac-cines in adolescents and children? Dr. O MER. That is a really good question. So, based on the cur- rent data and the data that the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-tion Practices has evaluated, in the groups for which it is currently recommended, 12 and up, the benefits substantially outweigh risks. We continue to monitor events. There was a\u2014there is a signal that various public health agen- cies, as you know, you may have seen in the news that they are evaluating proactively, just to remind everyone it is a self-limiting event in certain teams. And so\u2014and I have confidence that we will get clarity on this event, as well, in the coming weeks, fairly soon. Mr. J OYCE . And I thank you for that answer. My colleague, Dr. Schrier, the pediatrician on this panel today, I am sure will also have questions regarding immunization and children. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I yield the remainder of my time. Ms. D EGETTE . I thank the gentleman. The Chair now is pleased to recognize the vice chair of the subcommittee, Mr. Peters, for 5 minutes. Mr. P ETERS . Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to start by saying I certainly share the frustration of Dr. Burgess that we are not all together in person, unmasked, which I believe we could be, if we were all vaccinated. And I know that\u2014I think the\u2014every Democrat is vaccinated. I am sad to say that every Republican is not. So if there is anything we can do to encourage that, I would certainly jump in. And, as the daily\u2014number of daily vaccinations has declined since April, State and local governments are thinking about that issue, too, with respect to incentive programs to motivate unvaccinated Americans to get shots. In New Jersey there is a shot-and-a-beer program. In Ohio there is a vaccine lottery that of-fers you a million bucks. I don't know if that indicates that there is higher self-regard among Ohioans than New Jerseyites\u2014I say that as a former New Jerseyite. Major League Baseball teams are offering free tickets to those who get vaccinated at the ballpark. And the question I have, I guess, for Dr. Omer is whether these programs work. I mean, even before the pandemic hit, you have been researching ways to incentivize vaccine uptake. So do these vaccine incentive programs work? And what types of incentive programs would be most effective? Dr. O MER. So there are two things. We know, as a concept, incen- tives have a role in increasing vaccine coverage. So there has been evidence for several years. We have done some experiments, others have done some experiments, but incentives are useful. In this pandemic, although the uncertainty is that the\u2014what kind of incentives are better suited. So with our 50-State labora-tory, people like us, like myself, are watching and learning from it. And I think it is\u2014but then, you know, within certain limits, it is worth trying different models. So that is the short answer. Mr. P ETERS . And Dr. Gracia, what is your view on the effective- ness of these types of vaccine incentives, and particularly\u2014do you have any evidence that they can increase vaccine uptake in com-munities of color or Tribal nations? VerDate Mar 15 2010 you. I think, similarly to Dr. Omer's re- sponse, you know, we too, just at our organization, follow the evi-dence with regards to these policy recommendations. And with regards to incentives, you know, there can be a place for incentives, and there is just a great deal of innovation that is happening both in the public and private sector regarding that. So I think studying that to see how that is impacting the uptake for various communities, I think, will be important for us, not only now in the pandemic but certainly moving forward. Mr. P ETERS . OK, thank you. Dr. Shelton, your testimony indicates that you are partnering with stakeholders to give away tickets to incentivize vaccinations. How has the community responded to this incentive? And more broadly, what kinds of incentives or innovative ap- proaches for encouraging uptake have you seen work in rural com-munities that can be replicated or expanded on? Dr. S HELTON . Well, thus far in our mobile units and outreach, the numbers have been very low as we go out. So we are looking to see what incentives might be helpful. And I would love to have some of these incentives to offer to our community as ways to see whether or not these experiments truly do work. We are just at the beginning of these incentive programs. So, again, we don't have a lot of knowledge yet about what is working, but we look forward to trying these incentives, and seeing what will work, and reporting back on any successes that we do have. Mr. P ETERS . And Dr. Omer, any recommendations for employers who may want to incentivize COVID-19 vaccinations for their em-ployees? Any recommendations you have for us? Dr. O MER. Yes. First of all, promote it as a social norm. And we know that\u2014we have evidence that promoting even an emerging so-cial norm is helpful. Ensure that there is safety of everyone involved. So we know that, even though these vaccines are highly effective, people who are immunocompromised, there are certain concerning data about them, et cetera. So have those, you know, precautions available for these people. And sort of look at things like time off for\u2014you know, during vaccination. It is easy to vaccinate, and there will come a time where onsite vaccination will have\u2014pretty soon, for at least some large entities, onsite vaccination may have a role in there. So I think companies and employers of various sizes have a huge role. Even small businesses. But Mr. Offerman very eloquently spoke on the\u2014on small businesses. Mr. P ETERS . Right. Well, it looks like there is a lot of information to come in on this. And I would certainly invite any of the wit-nesses who see results from these incentives to reply to the com-mittee and offer us information on that. We would love to get that information. And Madam Chair, I appreciate you holding this hearing. It is OK to do hearings, virtually. I think it may be in some ways pretty useful, but I really am anxious to get back to work with everybody in person without masks in the committee room. And if there is any way we can incentivize the rest of our colleagues to get vac- VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 we have learned something from this testimony, as well. Thank you, I yield back. Ms. D EGETTE . Thank you, and I agree. The Chair is now pleased to recognize Mr. Long for 5 minutes. Mr. L ONG. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I appreciate it, and thank all the witnesses for being here today. And I might suggest that, as a first move to get away from these Zoom and committee hearings and things, we might consider doing them over at the White House. Because if you will Google ''Pelosi,'' ''White House,'' ''no social distancing,'' you will see that it is very safe to mingle, mix and mingle there, with people who have been and have not been vaccinated. So just a suggestion for a first move, so we can get back to more normal times. Dr. Gracia, according to a recent report issued by the Centers for Disease Control, residents in rural communities like I represent a lot of here in southwest Missouri are at increased risk for severe COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality. Last September, COVID-19 incidents of cases per 100,000 residents in rural com-munities surpassed those in urban counties. Further, the report found that COVID-19 vaccination coverage was lower in rural com-munities, at a little under 40 percent, than in urban communities, a little over 45 percent. The implications of these findings are the disparities in COVID- 19 vaccination access and coverage between urban and rural com-munities can hinder progress toward ending the pandemic. What are the unique challenges found in rural communities of getting available vaccine doses into patients' arms? Dr. G RACIA . Thank you for that question, and critically important to address, certainly, these disparities that we are seeing in rural communities. And similarly, we can point to some of the long-standing, as you noted, health disparities that exist in rural com-munities. We know, certainly, access to healthcare has been one of the areas that\u2014having access to a healthcare provider and routine, regular care, as far as preventive services, those are issues that can be challenging in rural communities, and that pre-dated the pandemic. But recognizing, certainly, that also, beyond the access to healthcare, are really what we think about the broader social de-terminants of health. So, in addition to access to healthcare, is ensuring you actually have transportation to be able to get to those services. Do you have, you know, income, the income to be able to maintain, you know, and have access to healthy, affordable foods and be able to engage in the types of physical activity, et cetera, that is needed for a healthy lifestyle? I think that we need to really address some of these longstanding issues as it relates to rural health disparities, certainly, as we move forward beyond the pandemic with regards to access to healthcare, whether it is through telehealth and the closure of rural hospitals. We have seen several rural hospitals that have closed during the context of the pandemic, and making access to care more difficult. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec with regards to vaccination, I think some of the promising things that are now happening is the investments, certainly, be-cause of the legislation that has been passed, to do more invest-ments to getting mobile healthcare units out, to be able to fund and support rural health clinics, to be able to do vaccinations in rural communities, and also to be able to educate and do outreach to rural communities through community health workers and other types of health outreach to increase vaccination. Mr. L ONG. OK, thank you. And I, for one, would like to see every- one vaccinated. I appreciate that. And it is discouraging that the rural areas are not able to get the same access. My next question for Ms. Pisani: The Pfizer vaccine, which is the one that I took back in December, is now available to children 12 to 15. And the Moderna announced this week\u2014or Moderna an-nounced this week that their vaccine is safe and effective for chil-dren ages 12 through 17, and they plan to submit their findings to the FDA in early June. What are the most frequently asked questions that you get from parents that have children in this age range about the COVID vac-cine? Ms. P ISANI . We get pretty much the same questions we get with all vaccines, and they want to know what are the long-term side effects of getting a vaccine, which, of course, the answer, again, is what is the long-term side effect of getting the virus. You have to remember to answer it that way. Parents are hearing the same rumors that are just literally going through wildfire on social media. I have never seen anything like it in my life. You will hear a rumor one day about, you know, ques-tions about infertility here, and then it will go all the way across the globe. And so my friends and my family who have, you know, kids my age and younger\u2014my kids' age and younger\u2014they are asking the same questions: Will they be safe, you know, why do they need them, if they\u2014if the virus isn't as dangerous to the chil-dren? And of course, that is all just misinformation that we need to correct. Mr. L ONG. OK. As the father of a pediatrician, I appreciate that very much. And it is\u2014I have said it before on here, but I will say it again, it is very disturbing to me to have someone of such noto-riety as Robert Kennedy, Jr., of all people, leading the anti-vaxxer charge. With that, Madam Chair, I yield back. Ms. D EGETTE . I thank the gentleman. The Chair now recognizes an actual pediatrician, Dr. Schrier, for 5 minutes. Ms. S CHRIER . Well, thank you, Chairwoman DeGette, and thank you to our excellent witnesses today. Vaccine hesitancy is such an important topic. And, as a pediatri- cian, I spent 20 years reassuring anxious parents about routine childhood vaccinations. And most parents, like you said, that are considered vaccine hesitant have heard something from a friend, online, that gives them pause, and they just want to be sure that they are making the right decision for their child. And we know that conversations with a trusted primary care provider makes all the difference in the world. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec we are seeing a higher degree of reluctance when it comes to the COVID vaccine for all the reasons you pointed out. So at this point, most parents who definitely want the COVID vac-cine for their kids over 12 have already done it or scheduled it. My 12-year-old got his 10 days ago. More hesitant families will visit their primary care provider to seek answers from their trusted doc-tor. So I want to start with Dr. Gracia. One of the main questions that I get from parents is about why they should vaccinate their child, when they have heard that the risk to children from COVID- 19 is low, and they are making this risk-benefit calculation. So, as a pediatrician yourself, can you briefly describe how you would an-swer that question to that hesitant parent? Dr. G RACIA . Yes, thank you for that question, and thank you\u2014 it was a pleasure, certainly, also, to partner with you on the vac-cines briefing that we did last year, just ongoing, highlighting the importance of vaccinations, and why this is so critical, not only in emergencies but beyond, in calm times, if you will. I think, you know, formerly, when I formerly practiced as a pedi- atrician, I think an important thing is, really, to hear and under-stand a parent's concerns about the vaccination and be able to ar-ticulate, certainly, the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and to note that, yes, while, you know, children have a much lower risk with regards to severe illness and hospitalizations from COVID-19, that is still important to provide that protection and to also think about it from the standpoint of there may be others in the family, for example, if someone is immunocompromised or they interact with others, that it also can provide that protection with regards to decreasing the risk of transmission. But I think it is especially important, too, to think about the ability for children then to engage in the activities that they were engaging in prepandemic and recognizing some of the social and emotional needs of children to really be able to re-engage in the things that they did prepandemic, and that vaccination is an im-portant strategy for us to get there. Ms. S CHRIER . I agree. And the risk of COVID is not zero. Several hundred kids have died. We don't know about long COVID. There are many risks, like you said, and getting back to normalcy is so important. Now, specifically, can you address the concern that some parents now have about finding a handful of cases of mild myocarditis out of many million vaccinated teens, and perhaps how they should think about that risk compared to, say, the risk of getting myocar-ditis from any viral infection, or certainly at a much higher risk of getting it from COVID itself? Dr. G RACIA . Right. And I think that it's important, really, one, to hear\u2014again, hear those questions, to listen to their concerns as parents and to tell them what is known now and, as you noted, that, yes, myocarditis can be caused by other viruses, by other bac-teria, for example, as well, and\u2014but to assure them, for example, one, you know, the American Academy of Pediatrics continues to recommend that children 12 and above should be vaccinated and that what is being studied, actually showing that, of the cases that\u2014right now there\u2014that there is not conclusive evidence that VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec is an association with the vaccine and also that the cases and the numbers of cases that are being seen is what would also be seen at baseline. And so, you know, really, it is stressing, too, that, especially for organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the pe-diatricians who are themselves vaccine experts, and really take this very seriously, and reading the data, I continue to recommend it, as does the CDC. And then getting back to Dr. Omer about\u2014that these\u2014\u2014 Ms. S CHRIER . And then\u2014\u2014 [continuing]. The systems, yes. Ms. S CHRIER . Right. We are looking for a blip above baseline, and we haven't hit that. Last quick question. I just wanted touch on the new guidance that the COVID vaccine can be coadministered with other child-hood immunizations that have been\u2014that have dropped by about 30 percent during the pandemic. And so can you tell me again, Dr. Gracia, your thoughts about coadministration? What do you say to a parent who is nervous about getting COVID with, like, HPD and Tdap, and our ability to then track po-tential rare adverse effects if they are given together. Dr. G RACIA . So, again, I would emphasize, you know, when\u2014I was going to say practice\u2014so I would emphasize again the impor-tance that\u2014how our safety systems are working to be able to de-tect if there are any concerns with regards to, you know, something like a coadministration, to know that\u2014you know, that these acad-emies, whether it is the American Academy of Pediatrics and oth-ers, certainly are reviewing this, and feeling that there is\u2014safety with regards to being able to do that coadministration, which can also then be a support for parents, especially in the need to be able to come back to the office, to be able to do other administration of vaccinations\u2014\u2014 Ms. S CHRIER . Thank you. Dr. G RACIA [continuing]. And building the existing infrastruc- ture that\u2014\u2014 CHRIER . [continuing]. Offices\u2014\u2014 Ms. S CHRIER . I am out of time. It is so great to see you again. And then just\u2014that path back to normalcy, to school, to summer camps, everything, is vaccinating our kids. Thank you so much. Ms. D EGETTE . I thank the gentlelady. And then I apologize to Mr. Long for somehow implying his daughter wasn't a pediatrician. What I meant was he is not a pediatrician, although he assures me he once played a doctor on the radio. So there you go. Mrs. Trahan, I am now pleased to recognize you for 5 minutes. Mrs. T RAHAN . Thank you, Chairwoman DeGette. Like so many of my colleagues, I am so pleased that earlier this month FDA ex-panded the authorization of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for ado-lescents 12 to 15 years old. And CDC quickly recommended its use among this age group. And I am also encouraged by yesterday's news that, according to Moderna studies, its COVID-19 vaccine appears to be safe and ef-fective for children as young as 12, as well. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec just as misinformation is spread across social media about the COVID-19 vaccine for adults, I too am concerned that families are facing a barrage of myths and disinformation about their use among children. So I am glad to have such a robust panel of experts here today to help us get the facts straight. Ms. Pisani, according to your testimony, the Vaccinate Your Family campaign has grown over the years into ''one of the nation's largest social media programs aimed at educating the public on vaccines and their safety and to counter vaccine disinformation.'' Unfortunately, we know that this disinformation is rampant online, with parents and children exposed to a range of myths about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. What lessons can we learn from Vaccinate Your Family's efforts to combat vaccine disinformation? Ms. P ISANI . Thank you for asking that question. So we have\u2014ob- viously, we have been around for 30 years, so we didn't start in so-cial media. We began working directly with parents, and children were our focus for 25 years. So\u2014but one thing we can learn is that\u2014never repeat the nega- tive, first of all. And also that there's efforts being made. And I have to say Google is doing an amazing job. They are giving out grants around the world to try to help stop disinformation. And Instagram is doing a great job. I don't know why Facebook is not following up with that. But we have to really think about the groups that are targeting people, and they have taken to targeting communities of color to sow doubt. And, you know, after all the work that has been done to help the disparities, and all the work we need to do, we have to really think about what is, you know, the line of freedom of speech. We all hold it sacred, but when there is a group of individ-uals or companies that are making a cottage industry about spreading disinformation and selling alternative products instead of vaccines, I think something needs to be done. That is endan-gering the United States and, frankly, the global citizens. Mrs. T RAHAN . Yes, I couldn't agree more. We have taken that up on another subcommittee\u2014this one. But, you know, authorizing a vaccine for adolescents 12 years and older is one hurdle, but get-ting shots in arms of those adolescents is another challenge alto-gether. You know, Dr. Shelton, you mention in your testimony that your agency has been vaccinating middle and high school students in school clinics. Has this proven to be successful? You know, what other activities have you led or have planned to expand vaccination efforts to these younger teens and preteens? Dr. S HELTON . Yes, we have been very grateful for the partner- ship with our schools to be able to go in and offer vaccines in the middle and high school levels. To be sure, the uptake has been small. It is a difficult time of year. There are a lot of end-of-year testings and sports events going on, and people are afraid to\u2014of side effects and that they may miss work. So I think a lot of the messaging that we need to use with focus- ing in our schools is we know that our schools transmit disease, are kind of like the petri dish of the community, so to speak. In the winter time we routinely combat flu and norovirus in our schools. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 so we know that one of the incentives for parents to talk with\u2014for pediatricians and healthcare providers to discuss with their parents is, if you want your students to have all of the great benefits of being\u2014in-person school, and all the social, mental, and physical well-being that they receive from the school, in addition to just the learning, vaccines really are our path to be able to have our schools go in person for longer amounts of time. We had with\u2014recently, in April, an increase in our cases throughout the district, because we had five different outbreaks in schools, despite having gone in school since the fall. This is the first time. And so, being able to go in and take those vaccines to the schools, we have seen some successes there. But definitely, the importance of what people can achieve by in-person school and the importance of having those vaccines is very much what needs to be messaged. Mrs. T RAHAN . Yes, no question. Finally, Dr. Omer, with my remaining time, your testimony cites a survey experiment in which you found that ''a bipartisan endorse-ment of COVID-19 vaccines would help increase confidence in the vaccines.'' That is precisely the goal of this hearing today, to work together to debunk vaccine misinformation and send a clear mes-sage of support for the COVID 19 vaccines. Dr. Omer, if we were\u2014if we are not able to dispel vaccine myths, boost confidence, and increase uptake, what potential consequences do we face? Dr. O MER. So I think we are at risk of entering a vicious cycle, because if we have\u2014so one way of responding to an outbreak is to get ahead of it. And if we don't get ahead of it by having high vac-cination rates, we increase the probability of variants emerging, and then it becomes a cycle of where we need, for example, boost-ers and other approaches and some nonpharmaceutical interven-tions, although not\u2014certainly, not at the level as we saw last year, but other measures that hamper normalcy but are applied to pre-vent adverse outcomes in the public health, in the sense of public health. So we absolutely need to invest in our\u2014redouble our efforts to vaccinate as high a proportion of our population as possible. Mrs. T RAHAN . Thank you, Dr. Omer. I yield back, Madam Chair. Ms. D EGETTE . I thank the gentlelady. The Chair now is pleased to recognize Dr. Ruiz for 5 minutes. Mr. R UIZ. Thank you for holding this very important hearing, Chairwoman. When vaccine distribution was ramping up, there was concern that Black and Hispanic individuals would have a greater amount of vaccine hesitancy than White individuals. And that narrative continues. But it just has not been my personal experience, as a physician, public health expert working in the community, inoculating some of the hardest-hit, hardest-to-reach constituents of mine, the Hispanic farm workers, which in my district face one of the highest rates of infections and deaths. And I have been going out there, administering the vaccine and educating communities about its importance. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec Blacks and Hispanics, they just don't want the vaccine because of mistrust, et cetera. That narrative is dangerous. It abdicates the responsibility of the healthcare system and us to make sure they have access. And it just blames those that have been left behind for generations. And the data is showing that my experience was actually a more accurate picture of what was occurring. As it is, the problem is not hesitancy, it is access. As with many aspects of our healthcare system, it is not about whether someone wants to get the vaccine, it is whether there are barriers pre-venting them from doing so. Despite months of headlines driving a narrative that Black Americans and other people of color would be the primary communities hesitant to get the COVID-19 vaccine due to discrimination and a history of medical experimentation in these communities, Kaiser Family Foundation polling shows Black Americans are just as likely to want to get the COVID-19 vaccine as White Americans. And, in fact, among unvaccinated people, His-panic adults report being twice as likely as White adults to want to get the vaccine. So I am concerned that, despite being motivated to get the COVID-19 vaccine, access barriers are preventing people of color from getting vaccinated. And we know that Hispanics, for example, have the lowest vaccination rate, even though they have the high-est infection rate and death rate than other communities. As a re-sult, the vaccination rates in these communities are disproportionally\u2014way disproportionately\u2014lower than their White counterparts in the United States. Dr. Gracia, in referencing the vaccination rate disparities among Hispanic adults compared to White adults, you cautioned that ''if we only look at the population as a whole, we may be missing sig-nificant barriers to access and information.'' So you have touched on some of those barriers already today. Could you further detail what barriers may specifically be pre-venting Black and Hispanic adults from getting the COVID-19, and what are some good, successful efforts that allow us to over-come those barriers? Dr. G RACIA . Thank you, Congressman Ruiz. Yes, these are\u2014it is important, as you noted, with regards to the narrative that is being shared, and understanding that inequitable access can also drive these disparities in vaccination rates. One of the things that we can see is that, when we prioritize and center equity with regards to the vaccine distribution and alloca-tion and administration and ensuring that the sites and locations are accessible, whether it is from the standpoint of the hours\u2014you know, that you have evening hours and weekend hours that are available, that the sites are trusted, community sites, where com-munities of color already seek their health services. And we have seen an impact of that, for example, with regards to the community health centers that receive Federal funding, that of the 10 million doses that they have given, over 60 percent of the vaccine administration has been to people of color. And knowing that\u2014\u2014 Mr. R UIZ. Yes. You know, the initial phase of this vaccine really got the low-hanging fruit, and they did a first-come, first-served VerDate Mar 15 2010 those who have high-speed internet, those that have the educational capacity to navigate a complex sys-tem, those that have the flexibility from leaving work and standing in line or waiting on the phone for hours at a time. And it dis-advantages rural, underserved communities who don't have those factors to benefit them. So we need to shift now from that model to a grassroot, commu- nity-based model, working with community health promoters, tak-ing the vaccines to the people where they are at, with trusted indi-viduals from the community. And we also have to think how we can change our healthcare de- livery system, because the status quo has resulted in these barriers and failures that have not focused on equity but has promoted health disparities. And because of that, we need to use this new form of outreach into our healthcare delivery model, so we can ad-dress health disparities in general, so we don't find ourselves in this situation in the next pandemic. And I ran out of time. And I appreciate you all being here. Ms. D EGETTE . Thank you so much. This completes the ques- tioning from members of the subcommittee, but we are always happy to welcome members of the full committee to ask questions in these hearings. And we have two today. And so my first nonsub-committee member, but a wonderful member of the full committee that I will recognize for 5 minutes, is Mr. Bilirakis, for 5 minutes. Mr. B ILIRAKIS . Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I appreciate it very much. And I want to preface my comments by saying that I did get the vaccine, both doses. I had COVID in early January, but I chose to get the vaccine after the 90 days. And I have had a very positive experience. However, this is for the panel, whoever would like to ask this question\u2014answer this question. Dr. Jay Carpenter, an internist in my district, has encountered young patients who have been vac-cinated, young patients in their early twenties, who have suffered from myocarditis\u2014so, again, let me pronounce it again: myocar-ditis\u2014and the inflammation of the heart. So has anyone experienced that, any of the experts? Have they seen this from, again, young adults in their twenties? So who would like to reply to that? Maybe we can get the\u2014you know, if it is applicable, the whole panel can apply\u2014reply, quickly. Has anyone seen this? Ms. P ISANI . I would say that it is such a rare\u2014it is such a rare reaction that there is still research taking place. And here in the U.S. we have amazing systems that oversee our safety, and so we have a vaccine-adverse-event reporting system, where everyone is encouraged, if they have any type of adverse event from a vaccine, they are to report it there. We have the Vaccine Safety Datalink. We have got the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment System. I mean, there is just\u2014and there's new systems that were put in place just for COVID, V-safe and the FDA's BEST system is work-ing. So there is a lot of different systems that are out there. And I do feel very confident that we will soon know if there is any type VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec need for any type of pause. And it makes me feel comfortable that there was a pause on J&J when it was requested. Mr. B ILIRAKIS . OK, anyone else? Anyone else want to comment? Have they experienced this, or heard about this? I mean, it is very serious, and I would like to actually have Dr. Carpenter maybe contact you, and maybe elaborate more. Is\u2014was that OK? Would\u2014do you I\u2014\u2014 Dr. G RACIA . Congressman, what I would just add to is, with re- gards to what we noted earlier, that what has been detected is not above the baseline of what we would detect with regards to cases of myocarditis. So as Ms. Pisani noted, we are continuing to review that and de- termine if there is actually any association, but there is\u2014\u2014 Mr. B ILIRAKIS . Thank you\u2014\u2014 Dr. G RACIA [continuing]. At this time. Mr. B ILIRAKIS . No, I appreciate that very much. And I under- stand. My chief of staff has been in direct contact with this par-ticular physician, an internist, and apparently he has experienced this, his patients have experienced this more than once. So it is definitely worth looking into. Dr. S HELTON . I would say we have not seen that locally, in our area, but certainly, as has been mentioned, the V-safe programs and other monitoring systems, we will continue to look toward those for any\u2014and report any side effects. Mr. B ILIRAKIS . Thank you very much. Dr. Omer, again, on this topic, given how much information is available, it can be difficult to know which sources of information you can trust. That is for sure, particularly with the internet. How can one ensure that information they find about COVID-19 vac-cines is accurate and comes from critical\u2014credible sources? Dr. O MER. That is a really good question. So the general public can go to several reliable sources and\u2014such as, for the CDC, so the technical documentation from the CDC has been consistently reli-able on this issue and others, as well. The second thing is professional associations. So we have 20 years of research that shows that in this country there is a high level of trust in professional associations. For example, when it comes to pregnancy vaccination, American Congress\u2014American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. For pediatric vaccina-tions, American Academy of Pediatrics. They are highly\u2014not just trusted but trustworthy entities, because they go through a very careful, deliberate process to evaluate the risk and benefit. So these are some of those sources that folks can go to. And the third thing is that\u2014I have mentioned this national con- tinued medical education program for physicians and providers, other providers. Just\u2014that is one of the reasons why we are doing this, so that, you know, primary care providers, frontline providers feel empowered to talk about vaccine efficacy and safety, and in a way that is evidence-based. Mr. B ILIRAKIS . OK, let me make a statement. I know, Madam Chair, my time is finished, but I recommend that our Members communicate directly with their constituents. I have had a town VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec meeting, it was very successful, with experts, CDC and NIH, and they directly answered their questions. I can't go any further, so I will submit the rest of my questions for the record. Thank you. Ms. D EGETTE . I thank the gentleman. And Mr. Carter, you are recognized for 5 minutes as our cleanup batter. Mr. C ARTER . Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate the oppor- tunity to waive on, and I thank all of the witnesses. This is very important, very important for me. I have a large minority population in my district, and it is very important. And I am very concerned, as a pharmacist and member of the Doctors Caucus, a healthcare professional. I went through the clinical trials myself, with the vaccine, to try to set a good ex-ample. And I am very concerned about that. I want to start with you, Dr. Shelton, because I want to know\u2014 you have mentioned in your testimony about the many commu-nities that lack access to broadband internet or even to cell service. And we all know that that is a problem. We all know that they can't get to know\u2014or they don't know how to sign up for an ap-pointment or get their COVID-19 vaccine. How can we address that? How can we address these challenges that\u2014to make sure that these people that don't have access to Internet or cell service, or other kind of technologies, that it is not a barrier to them getting COVID-19 vaccines? Dr. S HELTON . Well, certainly, providing broadband access is a long-term goal for many, and for our State, as well. Currently, though, it\u2014this lack of access does hamper their ability to even ask their own questions, to find their own good information, and correct and true information. So we have addressed this by, you know, a lot of people just call the health department or call the pharmacy or the healthcare pro-vider. We have encouraged people to help their families, friends, neighbors who may not have access to try to access and sign them up, especially our elderly population, not as computer savvy, by taking the vaccines out into the community and using our local radio stations or other media stations to allow people to know that there's, you know, vaccines coming, vaccines available. But this doesn't help as much to answer the questions one on one. So we value those opportunities to speak with them, and en-couraging them. This new move that we have now, where we can redistribute the vaccine in smaller increments to many more local providers, will go a long way with helping people to access their local physicians and having their local healthcare providers give them that one-on-one information. Unfortunately, a lot of people who are not interested in the vac- cine may not go to their healthcare provider regularly, anyway, or even have one. So we do have to continue to look at how we could best message in these areas. Mr. C ARTER . Thank you for mentioning the role of pharmacies, because 95 percent of all Americans live within 5 miles of a phar-macist. They are the most accessible healthcare professionals in America. So thank you for mentioning that, because that is very VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec and certainly a big part of what we are trying to do here. Dr. Omer, I wanted to ask you, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, about 6 in 10 African-American adults and two-thirds of Hispanic and White adults now say they have either gotten the vaccine, or at least one shot of the vaccine, or they will get it as soon as they can. At the same time, African Americans and Hispanic adults remain somewhat more likely than White adults to wait and see, if you will, before getting vaccinated. What are\u2014Dr. Omer, in your expe-riences, what are the main concerns, the top concerns or questions that you have heard from minority populations about COVID-19 vaccine? Dr. O MER. That is a really good question. So the concern, the specific concerns, overlap significantly with the rest of the popu-lation. But they do, you know, sit on a bed of not-so-pleasant series of interactions with the health system overall, not having sort of a healthcare home in certain situations, and some of the other structural barriers that were described earlier. So the concerns overlap. For example, the concerns, questions about the process, the questions about\u2014that arise from certain ru-mors, people talking about risk and benefit in certain subpopula-tion, et cetera. But that is\u2014but they sit on this baseline of under-standable mistrust in a lot of these situations. Mr. C ARTER . Well, thank you. And that is something\u2014and I tell you, that, to me, is difficult to get your arms around and difficult for us to address that situation. You know, we in the Doctors Caucus, we have done everything we can and certainly done a lot to try to build up the confidence of people in the vaccine and let them know that it is safe and effec-tive. And, you know, yes, it was done quickly, but that is because we cut red tape. We didn't cut corners. And they need to be assured of that. And I think that\u2014and I am real proud to be a member of the Doctors Caucus and proud of what we have done in the way of try-ing to encourage everyone and bringing about, you know, the fact that it is safe and effective, and building up that confidence. One more question, Dr. Gracia, just really quickly, you men- tioned in your testimony about the real barriers and perceived bar-riers. What are\u2014what is the difference there, what are you talking about? Dr. G RACIA . So, you know, real barriers, for example, if you sim- ply don't have access, right, to a vaccination site, or if you, for ex-ample, don't have the internet technology to be able to sign up for vaccine appointments, versus what might be a perceived barrier, for example, believing that there is costs associated with the vac-cine or that you might not\u2014or not knowing what the eligibility terms are with regards to the vaccine. It is really helping to clarify what are the barriers that an individual experiences and helping them to address getting access to the vaccine. Mr. C ARTER . Great. Well, this has been a great panel, Madam Chair, and thank you again for allowing me to waive on. And I will yield back. VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 Dec . I thank the gentleman, and I thank all of the Members for an excellent hearing. Everybody's questions were very helpful. And I mostly want to thank our witnesses again, an ex-traordinarily informative and interesting hearing. We, this subcommittee, we intend to continue our oversight over the vaccine distribution process. And we stand at the ready for all of you, our witnesses, to help in any way we can. So, as you get data for our researchers and our physicians, if you can let us know. And, Mr. Offerman, if you can, please let us know what we can do to help you in your outreach efforts, as well. And with that, I remind the Members that, pursuant to com- mittee rules, they have 10 business days to submit additional ques-tions for the record. And I would ask the witnesses, if you do get these questions, to please respond promptly to any of them that you may have. Thank you again to all of you for appearing today. And with that, the subcommittee is adjourned. [Whereupon, at 1:38 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.] [Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:] VerDate Mar 15 2010 11:55 "}
