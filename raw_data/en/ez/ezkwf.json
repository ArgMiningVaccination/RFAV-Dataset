Yam contains saponin, tannin, polyphenol, vitamins, sugars, amino acids, uronic acid, chelidonic acid, sitosterol, batasin, and dioscin in addition to general components, and thus has been used as an ingredient for nourishing, tonic, spleen invigorating, restorative, antidiarrheal medicines in the oriental medicine, in which the periderm of its tuberous root is removed and then dried as it is or steamed and then dried and has been called as 'Sanyak' since old times. Because of these health-oriented images of yam, it is recognized as an ingredient for oriental herb medicine or a material for functional food and thus its production and consumption have been increased and several agricultural cooperatives and companies have processed and sold yam as dried powder. [Choi et al., 1992](#B2-nrp-1-94); [Kim et al., 1991](#B8-nrp-1-94); [Lee et al., 1992](#B14-nrp-1-94)) and on processing characteristics [Jung et al., 1996](#B7-nrp-1-94); [Kwon et al., 1998](#B12-nrp-1-94); [Lee et al., 1998](#B13-nrp-1-94)). For studies on mucilage, a characteristic of yam, Han et al. ( [1990](#B6-nrp-1-94)) investigated the degree of viscosity and components of mucilage of raw (fresh) yam and steamed-dried yam and reported that the degree of viscosity of steamed-dried yam was considerably lower than that of raw yam and the protein content was also low, but the mannose content was higher in steamed-dried yam. Lee et al. ( [1994](#B15-nrp-1-94)) reported that mucilage could be separated if yam was freeze dried and ultra-fine milled into 5-30 \u00b5m size particles and then air classified at over 15,000 rpm. For in vitro experiments using yam mucilage, Ha et al. ( [1998](#B5-nrp-1-94)) studied the heavy metals (Co, Cr, Cu) elimination capacity and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory effect of yam mucilage and reported that since the adsorption capacity for heavy metals is one of important functions of polysaccharides, for example, the heavy metal adsorption capacity by chitosan and zooglan has already been reported, and the heavy metal adsorption capacity by yam mucilage was excellent and also the inhibitory effect on blood pressure increase would be expected because of ACE inhibitory action. In addition, some in vivo experiments including the study on the effect of yam on blood glucose in diabetics ( [Kwon et al., 2001a](#B10-nrp-1-94)) and the study on the anti-mutagenicity and anti-complementary activity of yam by Lee ( [1996](#B18-nrp-1-94)). Several foreign studies were performed on the components of yam mucilage, and Misaki et al. ( [1972](#B22-nrp-1-94)) reported that major components of mucilage were protein (71.8%) and mannan (13.8%), and the mean degree of polymerization of mannan was 110. Tomoda et al. ( [1981](#B29-nrp-1-94)) reported that mucilage was made of partially acetylated mannan and proteins containing some phosphorus, and its ratio was 1:2.2. According to Ohtani and Murakami ( [1991](#B24-nrp-1-94)), mannan was of about of galactose and Simozono ( [1991](#B28-nrp-1-94)) also reported that polysaccharides of yam were mainly mannose and some of arabinose, glucose, and galactose, and very small amount of xylose and rhamnose. [Sminia et al., 1983](#B26-nrp-1-94)) and thus it is necessary to verify the cell proliferation effect for this part. [Lee et al., 1993](#B19-nrp-1-94)), which has already been known to have immunopotentiation effect, and Bifidobacterium ( [Lee et al., 1993](#B19-nrp-1-94)) in vitro on the proliferation of several types of lymphocytes (splenocyte, lymph node, Peyer's patch) and also to investigate the immunopotentiation effect of yam mucilage by measuring the degree of inducing cytokine (TNF- & IL-6) production, which is an important mediator in macrophage (RAW 264.7) model system. Materials and Methods Preparation of yam mucilage Preparation of ginseng extract Bifidobacterium Lymphocyte proliferation [1983](#B23-nrp-1-94)). That is, after lymphocytes and each sample were incubated for 72 hours, 10 \u00b5L of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma Chemical Co.) solution (5 mg/mL PBS) was added and incubated another 6 hours and then 100 \u00b5L of isopropanol was added. Absorbance of the solution was measured at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Spectra Max 340PC; Molecular Devices). and Peyer's patch cell proliferation [1990](#B27-nrp-1-94)). Splenocytes or Peyer's patch cells of 5\u00d7105 cells/well concentration and certain concentrations of sample or B. adolescentis M101-4 strain were placed in a 96-well plate and incubated for 48 hours at 37, 5% CO2. At this time, for control group, LPS and ConA were used to compare the degree of proliferation stimulation, and cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Macrophage cell line culture & cytokine production [1994](#B4-nrp-1-94)). That is, 1 \u00b5g/mL of IL-6 or TNF- antibodies (rat anti-mouse; PharMingen) diluted with 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.2) was placed in a microtiter plate (Nunc) as 50 \u00b5L/well and coated at 4 overnight. Plates were washed with 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.2) containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) 3 times to eliminate remaining antibodies, and blocked for 30 minutes at 37 by adding 300 \u00b5L of 3% (w/v) BSA solution, and then washed with PBST 3 times to prevent the nonspecific binding. Next, standard recombinant IL-6 and TNF- or incubation supernatant were placed as 50 \u00b5L/well and reacted for 1 hour at 37, and washed again with PBST 4 times, and then reacted for 1 hour at room temperature by adding 50 \u00b5L of 2 \u00b5g/mL diluted biotinylated rat anti-mouse IL-6 or TNF- antibody. Plates were washed PBST 6 times and 1.5 \u00b5g/mL streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma Chemical Co.) was added as 50 \u00b5L/well and reacted for 1 hour at room temperature, and then washed 8 times, and then the amount of bound peroxidase conjugates was measured by adding 100 \u00b5L of substrate solution containing 0.1 M citric-phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) and 0.4 mM of tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma Chemical Co.). Finally, the reaction was stopped by adding the same quantity of 6N-H2SO4 and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Spectra Max 340PC; Molecular Devices). The amount of cytokine was calculated from the standard curve using Softmax curve-fitting program (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Results and Discussion Lymphocyte proliferation [Fig. 1](#F1-nrp-1-94), the proliferation effect of yam mucilage fraction was 4.1 fold increase when added in 1 \u00b5g/mL compared to control, 6.2 fold increase in 5 \u00b5g/mL, and 10.9 fold increase in 25 \u00b5g/mL, showing the proliferation increase as the added concentration increased. Not only B-cell mitogen LPS but also T-cell mitogen Con A showed great cell proliferation effect even at low concentrations, which suggests that proliferation occurred not only in B-cells contained in lymph nodes but also in T-cells for primed antigen (BSA). The effect of yam mucilage fraction was weak compared to those of mitogens such as Con A and LPS but higher than that of ginseng extract. For B. adolescentis, it was difficult to compare at the same concentration because heat-treated dead bacterial cells were added, but showed similar proliferation effect as 108 cells/mL Bifidobacteria when added in 25 \u00b5g/mL. proliferation [Fig. 2](#F2-nrp-1-94)and [Fig. 3](#F3-nrp-1-94), for splenocytes, the proliferation effect of yam mucilage fraction was 5.0 fold increase when added in 1 \u00b5g/mL compared to control, 10.0 fold increase in 5 \u00b5g/mL, and 14.7 fold increase in 25 \u00b5g/mL, and for Peyer's patch cells, the polysaccharide, promoted the increase when added in 1 \u00b5g/mL compared to control, 5.3 fold increase in 5 \u00b5g/mL, and 6.4 fold increase in 25 \u00b5g/mL. Yam mucilage fraction showed dose-dependent cell proliferation for these lymphocytes, and its effect was weaker than those of mitogens such as Con A and LPS but higher than that of ginseng extract. Also, it showed similar results compared to Bifidobacteria, which has been known to have immunostimulating effect. In particular, because it showed proliferation effect on Peyer's patch cells, an intestinal immunocompetent organ, the effect of yam mucilage fraction as a foodstuff in the intestine might be expected. It has been reported that ginseng extract ( [Lee et al., 1998](#B13-nrp-1-94)), with its components such as saponin and proliferation of not only B-cell or T-cell line but also B or T lymphocytes separated from the spleen or lymph nodes of mice, and it also has been known that lactobacillus such as Bifidobacterium ( [Lee et al., 1993](#B19-nrp-1-94)) has immunoreactivity by cell wall polysaccharides or soluble polysaccharides of the cytoplasm. Also in this study, yam mucilage fraction showed immune cell proliferation effect and its proliferation pattern was similar to that of LPS, and thus it is considered that it might have a mitogen-like function specific to B cells. Cytokine production by macrophage cells [Table 1](#T1-nrp-1-94), yam mucilage did not promote TNF- production for macrophage pre-stimulated with 1 \u00b5g/mL of LPS, but promoted TNF- production for LPS-unstimulated macrophage by 15.6 fold when added in 1 \u00b5g/mL compared to control, 39.7 fold in 5 \u00b5g/mL, and 60.1 fold in 25 \u00b5g/mL. Another cytokine, IL-6, produced by macrophage showed relatively weak effect compared to TNF-, promoting about 9.1 fold increase in IL-6 production when 25 \u00b5g/mL was added ( [Table 2](#T2-nrp-1-94)). From the above results, it is thought that yam mucilage fraction directly stimulated macrophage to produce cytokines and thus it is considered that in vivo experiments or the separation of substance should be performed in the future. [2007](#B20-nrp-1-94)) reported that water extracts of Acanthopanax divaricatus var. alveofructus and Codonopsis lanceolata showed a significant immunomodulatory activity such as production of IgG antibodies. Kim et al. ( [1998](#B9-nrp-1-94)) reported that Platycodon radix (Changkil) extracts increased natural killer cells in lymphocytic composition against Sarcoma-18O ascites and solid tumor transplanted in ICR mice. Kwon et al. ( [2001b](#B11-nrp-1-94)) reported that MeOH extracts of Schizandra the proliferation such as lentinan ( [Chihara et al., 1987](#B1-nrp-1-94)) in mushroom and cell wall components of lactobacillus ( [Damais et al., 1975](#B3-nrp-1-94); [Sekine et al., 1994](#B25-nrp-1-94)) have been reported, and thus the relationship between the structure of immunopotentiating substance and its functions need to be investigated for yam mucilage fraction, and the development of functional food or new materials using this is expected for the prevention of decreased immunoactivity due to aging or diseases.
