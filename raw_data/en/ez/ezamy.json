Our multidisciplinary team approach offers patients the benefits of the most advanced care backed by the latest research and technology and a real dedication to compassionate, personal attention from everyone involved. A sophisticated medical genetics program supports our cancer care, and our multiple support programs include a well-established integrative medicine program, which provides a wide range of complementary services for our patients. Our clinical research program is broad, with 85 available trials allowing our patients earlier access to potentially beneficial new treatments. NorthShore is investing significant resources into Kellogg Cancer Center, evidenced by the opening of our new facility this year at Evanston Hospital. Designed with input from the NorthShore Oncology Patient Advisory Board, the expanded clinical space facilitates our multidisciplinary clinics, allowing medical oncologists and surgical oncologists, as well as numerous support and integrative programs, to share contiguous space. Our patients can see their entire care team in one location, and our physicians and other caregivers work together more efficiently. Construction for a new and expanded Kellogg Cancer Center at Glenbrook Hospital is underway, with completion planned for early 2012; plans to double the space of Highland Park Hospital's Kellogg Cancer Center are in the works, with construction scheduled to finish in spring of 2011. The oncology Guided Patient Support (GPS) Program was initiated in January 2010, thanks to philanthropic support from The Auxiliary of NorthShore at Evanston & Glenbrook Hospitals. The innovative program provides nurse navigators for newly diagnosed cancer patients. Through their initial contacts with patients, as well as their attendance at weekly tumor specific conferences, navigators are able to efficiently bring patients to optimal diagnosis and treatment, and help them deal with a myriad of issues through-out their care. The GPS Program also provides patient financial advocates who help with everything from sorting through insurance challenges to securing financial assistance through grants including pharmaceutical company donated or discounted drugs and NorthShore Reflecting on 2010 Excellence in Personalized Cancer Care NorthShore is investing significant resources into our Kellogg Cancer Center, evidenced by the opening of our new facility this year at Evanston Hospital.Dr. Bruce E.

The GPS Program has allowed the addition of a third dietitian to the Kellogg team, and has helped to increase available psychosocial support. An outpatient oncology pharmacy opened adjacent to the Evanston Hospital Kellogg Cancer Center and now serves patients at all of our Kellogg locations, offering specialized information and support related to oral chemotherapy drugs, pain medicine and other associated medications. Recent research has shown the importance of follow-up contact from pharmacists related to oral chemotherapy success; our new on-site, specialized service ensures this essential communica-tion for our patients. The new Kellogg facility provides improved space and technology for our nine regularly scheduled multi- disciplinary conferences, with enhanced AV services allowing for more video conferencing with other sites. Research initiatives at NorthShore support a wide range of projects designed to improve cancer preven- tion, detection and treatment. Our patients benefit from a focus on translational research, bringing the latest findings from the laboratory to our clinical settings each day. We continue to expand our clinical trial offerings, bringing new drugs and techniques to patients, and more hope to their families. Our teaching affiliation with the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine continues to strengthen our academic profile, including expansion of the University fellowship program to NorthShore in 2011. Our attending physicians hold faculty appointments at the University, and medical students and residents train at NorthShore hospitals. In addition to multiple shared clinical initiatives, NorthShore and the University of Chicago are also collaborating on a growing number of research studies. In 2010, NorthShore achieved the prestigious Magnet status from the American Nurses Credentialing Center, and NorthShore is the first in Illinois to receive this distinction as a system\u2014the highest honor for nursing excellence, which is undoubtedly an important component of cancer patient care. Our survival outcomes compare favorably with national benchmarks; data reflecting survival by stage for several tumor sites can be found in charts throughout this report. We are proud of our ability to offer the highest level of care, and privileged to serve a growing group of patients and families.Sincerely, Bruce E.

The 45-year-old mother of three teenagers ended up in the Emergency Department at NorthShore Evanston Hospital with excruciating pain due to a herniated disc in her back. The back issue was another gift in disguise, as a CAT scan revealed abnormalities in her appendix. Emergency surgery to remove her appen- dix led to the discovery and diagnosis of the rare cancer. \"This cancer was aggressive, it had replaced her appendix,\" said NorthShore surgeon Marshall Baker, MD. Following her initial surgery at NorthShore Evanston Hospital, Meg was persuaded by a friend who had recently undergone successful cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to travel there for the next stage of her treatment. Physicians recom- mended an aggressive approach, and she had another surgery at Sloan Kettering to remove 63 lymph nodes, both ovaries and fallopian tubes, omentum, part of her colon and part of the peritoneal membrane, and then received intraperitoneal chemotherapy. She was told she had Stage 4 cancer, but that it was treatable with the aggressive therapy.Fighting a Rare and Aggressive Cancer and Winning the Battle Unfortunately, three weeks after Meg returned home she developed a bowel obstruc- tion, a complication from the treatment. Dr. Baker once again performed surgery on Meg to relieve the obstruction and reconstruct the bowel. Meg then decided to receive the rest of her treatment at NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center with oncologist Robert Marsh, MD, who led her through months of systemic chemotherapy and, like Dr. Baker, is thrilled with her progress. \"It's incredible how well she is doing,\" said Dr. Marsh. Meg has high praise for the entire team of caregivers who have helped her through this herculean battle. \"Dr. Baker and his staff are all great, the interns, the residents, everyone,\" she said. A bowel obstruction and a 12-day hospital stay aside Meg said she still ended up \"laughing and joking\" with her doctors and nurses. And when it came time to start chemother- apy at NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center, she felt equally at ease with the medical oncology team\u2014Dr. Marsh, nurse navigator Margaret Whalen, RN, and her chemotherapy nurses were all wonderfully caring and available when-ever she had questions, according to Meg. \"As soon as I walk in the door at Kellogg and see the smiling greeters, I feel like I am walking into a place where people care,\" Meg said. \"You can bond with the people there, and I have.\" \" To go through all that she has, and end up in the good condition she is, is remarkable,\" said Dr. Baker.

Improving Screening, Advancing Care An ongoing focus on improving quality for colorectal screening means our physicians stay ahead of the curve. To that end, our GI special- ists are improving colonoscopies with: Slower, more careful inspection on withdrawal of the colonoscope, given studies that show increased polyp detection rates with longer withdrawal times. Attention to the quality of colonoscopy prepa-rations, including split dosing (part the day before and part on the day of the procedure) and use of an irrigation pump to improve visualization. Encouraging adherence to published guide-lines regarding the appropriate frequency of colonoscopy in order to avoid over-use and under-use of screening and surveillance colonoscopy. NorthShore is involved in the latest technological improvements for colonoscopies with a current interest in magnification colonoscopy, which uses optical zooming to increase the degree of detail that can be seen; dye spraying techniques that highlight abnormalities of the colonic lining; and \"optical biopsy\" techniques, which allow real-time visualization of structures at the cellular level during colonoscopy. Improved techniques in radiation, including stereotactic radiosurgery for some early stage cancers, provide more options for our patients. Innovative research is a key component of our program and we regularly participate in both early stage studies for new and cutting-edge therapies and large national Phase III studies helping to enhance current options. Our academic affiliation with the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine allows for even more collaborative research efforts, all aimed at improved prevention, detection and treatment of GI cancers. Medical oncologist Jennifer Obel, MD, is currently leading efforts on a new study related to management of resectable colon cancer that has spread to the liver. NorthShore offers a Women's GI Risk and Prevention Center to address gender differences and barriers to critical cancer prevention strate-gies for women. Led by Laura Bianchi, MD, the Center's clinical program counsels women about their personal risk for GI cancers and offers an individualized approach to risk reduction includ-ing lifestyle modifications.

But that incongruous reality sent Fishman-Lewis, 37, and her family on a medical odyssey requiring the resources of both NorthShore University HealthSystem (NorthShore) Kellogg Cancer Center and the Maternal Fetal Medicine team at NorthShore Evanston Hospital. \"Being treated for breast cancer including undergoing chemotherapy while pregnant was an out-of-control experience. I needed doctors who would figure things out and allow me to make the best decisions,\" said Fishman-Lewis. Oncologists Leon Dragon, MD, and Douglas Merkel, MD, surgeon Katherine Yao, MD, and the Maternal Fetal Medicine team were \"absolutely\" those doctors, as well as the nurses and other staff, she said. Oncology nurse navigator Beth Weigel, RN, was \"beyond phenomenal.\" \"The Kellogg team and the Maternal Fetal Medicine team had to keep the big picture in mind,\" Fishman-Lewis said. She and her husband Brian, and big sister Margo, welcomed baby Liza on Aug. 23, 2010. In the meantime, she continues to undergo chemotherapy, which will be followed by radiation therapy. \"I have a wonderful family and a support group of superb doctors and nurses,\" Fishman-Lewis said. \"I have a lot to live for.\" Nurse navigator Beth Weigel, RN (from left) with Dr. Katherine Yao and Sara Fishman-Lewis10 NorthShore University HealthSystemGynecology Medical GeneticsGynecologic oncology at NorthShore University HealthSystem (NorthShore) offers patients the absolute latest in comprehensive care, backed by translational research and a team of compassionate and dedicated physicians and other healthcare professionals.

When he saw a physician in 2002, Nixon was diagnosed with prostate cancer that had spread to bones in his hip, back and leg. With the same athlete's determination, Nixon pursued options that would stop the cancer from advancing further and allow him to maintain his quality of life. He sought out several physicians before finding the best fit at NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center, first with urologist Charles Brendler, MD, and then with oncologist Daniel Shevrin, MD. \"We talked some about sports, and then Dr. Shevrin just listened to me and what my expectations were,\" said Nixon, a retired retail manager and active civic volunteer. \"It was a team I could be confident about and believe in.\" In December 2009, Dr. Shevrin enrolled Nixon in a clinical trial for an experimental drug for treatment of prostate cancer\u2014his prostate specific antigen, or PSA, dropped significantly, and his cancer is now under control. \"I am relieved,\" Nixon said. \"When I leave Kellogg, I am always in good spirits.\"Richard Nixon (left) and oncologist Dr. Daniel Shevrin, Director of Urologic Medical Oncology2010 Oncology Annual Report 13The Comprehensive Prostate Cancer Center at NorthShore University HealthSystem (NorthShore) brings together physicians and researchers from a multitude of disciplines to respond to what is now a highly curable disease. Men who are newly diagnosed with prostate cancer have the opportunity to meet with many members of our collaborative team of special- ists\u2014in one day, and in one location\u2014giving them not only a personalized treatment plan based on the most advanced care options, but also tremendous peace of mind. The Center is co-directed by Michael McGuire, MD, who is Chief of the Division of Urology, and Charles Brendler, MD, the Ronald L. Chez Family and Richard Melman Family Chair of Prostate Cancer at NorthShore. In addition to urologists, radiation oncologists and medical oncologists, our prostate cancer pro-gram offers essential support services focused on sexual health, nutritional and integrative medicine, genetic counseling and psychosocial issues. New members of the team recruited this year include another urologic oncologist, Kristen Novakovic, MD, a single port/natural orifice minimally invasive surgeon Sangtae Park, MD, and an expert in sexual health, Jeffrey Albaugh, PhD. Active Surveillance Program As the program's reputation for excellence continues to grow, our clinical volume is also increasing, up 40 percent in the previous year. NorthShore's prostate cancer active surveillance program is the only such program in the Midwest and the only one nationally using color flow, 3-D ultrasonography to diagnose prostate cancer and monitor prostate cancer progression. Men enrolled in the study are followed very closely with blood and urine tests to measure prostate specific antigen (PSA) and other promising biological markers every three months, physical exams every six months, and an annual biopsy. Study patients, like all prostate cancer patients at NorthShore, have the opportunity to meet with one of our registered oncology dietitians. Advanced Research Our clinicians work closely with our team of scientists involved in a number of promising initiatives aimed at developing better biomarkers Prostate Dr. Charles Brendler, the Ronald L.

NorthShore researchers will be using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging to analyze patients' blood, urine and tissue to develop metabolic profiles. NorthShore's Center for Medical Genetics is intimately involved with our prostate cancer program. Medical Director Wendy Rubinstein, MD, PhD, and her colleagues have enrolled more men into the international IMPACT study looking at BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in prostate cancer than any other U.S. site. An IRB-approved anxiety management program for prostate cancer patients on active surveillance focused on this essential quality of life issue was highlighted by Dr. Brendler and colleagues at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association in San Francisco in May 2010. Jennifer Doll, PhD, a NorthShore Department of Surgery tumor biologist, continues her research into the relationship between obesity and prostate cancer risk and progression. She also presented her findings at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association. Considerable progress is being made in research led by Susan Crawford, MD, to use neural stem cells embedded in an adhesive biogel that can be applied to a surgical site following tumor removal to eradicate micro- scopically residual cancer cells to prevent their subsequent growth and metastasis. For more information, call (847) 657-5730.14 NorthShore University HealthSystemThoracic Improving care and outcomes for patients with lung cancer and other thoracic malignancies is the committed objective of NorthShore's Thoracic Oncology Program (TOP). Working in a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach, the TOP team is a specialized group of healthcare professionals who are dedicated to preventing, diagnosing, treating and managing lung cancer and esophageal, pleural, mediastinal and chest wall tumors. Thomas Hensing, MD, Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine, and John Howington, MD, Clinical Associate Professor of Surgery, serve as Co-Directors of the program. TOP's multidisciplinary approach includes a team of board-certified physicians and mid-level practitioners from thoracic surgery, medical and radiation oncology, pulmonary medicine, pathology and radiology. Collective Expertise This approach, a variety of specialists and prac- titioners from different clinical disciplines working together, is the hallmark of NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center and the TOP program. The team meets weekly to discuss patient cases in detail and develop an individualized treatment plan based on collective expertise. This approach provides the best treatment options. The merits of multidisciplinary care are exemplified in our collaboration with neuro-oncology. Because lung cancer is one of the most common forms of cancers to metastasize to the brain, TOP was pleased to add the expertise of NorthShore neuro-oncologist Ryan Merrell, MD, to its team. He is one of three neuro-oncologists, along with many other subspecialists, who enable our team to recommend the best treatment plans for our patients. During the past year, TOP also welcomed medical oncologist Teresa Law, MD, to the team. Dr. Law is board-certified in internal medicine and medical oncology. As a teaching affiliate of the University of Chicago, NorthShore's partnership with this esteemed institution continues to broaden for the benefit of our patients, particularly around the area of clinical trials. Through this relation-ship, NorthShore is integrating its clinical trial menu with the University of Chicago, thus expanding options for TOP patients, as well as others, at both institutions. As a further benefit to clinical research, the infrastructure for NorthShore's bioinformatics capabilities is greatly expanding. This will strengthen and enhance collaboration between NorthShore and the University of Chicago. Critical support services play a key role in our multidisciplinary approach. Oncology certified nurses and pharmacists, along with dietitians and the psychosocial team, closely collaborate to provide a comprehensive can-cer program. The needs of our patients are first and foremost in our approach to care. TOP's nurse navigator, Gail Ronkoske, RN, works with each member of the care team to manage the patient's case from diagnosis through treatment and beyond. For more information, call (847) 570-2518.

Her own recent diagnosis of lung cancer and the fact that they had another brother succumb to the disease put McGuire's sister \"on his case,\" he explained. When his doctor called and said the scan revealed a problem, McGuire remained calm, still sure that it was nothing to worry about. Taking his sister's direction again, McGuire scheduled an appoint- ment with NorthShore thoracic surgeon John A. Howington, MD, who had successfully treated her with a minimally invasive procedure to remove the tumor. \"I trusted Dr. Howington immediately. Not only is he a talented surgeon, he's a terrific guy and a great human being,\" McGuire said. Scheduled for a thoracoscopic lobectomy\u2014the same minimally invasive surgery that saved his sister\u2014McGuire knew he was in good hands, and was confident he would beat the cancer. \"Everything went exactly as it was supposed to,\" McGuire said, proving his confidence was well-placed. Because his cancer was caught early, and the surgery was successful, McGuire avoid-ed chemotherapy and radiation and was back to his full activity level, even increasing his exercise plan, very quickly. More than a year after his procedure, McGuire remains cancer free, healthy, happy and grateful for a life and a future with his wife and two sons. \"I feel highly energetic, I play golf, I go to my kids' ball games; I'm a lucky man.\"Thoracic surgeon Dr. John A.

Of those, 3,344 cases (88 percent) were analytic. By definition, analytic cases are those patients newly diagnosed with malig-nant neoplasm and/or have received all or part of their first course of treatment at one of our Hospitals. The remaining 465 cases (12 percent) were non-analytic. Non-analytic cases are patients initially diagnosed and treated at another facility, who now are receiving treatment for progression or recur-rence of their disease at NorthShore. Details by site are provided in Table 1. Class of Case 2009 Class 0, 1 and 2 are considered analytic cases; Class 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are non- analytic. Class 0 and Class 1, which account for 2,759 cases, were those malignancies diagnosed at one of our four Hospitals. Once diagnosed with cancer, 2,644 (96 percent) of our patients remained at NorthShore for their treatment. Class 2, totaling 585 cases, were diagnosed else-where and referred to NorthShore for treatment. Class 3, a total of 418 cases were diagnosed and treated elsewhere and referred here for treatment of a recurrence or progression of disease. The remaining 47 cases are divided among other non- analytic classes. Overall Top 5 NorthShore Sites Breast cancer continues to be our top cancer site representing 22 percent of the total analytic cases seen at NorthShore. The next most frequent cancers seen were: lung (11 percent), prostate (10 percent), and colon and melanoma (5 percent each). These top five sites represent 53 percent of all newly diagnosed cases.Distribution by AJCC Stage for the Top Five Sites seen at NorthShore Cancer diagnoses are broken down into five stages. Each stage represents how far the cancer cells have spread. Eighty-six percent of our breast cancers were diagnosed at an early stage (stages 0, 1 and 2), reflecting the national (83 percent) trend toward early detection. Thirty-eight percent of our lung cancers (national 28 percent), 80 percent of our prostate cancers (national: 80 percent), 55 percent of our colon cancers (national: 49 percent) and 84 percent of our melanoma cancers (national: 71 percent) were also diag-nosed with early stage disease. In each of the top sites seen at NorthShore, detection at an early stage was significantly higher or equal to that seen nationally. National data supplied by the 2010 NCDB, Commission on Cancer, ACoS Benchmark Reports (2008 data); data for NorthShore is from diagnosis year 2009. See Table 2 on page 21. Survival by Stage at Diagnosis Stage at diagnosis also predicts the patient's survival rate, or the percentage of people who will survive for five years after the cancer diagnosis. Based on cases diagnosed in 2003 and submitted to the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) overall survival rates at NorthShore for the top five sites compare favorably to those seen nationally. For breast cancer our overall five-year survival rate is 91 percent (national: 85 percent). Longer or equivalent overall survival rates are seen for the remaining top four sites as well. See graph for colon and rectum on page 4, breast on page 8, prostate on page 13, lung on page 14 and melanoma on page 17.
