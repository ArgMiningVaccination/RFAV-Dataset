The Risk Reduction Monographs are part of the OECD Environment Monograph Series. This series is designedto make available to a wide readership selected technicalreports on the risk reduction of chemicals prepared underthe OECD Chemicals Programme. The EnvironmentPolicy Committee recommended that this report be madepublic under the authority of the Secretary-General, whosubsequently agreed. Demandandenduses .................................................................................... Areas in which Member Countries Have Developed Environmental Policies for Lead89FOREWORD Background In 1990 the Council of the OECD adopted a Decision-Recommendation on the Co- operative Investigation and Risk Reduction of Existing Chemicals (C(90) 163/Final). This Act isaimed at the reduction of risks from chemicals to the environment and/or the health of the generalpublic or workers. It is based on the premise that international co-operation in risk reductionactivities can enhance the technical and institutional aspects of risk management in Membercountries through burden-sharing and a reduction of duplicative efforts. Furthermore, suchactivities can lead to a more effective use of the knowledge about risks that is being generatedthrough, for example, national chemicals reviews and assessments, the OECD co-operativeinvestigation of existing chemicals, and the work of the United Nations International Programme onChemicalSafety(IPCS)indevelopinganinternationalhazardandriskevaluations. International co-operation in risk reduction can provide a forum for the exchange of views on risk reduction strategies, thus increasing mutual understanding and facilitating theharmonization of programmes being undertaken at the national level. By means of this forum,technicalbarrierstotradecanalsobeprevented. TheOECD'sapproachtoriskreduction The risk reduction process normally begins at the national level. However, the international character of the use and marketing of chemicals, and the mobility of certain chemicalsin the environment, have given risk reduction activities an international dimension. The new workon risk reduction in OECD is a major step towards greater international co-operation, consistencyand, ultimately, harmonization. It is designed to enable Member countries to use a variety ofoptionsflexiblyaspart of aco-ordinatedinternationalinitiativetoreducerisk. The OECD's approach to risk reduction relies on the sharing and exchange of information on the management of specific chemicals. Readily available information concerning national riskreduction strategies will make comparative analyses possible. Where common interests emerge,the development and implementation of measured and consistent responses to unacceptablehealthand/orenvironmentalriskscanbefacilitated. In this context, risk reduction activities can take into account all stages of a chemical's commercial and environmental life cycle, beginning with the natural resources needed to produce itand extending through the chemical's uses to its eventual disposal. The chemical's health andenvironmental effects, and those of its possible substitutes, can be considered together withexposure via all routes and media to different populations. In addition, the relative benefits of thedifferent elements of a risk reduction strategy at all stages of a chemical's commercial andenvironmentallifecyclescanbeweighed.10OECDworkonleadriskreduction OECD Member countries chose lead as one of the five chemicals or groups of chemicals for inclusion in the initial pilot project on co-operative risk reduction. The United States prepared asummary of information on the current \"state-of-the-art\" with regard to national strategies for leadrisk reduction. With Australia, Canada and Germany, it formed an OECD Clearing House whichcollected further information from Member countries, including the industries involved with thechemical. The Clearing House countries completed this Monograph, and the countries ofOECDagreedthat it shouldbemadepublic.11EXECUTIVESUMMARY Themainpurposesof thisdocument onleadriskreductionare: toprovideasummaryof informationregarding releases of lead to the environment, the ensuing environmental and human exposures, and the way OECD Member countriesandcountrieswithobserverstatusperceivetherisksassociatedwithexposuretolead; \u007f todescribetheactionsthosecountriesandindustryhave taken, or contemplate taking, toreducerisksassociatedwithexposuretolead; and \u007f to identify the benefits, in terms of protection of human health and the environment, that couldresult fromtakingsuchactions, totheextent that informationisavailable. This document reflects information provided from 1990-1992 and should be considered as a \"snapshot\" of the most recent thinking and activities during this time period. It may assist inevaluating the effectiveness of national risk reduction strategies for lead by identifying commontrends in setting criteria, standards or national policies. It may also suggest rationales andpossibilitiesforconcertedinternationalactions. Risk reduction activities for lead are expected to continue to create information and technology conduits between Member countries, and to promote the development and transfer ofknowledge regarding the nature and efficacy of responses to deal with unacceptable risks resultingfromexposuretolead. ChapterSummaries 1. LeadProduction, UseandDisposal Lead is a naturally occurring element within the earth's crust. It is believed to have been mined as early as 5000 B.C. Easily shaped and highly valued for its malleability and ductility, leadwasusedinancient timesinmakingpotteryglazes, art objects, coinsandwaterpiping. Today, lead is produced from the beneficiation of ores and concentrates and/or from recycling in over 50 countries. In 1990, world production of lead metal was 5.659million tonnes,valuedat over$US4.6billion, withslightlyover50percent derivedfromrecycledmaterials. In thatyear, OECD countries accounted of the world's production of lead in ores andconcentratesandabout64percentoftheworld'smetalproduction. Primary lead from mining is often produced as a by-product or co-product with other metals such as zinc, silver, copper and cadmium. In 1989, 155mines in 35countries produced2.21million tonnes of lead in concentrate, with co-product (copper, zinc, silver) output valued atover $US9billion.12Lead is also among the most recycled non-ferrous metals in the world. Secondary production(fromrecycledmaterials) has risen steadily. It surpassed primary output for the first timein 1989. This growth reflects the favourable economic conditions associated with lead recyclingand the fact that lead retains its physical and chemical properties when recycled. As leadapplications are used worldwide, scrap lead has become a readily renewable resource to whichcountrieswithout leadmineshaveaccess. Since 1970, the world demand for lead's unique chemical, electrical and physical properties has increased by 25percent to a record level of 5.627million tonnes in 1990. OECDcountries accounted for 65percent of world demand in 1990, with the Central and EasternEuropean countries consuming 21percent. Asia is now the third largest, and fastest-growing,lead-consumingregion, representing9percent of worlddemand. Demand for lead within OECD countries increased by 10percent between 1970 and 1990. The battery sector recorded the greatest growth and accounted for 63percent of demandin 1990. During the same period, health and environmental concerns were largely responsible forthe decline in the use of lead in gasoline, soldered food cans, solder and piping for potable watersystems, and pigments used in household paints. Most of the decline in other uses, such as cablesheathing, reflects changes in technology and market-driven requirements for lighter, more cost-competitiveandmoreefficient products. New applications are being developed for lead and lead compounds in microelectronics, superconductors, asphalt, earthquake damping materials and radon gas shielding, and forretrievable storage or permanent disposal of nuclear waste, to name a few. Industry hasacknowledged that risk analyses should accompany the introduction of new products, and thatrecyclingandreuseconceptsshouldbedevelopedwhereappropriate. Daily prices for lead are based on international market factors, as it is traded worldwide. Regionally, Europe and Japan are the largest importers of lead concentrates and Europe is themajor importer of lead bullion and refined lead. Australia, Canada and Peru are principal suppliersof bothleadconcentratesandleadmetal. Mexicoisamajorexporterof refinedlead. Environmental releases of lead can occur naturally (for example, through crustal weathering, volcanism) or from anthropogenic sources relating to industrial activity, powergeneration (coal and oil burning), and the use and disposal of consumer products. Industrialwastes (i.e. emissions, effluent and solid waste) are often regulated within OECD countries. Post-consumer wastes containing lead may be regulated, depending on their hazard classificationand/ortheirdestination(i.e. recycling, finaldisposal, internationaltrade). Lead materials that can be recycled vary from industrial and consumer scrap to remediation and abatement wastes. Post-consumer product scrap constitutes more than80percent of the scrap supply for recycling, with batteries accounting for up to 90percent in agivenyear. Battery recycling rates are high in many countries, sometimes exceeding 90percent. However, it has become apparent that the weakest link in the recycling chain is usually theconsumer who retains or discards a used battery rather than returning it for recycling. In a numberofcountries,governmentsareworkingwithindustrytoincreaserecyclingbyfocusingon the batterylifecycleandencouragingconsumerstoreturnusedbatteries.13If lead-containing industrial solid wastes and post-consumer products are not recycled or reused, they are generally sent to landfills for disposal or are incinerated. The composition andvolume of wastes destined for final disposal, as well as management methods, vary according tocountry and region depending on factors such as end use patterns, recycling rates and populationdensity. Some countries have estimated that batteries and consumer electronic products account for most of the lead in municipal solid waste. Others have identified lead in soldered food cans asthe main source of lead in household refuse. It has been observed in some countries that thevolume of lead in municipal waste is declining. Studies have also found that health concerns areminimal for properly managed landfills with runoff and leachate controls, and that lead emissionsfrom incinerators can be controlled, with proper technology, to 99percent or greater efficiency.While much of the atmospheric emission of lead from incineration can be eliminated, lead capturedby emission control devices and the lead remaining in ashes must be disposed of properly, usuallyinlandfills. 2. EnvironmentalFate,TransportandOccurrence Human activities remove lead from the earth's crust, where it is relatively immobile, and transferittoenvironmentalmedia.The potential for human and ecosystem exposure is thus greatlyincreased. Industrialization has vastly accelerated the transport of lead into human andenvironmental exposure pathways. Substantial human and ecosystem exposure to lead can occurinallenvironmentalmedia. It has been estimated that the amount of lead emitted per year into the atmosphere from anthropogenicsourceshasdeclinedto about 30percent of the estimated 332 350metric tonnes in1983. Sources of atmospheric lead emissions may be considered as belonging to one of two maincategories: mobile sources (through the use of leaded fuels in automobiles) and stationary ones(refining, manufacturing and incineration). Air emissions from smelters, processing facilities andsolid waste incinerators occur as point source releases from stacks and as fugitive releases fromstorage, processing or materials handling. Lead concentrations in the air in cities in some OECDcountries have ranged from 0.5 \u00b5g/m 3up to 10 \u00b5g/m3in densely travelled inner city areas. However, restrictions on lead levels in gasoline in many countries have resulted in a marked decrease in automotive emissions of lead into the atmosphere. Air concentrations near pointsourcesoftenstillremainhigh. Lead accumulates in soils and sediments. As a result of the decline in atmospheric lead emissions, the total annual anthropogenic loading of lead to soils worldwide is considered to havebeen reduced, from a 1983 estimate of between 479 000 and 1 113 000 metric tonnes peryear.Atmospheric deposition of lead is a major source of soil and sediment contamination. Theconcentration of lead in soils near highways is related to traffic density, local meteorologicalconditions, vegetation and topography. Lead concentrations decrease with distance from thehighway and with depth in the soil column. Lead concentrations associated with stationary sourcesare dependent on the rate of release from source, dispersion, and deposition rate. Generally, theconcentrationof leadinsoildecreasesexponentiallydownwindof apoint source. House paint containing lead can significantly contribute to household dust or soil concentrations of lead. Shot and fishing weights contribute large quantities of lead to soils and14sediments. Lead tends to be immobilized by the organic component in soil and remains bound to the soil. It has been suggested that lead immobilized in soil can be released by decreases in thepH of precipitation. However, there is as yet no evidence to confirm that acid rain is influencing thechemistryandtransport of leadinthesoilenvironment. Lead is a natural, usually very minor constituent of surface and ground waters. As with leadinsoils, thetotalinput of leadtoaquaticecosystemsworldwideisconsidered to have declined,from an estimated 97 000-180 000metric tonnes peryear in 1983, as a result of the decrease inatmospheric lead emissions. Input of lead to aquatic ecosystems can occur from sources such asindustrial wastes, effluents from mining, smelting, refining and manufacturing processes, dumpingof sewage sludge, and atmospheric fall-out. Most of the lead introduced into surface waters isreadily absorbed into sediments, where it complexes with organic material. Due to its relativeimmobilityinwater, leadtendstoaccumulatewhereverdelivered(forexample, nearpoint sources). 3. LinkagestoExposure Inhalation and ingestion (of water, food, paint, soil and/or dust) are the primary routes of human exposure to lead. The relative importance of any single source of exposure is difficult topredict. It willvarywithgeographiclocation, climateand local geochemistry. Similarly, the intensityof exposure experienced by an individual can vary as a function of age, sex, occupation, socio-economic status, diet and cultural practices. In addition, the amount of lead taken up into the bodyis believed to vary depending on the concentration and composition (for example, particle size,chemicalform)of theleadinhaledoringested. Some countries monitor the levels of lead in environmental media, as well as in blood, as abasisforassessingrisksofexposureandtheeffectivenessofmeasurestoreduce these risks. Incountries that monitor trends in lead levels, data indicate that while the demand for lead products(and possibly the amount of lead destined for final disposal) has increased, the average levels oflead in air, food and blood declined to below levels of national concern. However, some countrieshave identified portions of the population that continue to be exposed to levels that exceed those ofnational concern. These elevated lead exposures often relate to point source releases, to past useof paintscontaininglead, ortoleadpipingandsolderinpotablewatersystems. Reasons for the decline in lead levels vary according to country or region, and are in part influenced by local factors (for example, climate, socio-economic considerations, etc.). Declininglead levels in various environmental media and blood are commonly attributed to the followingfactors: \u007frestrictions on, and reductions in, dispersive uses of lead that result in its being suchas: \u00b7leadingasoline, \u00b7leadinsolderedfoodcans, non-regulatory measures for management of industrialemissionsandeffluents(forexample, fromsmelters);15\u007fmonitoring of water supply systems to reduce the solubility of lead from lead-bearing servicelinesbycontrollingthepH; and \u007fthe development and implementation of regulations and technology for safe management of lead-bearing and other wastes destined for final disposal in landfills orincinerators. 4. National PositionsonCurrentRisksfromLead The Member country statements in this chapter essentially present the rationale for any actions the country has taken to address effects associated with environmental or human healthexposures to lead. The risk assessments and risk characterizations that have led countries to takeaction have a national character. Countries develop positions on the need for risk reductionactivities only after they have analysed the hazard and the significance of certain exposures andhave factored in local social, economic and political considerations. These positions are usuallyarrived at after considerable debate on the numerous factors involved, and thus are not consistentacrossMembercountries. This chapter also contains an internationally agreed assessment of the risks of lead from the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS). The IPCS assessment is taken directlyfrom Chapters 1 and 9 of the recent Task Group-approved update of the Environmental HealthCriteriaDocument onLead, whichwillbepublishedinlate1993or early1994. 5. MechanismsforRiskReduction During the past few decades, most Member countries have taken steps to reduce unacceptable human and ecosystem risks from exposure to lead. Among the most successful ofthese measures have been restrictions on the use of lead in certain products with significantexposure potential (for example, interior paint, gasoline). Accompanying these measures havebeen actions to establish criteria for acceptable levels of lead in environmental media, to limitindustrial emissions of lead to the environment, to control occupational exposures, and to identifybiologically based indices for determining populations at risk. Despite the success of many ofthese measures in reducing lead exposure, some Member countries continue to consider possiblesteps to reduce lead exposure further, especially in light of new evidence of potential health effectsat levelspreviouslybelievedtobesafe. This chapter reviews risk management activities in Member countries. Included are discussions of steps taken in the past to reduce lead exposure, as well as current activities andpotential future measures contemplated by certain countries. Country-specific risk management activitiesare summarized in Table5.1. As shown in the table, the extent of these activities varies substantiallyamongcountries. The lead risk reduction activities of thirteen individual countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, theUnited Kingdom and the United States), the Nordic countries and the European Community aredescribed in this chapter, followed by a summary of industry risk reduction activities. At the end of the chapter is a series of tables that summarize available data on lead risk reduction activities in all16Member countries and Mexico. Repeated requests for information on lead risk reduction activities were made to all Member countries in 1991 and 1992. Lack of information in this report on aparticular country means either that no risk reduction activities have taken place in that Membercountry, orthat theMembercountryhasdeclinedtorespondtotherequestsforinformation. The following is a brief summary of the information given in this chapter, apart from that presentedinthetables: Australia: The Australian Government supports the production and uses of lead, consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. Australia restrictsthe manufacture and use of lead-based household paint with a 0.25percent non-volatilecontent, andtheleadcontent of gasolineislimitedto levels ranging from 0.3g/l to 0.84g/l,depending on location. Since 1 January 1986, all imported and domestic new cars havebeen required to operate on unleaded petrol (i.e. less than 0.013g/l). This policy hasresulted in unleaded petrol sales now approaching 50 per cent of total sales. Apenetration level of about 80 per cent is forecast for the end of the decade. Australia alsolimits the emission concentration from stationary point sources to 1.5 \u00b5g/m 3over a three- month average. The concentration of lead in drinking water should not exceed 0.05mg/l and the permissible levels for lead in specific foods are between 0.2and 2.5mg/kg,depending on the foodstuff. The lead content of ceramic glazes is restricted, as is thelead content of pencils, toys, crayons and artists' paints (to 0.01percent). Although thereare no recycling regulations governing lead batteries, the industry reports that over90percentoftheleadusedinbatteriesisrecycled. Canada: The advertisement, importation and sale of paints containing lead are restricted. Lead is permitted in products (paints) for exterior use only and must be properly labelled.The Canadian paint industry voluntarily stopped using lead in household (interior and exterior) paint in 1991. In 1990 Canada prohibited the use of leaded gasoline (not toexceed 5mg/l), except for use in critical equipment (not to exceed 26mg/l). Canadacurrently allows a maximum of 10 \u00b5g/l of lead in drinking water and the plumbing codepermits a maximum concentration of 0.2percent lead for solder and fluxes in contact withpotablewater. Lead concentrations allowed in food vary between 0.08mg/kg for infant formula and 1.5mg/kg for tomato products. National standards exist for ambient water quality (0.001to 0.007mg/l freshwater aquatic life), soil and air (emissions of particulates fromsecondary lead smelters from 0.023 to 0.046g/m 3). Lead is limited to 0.5per cent in coating materials applied to children's products. Canada recycles an estimated93percent of lead-acid batteries. Lead batteries that are filled with acid are classified ashazardous and, as a result, their transportation and storage are regulated by federal andprovincial requirements. Regulation of the handling of lead-bearing scrap is dividedbetween federal and provincial authorities. Canada has undertaken extensive educationand labelling programmes designed to increase community awareness of the hazardsassociatedwithleadexposure. Denmark: Danish lead risk reduction activities are aimed at phasing out the use of lead totally. Possible actions are regulation and voluntary agreements. The means could besubstitution and, where this is not possible, improved recycling. International action isseenasanecessarymeansof eliminatingleaduse.17Finland: The use of white lead and lead sulphate has been prohibited in interior paints since 1929. Lead carbonates and lead sulphates may not be used in paints after 1January 1993, except in paint intended for restoration and maintenance of works of artand historic buildings. The lead content of gasoline is limited to 0.013g/l (unleaded) and0.15g/l (leaded). Maximum values for emissions from facilities into air and water are seton a case-by-case basis during environmental permitting procedures. The maximumallowable concentration of lead in workplace air is 0.10mg/m 3(time-weighted average over eight hours). The maximum allowable lead concentration in the blood of exposedworkers is 50\u00b5g/dl. Food safety standard: the maximum lead content in fruits andvegetables is 0.3mg/kg, in drinks 0.3mg/kg, and in canned food 1.0mg/kg. Maximumlead leaching from ceramic ware that will come into contact with foodstuffs has beendefined. Themaximumleadlevelfordrinkingwateris0.05mg/l. France:Theleadcontent of gasolinewasreduced to 0.15g/l in 1991, and unleaded (less than 0.013 g/l) gasoline has been granted a tax reduction which makes its retail pricelower than that of leaded gas. France has adopted the EC limit of 0.05mg/l lead contentof surface water to be used as a source for potable water. The average annual limit valueforambient airconcentrationof leadis2\u00b5g/m 3. Standardsexist forlimitingleademissions from industrial and other facilities. Sewage sludge used in land application must not havea lead concentration greater than 800ppm. France limits the migration of lead fromceramic kitchen utensils into food, allows only external soldering of cans, and adheres tothe January 1993 prohibition of lead capsules for overcorking wine bottles imposed by theEC. Import and sale of paint containing white lead compounds is prohibited from 1February 1993. Battery recycling is accomplished through voluntary agreementsdesignedtofacilitaterecoveryandtransport of spent batteries. Germany: Regarding paint, white lead compounds are banned from sale and lead-based anti-corrosivepaint isbeingphasedout. Containers for paint with more than 0.15 per centlead content must be labelled. The maximum content of leaded gasoline has beenrestricted to 0.15g/l since 1976, and unleaded (less than 0.013g/l) gas has been on themarket since 1982. In 1992, the market share of unleaded gas was greater than80percent. Municipalities responsible for drinking water supply systems have to maintain a lead level of less than 40\u00b5g/l at the mains connection. Lead service lines are no longer used, andold lead systems are gradually being replaced. Copper pipes have to be soldered withlead-free alloys. Many German states have limited the lead concentration in the soil. Forexample, Northrhine-Westphalia has a limit of 20mg/kg lead in the sand of children'splaygrounds. The maximum tolerable lead concentration in air is limited to 2.0\u00b5g/m 3 (annual mean); the maximum deposition on soil to 0.25mg/m2/day. Total metal emissions (including lead) from lead smelters are limited to 5mg/m3. For direct discharges to water, limitsvaryfrom0.3to2.0mg/l, according to the type of facility. The use of sewage sludgeforagriculturalpurposesislegallyprohibitedif itsleadcontent exceeds900mg/kg. In Lebensmitteln , ZEBS) have been established for most foodstuffs in a range of 0.03-2.0mg/kg. In addition, a limit value forwine has been introduced through the \"wine regulation\". For other foodstuffs, guidelinesfor lead have been established. There is no use of soldered cans for food packaging.Lead capsules for overcorking wine bottles are prohibited from 1993, in accordance with18an EC regulation. The recycling rate for lead-acid batteries is reported to be above 95percent. In the workplace, the maximum allowable air lead concentration is 0.10mg/m3(eight-hour time-weighted average). The maximum allowable blood lead concentration for workers is 70 \u00b5g/dl for men and for women over 45, and 30\u00b5g/dl forwomen under 45. Some physiologists and toxicologists recommend that the blood leadlevels of adults should not exceed the concentration of 15\u00b5g/dl, and that those of childrenandof womenof childbearingageshouldnot exceed10\u00b5g/dl. Japan:Japan does not prohibit the use of lead-based paints but does, through voluntary agreements, limit the extent to which lead-based paint is used (prohibited for toys,households). Lead-based paints are used primarily in construction, automobiles andelectronic products. Lead gasoline is not manufactured, imported or used in Japan. Themaximum permissible lead concentration in drinking water is 0.1mg/l. Japan has setemission standards for smelters and other lead processing facilities at 10-30mg/m 3 depending on the facility. Waste water effluent must have a lead concentration of lessthan1mg/l. Theadministrativelevelforleadintheworkplaceisset at 0.1mg/m 3. Mexico: Mexico has an aggressive programme underway to reduce tetraethyl lead concentration in regular gasoline. In 1990, unleaded gasoline (less than 0.01g/l) wasintroduced. From 1988 to 1992, an 88percent reduction in the lead content of gas tookplace. For drinking water the government established a lead level of 0.05mg/l. Mexicohas also set standards for lead in foodstuffs, drugs and cosmetics. The maximumpermissible level of lead in tomato sauce is 0.36mg/kg and the maximum permissiblelevel of lead in synthetic organic dyes added to food, beverages, drugs and cosmetics is10ppm. Mexico has eliminated the use of lead solder in welding of tin cans and has established a maximumpermissiblelevelof leadinsurfacepaint of 90mg/kg. Industrieshaveagreed toeliminate the use of lead red oxide and lead-based carbonate from pigments, lacquer,enamel, paint and varnish on toys, pencils, school articles, printing inks, cosmetics,furnitureandpaints for interiors. Labelling on products containing lead is now required. Inaddition, a coalition of industry and artisans has agreed with government on maximumsolubility levels for kiln-fired glazed pottery. Mexico has established a maximumpermissible level of lead in the workplace of 150\u00b5g/m 3. A further reduction to 50\u00b5g/m3is beingconsidered. New Zealand: White lead compounds cannot be manufactured, imported or used in paint, distemper, powder coatings, pigments, or antifoulant. The maximum permissible amountof lead in paint is 5000mg/kg; however, it is anticipated that this level will be reduced to2500mg/kg during 1993. The maximum permissible level of lead in petrol is 0.013g/l(unleaded) and 0.46g/l (leaded). A target date for elimination of lead in petrol has beenset as January 1996. Material used for writing, drawing, marking or painting that containsmore than 100mg/kg of lead is prohibited. The maximum permissible amount of lead incoating materials for toys is 5000mg/kg. This level will be reduced to 2500mg/kg in theFourth Amendment of the Toxic Substances Regulations 1983. Accessible plasticmaterialontoysisrestrictedtoamaximumpermissibleamount of 250mglead/kg. New Zealand's drinking water guideline of 0.05mg/l was established based on the WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, 1984. There is a proposal to review the standard in1993 to align with the new WHO Guidelines. The maximum permissible amounts of lead19in food range from 0.2to 10parts permillion, depending on the food product. Limits for lead in sewage sludge intended for application to arable land were established in 1992.The maximum acceptable concentration of lead in dry sewage sludge is 600mg/kg, thelimit value allowable in soil is 300mg/kg, and the maximum cumulative loading is125kg/ha. New Zealand has proposed a national ambient air quality guideline of1.0\u00b5g/m 3for an average time of three-month moving average. The workplace exposure standardforleadinairis0.15mg/m3. Sweden: In1991, the Swedish Government decided that measures should be carried out in order to phase out the use of lead on a voluntary basis, and in the long run to ensure itscessation. White lead compounds are not used in paints; however, some lead is used inpaint aspigments, dryingagentsandrust-proofing agents. Sweden limits the lead contentin gasoline at 0.15g/l for leaded and 0.013g/l for unleaded products and recently a banhas been proposed on the manufacture and import of leaded gasoline from 1 July 1994.Water with lead concentrations of less than 0.01mg/l is deemed suitable for use asdrinking water. Air and water standards are set on a case-by-case basis during the facilitylicensing process. Food tolerance levels have recently been lowered to 0.3-0.5mg/kg formost cannedfood, andtobetween0.02-0.5 mg/kg for various foodstuffs (higher values forspices, etc.). Ceramic ware, intended for handling food and beverages, is prohibited forsale if more than 3mg/l lead is leached out during a standardized acetic acid leachingtest. Swedenhasinstitutedanaggressiverecyclingprogrammeforbatteries,supported inlarge part by taxes on batteries. The maximum allowable air lead concentration in theworkplaceis0.10mg/m 3(total)and0.05mg/m3(respirable). Switzerland: The use of lead and its compounds is prohibited in water paints and non- washable distempers used for interior paintwork. The lead content of gasoline is limited to0.15 g/l (leaded), 0.013g/l (unleaded), and 0.56g/l in aircraft petrol. The permissible leadconcentration in drinking water is 0.05mg/l. Switzerland has set a general emissionstandard for combusters with a mass flow greater than 25g/hr at 5mg/m 3. For municipal waste incinerators, the sum of lead and zinc, including compounds emitted into theatmosphere, is not allowed to exceed 1 mg/m 3. The maximum tolerable lead concentration in air (suspended solids) is limited to 1 \u00b5g/m3; the maximum tolerable deposition at 100 \u00b5g/m3per day. Waste water effluents must have a lead concentration of less than 0.5mg/l. The quality criteria for surface water flows and impounded river water is set at 0.05 mg/l. The use of sewage sludge and compost is prohibited if their leadcontent exceeds 500mg/kg or 120mg/kg, respectively. The maximum allowable air leadconcentration in the workplace is 0.1mg/m 3(time-weighted average over eight hours) for lead and lead compounds (except alkyl compounds), and 0.075/m3for tetramethyl and tetraethyllead. United Kingdom: The United Kingdom has implemented legislation concerning lead paint that prevents the use of lead carbonates and lead sulphates in paint. Under theserules, lead carbonates and sulphates may only be used in paint for certain historicbuildings and for art preservation. The maximum allowable concentration of lead ingasoline is 0.15 g/l. Unleaded gasoline has a maximum allowable concentration of0.013g/l. Rules governing the maximum concentration of lead in drinking water are set at 50\u00b5g/l. Recently regulations have been proposed to prohibit the use of certain lead solders indomestic water supply installations. A maximum permissible concentration for lead in20soilsof 300mg/kgdrysolidsaftertheapplicationof sewagesludgehasbeenestablished. The ambient air quality standard for lead is 2.0 \u00b5g/m3(mean annual concentration). The UK regulates air point sources and other lead works using the best practicable means.Industrial sources must meet an allowable lead concentration of 0.002g/m 3. Total particulate emissions cannot exceed 0.1g/m3. Permissible lead concentrations in waste water effluent vary by industry and plant location. The typical range of permissibleconcentrationsis1.0-5.0mg/l. The UK has established quality and labelling standards for a range of consumer products, such as a general limit for lead in food of 1.0mg/kg with lower limits for special types offood such as baby food (0.2mg/kg). As of 1988, ceramic wares have been subject toregulation. Industry was given five years to meet maximum lead concentrations of0.8mg/dm 2for flatware, 4.0mg/l for small hollow-ware 1.5mg/l for hollow-ware greater than threelitres. The UK also restricts the use of lead-basedpaints in consumer products. Although there are no rules governing the disposal of leadbatteries within the UK, there are very high recycling rates (exceeding 90percent) forlead-acidbatteriesusedinbuildingsandautomobiles. The maximum allowable concentration of lead in the workplace is 0.15mg/m 3(eight-hour TWA), blood lead concentration of 70\u00b5g/dl for men and 40\u00b5g/dl for women. For thegeneral population, the government advice published in 1982 recommended taking stepstoreduceexposureif bloodleadlevelexceed25\u00b5g/dl. United States: The United States has restricted or banned the use of several products containingleadwhere risks from these products are high and where substitutes for lead orlead-based products are available. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) lowered thechildhood blood lead concentration of concern to 10\u00b5g/dl in 1991. Earlier, the EPA hadlowered the level of concern to 10\u00b5g/dl (\"10-15 and possibly lower\") in 1986. The Agencyfor Toxic Substance Disease Registry (ATSDR) identified the same level of concern in the1988Report toCongressonchildhoodleadpoisoning. One of the highest-risk sources of lead poisoning for children in the United States is lead- based paint. The federal government has set a standard for lead in residential paint of0.06percent, which effectively bans lead use in residential paint. In 1992, the ResidentialLead-based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 was enacted (Title X). This law providesthe framework for a national approach to reduce hazards from lead-based paint exposure,primarilyinhousing. The US restricts the amount of lead allowed per litre of leaded gas to 0.026grams. Since 1988, all new light-duty vehicles, trucks, motorcycles and heavy-duty gasoline enginesmust operate on unleaded gas (0.01g/l). Starting in 1995, a total ban on leaded gasolineand lead gasoline additives will be in place for highway use. A new regulation of 1991outlines the treatment requirement for drinking water that sets an \"action level\" of 15 \u00b5g/lmeasured at the home source. A series of remediation steps are prescribed forhouseholds exceeding this level. Interim guidelines exist for abatement of lead-basedpaint in public housing. These guidelines recommend abatement at 1 \u00b5g/cm 2paint of 0.5 per cent lead by weight and clearance levels for lead in household dust of 200\u00b5g/ft2for floors, 500\u00b5g/ft2for window sills and 800\u00b5g/ft2for window wells. The interim guidance for residential soil recommends that clean-up should attain soil concentrations of between21500and1000mg/kg. The US ambient air quality standard for lead is currently 1.5\u00b5g/m3(quarterly average). The most stringent standard for surface water quality is a maximum four-day average of1.3\u00b5g/l with a one-hour maximum average of 34\u00b5g/l. The US has proposed regulationsfor the use and disposal of sewage sludge containing lead that would allow a maximumconcentration of lead in sludge of 300mg/kg and cumulative pollutant loading for lead inthe soil of 300kg/ha. In the US, certain lead-containing wastes are specifically listed ashazardous. These wastes must be managed by a permitted treatment, storage ordisposalfacility. The federal and state governments also regulate the use of lead paints and surface coatings used in toys, children's products and household furniture. The canning industryhas undertaken a voluntary phase-out of the use of lead in food cans. The USgovernment also regulates the lead content of ceramic glazes, food, wine and pesticides.A number of states have adopted legislation to limit the levels of lead used in packagingmaterials. A large recycling effort is ongoing in the US to deal with most lead-acidbatteries (it is likely that many small consumer batteries may not be recycled). Recentstudiesindicatethatmorethan95percentofallsuchbatteriesarerecycled. The current Permissible Exposure Limit for air concentrations of lead in the workplace is 50\u00b5g/m 3. Blood level monitoring is triggered by an air lead concentration above 30 \u00b5g/m3. The medical removal blood lead concentration in the workplace, which became effective in 1983, is 50 \u00b5g/dl for three consecutive checks and 60 \u00b5g/dl for any one check. A worker is permitted to return to that workplace when his blood lead level falls below 40 \u00b5g/dl. Nordic Countries: The Nordic countries have undertaken a number of joint initiatives towards protecting the environment. Denmark, Sweden and Norway have signed theMinisterial Declaration of the Third International Conference on the Protection of the NorthSea. This declaration states that the emissions of lead (and other micropollutants) shallwithin 1995 be reduced by 70 per cent compared to the level in 1985. Denmark, Finlandand Sweden have, through the Baltic Marine Environment Commission (HelCom),adopted the goal of reducing lead emissions by 50 per cent within 1995, using 1987 as areferenceyear. TheNordicWorkingGroupforthe Chemicals Group of the Nordic Council of Ministers has prepared a draft report describing Nordic experiences regarding the technologicalpossibilities for reducing the use of lead. The long-term goal for the Nordic countries is tocompletely eliminate the intentional use of lead in products and to minimize the amount oflead discharged to the environment. The strategy to reach this goal includes, inpreferential order: cleaner technology (substitution and process modifications); effectiverecollectionandrecoverysystems;andenvironmentallyacceptablewastetreatment. European Community: The European Community has issued directives regulating lead in products, and across different environmental media and environmental sources. It isimportant to note that a directive is a legislative action addressed to Member States. Itmay either contain very specific information or be narrative in nature. A directive oftensets a deadline for adoption by Member States into their own laws; typically, however, adirective will contain specific information and will set a deadline on the order of three22years. If aMemberStatefailstoadopt thedirectiveintolawwithinthe specified amount of time, thenactionmaybetakenagainst that MemberintheEuropeanCourts. Beginning in 1989, the EC prohibited the use of lead carbonates and lead sulphates in paintsintendedforallpurposesotherthanpreservationwork. Also in 1987, the EC limitedlead levels in gasoline in a directive which sets the maximum permitted lead compoundlevel of leaded gas at 0.15g/l and defines unleaded gasoline as that containing less than0.013g/lof lead. In 1993, the EC prohibited the use of lead capsules for overcorking winebottles. All sources of drinking water should have a maximum allowable lead concentration of 0.05mg/l. In 1989, standards were established for sewage sludge used in agriculturalapplication. The lead concentration limit for soils with pH levels ranging from 6-7 is 50-300mg/kg dry matter, while the limit in sewage sludge is 75-1200mg/kg and the annuallimit of sewagesludgeappliedtoagricultureis15kg/ha(basedonaten-yearaverage). The EC has set feed standards to limit the exposure of livestock to lead. As of 1988, the marketing of cosmetic products containing lead was prohibited. No more than 20mg/kglead may be contained in colouring matters, and not more than 10mg/kg lead inantioxidants and emulsifiers used for food. The maximum leaching rate for ceramicarticlesthat canbefilledis4mg/landforceramiccookware1.5mg/l. Beginning in 1988, paints, varnishes, printing inks and similar products that have onepercent weight associated with heavy metals must be classified, packaged andlabelled according to EC standards. In 1986, the EC established concentration limits forair of 0.15mg/m 3and blood lead of 70\u00b5g/dl, and for air of 40\u00b5g/m3and bloodleadof 40\u00b5g/dl. Industry: Theinternationalnon-ferrousmetalsindustryhaseffected a variety of initiatives which can be considered lead \"risk reduction\" measures. Summaries of these activitiesare provided in this section. These initiatives generally fall into one of several categories,as follows: 1) changes in processing technology and/or emission controls; 2)implementation of medical surveillance and occupational hygiene programmes forexposed workers; 3) support of research to validate the effectiveness of existingoccupational and general population exposure limits and develop new monitoringprocedures for ensuring human and environmental health; and 4) implementation ofproduct stewardship programmes to inform downstream users of lead of the precautionswhichshouldbeexercisedsoastoprotect thehealthof employeesandconsumers. Occupational standards for exposure to lead vary among OECD countries. For example, OECD countries have established maximum occupational exposure limits for lead in bloodranging between 40and 80\u00b5g/dl. Standards for occupational exposure to airborne leadalso vary among OECD countries, with 50, 100 and 150\u00b5g/m 3all being specified in national regulations or legislation. Engineering controls backed by personal hygiene andother protective programmes are employed by lead producing and consuming industriesto minimize worker exposure. In areas where exposure limits cannot otherwise be met,personal respirators are employed. Correlations between lead in air and lead in blood aregenerally poor, with good personal hygiene widely regarded as the most significant factorin limiting exposure. This factor also serves to minimize the transport of lead particles intothe home. The European Federation of Capsule Manufacturers (EUCAPA) agreed in23June1990tostoptheproductionof lead-containingcapsulesforovercorkingwinebottles. The information presented in this overview was, in large part, collected via a questionnaire administered to the international industry by the International Lead Zinc ResearchOrganization in early 1992. Respondents to the questionnaire included corporationswhose lead production capacities comprise a significant proportion of both annual globalproduction and production in OECD Member countries. Responses to this questionnairewere not received from all lead-producing industries. As a result, the informationpresented must be viewed as a qualitative overview that is likely to be incomplete in someareas. Similarly, risk reduction measures implemented by the industry show evidence ofgeographic variation that is reflective of regional differences in the perception of relativerisk associated with lead exposure. The nature and extent of risk reduction activity byindustryinindividualcountriesisthusvariable. 6. SummaryandConsiderations Almost all OECD countries have introduced regulatory or non-regulatory measures to reduce unreasonable human and ecosystem risks from exposure to lead. The risk assessmentsand risk characterizations that have led countries to take actions have a national character.Although some countries have taken the same number of measures, no two countries haveadopted the same set of risk reduction measures (i.e. initiatives relating to environmental media,industrialormunicipalreleases, products, occupationalexposures, etc.). Blood lead sampling is one of the methods most widely used to assess human risk from exposure to lead. Approximately 30 per cent of OECD countries have reported blood leadmonitoring data for the general population and/or segments of the population at greatest risk.These countries have reduced average blood lead levels for the general population to below 10 \u00b5g/dlbyintroducingeitherafewmeasuresoraconsiderablenumberof initiatives. Data for those Member countries that monitor lead in various media also indicate that the average concentrations of lead in environmental media have declined to below national levels ofconcern. However, some countries have identified releases of lead from point sources and/or thelong-range transport of lead in air as concerns. Others have indicated that, given the recentprogress in reducing lead in air, there are more significant domestic concerns such as lead inimported canned food, lead in drinking water (especially for critical groups such as bottle-fedinfants), orleadindust andchipsfromdeterioratingoldhouseholdpaint. It is suggested that when considering risk reduction strategies for lead, Member countries not already doing so may wish to undertake environmental and blood lead sampling to identifypopulations at highest risk and to evaluate the extent of lead exposure in their general population.Countries may also want to draw on experiences described in the document when developingregulatory and non-regulatory measures to reduce unreasonable risks from exposure. Thesemeasures may include: regulations and standards (for example, on lead in food packaging, lead ingasoline, smelteremissions)aimedat reducingongoingreleasesof leadtoair, water, soil, dust andthe workplace; implementation of cleaner technology (for example, substitution, processmodifications), effective recollection and recovery systems, or environmentally acceptable wastetreatment; abatement activities to reduce risks from exposure to historical sources of release (forexample, deteriorating paint, piping in potable water systems); and voluntary industry productstewardship programmes such as the industry phaseout in some countries of high-risk applications24(forexample, leadinsolderedfoodcansorhouseholdpaints). In addition, consideration should be given to reviewing progress every few years with lead risk reduction strategies. This could include the collection of Member countries' environmental andblood lead monitoring data, as well as of new information on their regulations, criteria, standards ornationalpoliciesregardingexposuretolead.2526EXPOSEDESYNTHESE ont ou sant \u00e9humaine et de l'environnement, susceptibles de o m be n identifiant tendances lors de etencourager l'acquisition et pays de l'OCDE r \u00e9alis\u00e950pour cent de la production mondiale de r premi atteindre un niveau record de 5627millions de tonnes en 1990.

In 1990, world production of lead metal was 5.659million tonnes,valued at over $4.6billion with slightly over 50percent derived from recycled materials. In thatyear OECD countries accounted for 50percent of the world's production of lead in ores andconcentratesandabout64percentoftheworld'smetalproduction( Figure1). Primaryleadmetalproduction(fromoresand concentrates) has remained relatively stable since 1970, although there has been an overall decline in output. Secondary production (from recycled materials) has risen steadily, and surpassed primary output for the first time in 1989 (Figure3). Periodic declines in production often reflect economic downturns, such as the oil crisis in 1975 or the recession of the early 1980s ( Figure 3). During the 1982 recession, primary production was impacted to a lesser degree than secondary production, in part because primarylead is often produced as a by-product or co-product with other metals such as zinc, silver, copperand cadmium. In 1989, 155mines in 35countries produced 2.21million lead inconcentrate, withco-product (copper, zinc, silver)output valuedat overUS$9billion. Lead is among the most recycled non-ferrous metals. As indicated in Figures2 and 3 , secondary production of lead has grown steadily in spite of declining lead prices. This growth canbe attributed to the following factors which, when combined, reflect the favourable economicconditionsassociatedwithrecyclinglead: \u007fLeadretainsitsphysicalandchemicalpropertieswhenrecycled. \u007fThe lead-acid battery is almost entirely recyclable. This includes the polypropylene case and the electrolyte, which can be safely neutralized or processed by moderntechnologiesforuseintheproductionof fertilizersorothersaleableproducts. \u007fThe battery's dominance is growing as the main end use for lead. In addition, the battery has a somewhat predictable life span and contains a high proportion of lead(estimated to average 50percent of the automobile battery's weight or about 8kg oflead). \u007fLead applications are used worldwide. Scrap lead is a readily accessible renewable resource which countries without lead mines can easily obtain. For example, ECcountries produce very little lead in ores and concentrates, but virtually all of themhavesecondaryleadmetalprocessingfacilities. \u007fThe energy required for producing lead from recycled scrap is lower than that required for primary production. However, because of its co-product nature, primary lead is44already produced with a relatively low energy consumption in comparison with other metals. 45 46\u007fThe recycling rate of lead-acid batteries has increased in most countries, reaching an estimated 98percent in the United States in 1990. The increase in the recycling rateis largely due to market factors, but also to joint action by industry and government inrecent yearstoincreaserecycling(BCI, 1992). 1.2 Processingandtechnology Lead metal is produced through a series of process stages. The number of stages required to produce metal is dependent on the type of feed material (i.e. mined ore or scrapmaterial). Lead-bearing ores must first be mined and then concentrated before being smelted andrefined into lead and lead alloys. Prior to smelting and refining of lead-bearing scrap (batteries), thebattery cases must be broken and the acid, plastic/ebonite and lead components separated. Thelead content of some scrap, such as lead sheet, pipe or boat keels, is high enough to allow it to bedirectlyrefinedorremeltedforreuse. 1.2.1 Miningandconcentrating The common minerals in lead (PbCO 3) found with other sulphide ores -- most frequently those of zinc, copper and silver. Ore bodies near the surface are mined by open-pitmethods, while those that occur at depth must be extracted. Ore is first drilled, then blasted,crushed and carried by trucks and/or conveyors to a mill. There the metal-bearing sulphides arefinelyground, separatedbyfrothflotationfromwaste(ironandmineralsthat arenot metal-bearing),and concentrated into separator bulk lead, zinc and copper concentrates. The concentrates areoften dried to a specific moisture content, then shipped for smelting. The lead content inconcentrate typically ranges from 50-70percent. The waste material (tailings) is carried in slurryform for use as back-fill in the mine or for disposal in an on-site tailings pond where particulatemattersettlesout andtheeffluent canbemonitoredand/ortreatedif necessary. Methods to minimize the risk of dusting or spillage of concentrates and tailings can involve ensuring that materials are moist and non-dusting, that the mechanical design of handling systemsis used to minimize spillage and permit clean-up, and that old tailings sites can be rehabilitatedthrough options such as flooding, covering with topsoil and/or vegetation, or converting towetlands/wetcovers. 1.2.2 Smeltingandrefining Lead-bearing concentrates or scrap must be metallurgically treated to separate lead metal from various impurities, such as sulphur and silicate minerals in concentrates, or sulphates, oxidesandothermetalsinscrap. To extract lead from concentrates requires the conversion of lead sulphide into lead oxide, and then the reduction of the oxide to metallic lead (bullion). The two traditional methods are theImperial Smelting Process (ISP), which simultaneously processes lead and zinc ores and isenergy-intensive, or the sinter and blast furnace process, which will be discussed further as it is themost commonly used method at present. Newer, more efficient direct-smelting technologies have47beendevelopedandimplementedinrecent years. 1.2.3 Theconventionalsinterandblastfurnaceprocess Concentrates are often pelletized to increase porosity. Then heat and oxygen are applied to drive off the sulphur, as SO2, leaving a sinter of lead metal, lead oxide and other metal oxides or silicates. The SO2off-gas is blown through a cooling and dust collection system before going to an adjacent plant, where it can be used to make sulphuric acid or other sulphur products. Lead oxideis then reduced to metallic lead (bullion) in a blast furnace, while silicates and other impurities formaresidualproduct calledslag. Lead recoveries in modern blast furnaces range from 97to 99percent of the lead content in the feed (SRI, 1983). Some operations recover additional metal from the slag by passing itthrough a fuming furnace to oxidize and drive off lead and zinc, which can then be collected in theform of flue dust. The molten slag is tapped from the furnaces. It is either granulated and vitrified,by being subjected to a water spray, or cooled and solidified slowly by the air. The slag can thenbe stored in piles either on-site or in a designated landfill site, or it can be used for constructionpurposes such as in block form as rip rap for dams. Where slag is used in construction,leachability must be considered. Flue dusts are usually recycled back through the smeltingprocess. 1.2.4 Thedirectsmeltingprocess The direct smelting process skips the sintering stage described above. Within a single furnace/chamber it uses the exothermic sulphide-roasting reactions, with air to provide the heatrequirements to convert PbS to PbO and then produce lead bullion and slag (SRI, 1983). Thismethod has the potential to provide a cleaner working environment by reducing the possibility forvagrant emissions of lead oxide (fume). The SO 2off-gas, dusts and slag are collected and treated inthesamemannerasdescribedforthesinter-blastfurnaceprocess. The evolving processes are the Kivcet (Russian design), Isasmelt (Australian), QSL (German) and TBRC/Kaldo (Swedish). There is also the Outokumpu Oy (Finnish) process, whichhasnot yet beenconstructedonacommercialscaleforlead. 1.2.5 Refining Lead bullion from the smelting stage is refined to remove remaining impurities and traces of other metallic elements, including precious metals, either by the electrolytic or pyrometallurgicalprocess. In electrolytic refining the lead bullion is cast at the smelter into plates weighing severalhundred kilograms, which serve as anodes. Thin sheets of pure lead are inserted into electrolytictanks with the anodes to act as cathodes. The continuous application of electricity in the solutiondissolves the anodes, while the pure lead is deposited on the cathodes. Impurities such asprecious metals that settle in the tank are removed for further processing. The refined lead, up to99.999percent purity, isthencast intoslabs, calledpigs, formarket. Pyrometallurgical refining is carried out in a series of large covered or semi-covered kettles. The molten lead is transferred from one kettle to the other by pumping, or by ladle and48crane, and each impurity or precious metal is progressively removed from the lead. Some secondary and primary lead producers may also choose to remove or add various metals toproduce alloys. The techniques vary with the types of impurities and by-product metals containedin the molten lead. Selective reagents are added to the lead under carefully controlledtemperatures, and the different drosses, containing impurities, that collect on the surface areskimmed off. When all impurities have been removed or the proper alloy is obtained, the leadmetal or alloy is cast into pigs. In most cases, drosses are processed to remove precious andothernon-ferrousmetals. 1.3 Demandandenduses Lead is a dense, bluish-white metal whose physical and chemical properties find application in the manufacturing, construction and chemical industries. It is easily shaped and haslongbeenprizedfor itsmalleabilityandductility. Some experts believe that lead was used in Egypt as early as 5000B.C. for pottery glazes. The oldest archaeological evidence of lead use may be a figurine found in the Dardenelles(Asia Minor), dating from around 3800 B.C. Lead was also used in China around 2000 B.C. incoins. It was mined in Greece from around 1200 B.C. and used in coins, ornaments, missiles forslings, and many other articles. The best known use of lead in ancient times is probably as pipinginRomanwatersystems. Since 1970, the world demand for lead has increased by 25percent to a record level of 5.627million tonnes in 1990. OECD countries accounted for 65percent of world demand in 1990,with the Central and Eastern European countries consuming 21percent ( Figure4). Asia is now the third largest and fastest-growing lead-consuming region. During the last two decades, Asiandemand for lead increased by a factor of 6 and now accounts for 9percent of world demand. Theincreaselargelyreflectstherapidpaceof economicgrowthinthisregion. The International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) collects annual statistics for lead demand by eight broad categories: batteries, gasoline additives, rolled and extruded products,alloys, pigments and compounds, cable sheathing, shot and ammunition, and miscellaneousproducts. ThesedataarethemostcomprehensiveforOECDcountries. Figure 5gives a breakdown of lead demand in OECD countries in 1970 and 1990 by end use categories. Over this period, demand in OECD countries increased by 10percent, with thebattery sector recording the greatest growth and accounting for 63percent of demand in 1990.During the same period, demand significantly declined for lead in gasoline, alloys and cablesheathing. Health and environment concerns were largely responsible for the decline in the use oflead in gasoline and in certain alloys (for example, lead solders for potable water systems).However, most of the decline largely reflects changes in technology and market-drivenrequirementsforlighter, morecost-competitiveandefficient products. Detailed trends in end use demand in OECD countries by broad category are shown in Figures 6-16 . The data were assembled by the Lead Development Association (LDA) from information provided by industry in various regions. The following sections briefly describe endusesandtrendsbybroadcategory.49 501.3.1 Batteries Since 1970, the battery sector's demand for lead has increased by 79percent to 2.12milliontonnesin1990. Figure 6shows how lead demand has steadily increased over the last 20years for all types of lead-acid batteries: starting, lighting and ignition (SLI), electric vehicle,industrial, andsmallconsumerproducts. SLI batteries, which are used in cars, trucks, buses, etc., accounted for 78percent of the battery market in 1990. Batteries to power electric vehicles, such as fork lift trucks, airport groundsupport vehicles, delivery vans and golf carts, were the second largest category at 14percent.The third largest category was industrial batteries, such as those used as stand-by power toprovide uninterruptible electrical energy supplies for telephone exchanges, public buildings,hospitals, submarinesandvariousindustries. 1 Lead oxides and alloys with antimony, calcium, etc., are used in the production of battery components such as paste, grids and posts. Other battery components include plastic or ebonitecases, separators and electrolyte (sulphuric acid). All components can be easily separated andeither recycled, reused or safely disposed. Technology is available not only to neutralize the acids,but also to convert the sulphur for use in fertilizer or detergent products. The extent of applicationdepends, of course, ontheavailabilityof marketsfortheseproducts. 1.3.2 Gasolineadditives Lead tetraethyl and tetramethyl gasoline additives improve engine performance. Their economic efficiency resulted in their wide use throughout the world. The demand for lead for theproduction of gasoline additives in OECD countries peaked during the early 1970s at340000tonnes, but declined to about 72000 tonnes in 1990 ( Figure 7). The decline in demand occurredintwophases, thefirst of whichfollowedthe introduction of unleaded fuel for vehicles withcatalytic convertors. During the 1970s, governments (largely North American) required catalyticconvertors on new vehicles in order to reduce SO 2,N O2and other gas emissions. Unleaded gas was developed for these vehicles, as lead caused adverse effects to the exhaust emission controlsystems. The second phase began in the late 1970s and early 1980s when governments reducedthe allowable level of lead in gasoline because of concern that lead compounds discharged into theair along with motor vehicle exhaust gases constituted an unreasonable risk to human health andtheenvironment. 1.3.3 Rolledandextrudedproducts Lead's softness and ability to be alloyed with other metals allow it to be rolled into sheets (largely for construction purposes such as roofing, damp-proof courses at the base of walls, andcames for stained glass and leaded windows) or to be extruded to form pipes for carrying water or 1Industrial batteries can also be used by electric utility companies for load levelling purposes. The battery provides additional electricity during peak power usage periods of the day and is recharged during periods of low electricaldemand, usually at night. Load levelling provides utility companies with the flexibility to meet new demand, withoutincreasingcapacitybybuildingnewgeneratingfacilitiesorexpandingexistingones.51chemicals.52 53The properties identified above also permit lead to be used for some packaging materials, suchascollapsibletubesfor containing corrosive substances (for example, glues) or for wine bottlecapsules, auseinrapiddeclineat thistime. The sound and radiation attenuation properties of lead, as well as its corrosion-resistant nature, lend it to use either alone or in the form of sheets bonded to plywood, steel or othermaterial for shielding in X-ray rooms, small isotope containers, enclosures containing noisesources, andliningsforreactionvesselsandlaboratorysurfaces, tonameafew. Leadusedinthewaysidentifiedaboveisretrievableandcaneasily be recycled at the end of product life. The demand for lead in construction, shielding and sound proofing materials hasgrown, while its use in all other rolled and extruded products has declined ( Figures8 and9 ). Although this decline is largely attributed to the introduction of pliable, chemical-resistant and morecost-effective plastic substitutes, the sharp decline of lead use in piping is also attributed to healthconcerns associated with the presence of lead in potable water systems. The reduction in theamount of lead used for wine bottle capsules during the late 1980s reflects concerns over leadtoxicity, and also an increase in the use of plastic substitutes as an industry measure to reducecosts. 1.3.4 Alloys Lead is easily alloyed with tin, antimony, copper or zinc for use in solders and bearings, or in the production of brass and bronze. There are a variety of applications, as shown in Figures10 and11, that will not be described as they are essentially self-explanatory with the exception of terne plate. Terne plate refers to a process whereby a lead/tin alloy (about 50percent lead) isused as a corrosion-resistant coating on items such as car fuel tanks and stainless steel roofingmaterials. The use of lead is declining for the majority of applications in this category, with the exception of terne plating and electronics. The computer and electronic gadget boom of the 1970sand1980shasresultedingrowthintheuseof leadsoldersforelectricalconnections. Because of health concerns, the use of lead in plumbing solder in drinking water systems has been restricted. These solders are now largely used to join pipes in central heating systems.The use of lead solder for food cans has also been declining because of health-related concerns.However, the demand for lead in the remaining applications has largely declined because of cost-cutting and technological changes: for example, aluminium radiators have replaced lead solderedcopperradiatorsinsomecarsbecausetheyarelighterinweight. Exposure concerns associated with electronic applications relate more to the disposal of components than to their use. In general, electronic scrap represents a valuable source of manybase and precious metals, and there is an economic incentive for appropriate recovery processes.Certain primary copper smelters that process complex concentrates also recover precious andbasemetals, includinglead, fromscrapelectroniccomponents.54 55 56 571.3.5 Pigmentsandothercompounds Lead pigments are used in glass to improve the refractive index in crystal, which contains up to 36percent lead, or optical instruments (for example, binoculars, microscopes, telescopes,etc.). Lead is also added to glass to prevent exposure to harmful radiation from televisions,computers, video game screens and other cathode ray tubes. In addition, lead-containing glass is also used to provide a seal between metal and glass in fluorescent lamps and light bulbs. Figure12 indicates that lead demand for glass has remained stable for most applications, with the exceptionof cathoderaytubeswherethegrowthinusagereflectstheincreaseindemandforvideoandcomputerterminals. Lead pigments and compounds are used in ceramic glazes or as a component of ceramic products (for example, tiles, foodware, insulators, capacitors and other electrical materials). Thedemand for inorganic lead compounds added to glazes, for appearance or for scratch- andcorrosion-resistant purposes, peaked in 1980 and has since dropped. The demand for inorganiclead compounds used under glazes to give colour and/or durability to ceramic products has beendecliningslowlyasaresult of technologicalchanges. Inorganic lead compounds are also used to give colour and/or corrosion resistance to paints. The greatest decline in the use of inorganic lead compounds has occurred in householdpaints. Most OECD countries no longer permit their use in such paints because of health concernsregarding exposures to lead due to the deterioration of the paint and wall surfaces. Since 1970,theuseof lead in paints in OECD countries has declined by a factor of 4, to 15700tonnes in 1990. Most leaded paint is used today for exterior purposes such as road markings, or as a corrosion inhibitor onironor galvanizedsteel. Inorganic and organic lead compounds are also added to plastic (mainly polyvinyl chloride -- PVC) as a stabilizer, to prevent degradation caused by heat during processing or ultra-violet lightduring use. The demand for lead in plastics increased by 70percent during the 1970s and hassince been relatively stable at about 80000tonnes peryear. Lead-stabilized PVC is mainly usedfor cable jacketing, conduits, and other building applications such as siding, rainwater-resistantproducts, windowframingandgeneraltrim. Extensiveuse is also made of PVC for a wide range ofpiping and fittings. Without stabilizers, the life of PVC products is inadequate for most applicationsinvolving exposure to sunlight and weathering. There has been some concern over the use of leadstabilizers in small bore PVC water pipes. As a precautionary measure, alternative stabilizers suchas organotin, barium or zinc compounds are available for some applications; however, some ofthesemayalsoraisehealthconcerns. Lead compounds have been used for medicinal purposes and in cosmetics (as a hair darkeneroraneyebrightener)withincertainpopulations. However, theseareunreporteduses. 1.3.6 Cablesheathing Lead can be extruded into a continuous covering to prevent water penetration of undergroundorunderwaterpowerandtelecommunicationscables. Althoughthisuse is recyclable,its demand has been declining because of the development of alternate technologies that replacepaper-insulated lead cables with polyethylene and PVC. Since 1970, the use of lead for cablesheathing has declined by a factor of 2.5, to 153800tonnes in 1990 ( Figure14 ). The remaining market is largely for marine cables. Scrapped cable is usually recycled to recover the lead in58sheathing, aswellasthecopperconductor. 591.3.7 Shot andammunition Lead is formed into spherical lead shot to be used as ammunition, or added to certain steel alloys (steelmaking shot) to improve the steel machinability. Figure15 shows that the demand for both steelmaking shot and ammunition declined in 1980 in response to the economicdownturn. The demand for lead in steel shot continued to slide because of technological changes,whileammunitiondemandrecovered. Concernshavearisenregarding the ingestion of used ammunition shot by water fowl, as it can be picked up from sediment in wetlands, and also as a result of the leachability of lead shot inacidic soil conditions. Some countries restrict the use of lead in such locations. Iron shot isconsidered an alternative, but it has an inferior performance and higher cost. It also increases thewear on gun barrels. Due to its sparking characteristics, iron shot can present a fire risk in certainsituations. 1.3.8 Miscellaneoususes Lead can be cast in a variety of forms for products such as yacht keels, and for counterbalance, curtain weights and fishing sinkers, to name a few. Figure 16 shows a fluctuating trendindemandforleadintheseproducts,whichreflectseconomic cycles that can be linked to the1975oilcrisisandtherecessionof theearly1980s. The use of lead weights for balancing vehicle wheels has increased along with the increaseinthenumberof vehiclesworldwide. Lead-tin-antimony alloys are sometimes cast into moveable pieces or lines for typesetting in letterpress printing. This use has been declining steadily due to both technological changes andhealthconcerns. Thin layers of lead can be electrically plated on to steel items for corrosion resistance. Thisrepresentsaverysmallbut stabledemandforlead. Leadcanberecoveredfrommanyoftheseusesthrough the scrap steel recycling system, orthroughthesecondaryleadsystem. Lead is also used in the manufacturing processes of other products. In galvanizing, a layer of molten lead is used in the bottom of a molten zinc bath to assist the separation of dross(impurities) as zinc coatings are applied to steel for corrosion resistance. Baths of molten lead arealso used in annealing processes for quenching (controlled cooling) of steel products (notably wire)duringmanufacturing. Leadisreusedintheseprocesses. Demandhasbeen small but stable overthelast20years.60 611.3.9 Newuses New applications are being developed for lead and lead compounds in microelectronics and superconductors, as an antioxidant in asphalt to prolong the life of road paving, in earthquakedamping materials, in radon gas shielding, in nuclear waste containment receptacles, in advancedlead-acid batteries for electric vehicles, in specialized lead-acid batteries for remote area powersupply systems coupled to solar and wind power generators, in a new power generation deviceusing liquid metal magneto-hydrodynamics (LMMHD), and in load levelling batteries for use inmasstransitsystems(forexample,toboostpowerduringperiodsofpeakdemand). These applications use the unique chemical, electrical and physical properties of lead. Industry has acknowledged that risk analyses should accompany the introduction of new products,andthat recyclingandreuseconceptsshouldbedevelopedwhereappropriate. 1.3.10 Stockpiling/storage Stockpiles of lead are maintained for strategic defence purposes in the United States. This is because of the widespread use of lead in many defence-related products and technologies. Stockpiles may contain refined lead, lead alloys, and/or scrap lead. In 1990, the US federal defencestockpilecontained545000tonnesagainst agoalof 998000tonnes. Lead producers and consumers maintain operating stocks to meet normal commercial requirements and to safeguard against any short-term disruption in production or supply. Stocksare also held in warehouses approved by the London Metal Exchange (LME). At the end of 1990,reported commercial stocks held in countries other than the Central and Eastern Europeancountriestotalled438000tonnes. 1.4 Worldmarketsandtrade Daily prices for lead are based on international market factors, as it is produced, traded and consumed worldwide. Regionally, Europe and Japan are the largest importers of leadconcentrates and Europe is the major importer of lead bullion and refined lead. Australia, Canadaand Peru are principal suppliers of both lead concentrates and lead metal, while Mexico is also amajorexporterof refinedlead. The balance between supply and demand is usually reflected in stock levels. As stocks rise, the price of lead generally falls and vice-versa ( Figure17 ). Daily prices of refined lead are set by the London Metal Exchange (LME) for both prompt and forward trading. They are widelyaccepted as the basis of sales by producers to consumers, subject to transport costs, tariffs andothertradingexpenses. 1.5 Disposal(recycling,incineration,landfill) Environmental releases of lead can be natural in origin (for example, crustal weathering, volcanism) or can occur from anthropogenic sources relating to industrial activity, power generation(coalandoilburning), andtheuseanddisposalof consumerproducts.62 63Industrial releases (i.e. emissions, effluent and solid waste) are usually regulated within OECD countries. Post-consumer wastes containing lead may be regulated, depending on theproduct's hazard classification and/or its destination (i.e. recycling/recovery, final disposal,internationaltrade). 1.5.1 Recycling Lead is one of the most recycled non-ferrous metals in the world. Annual production from recycled materials (i.e. secondary lead) has risen steadily. It exceeded primary output for the firsttime in 1989 (Figure3). Factors that influence lead recycling include: type of product, historicaldemand levels, product life span, collection system infrastructure (including transportation),international trade, scrap separation and processing technologies, prices of scrap lead comparedwith lead metal, currency exchange rates, environmental regulations, and the return of spentproductsbyconsumers. Technology is available to recover lead as well as other metals and materials (for example, plastics) from lead-bearing residues and waste. Lead-bearing feed for recycling can varyfrom industrial scrap (for example, plating or chemical solution/sludge, baghouse dusts, refiningdrosses, dirt residues from fragmentizer plants used for shredding steel cars, domestic appliances,etc.) to remediation and abatement wastes such as lead paint removal debris, lead-contaminatedsoil, and firing range soils. Post-consumer product scrap constitutes more than 80percent of thescrap supply for recycling (for example, batteries, cable sheathing, radiation and sound attenuationmaterials, sheeting, crystal glass, wheel weights, and electronic equipment, which also containspreciousmetals), withbatteriesaccountingforupto90percent of thisamount inagivenyear. Recycling rates are usually stated for batteries, as they account for over 60percent of world demand for lead. As for other recyclable lead products, recycling rates are not usuallyavailable since they tend to have variable life spans, which makes it difficult to determine theamount of material available for recycling in a given year. Table1.1 shows battery recycling rates insomeOECDcountries. Battery recycling rates are determined by comparing the amount of lead recycled from batteries with the quantity available for recycling, in a given year. Recycling facilities can usuallyprovide data on the amount of lead produced from scrapped batteries. However, the amount oflead available for recycling is largely influenced by the battery's life span. Therefore, to determinethe amount of lead available from batteries for recycling in a given year requires historical data onbattery production and average lead content, as well as import and export data on new batteriesand vehicles containing batteries. Also required are current data on the lead content of batteries inscrapped vehicles and import/export data on scrap lead, scrap batteries, and scrapped vehiclescontaining batteries. Methods of calculating recycling rates may vary by country, according toavailabledata. It should be noted that the average lead content in batteries has decreased over time because of technology changes. The life span can also vary depending on climatic conditions andenergy demand requirements (for example, air conditioning, heaters). The average battery life forpassengervehiclesisestimatedat fouryearsintheUnitedStatesandthreeyearsinJapan.64Table1.1 BatteryRecyclingRatesinSomeOECDCountries 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 Australia >90 Belgium 77 Canada 93 France 80 90 90 GermanyFR 83 >95 Italy 83 Japan 93.3 92.5 88.6 91.0 95.3 97.8 * There are no lead recycling facilities in Norway. Scrap batteries are collected and then exportedtoothercountriesforrecycling. e = estimated. Note:Methods used to determine recycling rates may vary by country. Recycling rates canexceed100percentwhenstoredorstockpiledbatteriesarereturned. Sources: Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, Australia, 1992; Energy, Mines and Resources, Canada, 1992; Federal Environment Agency, Germany, 1992;State Pollution Control Authority, Norway, 1992; National Chemicals Inspectorate (KEMI),Sweden, 1992; US Bureau of Mines, 1992; US Department of Commerce, 1992; ILZSG,1991b; BatteryCouncilInternational(BCI), 1992.65As indicated in Table 1.1, battery recycling rates are high in many countries. This is largely because of the favourable economics associated with recycling batteries. However, it hasbecome apparent that the weakest link in the recycling chain is usually the consumer who discardsa used battery rather than returning it for recycling. In a number of countries, governments areworking with industry to increase recycling by focusing on the battery life cycle and persuading theconsumer to return used batteries. Initiatives include: mandatory take-back requirements forretailers and manufacturers; requirement of a cash deposit if an old battery is not returned when anewoneispurchased; asmall tax on new replacement batteries that can be used to offset the costof transporting used batteries from remote regions; or a deposit/refund scheme by whichconsumers pay a deposit when purchasing a battery and are reimbursed when it is returned. Itshould be noted that the latter scheme could stimulate vehicle battery thefts if the cashdeposit/refundwereset toohigh. 1.5.2 Incineration/Landfill When industrial solid wastes and post-consumer that contain lead are not recycledorreused, theyaregenerallydisposedof inlandfillsorincinerators. Lead-bearing solid wastes from mineral and metal processing facilities that are not recycled (for example, mine tailings and smelter slag) are either reused, like tailings for back-fill inunderground mine workings and slag in various construction applications, or disposed of in tailingsimpoundment or landfill sites where effluent can be monitored and treated if necessary. A fewfacilities are permitted to discharge tailings or granulated vitrified slag to water systems, where theimpact is considered to be minimized because of leachate characteristics, dilution factors, or thesomewhat anaerobicenvironment that existsat depth. Most industrial solid wastes from the manufacturing of lead-bearing products or the recycling of steel products are reused or recycled. Examples are drosses, bag house dusts andbags, pasting belts, lead-bearing oil and hydraulic fluids, pesticides, floor sweepings, disposableclothing, andrespiratorycartridgefilters. Without detailed sampling or monitoring data, it is difficult to assess accurately the composition and volume of post-consumer products disposed of in landfill or incinerator facilities.Difficultiesinmodellinganalysesoccurbecauseof thevariabilityindemand patterns, life spans andrecyclingratesforproducts, aswellastheoftenincompletenatureof import/export data. The volume and characteristics of lead in post-consumer products destined for final disposal have been estimated in the United States, Norway, France, Sweden and Germany. Amaterial flow analysis for lead-bearing products in the United States estimated that lead discards tomunicipal solid waste sites consist primarily of batteries and consumer electronics products.Batteries were also identified by a materials flow analysis as the main source of lead in municipalsolid waste in Norway. A study in France concluded that, of the total lead coming from householdrefuse, lead in soldered cans accounted for 35to 41percent of lead discards, with paper productscontributing the second largest amount at about 19percent. Sweden has estimated that non-hazardous waste from households contains just under 2000tonnes of lead per year, of whichabout half goes to waste incineration with the rest destined for landfill. In Germany, the amount ofleadindomesticandindustrialwastestreamsisdeclining.66Waste management methods can vary by country and region, depending on land mass and population density. In some countries, the trend towards incineration is increasing as existinglandfillfacilitiesreachcapacityandlandavailabilityfor newsitesbecomeslimited. The main concern in regard to the presence of lead in landfills is the potential for the lead to leach and contaminate drinking water supplies. Since elemental lead and lead compounds arestable, health concerns are minimal for a properly managed landfill with runoff and leachatecontrols(USEPA, 1992). Although incineration is generally more costly than landfills, it minimizes land use requirements by reducing waste volumes up to 90percent and often provides some revenue fromenergy recovery (for example, steam for heat or electricity generation). Lead emissions are theprimaryconcerninregardtotheincinerationof lead-bearingmaterials. With the proper technology,however, lead emissions from combustible and non-combustible components of municipal solidwaste can be controlled with 99percent or greater efficiency (US EPA, 1992). Though theatmospheric dispersion of lead from incineration can be significantly reduced, the lead captured byemissions control devices and the lead remaining in ashes must be disposed of properly, usually inlandfills(USEPA, 1992).6768GENERALREFERENCES(CHAPTER1) BCI (Battery Council International) (1992). 1990 National Recycling Rate Study for the United States.

NaturalSources Lead has been present on earth for all of geological time. It occurs naturally in the earth's crust at average levels of 5-50\u00b5g/g (US EPA, 1989). In the natural cycle, lead is released to theearth's surface through a variety of processes which include weathering of rocks, volcanic activity,and uptake and subsequent release by plants. Other natural sources include sea sprays,windblown dusts, and wild forest fires (Nriagu, 1978a,b). The weathering of rocks releases lead tosoils and aquatic systems. This process plays a significant role in the global lead cycle, but onlyrarely results in elevated concentrations in any environmental compartment. Soils derived fromcarboniferous black shales are an exception, as they can contain up to 200\u00b5g lead/g (Hawkes andWebb, 1962). Similarly, non-ferrousorebodies which contain lead can contaminate adjacent watercoursesandsoils. The US National Research Council (NRC, 1980) estimated the natural concentrations of lead in air, soil, water and food in the United States ( Table2.1 ). Such an exercise is extremely difficult, however, and estimates, often based on concentrations measured in remote ares, aredifficult to validate. The effect of a long environmental residence time, combined with the fact thatman has been mining and processing lead for thousands of years, is that concentrations of leadmeasured in remote areas do not necessarily reflect natural concentrations and may well include acomponent of 5-25\u00b5g/g - Inhabited 5-25\u00b5g/g Water - Fresh 0.005-10\u00b5g/l - Marine 0.001\u00b5g/l Food 0.0001-0.1\u00b5g/g71Source: NRC, 1980. 2.1.2 AnthropogenicSourcesHuman activities remove lead from the earth's crust and transfer it to environmental media, where its potential for resulting in both human and ecosystem exposure is greatly increased(Figure18 ). While uses of lead have been known since ancient times, industrialization has vastly accelerated its transport into human and environmental exposure pathways. Lead is released intothe environment during the mining and smelting of its ores, the production, use, recycling anddisposal of lead-containing products, and the burning of fossil fuels and wood (Royal CommissiononEnvironmentalPollution, 1983). Estimates of the dispersal of lead emissions into the environment indicate that the atmosphere is the major initial recipient. The development of lead fuel additives in the 1920s andthe increasing use of the automobile greatly escalated the rate at which lead was released to theatmosphere. The amount of lead emitted from this source has, of course, now greatly decreased.Mobile and stationary sources of lead emissions tend to be concentrated in areas of highpopulation density and near smelters. From these emission sources, lead moves through theatmosphere to various compartments of the environment. It is deposited on soil, surface watersandplantsandthusisincorporatedintothefoodchainof animalsandman. 2.2 LeadintheAtmosphere Humans are exposed directly through inhalation of lead emitted into the air. Importantly, air also acts to transport lead into other human exposure media, including dust, soil, food andwater. Deposited lead can be re-entrained into air with wind-blown dust. Most atmospheric lead isfrom anthropogenic emissions. The most recent worldwide estimates of anthropogenic emissionsof lead to the atmosphere are for 1983 (Nriagu and Pacyna, 1988). These are shown in Table2.2 . The authors based their estimates on a review of emissions studies in the United States, Western Europe, CanadaandtheformerSoviet Unionforvarioussources. The emissions are given as plausible ranges, due to the considerable difficulties of estimation. While these figures provide an overall global perspective, it must be borne in mind thatconsiderable regional and local variation will occur, reflecting factors such as the locations of majorindustrialpoint sourcesandtheconsumptionof leadedgasoline. By far the largest source category is \"mobile source\", reflecting leaded gasoline consumption. Automobiles are the primary mobile source of lead in air (several reports suggestthey are responsible for as much as 90percent), although trains, boats, farm vehicles andaeroplanes can also be important mobile sources (Nriagu, 1978b). The majority of lead emissionsoccur following the combustion of leaded gasoline in the engine, although some lead is alsoreleased with gasoline vapours during refueling. Current (1992) estimates for such emissionswould be considerably lower given the reduction in the use of tetraethyl-lead that has occurredsince1983(refertothetable). Air emissions from smelters, processing facilities and solid waste incinerators occur as controlled releases from stacks and fugitive releases from storage, processing or materialshandling. Although worldwide it has been estimated that the non-ferrous metal industry is the72secondlargest leademitter, therearelikelytobelargeregionalandnaturaldifferences.73 74Levels of airborne lead are strongly reflective of the distance from local sources, since atmosphericdispersalprocessesrapidlydilutetheleadcompoundsastheyarecarrieddownwindfrom the source. These follow a general sequence of being highest adjacent to a major sourcesuch as a highway or smelter, with concentrations lower at rural locations and lowest at remotemarinelocations. Cautionisrequiredwheninterpretingindividual short-term measurements of leadin air, as these may grossly misrepresent the long-term picture. For this reason, and because thehuman physiological response to lead is on a time scale of weeks or longer rather than hours,regulatory standards for lead in ambient air are set in terms of annual average (EC) or quarterlyaverage(USEPA)concentrations. These standards are 2.0\u00b5g/m 3and 1.5\u00b5g/m3,respectively, and havebeeninexistencesince1982(EC)and1978(USEPA). Atmospheric lead levels in remote continental areas fall in the range of 0.1-10 \u00b5g/m3. Marine atmospheres generally contain less lead than continental air. Concentrations of lead in urban air in various OECD countries in the 1970s ranged from 0.5\u00b5g/m3up to 10 \u00b5g/m3in densely trafficked inner cities (Nriagu, 1978b). However, restrictions on lead levels in gasoline imposed since that time in many countries have markedly decreased automotive emissions of lead into theatmosphere. Theair leadlevelspresentlyfoundin European and North American cities are in the range of 0.2-0.8\u00b5g/m 3, and in rural areas usually in the range of 0.05-0.3\u00b5g/m3. However, the general population spend much of their time inside buildings. Concentrations of lead in indoor air aregenerally much lower than those outdoors, a typical ratio being around 60percent (Davies et al.,1987) for sites influenced predominantly by automotive lead. Sites adjacent to industrial leademittersmayshowdifferent ratiosduetoadifferingparticlesizedistributionforlead. Despite declines in general atmospheric concentrations of lead in some countries, areas of higher concentrations still exist due to the presence of local sources. In the UK, concentrationsof lead in ambient air near smelters have been reported to average 0.4-0.8\u00b5g/m 3(Carroll, 1987) and 2.2-6.0\u00b5g/m3(Reed, 1987). In 1980, air lead concentrations in a smelter town in Yugoslavia were as high as 21.3to 29.2\u00b5g/m3. Pollution control measures were installed at the smelter in 1985, but concentrations around the smelter were still as high as 12.8\u00b5g/m3after these controls wereput intoplace(Grazianoet al., 1990). ParticleSizeDistributionandChemicalFormsofLeadinAir: Industrialleademissions and the major proportion of automotive emissions are in the form of particlesof inorganiccompoundsof lead. These particles have very small dimensions, but coverarangeof sizeswhichconferdifferent propertiesuponthem. Primary vehicle exhaust lead comprises particles of around 0.015\u00b5m in diameter, and may be attached to particles of carbon of similar dimensions (Chamberlain et al., 1979). Particlesof this size very rapidly combine with other particles. When they have grown to around 0.1to1.0\u00b5m, they cease to grow and can have an atmospheric lifetime of around seven to 24days.Particles arising from industrial process emissions cover a variety of sizes, dependant largely uponthe nature of the control devices employed. Sizes of 0.1-5.0\u00b5m are typical (Bennett and Knapp,1989). Lead from other sources, such as windblown road dust and fugitive losses from stockpiles,are substantially larger in size, typically 5-50\u00b5m. Particles of 10\u00b5m and larger are subject torather rapid settling due to gravity and have a very short atmospheric lifetime, and thus range estimates for such emissions would be considerably lower given the reduction in theuseoftetraethylleadthat hasoccurredsince1983. AccordingtotheInternationalLeadandZincStudyGroup, worldwide(excludingEconomiesinTransitionandChina) useof lead in the productionof tetraethyl lead had declined to 68 000 tonnes in 1992. Approximately 75 per cent of this amountwouldbeemittedtotheatmosphere, withtheremaining25per cent beingdepositedintheengineoilandtailpipe(USEPA,1986). Source:AdaptedfromNriaguandPacyna(1988).76Airborne lead particles can exist in a range of chemical forms, which in turn may influence their environmental properties and toxicity. A water-soluble form will be both more mobile in theenvironment, and more readily absorbed by the human body, than the insoluble form. Automotivelead emissions are mainly in the form of lead bromochloride (Hirschler et al., 1975; Habibi, 1973).This appreciably water-soluble compound is rather rapidly converted in the atmosphere toammonium lead sulphate, a rather less soluble species (Biggin and Harrison, 1979). Thechemistry of industrial emissions depends upon the process in which they arise. Amongstemissions from smelters, oxide and sulphate forms of lead are prevalent (Pacyna, 1987). Theseforms are less water-soluble than automotive emissions, but will become more available throughenvironmentalweatheringprocesses. Leadassociatedwithwindblownores tends to be in the formof sulphides and sulphate (Harrison and Williams, 1982). The former are very insoluble, but canoxidizetothemoresolublesulphateintheenvironment. Depending on the particle size, airborne suspended particles may have a long residence time in the atmosphere. Studies from remote areas indicate that lead-containing particles aretransported over substantial distances, up to thousands of kilometres, by general weather systems. Murozumi et al. (1969) and Boutron (1982) have found significantly increased lead levels in polar ice and glaciers, resulting from long-range transport of lead-containing airborne particles. Steinneset al. (1987) have demonstrated that lead compounds are enriched in mosses, podzolic soils,ombrotropic peat and other environmental targets in southernmost Norway from deposition of long-rangetransportedatmosphericpollution. Studies of lead in the motorway environment can account for deposition of less than 10percent of emitted lead within 100metres of the road (Wiffen, 1977; Harrison et al., 1985). Theremaining 90percent plus escapes local deposition and travels greater distances. Measurementof lead over the North Sea shows average concentrations of 0.005-0.09\u00b5g/m 3(Harrison and Ottley,1990),onlyalittlebelowtypicalrurallevelsintheUnitedKingdom. Lead may be removed from the atmosphere by either wet or dry deposition. The consequence of the removal is the contamination of surface waters (rivers, lakes and oceans) andsoils. The most efficient clearing system is rain (wet deposition). According to the distance ofatmospheric transport, the transport pattern has been described as \"near fall-out\", \"far fall-out\" and\"airborne\". \"Near fall-out\" is defined as the deposition in the immediate surroundings of theemission sources (roadways, stationary sources). \"Far fall-out\" is defined as that away from theemissionsources, but within the geographic area (20-200km). Small particles which are subject tolong-range atmospheric transport and are ultimately deposited elsewhere are designated as\"airborne\". According to data of Huntzicker et al. (1975) on the distribution of lead emissions frommotor vehicles in the LosAngeles basin, about 55percent of the emitted lead can be attributed tothecategoryof \"nearfall-out\", 10percent to\"farfall-out\"and35percent to\"airborne\". In rural areas of Europe and North America, the annual deposition rates (wet and dry) are typically in the range of 20-80\u00b5g/m 2/day. Although there are very few data available, it appears that in less industrialized areas of the world the lead deposition rates are considerably lower. InGreenland and the Antarctic, values below 1\u00b5g/m 2/day have been recorded. In large cities the depositionratesareabout 1.5-10timeshigherthaninruralareas. Trends in concentrations of lead in rainwater are reflective of those for lead in air. In a study in Minnesota, average concentrations of lead in rainwater fell from 29to 4.3\u00b5g/l at an urbansite and from 5.7to 1.5\u00b5g/l at a rural site between 1979 and 1983, correlating closely withdecreased use of lead in gasoline (Eisenreich et al., 1986). Valenta et al. (1986) found between77about 15and about 50\u00b5g lead2+/l rain in the former Federal Republic of Germany, and a wet deposition of about 30\u00b5g lead2+/m2/day in rural regions, 50\u00b5g lead2+/m2/day in urban areas, and 100-150\u00b5g lead2+/m2/day in regions with metallurgical industry, varying with time and having in generaladecreasingtendency. Depositionratesof leadcanbevery high near point sources of the metal. For example, in Wollongong, Australia, a value of 4.7kg/ha/y was measured at a distance of 100m from a coppersmelter by Beavington (1977), while an extremely high deposition rate of 30kg/ha/yr was foundnearaleadworksintheUnitedKingdombyTurneret al. (1980). 2.3 LeadinWater Lead is a natural, usually very minor constituent of surface and ground waters. Nriagu and Pacyna (1988) estimated, for 1983, inputs of 97000-180000 tonnes per year of lead toaquatic ecosystems worldwide from sources such as industrial wastes, effluents from mining,smelting, refining, manufacturing processes, atmospheric fall-out, and dumping of sewage sludge.Atmospheric fall-out represents over half of the total. In this context, it is considered that the totalannual input of lead to aquatic ecosystems has declined since 1983, given the reduction that hasoccurred in lead emissions from mobile sources. It is important to emphasize that point sources ofdischarge, although not of great worldwide importance, may have large local impacts. In contrast,the globally important atmospheric deposition is spread over vast areas of ocean and may havelittlelocalimpact. Lead deposited from the atmosphere can enter aquatic systems through direct fall-out or througherosionof soilparticles. Ingeneral, thereislittlecorrelationbetweenleadconcentrationsinrain and snow and concentrations in streams that drain watersheds. Lead tends to be immobilizedby the organic component in soil and remains bound to the soil, thus inhibiting migration togroundwater. Lead entering a river is rather rapidly transported to the sea. In the course of downstream dispersion, some lead may be removed by transfer to sediments on the river bed. During periodsof high flow, some of this deposited lead may become resuspended and enter the water insuspended solids. Water in lakes and reservoirs is not subject to such energetic processes, andtransferislikelytobesolelyout of thewatercolumn. For marine waters, inputs from rivers, sea outfalls and the atmosphere are dispersed and diluted by mixing with cleaner sea water from deep ocean areas. Lead also tends to precipitate inthe rather alkaline waters of the sea, and will deposit into sediments on the sea bed. In estuarinezones, where freshwater and sea water mix, enhanced precipitation of lead into estuarinesediments, oroccasionallyremovalof sediment tothesea, mayoccur. In general, lead decreases in concentration from rainwater (generally acidic; about 20\u00b5g/l lead) to freshwater (generally neutral; 5\u00b5g/l lead) to sea water (alkaline; below 1\u00b5g/l lead).Inthecourseof this decreasing concentration gradient, lead is removed to bottom sediments whichprovidealong-term sinkinwhichthemetalisstoredinarelativelyunavailableform. Concentrations of lead in rivers are mainly dependant upon local source inputs, as residence times are short. The local geochemistry may also be important. In areas of lead78mineralization, rivers can contain lead concentrations as much as tentimes higher than in unmineralized areas. In areas without lead mineralization, background levels of lead in the watertend to be very low, and normally well below 10\u00b5g/l. When point source inputs of lead enter ariver, downstreamconcentrationsmaybeappreciablyelevated. It is not only the concentration of lead in the effluent which influences the final concentration in the river, but also the relative flow rates of the effluent stream and river and thechemical properties of the receiving water body (for example, water hardness, pH). Point sourceeffluents may have an appreciable impact on water quality. Storm runoff waters, especially fromroadways and other paved areas, may contain appreciable levels of lead in excess of 400\u00b5g/l(Harrison et al., 1985) and these may cause significant incremental pollution of surface waterswheredilutioncapacitiesarelimited. Alexander and Smith (1988) have reported trends in lead concentrations in major rivers in the United States. At about one-third of sites, declines in dissolved lead concentrations werestatistically significant. This was attributed primarily to reduced usage of leaded gasoline. Forexample, the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. showed a decline in dissolved lead from 5to2.5\u00b5g/lbetween1974and1985. Infiltration of rainwater into groundwaters and entry into aquifers normally involve passage through soil. Rainwater can contain appreciable concentrations of lead. These, however, diminishon passage through the soil, as lead binds to soil minerals and humus. Groundwaters thereforenormallycontainverylowconcentrationsof lead, typicallybelow10\u00b5g/l. Coastal waters are subject to appreciable inputs both from rivers and from sources such as sewage sludge dumping, sewage outfalls and atmospheric deposition. Because of limiteddispersal rates, concentrations of lead in coastal waters closely reflect riverine inputs containinglead from areas of mineralization, as well as from industrial, automotive and domestic sources. Ingeneral, seawaterconcentrationsobservedarebelowthoseof riverwaters. Intheremoteocean, seawaterhasnoimmediateaquatic inputs of lead and only a modest input from the atmosphere. Due to very long residence times, suspended solid concentrations areverylow. Forthesereasonsleadconcentrationsareextremelylow, muchlessthan1\u00b5g/l. 2.3.1 Physico-chemicalSpeciation The most important forms of lead in environmental waters are: free and solvated lead ions and ion pairs (highly mobile and available); organic complexes with dissolved humus materials of awide range of molecular sizes (binding is rather strong and limits availability); lead attached tocolloidal particles such as iron oxide (strongly bound and less mobile when available in this formthan as free or solvated ions); and lead attached to solid particles of clay, or to dead remains oforganisms(verylimitedmobilityandavailability). The identification of different physico-chemical species of lead is very difficult and currently an area of much research activity. In acidic waters, lead is more likely to be present asfree or solvated ions and ion pairs, and to be both mobile and available for uptake. In less acidicenvironments, it will tend to form one of the less available species and may precipitate to thebottom of a river, lake or sea. Thus, acidic lead-bearing effluents are normally neutralized or madealkaline before discharge, so as to precipitate the lead and reduce its mobility. Once lead enters a79watercourse, it will progressively adjust its speciation to reflect the conditions of the water (Laxen and Harrison, 1983). Since most surface waters are neutral or alkaline, lead will tend to associatewith less mobile physico-chemical forms. An exception is mine drainage water, which can bestrongly acidic and can sustain high concentrations of dissolved lead. Mine effluent can, however,betreatedbylimeneutralizationtocontrolthedischargeof contaminants. 2.3.2 LeadinDrinkingWater Water for potable supplies is normally derived from surface freshwater or groundwater sources, which in most cases have a lead content of less than 10\u00b5g/l. Water treatment prior todistributiondoesnot normallyaddtothisamount, andusually reduces the lead content (often by asmuchas50percent). IntheUnitedKingdom, it hasbeenconcludedthat nearlyallthe lead in tapwater is derived from sources of contamination in domestic pipes and storage tanks. Mains water is virtually freefrom lead (Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, 1983). Concentrations of lead in UKdrinkingwaterwerethesubject of an extensive survey in 1975-76 (Department of the Environment,1977). This survey revealed higher concentrations in first draw samples than in well flushed,daytime samples. Lead concentrations even in the latter kind of sample were well in excess ofthoseinwaterleavingthetreatment works. Many first draw water samples (i.e water which has stood in the pipe overnight) show concentrations in excess of 50or even 100\u00b5g/l. This problem arises from the leaching of leadfrom the distribution system and domestic pipework and lead-containing fittings and faucets: aprocess known as plumbosolvency (DeMora and Harrison, 1984). It is particularly acute wherelead pipes are used. The most plumbosolvent are soft, acidic waters; these are now treated withlime to neutralize the acidity prior to entering the distribution system. Very hard waters can also beplumbosolvent, and these are dosed with orthophosphate at the treatment works to reduce thesolublilityof lead(SheihamandJackson, 1981). Average lead levels in drinking water in the United States ranged between 10 and 30\u00b5g/l, but the combination of corrosive water (i.e. soft or acidic) and lead pipes or lead soldered joints indistribution systems or houses created localized zones of high lead concentrations up to 380\u00b5g/l(US EPA, 1989c). The combination of new solder and corrosive water can result in even largerconcentrations. 2.4 LeadinSoil In rural and remote areas, lead in soil is derived mainly from natural geological sources and lead concentrations reflect those of the underlying bedrock or transported parent material.Some rocks, such as marine black shales, may contain up to 200\u00b5g/g lead (see Section 2.1).Phosphates can also be particularly rich in lead, with phosphorites containing on average 50 \u00b5g lead/g (Nichelatti, 1992; Altschuler, 1980). Where soils are derived from mineralized rocks, natural concentrationsmayrangefromseveralhundredtoseveralthousand\u00b5g/glead. As lead accumulates in soil, where it is relatively immobile and has a long residence time, present-day amounts of lead in surface soils largely reflect anthropogenic inputs arising from80industrial, urban and agricultural activities. Nriagu and Pacyna (1988) have estimated that the inputs worldwide for 1983 total 479000-1113000tonnes peryear ( Table2.3 ). They show important sources of lead arising from atmospheric fall-out, the disposal of commercial products, flyash from the coal burning power industry, and urban refuse. It is considered that the total annualinput of lead to soils has declined since 1983, given the reduction that has occurred in leademissionsfrommobilesources. Appreciable inputs to land arising from mine tailings and smelter wastes nearly equal all other sources combined. Nriagu and Pacyna (1988) calculated that uniform dispersion over acultivated land area of 16x10 12square metres would result in an application of lead to soil of around 50g/ha/yr. It should be noted that inputs are not uniform, and that lead enhancement insoil is most marked in the vicinity of specific industrial and mining activities and in urban areas.However, such local and regional contamination occurs on a frequent enough basis to make theproblemof soilleadcontaminationof widespreadinterest. Concentrations of lead in soil range widely, depending on the nature of the parent material, land use, and location in relation to deposition from industrial, automobile and urbanemissions. This is illustrated by data compiled for over 1500 agricultural soils from England andWales (Archer and Hodgson, 1987) in which the highest lead contents are in areas contaminatedby historical mining and smelting. Regional patterns of lead in the surface environment have beenclearly shown by published geochemical maps, such as that in the Wolfson Geochemical Atlas ofEngland and Wales (Webb et al., 1978) and a similar German geochemical atlas. Both atlasesfocus on areas with elevated lead levels due to mining, smelting and other industrial activities. InBritain alone it has been estimated that some 4000square miles are affected by historical miningandsmelting(Thornton, 1980). Typical values for \"uncontaminated\" rural soils have been reported as 15-106 \u00b5g/g, with a geometric mean of 42\u00b5g/g in the UK (Davies, 1983) and from 2780soils a geometric mean of48\u00b5g/g in England (McGrath, 1986). In comparison, Holmgren et al. (1983) reported values forover 3000surface soils from cropland in the United States, where the median concentration of leadwas 11\u00b5g lead/g and the mean 18\u00b5g/g. It may be concluded that the relatively high values foundin the United Kingdom compared with those in the United States indicate widespread low-levelcontaminationoverthecenturiesof industrialandmetallurgicalactivity. Several investigations have provided clear evidence of elevated lead concentrations in urbansoilscompared with those in rural and agricultural situations. In the United States, a study ofcity parks (where children are likely to be in contact with soil) recorded soil lead levels of between200and 3300\u00b5g/g (US EPA, 1989). A comprehensive survey of lead in urban garden soils from53 representative towns and city boroughs in the United Kingdom confirmed elevatedconcentrations of lead in surface garden soils, compared with agricultural soils (Culbard et al.,1988). Lead concentrations ranged from 13\u00b5g/g to 14100\u00b5g/g (geometric mean 230\u00b5g/g) inlocations excluding London and areas affected by mining and smelting. In seven Londonboroughs, the mean value was 654\u00b5g/g lead. Garden soils in lead mining villages in Derbyshireranged from 1180to >20 000\u00b5g lead/g (geometric seem to pose aspecial\"geochemicalhotspot\"problemintermsof environmentalexposureof localpopulations. A major mechanism of soil and sediment contamination is atmospheric deposition of lead (Nriagu, 1978a; Nriagu and Pacyna, 1988). The concentration of lead in soils near highways isrelated to traffic density, local meteorological conditions, vegetation and topography. In general,lead concentrations decrease with distance from the highway and with depth in the soil column(Nriagu, 1978a). Lead soil concentration is greatest within 10metres of the road and estimates (1992) would be lower, given the reduction that has occurred in airborne emissions of lead from mobile sources. Many of these emissions are localizedduetothenatureof theparticulatematter. Source:NriaguandPacyna(1988).83A typical picture of lead accumulation in soils along a highway is demonstrated in a study in Belgium by Deroanne-Bauvin et al. (1987). Lead was enriched in a relatively narrow zone alongeither side of the road, and its distribution was shown to be influenced by the distance from theroad, duration of exposure, traffic density, climatic conditions, profile of the road, and state ofgrowthof vegetation. Lead concentrations associated with stationary sources are dependent on rate of release from source, dispersion, and deposition rate; generally, the concentration of lead in soil decreasesexponentially downwind of a point source (Nriagu, 1978a, b). Concentrations are usually highestwithinthreekilometresof apoint source(USEPA, 1989). There are numerous published results showing elevated concentrations of lead and other metals close to and downwind of industrial smelting and refining operations in the United control 16 Source:USEPA(1979). Soil contamination can arise as a result of the mining, storage and transport of the mineral ores and from associated waste materials such as tailings and spoil heaps. Colbourn andThornton (1978) found high concentrations of lead in agricultural soils of a historical mining districtin the United Kingdom, ranging from several hundred to several thousand \u00b5g lead/g over about250km 2. Contamination of mine soils has been reported from several other parts of the world, includingItaly(Leitaet al., 1988). Continuous applications of sewage sludge to land results in an accumulation of lead in soil. The lead content of sludges is very variable and depends on the amounts of industrialeffluents and waste incorporated. Typical sludges contain <1000\u00b5g lead/g. Every effort is nowmade to lower lead content to meet the requirements of legislation. Soil receiving heavy sludgeapplications over a long period was found to contain 425\u00b5g lead/g compared with 47\u00b5g lead/g inan unsludged soil (Beckett et al., 1979). The possibility that lead might accumulate in crop plantsto dangerous levels has led to several countries drawing up guidelines for sludge use. Forexample, in the United Kingdom a maximum waste permissible concentration for lead in soils of84300mg/kg dry solids after application of sewage sludge has been established, along with an average annual rate of addition of lead amounting to 15kg/ha calculated over a ten-year period. InGermany, the lead content of sludge should not exceed 900\u00b5g/g dry sludge and, if soil contains>100\u00b5g lead/g, sludge should not be applied. There is, however, a general conclusion that lead insoilderivedfrom appliedsludgehasonlylowavailabilitytoplants. House paint containing lead can significantly contribute to concentrations of lead in soils. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (1990) estimated that 18percent ofprivately owned housing units have soil lead levels above EPA guidelines of 500\u00b5g/g, while27percent of publichousingunitswithlead-basedpaint havesoilsexceedingguidelines. 2.4.1 ChemicalSpeciesof LeadinSoils The main components of lead in soil are the soil solution, the absorption surfaces of the clay-humus exchange complex, precipitated forms, secondary iron and manganese oxides andalkaline earth carbonates, the 2500 \u00b5glead/g (Wedepool, 1970; Nichelatti, 1992). Soil solution is the immediate source of lead for plant roots. The results of analysing soil solutions derived from lead- contaminated soils reported by Gregson and Alloway (1984) show that only a very small portion ofthe soil lead is present in solution. However, the concentrations reported are some 1000to100000timeshigherthanthoserecordedfornon-contaminatedsoils. In heavily polluted soils, partof the lead was present as a high molecular weight organo-lead complex and the proportionrepresented by this form was greater in soils of higher pH. From acid soils cationic forms of leadwere predominant, accounting for as much as 95percent of lead in solution. In a carbonate-richsoil, neutral species predominated (Alloway et al., 1984). The level of lead in soils (as well as inwater) is controlled by lead carbonate across the whole range of pH. In very acidic soil thecontrolling role of phosphate appears predominant, whereas in a reducing medium, like thatprovidedbywetlands, sulphideconrolstheleadconcentration(Nriagu, 1984). While many metals are converted to organic forms by micro-organisms in soil, there is little evidence to suggest that the natural production of methylated lead has any generalenvironmentalsignificance. It has been suggested that acidification of the surface environment may influence the chemical species of metals present, their transport pathways and cycling (Ward, 1985). There isas yet no evidence that acid precipitation is influencing the chemistry and transport of lead in thesoilenvironment. Recent studies in an old lead mining district in central England, in which some garden soils contain onepercent or more of lead, have shown that long-term weathering of the lead oregalena (PbS) has resulted in the formation of pyromorphite, a stable soil-lead mineral with anextremely low solubility and thus low bioavailability (Cotter-Howells and Thornton, 1991). Thepresence of this mineral was used to explain the normal blood lead concentrations in youngchildrenexposedtotheseheavilycontaminatedsoils. 2.4.2 LeadAvailabilityandUptakeintoPlants Although various soil parameters can affect the availability of lead, the total amount of the85element present is one of the major factors affecting the lead content of plants. It has been found by many workers that there is a positive linear relationship between lead concentrations in plantand soil, and that this relationship exists for a wide range of uncontaminated and contaminatedsoils (Davies and Thornton, 1989). At higher soil lead levels, however, plant uptake has beenfound to decline with increasing soil lead concentrations and a curvilinear relationship has beenreported. There is general agreement that only a small proportion of the lead in soil is available foruptakebyplants(DaviesandThornton, 1989). The amount of lead absorbed by plants depends not only on the total lead content of the soil, but also on its chemical form. For example, Alloway and Morgan (1986) found that lead insoils contaminated with inorganic sources, such as metalliferous mining and smelting, tended to bemorereadilyaccumulatedbyvegetablesthanthat fromsoilsamendedwithsewagesludge. Many researchers have attempted to predict the uptake of lead by plants using soil extractants such as nitric acid, ammonium acetate, calcium chloride and others. In addition toextractant type, factors such as soil properties and plant species have also been shown to affectthe prediction of plant concentrations (Adriano, 1986). Attempts so far have met with limitedsuccess, primarily because relatively little is known about which factors control the availability ofmetals at the root-soil interface. Enough is known, however, to suggest that empirical relationshipsthat attempt to relate metal uptake directly to soil concentrations need to take into account soil pH,organic matter content and major ion status (Davies et al., 1987). Soil pH is one of the mostimportant factorsaffectingthesolubility, mobilityandbioavailabilityof lead(Adriano, 1986). Other soil factors influencing the bioavailability of lead include cation exchange capacity, organic matter content, soil texture and clay mineralogy, redox potential, and the levels of otherelementsincludingthenutrientsphosphorus, sulphurandnitrogenandtheheavymetalcadmium. Plant species differ widely in their ability to absorb, accumulate and tolerate lead. For example, Alloway and Morgan (1984) found that of all soil types, the percentage accumulation washigher in the leafy crops, lettuce and cabbage, than in the root crops, radish and carrot.Phytotoxicity may occur for ray-grass or radishes if in limonitic soils containing more than200\u00b5glead/gorsandysoilwithbetween150to200 \u00b5glead/g(Gomez, 1982; Nichelatti, 1992). In addition, there is little doubt that lead of atmospheric origin can contribute significantly to the lead content of field crops (Chamberlain, 1983). Even in rural regions of Denmark, aerially derived leadhas been shown to account for 90-99percent of the lead found in grass (Tjell et al., 1979).However, the degree to which lead deposited on plant foliar surfaces is actually absorbed by theplant andsubsequentlytranslocatedwithinit isstillamatterfordebate. Aproportion, typically around 50percent, of the lead content of vegetables and fruit crops can be removed by washing. Much of the remainder is incorporated into the cuticle and cell wallsof the leaves or peel. It appears that much of the lead deposited on the leaves may be present asa surface coating which is not absorbed into the plant (Moir, 1992). In the case of root crops, theimportance of aerially derived lead to the lead content of their edible portion is probably slight,whereas in leafy crops it may be more important, particularly in areas of high atmospheric leaddeposition.862.4.3 LeadIntakesbyGrazingAnimals Grazing animals such as sheep, cattle and horses can ingest large quantities of soil. In winter, whenthe soil is wet and the herbage is short, cattle and sheep may ingest up to 30percentof their dietary intake of dry matter as soil (Thornton and Abrahams, 1981). Because many soilscontain up to several thousand\u00b5g lead/kg, these animals will normally have much higher intakes oflead than non-herbivorous animals. In areas of previous metalliferous mining and smelting, it hasbeendemonstratedthat thelargest proportionof total lead intake by grazing livestock was acquireddirectlybytheinvoluntaryingestionof lead-contaminatedsoil. 2.5 LeadinDust The general consensus is that the results from numerous investigations over the past two decades point to the presence of elevated lead concentrations in dust, both external to and withinthe home. Exposure to lead in dust can occur through ingestion, especially likely in children, orinhalationof resuspendeddust. Deposition of airborne lead from leaded gasoline combustions and stationary sources such as smelters are the major contributors to dust lead in the outdoor environment. An additionalmajor source of lead in dust is the peeling and flaking of lead-based paint. Lead in dust is foundprimarilyassulphate, along with small amounts of oxide and halide salts (US EPA 1989). The leadparticles are usually large, ranging between 40and 1000\u00b5m (US EPA, 1989). Unlike lead that isincorporated into soils, lead in surface dusts is mobile and will decrease with declining input,precipitation, wind, andstreet andhousecleaning. Typical lead levels in street dust in the United States range from 80-130\u00b5g/g in rural settings to 100-5000\u00b5g/g in urban settings (US EPA, 1989). House dust ranges from 50-500\u00b5g/gin rural settings to 50-3000\u00b5g/g in urban settings to 100-20000\u00b5g/g near point sources of leadsuchassmelters. A1981studyof roadwaydust intheUnitedKingdomfound lead levels in urban street dust to average between 1000and 4000\u00b5g/g, while rural street dust contained lead concentrations of440\u00b5g/g (Harrison et al., 1985). An extensive study of household dust in the UK in 1981 and 1982found a geometric mean of lead concentration in house dust of 561\u00b5g/g, with around 10percentof homes exceeding 2000\u00b5g/g (Thornton et al., 1990). The geometric mean for house dust inLondon exceeded 1000\u00b5g/g. In a subsequent investigation, the concentration of house dust in1985 in the city of Birmingham was found to be 424\u00b5g/g. Both of the UK sampling efforts wereconducted before mandated reductions of lead in gasoline, so current concentrations may well belower. An environment survey conducted by the German Ministry for Environment in 1991 showed a median lead content in indoor dust (dust deposit, element concentration in the dust bagof a vacuum cleaner) of 0.42\u00b5g lead/m 2/day. Where the neighbourhood was of the apartment block type without green areas, inhabitants were found to be exposed to higher dust deposits,containing almost all elements investigated, than inhabitants of areas with less compactconstructionandmoregreenareas. As discussed above, the presence of lead-based paint in dwellings is also associated with87dust and soil levels in dwellings. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) guidelinesstatethat dust concentrationsinhomesshouldnot exceedaclearance level of 200\u00b5g/ft2 on the floor, 500\u00b5g/ft2on the window sills, and 800\u00b5g/ft2on window wells (US HUD, 1990). A 1990 HUD study estimated that 10.7million homes had dust levels exceeding oneor more HUDguidelines, and that 1million had concentrations exceeding HUD guidelines on the floor, wherechildrenaremost likelytocomeintocontact withdust (USHUD, 1990). In the UK National Survey of Metals in Dusts and Soils (Culbard et al., 1988), a highly significant relationship was found between lead concentrations in house dusts and garden soils,though there was more lead in house dust than in surface soil, indicating the importance of internalsources such as paint. In this study it was proposed that around 25percent of indoor dustoriginatedfromgardensoil. There is general agreement that, in many cases, local lead contamination of the outdoor environment, around both primary and secondary lead smelters and lead processing plants, resultsinenhancedleadconcentrationsindustswithinthehome.88GENERALREFERENCES(CHAPTER2) Adriano, D.C.

The relative importance of any single source of exposure is difficult topredict and will vary with geographic location, climate and local geochemistry. Similarly, theintensity of exposure experienced by an individual can vary as a function of age, sex, occupation,socio-economic status, diet and cultural practices. In addition, the amount of lead taken up into thebody is believed to vary depending on the concentration and composition (for example, particlesize, chemicalform)of theleadinhaledoringested. Some countries monitor levels of lead in environmental media, as well as in blood, as a basis for assessing risks of exposure and the effectiveness of measures to reduce these risks.Trend data have also been used to link anthropogenic sources of release to human exposures.However, it should be noted that even strong correlations do not necessarily prove a linkage with agivensource, asmost countrieshavetakenmultiplemeasurestoreducerisksfromexposures. The following section briefly describes the pathways of human exposure to lead (see also Figure19 ). In Section3.4, trends in lead concentration in various environmental media (as well as in food and blood) in some OECD countries are examined. The information in that section wasreceived from government agencies, academia and industry. Explanations for variations in trendswere sometimes also provided. In some cases, a rise or fall in blood lead levels was linked tochangesindemandforspecificlead-containingproducts. This linkage was generally demonstratedby correlating trends for lead in blood and demand for products with trends in the concentration ofleadinair, food, etc. The information presented in this chapter is as received. No attempt has been made to correlate data between countries, due to variations in survey methods and other confoundingfactors. 3.2 PathwaysofHumanExposure 3.2.1 LeadinPaint Lead in paint constitutes a major source of bioavailable lead in the environment. Although many OECD countries have banned or restricted the use of lead in interior paints, there remains ahuge reservoir of contaminated material in existing structures where leaded paint has been used.Children are especially susceptible to exposure to lead in paint. They may chew on pieces ofpeeling or flaking paint, or may ingest house dust generated as a result of deterioration of indoorpaint, restoration, rehabilitation work, and garden soil contaminated by deteriorated leaded exteriorpaint. The US HUD (1990) has estimated that 57million privately owned and occupied homes builtbefore 1980 have lead paint; of these, 9.9million are occupied by families with children under theage of seven. An estimated 3.8million homes occupied by young children have deteriorated paint93(i.e. peelingor flaking).94 953.2.2 LeadinSoils/Sediments Lead accumulates in soils and sediments. Loading can occur from both natural sources (for example, local geology, volcanic activity, sea spray, forest fires, etc.) and anthropogenicsources such as agricultural and food wastes, logging, urban refuse, municipal sewage sludge,solid wastes, coal and fly ash, fertilizer, commercial product wastes and atmospheric fall-out.Lead-based house paint can also significantly contribute to soil concentrations of lead. Childrenmay contact lead-bearing soils during outdoor play; in addition, contaminated soils may be trackedindoors on shoes, clothing, etc. A major mechanism of soil and sediment contamination isatmosphericdepositionof leadfromgasolinecombustionandfromstationarysources. Lead is retained in soil in organic complexes or adsorbed to hydrous oxides near the soil surface. The mobility of lead in the soil depends on the soil pH and organic content. In general,lead's relative immobility in soil tends to decrease its bioavailability to humans and other terrestriallife. However, itsimmobilityalsoincreasesitsresidencetimeinsoils. 3.2.3 LeadinDust Dust is found both in the home and in the outdoor environment. Exposure to lead in dust can occur through ingestion, especially likely in children, or inhalation of resuspended dust.Depositions of airborne lead from leaded gasoline emissions and from stationary sources, such assmelters and coal-powered generating stations, are the major anthropogenic contributors of dustlead in the outdoor environment. An additional major source of lead in dust is the peeling andflaking of lead-based paint. Lead in dust is found primarily as sulphate, along with small amountsof oxideandhalidesalts(USEPA, 1989). Unlike lead that is incorporated into soils, lead in surfacedusts is mobile and is believed to decrease with declining input, precipitation, wind, or street andhousecleaning. Accidental ingestion of dust or soil (dirt) by hand-to-mouth activity is an important source of leadexposuretoyoungchildren. 3.2.4 LeadinFood Theingestionof food is a major component of most individuals' total lead uptake, although the relative contribution is a function of one's size, body weight, age and type of diet. Theoccurrence of lead in the diet may be a result of: a)natural sources of lead; b)deposition ofairborne lead particles onto crops, forage, feed, soils and water; and c)harvesting, processing,transport, packaging, preparation and storage of food. The concentrations of lead in foods aretypically less than 100 \u00b5g/kg fresh weight, though certain foods can reach much higherconcentrations (Sherlock, 1987; Dabeka and McKenzie, 1987, 1988; US EPA, 1989). In the 1980sintheUK, themajorityof foodscontainedlessthan50\u00b5g/kg(Sherlock, 1987). Canned foods often have much higher concentrations of lead than foods packaged in another manner. The US EPA estimated that about 42percent of lead in food comes from leadsolderedcansorother metal sources (US EPA, 1986), though this contribution should now be less. Canned food may absorb substantial quantities of lead from lead solder used to seal the can, especially if the food is at a low pH. Foods packed in lead soldered cans may have lead levels ashigh as 100to 400\u00b5g/kg, or fiveto 30times the lead content of frozen or fresh foods (US EPA,961989). Atmospheric deposition is also another important source of lead in food. In the United Kingdom, deposited lead on soil and crops is estimated to contribute 13to 31percent of the totaldietary consumption of lead by children (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foods, 1989). In theUnited States, 45percent of lead in a typical diet is assumed to originate from depositions (USEPA, 1986). Foods with high surface areas (such as spinach) also tend to have higherconcentrationsof leadduetoatmosphericdeposition. IntheUK, a series of surveys between 1983and 1987 failed to demonstrate any consistent decline in the lead content of vegetables whichmight have been associated with the reduction in lead content of petrol within the same period.Cooking food in lead-contaminated water can elevate lead concentrations in food. Sherlock (1987)reported that every 10\u00b5g/l in water increased the lead concentration in cooked vegetables byabout6\u00b5g/kg. Other sources of lead in foods include leaching from ceramic containers in which lead glazes have been used, contamination of roadside fruits such as blackberries with vehicle-derivedlead, uptake of lead from lead-rich urban garden soils into home-grown vegetable crops, anduptakeof leadintocropsfromsewagesludgeappliedtofarmland. 3.2.5 LeadinWater Lead is a natural, usually minor constituent of surface and groundwaters. Anthropogenic input of lead to aquatic ecosystems can occur from sources such as effluents from mining,smelting, refining and manufacturing processes or the dumping of sewage sludge and atmosphericfall-out. Lead deposited from the atmosphere can enter aquatic systems through direct fall-out orthrougherosionof soilparticles. Ingeneral, thereislittlecorrelationbetweenleadconcentrations inrainandsnowandconcentrationsinstreamsthat drainwatersheds. Lead tends to be immobilized by the organic component in soil and remains bound to the soil. For the same reason, the migration of lead to groundwater is inhibited. In surface water,qualitiessuchaspHandhardnessinfluenceleadcontent. Lead concentrations in drinking water result primarily from lead leaching from water delivery systems (i.e. water mains, connecting pipes and in-house plumbing), and from previouslycontaminated drinking water sources. Plumbing systems may contain lead pipes, lead soldering,and bronze or brass fittings. Corrosion of these materials, aggravated by water with low pH, andsubsequent leaching into the drinking water can contribute significant quantities of lead in systemswherethesematerialsareused(USEPA, 1989). The physical and chemical form of lead in water has a strong influence upon its toxicity (Prosi, 1989). For instance, a dissolved ion of lead is highly mobile and readily transported into thehuman body if ingested. At the opposite extreme, a large suspended particle of lead sulphide is oflowmobilityasit willrapidlysettleout and, if ingested, isverypoorlyabsorbed. 3.2.6 LeadinAir Lead in air can be inhaled or, as previously mentioned, can be deposited in the form of dust on soils, water and food crops. Loading to air can occur from natural emissions (for97example, volcanoes, forest fires, etc.) and anthropogenic releases such as gasoline combustion, coalburningorindustrialemissions. The health effects of respired lead are dependent upon particle size. A high proportion of inhaled small particles (less than 2.5 \u00b5m) is deposited in the deepest alveolar portion of the respiratory system (Hinds, 1982), from which lead is absorbed with almost 100percent efficiency into the bloodstream. Particles in the range 2.5to 10 \u00b5m most typically deposit in the tracheobronchial and naso-pharyngeal region, from which they are elevated and swallowed. Absorption of lead through the gastrointestinal tract is far less efficient in adults (8to 10percent)but can be up to 50 per cent in children. Thus, a large proportion of lead in these sizes does notenter the bloodstream (Chamberlain and Wiffen, 1978). Particles of greater than 10 \u00b5m enter the nose with only low efficiency and do not represent an appreciable inhalation hazard unless present in very high concentrations. Such particles can, however, contribute to the lead content of surfacedustsandsoils. 3.2.7 LeadintheWorkplace Occupational exposures to lead have been noted in various industries, such as inorganic pigments manufacturing; primary and secondary lead metal processing; brass, bronze and copperfoundries; battery manufacturing; machinery manufacturing; electronic capacitors manufacturing;auto repair services and garages; bridge, tunnel and elevated highway repairs; stone, glass andclay products manufacturing; munitions manufacturing; and firing ranges (Maizlish et. al., 1990). Inaddition, lead exposures can occur during renovation and abatement of lead-painted homes andother structures. Para-occupational exposures occur when lead in the form of dust is easily carriedout of the workplace (on clothing, shoes, etc.) and into worker residences, where spouses andchildrenof leadworkerscanthenbeexposed. 3.3 GlobalBaselineData Because of regional disparities, there is very little baseline or trend data for lead concentrations in environmental media on a global or long-term scale. However, an attempt hasbeen made to establish historical baseline data on lead concentrations in the atmosphere byanalysing core samples of Greenland ice dating back as far as 5500years before the present. ThegraphinFigure20 , based on data collected in two studies (see Boutron et al., 1991), indicates that concentrations of lead in ice began to increase in the eighteenth century, possibly reflecting thebeginningof industrialization. Superimposed on the graph is the trend in demand for lead used in gasoline in OECD countries. These countries account for the majority of the world's production of leaded gasoline.As the graph suggests, there appears to be a correlation between decreased use of lead ingasoline and lower lead concentrations in the ice after 1972. However, the demand for lead ingasoline is shown to have been at its highest in 1972, about 20years after the highestconcentrationsof leadintheiceshownhere.98 993.4 CountryData Figures21-58presentingcountrydatafollowthissection. 3.4.1 Australia Between 1985 and 1988, lead emissions declined in all states and territories, resulting in an average reduction of 18percent for Australia ( Figure21 ). More than 90percent of these emissions derive from leaded petrol, and the decline has been attributed first to a reduction in theconcentration of lead in petrol in 1983 and, second, to the introduction of unleaded petrolcontaining 0.013g/l or less of lead. Since 1January 1986, all vehicles, whether manufacturedlocally or imported, have been required to operate on unleaded petrol. Although overall emissionshave declined, there are concerns relating to specific point source releases, such as smelters, thatregularlyexceedrecommendedguidelines. In Australia's largest capital cities, lead in air levels have declined substantially over the last fiveto tenyears. However, many lead in air levels recorded in recent years were above theNational Health and Medical Research Council's recommended maximum of 1.5 \u00b5g lead/m 3 (averagedover90days)(CEPA1992). Since 1977, dietary intakes of lead for all segments of the population have declined dramatically and are well below the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake recommended by theWHO (Figure22 ). For example, the estimated intake for infants has been reduced by 90percent. Improvements are believed to be the result of changes to food canning technology and the discontinueduseof pesticidesprays, basedonleadarsenate, inagriculture. Blood lead data indicate that in most localities less than 10percent of children have blood leadlevelsgreaterthanorequalto25 \u00b5g/dl. According to aggregated data, the mean blood lead level of exposed workers declined from 40 \u00b5g/dl to 30 \u00b5g/dl between 1986 and 1992. During the same period, the proportion of workers with blood lead levels greater than or equal to 50 \u00b5g/dl also decreased by 71percent (Figure23 ). 3.4.2 steadily ( Figure24 ). It is believed that these opposing trends are a result of the introductionof unleadedfuelandareductioninthepermissiblelevelof leadinleadedgasoline. Figure25 indicates that the monthly lead uptake from food did not significantly change duringtheperiod1979to1988. Blood lead levels for the general population declined slightly, to below 25 \u00b5g/dl, between 1972 and 1982 ( Figure26 ). According to the Ministry for Environmental Conservation and Protection, more recent measurements show that blood lead levels for occupationally of lead in air for rural and urban sites have remained relatively constant or have declined, and are well below themaximumpermissiblelevelof 2 \u00b5g/m 3setinanECDirective( Figure27 ). The average blood lead levels for various segments of the population have steadily declined during the 1980s ( Figure28 ). The decline has been, in part, attributed to reductions in the permissible level of lead in gasoline. Trends shown in Figure28 also suggest that smokerstendtohavehigherbloodleadlevelsthannon-smokersof thesamegender. 3.4.4 Canada The average levels of lead in air have steadily declined over the last few decades (Figure29 ). The decline has been largely attributed to reductions in the use of lead in gasoline, as lead emissions from other sources (for example, mineral and processing facilities) have remainedrelatively constant ( Figure30 ). It should be noted that lead emissions from the lead industry were relatively constant during the 1980s, as the majority of reductions occurred when federal andprovincial controls were introduced prior to 1978. The reduction of lead in air since 1987 is, in part,attributedtoadeclineinleademissionsfromgasolinecombustionandcopper-nickelproduction. The average blood lead levels for the population at greatest risk from exposure (i.e. children) also declined to about 6 \u00b5g/dl in 1988, well below the 25 \u00b5g/dl level of concern which is currently under review ( Figure31 ). Although there is a strong correlation between blood lead levels in children and air lead levels, it has been suggested that the decline may also be related tootherfactorssuchasavoluntaryindustryphase-out of leadsolderedfoodcansanda decline in theuseof leadinindoorpaints. 3.4.5 Finland Use:In Finland, the total use of lead was about 22650 tonnes in 1990. The greatest portion,9500tonnes,wasusedbythebatteryindustry. Air:The estimated lead emissions to the atmosphere were 286tonnes/yr in 1990, of which 152tonnes was from motor vehicles. The total emission has decreased by 36percent fromthe1988level, primarilyasa result of the decreased use of leaded gasoline. At present, the use ofunleaded gasoline is about 70percent of the total gasoline use. However, industrial emissionshaveincreasedby19percent. Theaverageairbornelead level in Helsinki has declined sharply from 1\u00b5g/m 3in the 1970s to0.05\u00b5g/m3in1990duetotheuseof low-lead and unleaded gasoline. In more remote areas, the backgroundconcentrationof leadintheairis0.005 \u00b5g/m3. Atmospheric lead deposition in the snowpack during winter in Finland has also been studied. In southern Finland, it was 4.8\u00b5g/l (mean value) and in northern Finland, 2.2\u00b5g/l in 1990. In the 1970s, the lead deposition in Finland was estimated to be 28.4mg/m2per year. But a101recent climatological model study indicates that the lead deposition in southern Finland varies between4to7mg/m2peryear, A recent study on 8 500 water samples from drinking water supply sources revealed that lead concentration in 8490of the samples was below 1\u00b5g/l. The remaining ten samplescontainedabout 50\u00b5g/lof lead. Groundwater samples at 56 stations were studied during 1975-1988. The maximum lead concentrationwas80\u00b5g/lwithameanvalueof 2.8\u00b5g/l. Snow samples from 54 stations were also analysed between 1976 and 1988. The maximum lead concentration was observed to be 70\u00b5g/l with a mean value of 4.2\u00b5g/l. The meanlead deposition in snowpack was 1.14mg/m 2per year, and the range varied between 0.18- 42.0mg/m2peryear. Soil:Lead discharged via wastes and other lead-containing materials in soil was estimated to be 5890tonnes in 1990. This is an increase of 15percent over the estimateddischargefortheearly1980s. The lead concentration in Finnish soil generally varies between 15-20\u00b5g/g, but it can be quite high in industrial and urban areas. The mean lead concentration in cultivated soil was1.66mg/lin1987, whichis16percent lessthanthemeanvalueof 1.98mg/lobservedin1974. Foodstuffs, etc.: Dietary intake of lead is 40-60\u00b5g per day. Respiratory air can increase the lead exposure in urban areas by about 5\u00b5g per day (however, absorption via the lungs isgreater than via the gastrointestinal tract). Drinking water is of minimal importance, since leadpipeshavenot beenusedinFinland. Leadconcentrationindrinkingwaterisbelow1\u00b5g/l. Blool lead levels: Average blood lead levels decreased from 11 \u00b5g/dl (only men studied)to2.8 \u00b5g/dl(menandwomen, N=200)in1975-1992. In Helsinki, the average blood lead level of children has decreased from 4.6to 3.0\u00b5g/dl between 1983 and 1988 (children in day care centres). The maximum level observed was8.3\u00b5g/dl (N = 35). In the same period, car exhaust emissions of lead decreased by 75percent inthecapitalarea. Occupational health: Blood lead concentration for exposed workers has decreased from about 20 \u00b5g/dl to 14 \u00b5g/dl (median values) for men between 1973 and 1982. The highest values have decreased from 120-160 \u00b5g/dl to 80-90 \u00b5g/dl among men, and to about 50\u00b5g/dlamongwomen. 3.4.6 France Surface water: The river authorities monitor the concentration of lead in surface water. Between 1971 and 1986 there was a steady decrease of the proportion of high values over 100102\u00b5g/landaconcurrent increaseforthemediumvalues20to100 \u00b5g/l. In 1987, monitoring sites were redistributed to include more sites in zones of high risk. This gave a sudden rise in the proportion of measurements of high concentrations for the year1987. Data obtained after 1987 confirm the previously observed decrease of high concentrations.In 1990, for the first time levels between 50 and 100 \u00b5g/l were more frequently measured than levelsabove100 \u00b5g/l. Air pollution from automobiles: Emission into air from automobiles is monitored at 24 sites in areas of dense traffic. After implementation of Directive 82/884/EEC by the French authorities,the limit value of 2 \u00b5g/m 3was never transgressed at any of the sites. One-year averages varied between0.2and1.9 \u00b5g/m3. Pollution from industrial souces: The main sectors discharging lead into air and water are non-ferrous smelters, battery plants, and plants manufacturing gasoline additives and regeneratingspent oil. Minor discharges stem from iron, steel, copper and bronze smelters, coke production,andmunicipalwasteincinerators.

The reduction has been attributedtothephasingout of leadingasoline. Between 1972 and 1985, the lead concentration in the clay fraction of sediments in the RhineandElberiversalsodeclined( Figure33 ). Various studies indicate that average blood lead levels in schoolchildren and adults (male and female) have declined since 1975 ( Figure34 ). The reductions are believed to be a result of the decrease of lead in air. Germany has also phased out the production of lead soldered foodcans and prohibited the use of lead-based pesticides and paints, with the exception of anti-corrosivepaintsforindustrialrepaircoatings. 3.4.8 New Zealand The current mean blood level is 7\u00b5g/dl. Lead from paint and food and drink containers are the major sources of the NewZealand mean blood level. Petrol lead accounts for 5percent.Studies conducted between 1974 and 1984 show that blood lead levels dropped by 40percent foradult males and 35percent for adult females and children ( Figure36 ). This reduction was attributed to the removal of lead from food and drink containers. Leaded petrol consumption wasnot considered to be a significant factor in the decline of blood lead levels, as it tended to fluctuatewithin a relatively stable range during the period ( Figures 35 and 36 ). In 1986, the lead content of petrol was reduced from 0.84g/l to 0.45g/l but no significant reduction in lead blood level wasobserved.1063.4.9 Norway The estimated and known discharges of lead to air, water and soil decreased by about 49percent between 1985 and 1990, whereas the quantity of lead disposed of to landfill isestimated to have increased by a factor of4 during the same period ( Figure37 ). The substantial rise in lead going to landfill has been related to a six-fold increase in disposals from themetallurgical industry. However, the significant decline in lead released to water has beenassociatedwitha98percent reductionof leadwithinmetallurgicalindustryeffluent. The decline of lead emitted to air has been largely attributed to a reduction in the use of leadedpetrol. This reduction in lead emissions is believed to have resulted in a decrease of lead inprecipitation ( Figure38 ). The only exception is an unexplained temporary increase in lead deposition in southern Norway for 1988. With regard to deposition patterns, a study of lead inmoss found that the atmospheric deposition of lead in Norway and other Nordic countriesdecreased from south to north parallel to population density and intensity of traffic. The study alsoidentified the long-range transport of lead from densely populated areas of central Europe as acontributingfactortoleaddeposition. Blood lead levels in Norway are considered to be directly related to the concentration of lead in air. A cohort study in 1983 and 1984 found that, despite low to moderate blood leadconcentrations, theinhabitantsof atownwith moderate traffic pollution had higher blood lead levelsthan residents of a small town with very little traffic (NILU, 1990). After considering a number ofcontributing factors, it was recognized that children exposed to passive smoking and adult smokershad higher blood lead concentrations. It was also noted that as lead in air levels declined, thedecrease in blood lead concentration was greater in non-drinkers than in individuals who dranksmalltomoderateamountsof alcohol. 3.4.10 Sweden The levels of lead emitted to air or deposited from air have declined during the last two decades ( Figure39 ). Overall, the amount of lead emitted tends to be less than the quantity deposited. The difference may, in part, be attributed to the long-range transport of lead fromdensely populated areas in Europe (Nordic Council of Ministers, 1992). Reductions in leadedgasoline are considered to have largely contributed to reduced emissions. However, the reductionof the permissible level of lead in gasoline from 0.4to 0.15g/l in 1981 does not appear to haveinfluencedthedownwardtrendinleademittedtoair. The quantity of lead in effluents entering water has declined by 80percent since 1977 and was reported to be 14tonnes in 1990 ( Figure40 ). It is also reported that atmospheric deposition accounts for 95percent of the total anthropogenic input of lead to Sweden's marinearea(KEMI, 1992). Averagebloodleadlevelsof childrenlivingnearsmeltersorinruralor urban environments have been declining since 1978, to below 5 \u00b5g/dl in 1988 ( Figure41 ). Average blood lead levels for the general population in Stockholm also fell to below 6 \u00b5g/dl by 1984. Important factors contributing to the decline in blood lead levels were considered to be the reduction in the permissible level of lead in gasoline, a decrease in the use of lead soldered food cans, andimprovements in occupational hygiene (KEMI, 1992). In this latter regard, occupational exposures have also declined. The average blood lead level fell by 30percent between 1977 and 1989107(Figure42 ). 3.4.11 Switzerland The release of lead into the atmosphere is decreasing since 1970 ( Figure 43 ). The reduction can be attributed to the phasing out of leaded gasoline as well as to improvements of thefluegastreatment inmunicipalwateincinerators. The general population exposure is decreasing since the last decade. This is shown by the MONICA study (MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease) in whichbloodleadconcentrationof menandwomenof different ageswereanalysed(FOEFL, 1992). 3.4.12 UnitedKingdom The levels of lead in various sludges and industrial waste entering the North Sea from the United Kingdom declined significantly during the latter half of the 1980s ( Figure46 ). An explanationforthevariationsisnot provided. Concentrations of lead in air at rural and urban sites have declined. One of the greatest drops correlates with a 1985-1986 reduction in the maximum permissible level of lead in gasolinefrom0.40to0.15g/l( Figures47and48 ). The average blood lead concentrations for children, as well as adult females and males, also declined steadily during the mid-1980s, with the average levels being well below the 25 \u00b5g/dl level of concern ( Figure49 ). According to the UK Department of the Environment, the reduction in the permissible level of lead in gasoline during 1985 had a minimal impact on the alreadydownward trend in blood lead levels in adults, but did appear to contribute slightly to the decreaseof lead in the body burden of children. It was also suggested that the decline reflected a long-termtrend that related to several personal, social and environmental factors such as reductions in leadintake from food ( Figure50 ) or water. Two studies in Glasgow and Ayr, Scotland, showed that bottle-fed infants accumulated considerable quantities of lead in response to exposure from lead inwater. Sinceboththesestudies, thewatersuppliershaveadjustedthepHof thewaterto8and 8.5to reduce leaching of lead. This resulted in a marked fall in blood lead concentrations in Glasgowmothers (Moore et al., 1981) and a drop in water-lead concentration of around 80percent in Ayr(SherlockandQuinn, 1986). 3.4.13 UnitedStates During the 1980s, the average annual concentrations of lead in air declined at urban and point source sites and are well below the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 1.5 \u00b5g/m 3 (Figure51 ). The downward trend has, in part, been related to reductions in emissions from transportation, stationary fuel combustion, industrial, solid waste and other miscellaneous sources (Figure52 ). Transportation emissions have dropped by more than 98percent since 1970. The decline has been attributed to a decrease in the lead content of leaded gasoline fromapproximately 2g/gallon (.528g/l) in the early 1970s to 0.1g/gallon (0.026g/l) in 1986 (ENVIRON,1991). Reductions in emissions at point sources are believed to be related to changes inproductivity,processtechnologyandemissioncontroldevices.108Lead intake from food for various segments of the population, including children, declined during the 1980s ( Figure53 ). Reasons for the decline range from improved food preparation, canning and hygiene practices to reductions in the level of lead in food crops, which is linkedthrough soil to crustal weathering, lead deposition from air, and/or lead concentrations in irrigationand groundwaters. It has been suggested that the steady decline in the use of lead soldered food cans during the 1980s was a major contributing factor to the decline of lead intake from food (Figure54 ). Discards of lead in municipal solid waste (MSW) are estimated to have increased during the last few decades, with batteries identified as the largest contributor ( Figure55 ). However, there is uncertainty about the quantity of lead entering the waste stream. The estimates shown inFigure52 were based on a materials flow analysis which required assumptions such as theestimated lifetime and recycling rate of a product. Industry assessments of the data indicate thatthe quantity and relative contribution of discards by end use product can vary substantially andcould be much less, depending on the recycling rate used (LIA, 1991). Alternative estimates usingconcentrations of lead in incinerator ash or actual sampling of MSW suggested that the materialsflowmethodoverstatesleaddiscards(LIA, 1991). According to a national health and nutrition survey, NHANES II, the average annual blood lead level for children declined during the latter half of the 1970s and continued to register wellbelow the level of concern, at the time, of 25 \u00b5g/dl for children ( Figure56 ). 2The decline has been attributed to reductions of lead in air from decreases in lead in gasoline, a voluntary programme by the domestic food industry to discontinue use of lead solder in food cans, and the decline of theuseof leadinresidentialpaints(EPA, 1992). Although overall blood lead levels in children declined, there was statistically significant evidence to indicate that black children had higher blood lead levels. It was noted that urbanizationand income were directly associated with lead exposures and that children in high risk categories(for example, inner-city black children in families with low social economic standing) have morecomplex exposures, such as leaded paint, weathering and chalking, than US children as a whole(ReporttoCongress,1988). Some data suggest that lead exposures had decreased in the US even before the removal of lead in gasoline. Figure57 is a scatter plot of US blood lead values from 1935 to 1990 that were sourced by the International Lead and Zinc Research Organization (ILZRO) fromlitreature referenced in Appendix A . Comparison of Figure 57 with Figure 58 suggests that the decline in blood lead levels is consistent with the reduction in the use of lead in gasoline afterleadedfueldemandpeakedintheearly1970s, but not prior. The discrepancy in trends may reflectdeclines in lead exposure from other sources such as paint, drinking water and food. It should alsobe noted that early blood lead surveys were generally not conducted with the same carefullyrandomized protocols as later surveys. In addition, older data was generated using a range ofanalytical procedures without consistent quality controls and the methodology was less sensitivethan that employed today. Modern methods also take greater care in blood sampling to reduce thelikelihoodof contaminationduringsamplecollection. 2In 1991, the United States adopted a three-tiered system to assess blood lead exposure.

Essentially, these statements provide the rationale for any actions the country has takento address effects associated with environmental or human health exposures to lead. Thenational statements are based on conclusions concerning the hazards of lead and datafrom human health or environmental monitoring carried out to determine levels ofexposure. The national risk assessments and risk characterizations that have led countries to take action have a strong national character. Countries develop positions on the need for riskreductionactivitiesonlyaftertheyhaveanalysedthehazardandthesignificance of certainexposures and have factored in local social, economic and political considerations. Thesepositions are usually arrived at after considerable debate on the numerous factorsinvolved,andthusarenotexpectedtobeconsistentacrossOECDMembercountries. This chapter also contains an internationally agreed assessment of the risks of lead from the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS). The IPCS assessment is takendirectly from Chapters 1 and 9 of the recent Task Group-approved update of theEnvironmental Health Criteria Document on Lead, which will be published in late 1993 orearly1994.149150AUSTRALIANNATIONALRISKSTATEMENTOFLEAD As a major producer of lead, Australia has some towns affected by point source emissions. There are also urban contamination problems, largely due to the population's heavy reliance on cars,the relatively high lead contentofleaded petrol and the slower than expected change ofthe nation's carfleettounleadedpetrol. PublicHealth The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has promulgated National Guidelines for Lead in Drinking Water (50\u00b5g/l), Lead in Blood (25\u00b5g/dl) and Lead in Air (1.5\u00b5g/m 3, averaged over three continuous months). These Guidelines are generally used by Australian StatesandTerritoriestodetermineleadriskreductionmeasures. TheLead in Drinking Water Guideline was developed in Australia, taking into consideration other national guidelines and the World Health Organization's 1984 revision of drinking waterguidelines. The LeadinBlood andLeadinAir Guidelines were developed on Thereviewwillinclude: \u007fa commissioned research review of Australian ambient lead in air and lead in blood, both in major metropolitan centres and in populations at particular risk from historical andpresent lead exposures from industrial activities.

This group would have as its base document relevant chapters of the draftIPCSEnvironmentalHealthCriteria; and, \u007fan International Scientific Consensus Conference on Lead from 5to 9October 1992, which examined broader non-occupational toxicological issues. This meeting wasconductedwithappropriatescientificrigourwithexpertparticipantsidentifiedby all relevantbodiesincludingindustry. It is likely that the Lead in Drinking Water Guideline will be amended following this review of151theleadinbloodandairguidelines.152Occupational LeadExposures In 1980, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) recommended an occupational maximum blood lead level of 70 \u00b5g/dl for males and 40 \u00b5g/dl for females. However, those guidelines will soon be abolished in anticipation of the National Occupational Health and SafetyCommission'sproposedstandard. The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission expects to declare a National Inorganic Lead Control Standard and Code of Practice for the Control and Safe Use of Lead atWork during 1993. Lead smelting and the manufacture of lead products are major industries inAustralia. ThedraftStandard Code aims to progressively reduce lead exposures in the workplace, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse health effects. The draftNational Standard seeks to accommodateoccupationalhealth, safety, economic and equal employment opportunity objectives. The latter is particularly for women, as they are sometimes excluded from certain jobs in the lead industry because of potential foetal damage, which could lead to early childhood developmentalproblems. Inbrief,the draftStandardincludesthefollowingmeasures: \u007fprior to particular jobs commencing, employers are to determine whether the work entails significant risk of lead exposure (i.e. whether employee blood lead levels couldbeexpectedtoriseabove30\u00b5g/100ml); \u007femployers to ensure that the level of lead in air likely to be inhaled by employees does not exceed 0.15mg/m 3(calculated as a time weighted concentration over an 8hour day)orif not practicable, that respiratoryprotectiveequipment isprovided; \u007femployers to provide surveillance programmes, including monitoring of blood leadlevelsof employeesinlead-riskjobs; \u007femployees with high3blood lead levels to be removed from the lead-risk job until the bloodleadlevelissufficientlylow1; \u007fthe following exposure control hierarchy is to be followed by employers in reducing the lead exposure of employees as far as practical, particularly when employee blood leadlevelsareconsistentlyraised 1: induction and training on the nature of hazardsandmeansof assessingandcontrollingexposuretoworkplacelead.154The Australian lead industry (1988) recommended a maximum occupational blood lead level of 70 \u00b5g/dl for males and 30 \u00b5g/dl for females, and in 1992 recommended a maximum of 65\u00b5g/dl for males. The Australian lead industry further recommends concentrations of lead in blood at which return to occupational exposures may occur (50 \u00b5g/dl for males, 25 \u00b5g/dl for females). Several states prohibit females and young males (under16 or 18) from working in lead processes. ThedraftNational Standard also provides for collection of information by States and Territories, from all workplaces where lead-risk jobs are carried out, regarding compliance andmonitoringresults. ThisinformationwillbeusedtoreviewtheStandardwithinfouryears. EnvironmentalExposures Sources of ecosystems or non-human leaded petrol, battery andleadfishingweights. These have impacted on water,airandsoilqualityand, inturn, haveimpactedonaquaticandterrestrial(includingavian)life. With respect to strategies for reducing the risks of lead to ecosystems, the Australian and NewZealand Guidelines for the Assessment and Management of Contaminated Sites present agood strategy for reducing risks associated with lead contaminated soil. The Australian WaterQuality Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Waters provide guidance to ensure protection of watersystems from lead risks. In some States 4, environmental audit systems provide mechanisms for the identification and subsequent reduction of unacceptable risks. The rationale for thesemeasures include national concern for maintenance or improvement in water and soil quality, theneed to minimize the risks of exposure of ecosystems to lead and similar activities beingundertakeninothercountries. Lead toxicosis, following ingestion of lead shot, has long been recognized as a significant cause of mortality in waterfowl. As in other countries, Australia has needed to deal with problemscausedincertainareasthroughtheuse of lead shot in hunting. For example, following ingestion oflead shot, lead toxicosis has been observed in Magpie geese, Black swans, several species ofduck (including Black duck and Musk duck) and Hardhead. The level of ingestion of lead shot andthe concentration of lead in the tissue of several species of waterfowl has been shown to be abovecriteriausedinothercountriesat whichactionistaken. To date, there has been no national approach to reducing risks of lead exposure to the nonhuman environment. As is generally the case with chemicals management in Australia, actionisinitiatedat theStatelevel. Two States do not allow waterfowl hunting and two States have partial bans on the use of lead shot for waterfowl hunting. Monitoring in threeof the fourStates indicates that the level ofingestion of lead shot is equal to or greater than the levels set in the US at which managementaction is taken. In the remaining State, monitoring has indicated that there are no known demonstrated elevated concentrations of lead in waterfowltissues; \u007fdomestic and overseas studies that demonstrate the consequences of elevated concentrationsof leadinwaterfowltissues; \u007fsimilar actions undertaken in overseas countries have proven to be effective in reducingtherisk; and \u007fpublicpressurefromconservationgroupsinsomeStates. The rationale behind the total bans on all waterfowl hunting is based on animal welfare and conservation arguments and the type of shot is secondary. At some hunting grounds, steelshot is obligatory and consideration is being given elsewhere to voluntary use of steel and othernontoxicshot.157CANADIANPOSITIONSTATEMENT: HEALTHRISKSDUETOENVIRONMENTALEXPOSURETOLEAD Therearenoknownbeneficialeffectsofleadinhumansorotheranimals. Many adverse health effects are well documented for exposures to high lead levels, for example,anaemia,renaldamageandencephalopathy. Recentresearchdatahaveshownthatadversehealth effects may occur at low blood lead levels, previously thought not to result in adverse effects.Children are particularly susceptible to the toxic effects of low lead levels; the effects observed includelower scores on indices of mental development and lower birth weights. Exposure of pregnant womento lead may also result in exposure of the fetus and a higher risk of pre-term delivery. Recentconclusions regarding the health risks in Canada have been based largely on the weight of evidence ofneurotoxicity,whilerecognizingcontroversyoversomeindividualstudies. In Canada, the responsibility for taking measures to reduce the health risks of lead is shared between several federal and provincial departments and organizations. To a large degree, the actionstaken in this country result from initiatives of, or recommendations made by, the Health ProtectionBranch ofthe DepartmentofNational Health and Welfare. In view of the recent health-related data, theHealthProtectionBranchhasadoptedthepositionthatexposuretoleadshould be reduced as much aspossible. The actions taken with respect to lead in automotive gasolines, for example, were based on the best health data available at the time, and an exposure assessment that indicated that 30-40percent of children's blood lead was derived from lead in gasoline. In 1983, the Canadiangovernmenttookactiontoreduce(startingin1987)themaximumamountofleadthatcouldbeaddedtogasolines and, in 1986, decided to phase out lead in automotive gasolines by the end of 1992.Subsequently,thedateofimplementationwasbroughtforwardtoDecember1990. Exposures from all media (air, food, water, soil, consumer products) are usually taken into account in determining the need for additional control measures; blood lead levels are used as anindicator of total exposure from all sources. Before implementing any regulatory initiatives, the health-based position of reducing exposure to lead \"to the extent possible\", needs to be reviewed in light ofpossible socio-economic impacts; the resulting approach can be a tempering of the proposed controlsprovidedthatnounreasonablerisksfromthehealthprotectionviewpointresult. Initiatives that have been implemented to reduce exposure to lead from all sources in Canada rangefromregulatorymeasurestoaprogrammeofinformationandeducationandinclude: \u007fthereductionandultimatephase-outofleadadditivesinautomotivegasolines; \u007freductioninthepermittedreleaseofleadfromceramicware; \u007festablishment of maximum limits for lead in certain foods, for example: tomatoes and tomatoproducts,beveragesandinfantformula; \u007fregulations which limit the amount of lead in protective coatings on furniture and other articles intended for children; on toys, equipment and other products for use by children inlearningtoplay;andonpencilsandartists'brushes;158\u007fsupportofavoluntaryindustryphase-outofleadsolderinfoodcans; of recommendations the Department of National Health and Welfarethat theuseof leadsolderinplumbingfordrinkingwaterbediscontinued; and \u007fimplementation of a national information programme to create an awareness of, and promote action to reduce, the health risks associated with removing leaded paint fromolderhomes. There is evidence that the actions taken as a whole in Canada have had a significant health benefit; average blood lead concentrations in Canadian children have shown a steadydecline, fromabout 19\u00b5g/dlin1972, to12\u00b5g/dlin1984, andto6\u00b5g/dlin1988.159DENMARK NATIONALLEADRISKSTATEMENT Lead has several harmful properties with respect to health and to the environment. Lead bioaccumulates and is in general very toxic. The current use today results in dispersion into allenvironmental media. The use of lead in products and as a metal will sooner or later end in wasteand thereby be spread into the environment. The emissions today are adding to the presentcontamination of the environment, and will if the use is continued give rise to serious problems inthefuture. NORWAY GENERALSTATEMENT Lead has no known essential role in biological processes, but is a poison that is harmful bothtotheenvironment andhumanhealth. Lead is used in numerous products. Some of these applications give rise to direct emissions of lead to the environment, others give rise to a waste problem and a more slowcontamination by lead/leaching of lead to water and soil. In the long run this leaching may add uptomajorpollutionandhealthproblems. Lead ought to be substituted wherever possible. It is most important to reduce/substitute the use of lead in those applications that give risk to direct emissions/spreading and that involvegreatest risk of hazardous effects. Research and development should be encouraged to findacceptable substitutes for areas of application where they do not exist today, so that the use ofleadinthelongtermcanbephasedout. In the meanwhile the amount of lead discharged to the environment should be minimized, and highly effective recollection and recovery systems for lead containing products should beestablished.160FRANCE NOTEONNATIONALRISKREDUCTIONSTRATEGIES ASSOCIATEDWITHLEAD PublicHealth: DomesticExposure An important action is undertaken jointly by the Ministries of Environment, Health and Housing.

Lead can cause neurotoxicological effects and other biochemically tangible alterations in theorganismof youngchildren. During pregnancy, lead can pass from the mother's blood circulation into the fetal organismwithout effectivebarrier. This leads to the recommendation of physiologists and toxicologists, that blood lead levels of adults should not exceed the concentration of 15 \u00b5g/100ml and those of children and women in theageof possiblepregnancyshouldnot exceed10 \u00b5m/100ml. The abatement of lead pollution was one of the first aims of German environmental policy in the 1960s. One of the first examples of environmental legislation was the Lead-in-petrol-law(Benzinbleigesetz)of 1971. Germany has today a two-fold comprehensive regulatory scheme for reducing exposure tolead: \u007fA regulatory system covers all the production facilities (emissions to air, water, soil, includingwastedisposal, aswellasoccupationalhealthat theworkplace). \u007fAconsumerorproductrelatedsystemguaranteesthesafeuseofindustrialproducts. In those cases where scientifically proven limit values could not be identified, the \"precautionary principle\" ( Vorsorgeprinzip ) has been the imminent rule and decisive basis for environmentalstandards,measuresandcontrols. In application of the \"precautionary principle\" of the German environment policy, many measures were taken in order to reduce the exposure of humans and the environment againstlead. Suchmeasures--onaregulatoryaswellasonavoluntaryagreement basis--include: \u007fRestrictions of use of lead. These measures cases where non- acceptablerisksareproven. \u007fReductionof emissionsof leadat productionlevel. \u007fReduction of emissions of user's level (i.e. voluntary agreements on collection andredelivery, incentivesforamoreeffectiverecycling, etc.) \u007fSafertreatment anddepositionof lead-containingwastes. In some cases, proposed regulations concerning lead contents in commercial products162could not be implemented in Germany with respect to the rules of international free trade and regulations of the European Common Market, or their implementation was delayed (for example,introductionof unleadedgasoline). SWEDEN NATIONALLEADRISKSTATEMENT/ RATIONALEFORRISKREDUCTIONMEASURES Lead bioaccumulates and is, in general, very toxic. Current lead use involves dispersion into all environmental media and also gives rise to lead-containing waste that sooner or later willspreadintheenvironment. Metallicleadin the environment will slowly transform and may be takenup by organisms. Exposure to lead may give rise to a number of serious effects on health,especially in occupationally exposed workers and in children. Therefore, the use of lead should bephasedout. In1991, theSwedishGovernment decidedthat measuresshouldbecarriedout in order to phase out the use of lead on a voluntary basis, and in the long run ensure its cessation. Work toensurethat thephaseout iscarriedthrough is now on-going, both at the responsible authorities andwithinindustry.163SWITZERLAND STATEMENTONCURRENTRISKSFROMLEAD NatureofConcernforLead Environment The main general risk of lead was the fine dispersion in the environment by car traffic and the interrelated food intake by man and animals. However, this main source is rapidly decreasingin Switzerland (1984: 510 tonnes lead 1995: tonnes; 2000: 20tonnes.) Lead emission of municipal waste incinerators is decreasing due to extended flue gas treatment. The remaining main source of lead will be the metalworking industry, which is of localconcern. Duetotheuseof winecapsules, about 200tonnesof leadisfoundinurbansolidwaste. The general population exposure is strongly decreasing since the last decade. This is shownbyanalysingfoodandpotteryandbymonitoringhumanbloodlevelsof lead(FOEFL, 1992). Workplace Althoughtheclassicsourcesof exposuretoleadat theworkplacehave been eliminated or greatly reduced, for certain professions, for example battery manufacturing, repairing of steelconstructions of the cable industry, lead still has to be regarded as a severe health problem. Theoccupational exposure limit value (\"MAX-Wert\") for lead and its compounds (except alkylcompounds)isatpresent0.1mg/m 3. Children Recent results of epidemiological investigations indicate that blood lead concentrations of pregnant women as low as 10 to 15 \u00b5g/dl may have a detrimental effect on the development of the central nervous system of the foetus. At present in Switzerland blood lead concentrations in womenof childbearingageinmost casesdonot exceedthisvalue. ( Figure45 , Chapter3) Lead in dust and soil is considered to contribute significantly to childhood lead exposure. The blood lead concentration of children is highly correlated with lead concentrations in dust andsoil (playgrounds). Children -- especially young children -- show a high hand-to-mouth-behaviour.In addition, lead absorption in children is higher (40-60 per cent) than in adults (8-10 per cent).Prolongedexposuretothepollutant resultinginblood lead levels of 10 \u00b5g/dl and higher is known to leadtoareductionof IQ scoresandbehaviouraldifficultiesinchildren.164THEUNITEDKINGDOMVIEW OFRISKSASSOCIATEDWITHEXPOSURETOLEAD Introduction Lead ore is plentiful, accessible and simple to smelt. The metal is heavy, pliable and resistant to corrosion. It is easily melted down and re-used. These properties account for itscomprehensive use both traditionally in building, plumbing and shooting and in more modernapplications like electrical insulation, radiation screening and battery manufacture. Even wheresubstitutes are now preferred or required, artifacts from earlier times survive and are still inwidespreaduse. The Government recognizes that the cumulative effect of centuries of use is that lead is now one of the most widely dispersed of environmental pollutants. Moreover, so far as it is known,there is no harmless form into which lead can be converted in the environment, although the lowsolubility of many of its compounds limits their availability to living organisms. Thus, not only isthere widespread human exposure to lead today but future generations too will be exposed to theleadwhichisalreadyintheenvironment. HealthEffects Frank lead poisoning is rare today and, where identified, is usually associated with exposure to specific localized sources. In recent years, however, there has been growing concernthat lead in the body resulting from general environmental exposure may be harmful atconcentrationswhichfallshort of thoseat whichclinicalsignsandsymptomsappear. In 1983, in a response to the Royal Commission report on lead in the environment, the Government accepted that, despite considerable research, no level has been established at whichlead can be assumed to be safe (DOE 1983). The Government also accepted that, given thehealth uncertainties and the particular characteristics of lead as a widespread toxic pollutant, it wasprudenttoreduceexposuretoitwhereverpracticable. Lead is a neurotoxin which can affect the nervous system of developing children at lower levels than in adults. Particular attention therefore has been paid to the possible health effects ontheintelligenceandbehaviourof youngchildren. A report from the Medical Research Council's Advisory Group on Lead and Neuropsychological Effects in Children (MRC 1983) suggested that any effects of lead at theexposure levels seen in the UK were very small and cannot be detected with any certainty. Thisconclusion was still largely applicable when the group reported again in 1988 but the evidence foranassociationbetweenbodyburdenandIQ wasnowstronger(MRC1988). The group observed that whilst statistical associations detailed in the numerous studies reviewed were consistent with the hypothesis that low level lead exposure has a small negativeeffect on the performance of children in ability and attainment tests, the limitations of theepidemiological studies in drawing causal inferences were such that is was not possible toconclude that exposure to lead at current urban levels was definitely harmful. In view of these165conclusions it was recommended that it would be prudent to continue to reduce the exposure to environmentallead. Exposure The average blood lead levels in the population as a whole have declined substantially over the past decade by 4to 5percent per annum. Figures from the last national survey of bloodlead levels in 1987 (DOE 1990) gave a geometric mean in the region of 6.9to 9.7\u00b5g/dl blood leadfor adults and 7.1to 7.5\u00b5g/dl blood lead for children. Recent small scale local investigationsindicate that the trend of declining average blood lead is continuing. Blood lead levels can beinfluencedbynumerousfactors,mostarerelatedtothesourcesofexposure. A report titled \"Lead in the Environment and its Significance to Man\", produced by the Department of the Environment in 1974, provided the first comprehensive summary of theexposure pathways to humans (DOE 1974). Several key sources of exposure were identified anda programme to safeguard human health was outlined. These included lead in paint, petrol,drinking water and food. Subsequent action was later reviewed in the report of the RoyalCommission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP 1983). Amongst the numerous recommendationswhich the Royal Commission called for were, further reduction in the lead content of petrol leadingto the phasing out of lead additives altogether, reductions in the use of lead in household paintsand continued remedial programmes of water treatment and lead pipe replacement. The variouspolicy objectives and risk reduction measures taken are detailed in the summary of UnitedKingdomactions. References Department of theEnvironment, UK(1983).

A combination of factors (for example, lead's physical characteristics and cost) make lead an attractive material for a wide variety of applications;therefore, lead provides large economic benefits to its users. However, lead's widespread use hasresulted in large amounts of lead being deposited to air, land and water. Lead is an elementalpollutant that does not disintegrate. Thus, the total amount of lead pollutants resulting from humanactivity will increase with time no matter how little additional lead is added to the environment. Thecurrent production, use and disposal of lead are highly regulated with demonstrably effectiveresults. However, because of its previous widespread use and persistence, lead exposure is apervasiveproblem, affectinganumberof localpopulations. Lead is a powerful toxicant and produces adverse effects even at low levels . Lead is a poison that affects virtually every system in the body. Severe exposures can cause coma,convulsions and death. Lower levels cause adverse effects on the central nervous system,kidneys, reproductive system and blood production system (1). Children are particularlysusceptible to lead poisoning. Blood lead (PbB) levels at least as low as 10 to 15 \u00b5g/dl are associated with decreased intelligence and slowed neurological development; low levels have also been associated with deficits in growth, vitamin metabolism and effects on hearing. Chronicchildhood lead exposure may not produce clinical symptoms especially at lower levels, and manycasesgoundiagnosedanduntreated. Lead'sneurologicaleffectson children are profound and arelikely persistent. In 1992, the Residential Lead-based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 wasenacted (Title X). This law provides the framework for a national approach to reduce hazards fromlead-based paint exposure, primarily in housing. It will establish a national infrastructure of trainedworkers, training programmes and proficient laboratories, and a public education programme toreducehazardsfromexposuretoleadinpaint inthenation'shousingstock. Lead is deposited in bone over the lifetime of the exposed individual. Long after exposure hasceased, somephysiologicalevent such as serious illness or pregnancy may release this storedlead from the bone and produce adverse health effects such as impaired hemoglobin synthesis,alteration in the central and peripheral nervous systems, hypertension, effects on male and femalereproductivesystems,and damage to the developing fetus. These effects may occur at PbB levelsbelow50 \u00b5g/dlandarelikelytobedependent onthelevelanddurationof exposure(2)(3)(11). Because of continuing epidemiological research that has detected adverse health effects from lead at levels lower than those previously regarded as toxic, the level of concern for childhoodlead poisoning in the US has been steadily lowered over the past twenty years. Scientific evidenceshowing effects of PbB levels below 25 \u00b5g/dl in children has recently compelled the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to lower the threshold for lead poisoning prevention activities to PbB levels of 10 \u00b5g/dl. Earlier, EPA had lowered the level of concern to 10 \u00b5g/dl in 1986 (8) and ATSDR identified the same level of concern in the 1988 report to Congress on childhood lead poisoning167(10). Childhood lead poisoning is widely recognized in the US as the most widespread and preventable childhood health problem associated with environmental exposures . In 1984, an estimated 2.4 million (17 per cent) of children living in Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas in theUS had PbB levels above 15 \u00b5g/dl (10). Though widely perceived as a problem of inner city minority children, in fact, lead poisoning in the US affects children from all areas and from all socio- economicgroups. Adults also face health risks from lead, possibly at low PbB levels . NIOSH has issued a health alert to construction workers warning them to the possibility of adverse health effectsresulting from long-term, low-level exposure (11). NIOSH has committed to a goal of eliminatingoccupationalexposuresthat result inworkershavingbloodleadlevelsgreaterthan25\u00b5g/dl(11). Though the average level of lead exposure has dropped, the prevalence of poisoning and population exposures are still of concern . The percentage of children with elevated blood lead has declined substantially over the last twenty years, with average PbB levels dropping from over 15 toabout 5 \u00b5g/dl (1). The US has made important strides in reducing exposures to lead, notably throughreductionsof leadingasoline; in food can solder; in atmospheric deposition in soil/dust and on food crops; and in new residential paint (1). However, despite progress in reducing averageleadexposures, current leadexposuresamongchildrenat risk remain problematic, especially sincethere is little margin of safety between current blood lead levels and levels now believed to causeeffects in children. Though the effects of lead at low levels are not as severe as those at high-levels, a larger number of children are affected at these levels, making these exposures animportant publichealthconcern(10). Household dust derived from deteriorated lead-based paint is the most important source of high-level lead exposures in the US . Because lead is a multi-media pollutant, all sources contribute to the overall problem. However, there is general consensus that deteriorated lead-based paint (applied prior to actions taken to ban the use of lead in residential paint) is the majorsource of high-dose lead poisoning in US children. Other sources contribute to overall exposure,but such paint is associated with highest exposures (5). Millions of private homes in the US withlead-based paint continue to be occupied by families with small children, and there is no apparentcorrelationbetweenincidenceof lead-basedpaint and income of the household (7). Notably, manyhouses with lead-based paint are rental units that will be rented to many different families over theyears. Thus, a single house with deteriorated lead-based paint can be the source of exposure formanychildren(8). Other important sources of lead exposure include soil/dust; drinking water; occupational exposures; airborne lead from point sources (for example, smelters); hazardous waste sites; andproducts containing lead . Lead-contaminated soil and dust are widespread, and are often associated with structures containing lead-based paint (such as houses, bridges, and water tanks). Drinking water can be contaminated with lead that can leach from pipes carrying water to homes, from lead-soldered pipe joints, and from lead in brass and bronze plumbing fittings and fixtures.Given the actions taken to date to control other sources of lead, in some areas of the US drinkingwaterremainsanimportant sourceof leadexposure, especiallytochildren. US regulatory activities, such as decreases of lead in gasoline and in residential paint and the voluntary programme by the domestic food industry to discontinue use of lead solder in foodcans, have resulted in significant reductions in average levels of lead exposure. Nevertheless, theUS still considers current levels of lead exposure to be an important public health problem,168especially in high risk communities. In recognition of the extent and severity of lead exposure in the US, various Federal government agencies and bodies have initiated further activities to reduceleadexposuresinavarietyof settings. Theseactivitiesinclude: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have lowered the level of PbB of concern in children from 25 \u00b5g/dl to 10 \u00b5g/dl (1). Recognition of this level of concern in the United States dates back to 1986 (8)(10). CDC has also identified an agenda for the first five years of a 20-year effort to reduce the number of lead-poisoned children in the US, including: screening high-riskcommunities, with appropriate environmental and medical follow-up for poisoned children;conducting studies to determine the impact of interventions on children's blood lead levels; andestablishingnationalsurveillancefor childrenwithelevatedPbBlevels(5). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has been involved in several activities related to the prevention of occupational exposures to lead. These include thepublication of an alert providing recommendations for preventing lead poisoning during blasting,sanding, cutting, burning or welding of bridges and other steel structures coated with lead paint(11). NIOSH also collaborated with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) onguidelines for the prevention of lead exposure for construction workers (12). NIOSH has alsocommitted to a goal of eliminating occupational exposures that result in workers having blood leadlevels greater than 25 \u00b5g/dl. Finally, NIOSH is currently evaluating health data in the development of criteriaforarecommendedoccupationalstandardforlead. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the US Department of Labor has established environmental and biological standards for lead-using industries. Standardstake the form of both permissible workplace air contaminants and permissible blood levels inworkers. Environmental and biological monitoring must be conducted by the employer. Elevatedblood lead levels may require the removal of an individual from the work place. The currentPermissible Exposure Level (PEL) generally limits air concentrations of lead to 50 \u00b5g/m 3. OSHA's general industry lead standard also requires employers who have employees exposed to leadabove an action level of 30 \u00b5g/m 3to implement a programme that includes provisions for methods of compliance, medical surveillance, exposure monitoring, training, regulated areas, respiratoryprotection, protective work clothing and equipment, housekeeping, hygiene facilities and practices,signs and labels, recordkeeping and the need to limit exposures below 50 \u00b5g/m 3. OSHA's PEL for lead in the construction industry is 200 \u00b5g/m3. Under Title X, OSHA is required to promulgate interimfinalstandardsforoccupationalexposuretoleadintheconstructionindustry. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) Lead Poisoning Project seeks to prevent lead poisoning of consumers. In 1990, CPSC published a consumer safety alert/brochureon lead paint in the home (13), based on the HUD abatement interim guidelines. CPSC is alsoevaluating lead test kits for safety, efficacy, and consumer-friendliness. These kits are potentialscreening devices that may be used by the consumer to detect lead in paint and other materials.The Commission staff is also evaluating recent data on lead toxicity to determine the need to lowerthe existing allowable lead limit for paint (currently 0.06 per cent by weight in dried paint film). Insupport of thiseffort, nationalmarketplacesamplesof residentialpaint arebeinganalysedforlead. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) submitted to Congress a comprehensive plan to address the lead-based paint problem in private housing (7). Activitiesinclude updating the lead-based paint regulations in HUD programmes; updating regulations fordealing with lead-based paint in Federally owned property; providing support for local screeningprogrammes; increasing public education; supporting research to reduce the cost and improve the169reliability of testing and abatement; supporting research on the cost-effectiveness of various abatement techniques; evaluating strategies to address exterior soil lead and dust and interior dustlead; increasing state and local support; and providing more money to support abatement in lowand moderate income households. HUD estimated that the total cost of testing and abatement inhigh-priority hazard homes would be about $8 to 10 billion annually over ten years. The costscould be lowered substantially by integrating abatement with other renovation activities. In 1992,HUD awarded $47.7 million to states and communities for the abatement of lead-based paint inprivately-owned low and middle income housing. The agency plans to award an additional $90millionin1993. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed a strategy to reduce lead exposures\"tothefullest extent practicable, withparticularinterest inreducingtheriskto children, toavoid high blood lead levels\" (6). Two specific objectives of the lead strategy are (a) to significantlyreduce the incidence of PbB levels above 10 \u00b5g/dl in children, and (b) to reduce lead exposures that are anticipated to pose risks to children, the general public, or the environment. EPA aims to accomplish these goals by identifying geographical \"hot spots,\" implementing a lead pollutionprevention programme, strengthening environmental standards, developing and providinginformation on cost-effective abatement technologies, encouraging the availability ofenvironmentally safe recycling, implementing a public information programme, aggressivelyenforcingexistingenvironmentalstandards, andincreasingresearchinmanyof theseareas. Under Title X, EPA is mandated to promulgate regulations ensuring that those engaged in abatement activities are trained and that training programmes are certified, to establish standardsfor abatement activities, to promulgate model State programmes from compliance with training andaccreditation regulation, to establish a laboratory accreditation programme, to establish aclearinghouse for dissemination of information, to promulgate regulations for the disclosure of leadhazards at property transfer, to conduct a study on the hazards of renovation and remodelingactivities, andtodevelopregulationstoidentifyleadhazardsinpaint, dust, andsoil. TheFoodandDrugAdministration (FDA) hascontinuedwithitsprogrammetoidentify and mitigate sources of lead in the diet, particularly those in foods consumed by infants, children andpregnant women. Voluntary efforts as well as reduced action levels have resulted in reducing leadexposures from food cans and from lead-glazed ceramic ware. Other sources of dietary lead forwhich regulatory measures are being introduced include wine, dietary supplements, crystal ware,foodadditivesandbottledwater.

Emphasis has been given to data which have become availablesince the publication of Environmental Health Criteria 3: Lead (WHO 1977). The environmentaleffects of lead are discussed in Environmental Health Criteria 85: Lead - Environmental Aspects(WHO 1989). 1.1Identity,physicalandchemicalproperties,andanalyticalmethods Lead is a soft, silvery grey metal, melting at 327.5 \u00b0C. It is highly resistant to corrosion, but is soluble in nitric and hot sulfuric acids. The usual valence state in inorganic lead compounds is +2. Solubilities in water vary, lead sulfide and lead oxides being poorly soluble and the nitrate,chlorate and chloride salts reasonably soluble in cold water. Lead also forms salts with suchorganic acids as lactic and acetic, and stable organic compounds such as tetraethyllead andtetramethyllead. The most commonly used methods for the analysis of low concentrations of lead in biological and environmental materials are flame, graphite furnace, and inductively coupled plasmaand atomic absorption spectroscopy and anode stripping voltammetry. Depending on samplepretreatment, extraction techniques and analytical instrumentation, detection limits of 0.12 \u00b5moleslead/litre blood (2.49 \u00b5g/dl) can be achieved. However, reliable results are obtained only whenspecific procedures are followed to minimize the risk of contamination during sample collection,storage,processingandanalysis. 1.2Sourcesofhumanexposure Levels of lead in the earth's crust are about 20 mg/kg. Lead in the environment may derive from either natural or anthropogenic sources. Natural sources of atmospheric lead includegeological weathering and volcanic emissions and have been estimated to produce 19 000tonnes/year, compared to an estimate of 126 000 tonnes/year emitted to the air from the mining,smeltingandconsumptionof over3milliontonnesof leadperyear. Atmospheric lead concentrations of 50 pg/m 3have found in remote areas. Backgroundlevelsof leadinsoilrangebetween10and70mg/kg, andameanlevel near roadwaysof 138 mg/kg has been reported. Present levels of lead in water rarely exceed a fewmicrogrammesperlitre; thenaturalconcentrationof leadinsurfacewaterhasbeenestimatedtobe0.02\u00b5g/litre. 5The content of this chapter has been approved by an IPCS Task Group, 1-6 February 1993. During technical editing correctionsmaybemadetonumbersquoted,however,thesewillnotaffecttheconclusionsshown.172Lead and its compounds may enter the environment at any point during mining, smelting, processing, use, recycling or disposal. Major uses are in batteries, cables, pigments, petrol(gasoline) additives, solder and steel products. Lead and lead compounds are also used in solderapplied to water distribution pipes and to seams of cans used to store foods, in some traditionalremedies, in bottle closures for alcoholic beverages and in ceramic glazes and crystal tableware.In countries where leaded petrol is still used, the major air emission is from mobile and stationarysources of petrol combustion (urban centres). Areas in the vicinity of lead mines and smelters aresubject tohigh-levelsof airemissions. Airborne lead can be deposited on soil and water, reaching humans through the food chainandindrinking-water. Atmosphericleadisalsoamajorsourceof leadinhouseholddust. 1.3Environmentaltransport,distributionandtransformation The transport and distribution of lead from fixed, mobile and natural sources is primarily via air. Most lead emissions are deposited near the source, although some particulate matter (<2 \u00b5m) is transported over long distances and results in the contamination of remote sites such asarctic glaciers. Airborne lead can contribute to human exposures by the contamination of food,water and dust, as well as through direct inhalation. The removal of airborne lead is influenced byatmospheric conditions and particulate size. Large amounts of lead may be discharged to soil andwater. However, such material tends to remain localized because of the poor solubility of leadcompoundsinwater. Lead deposited in water, whether from air or through run-off from soils, partitions rapidly between sediment and aqueous phase, the rate depending upon pH, salt content, and thepresenceof organicchelatingagents. Above pH 5.4, hard water may contain about 30 \u00b5g lead/litreand soft water about 500 \u00b5g lead/litre. Very little lead deposited on soil is transported to surface orground water except through erosion or geochemical weathering; it is normally quite tightly bound(chelated)toorganicmatter. Airborne lead can be directly transferred to biota or through uptake from soil. Animals can be exposed to lead directly through grazing and soil ingestion or by inhalation. There is littlebiomagnificationof inorganicleadthroughthefoodchain. 1.4Environmentallevelsandhumanexposure In the general non-smoking adult population, the major exposure pathway is from food and water. Airborne lead may contribute significantly to exposure, depending upon such factors asuse of tobacco, occupation, proximity to motorways, lead smelters, etc., and leisure activities (forexample, arts and crafts, firearm target practice). Food, air, water and dust/soil are the majorpotential exposure pathways for infants and young children. For infants up to 4 or 5 months, air,milkformulaeandwaterarethesignificant sourcesof leadexposure. Levels of lead found in air, food, water and soil/dust vary widely throughout the world and depend upon the degree of industrial development, urbanization and lifestyle factors. Ambient airlevels of over 10 \u00b5g/m 3have been reported in urban areas near a smelter, whereas lead levels below 0.2 \u00b5g/m3have been found in cities where leaded petrol is no longer used. Lead intake from173aircan, therefore, varyfromlessthan4\u00b5g/daytomorethan200\u00b5g/day. Levels of lead in drinking-water sampled at the source are usually below 5 \u00b5g/litre. However, water taken from taps (faucets) in homes where lead is present in the plumbing cancontain levels in excess of 100 \u00b5g/litre, particularly after the water has been standing in the pipesforsomehours. The level of dietary exposure to lead depends upon many lifestyle factors, including foodstuffs consumed, processing technology, use of lead solder, lead levels in water, and use ofleadglazedceramics. For infants and children, lead in dust and soil often constitutes a major exposure pathway. Leadlevelsindust dependuponsuchfactorsastheage and condition of housing, the use of lead- based paints, lead in petrol and urban density. The intake of lead will be influenced by the age andbehaviouralcharacteristicsof thechildand bioavailabilityof leadinthesourcematerial. Inhalation is the dominant pathway for lead exposure of workers in industries producing, refining, using or disposing of lead and lead compounds. During an 8-h shift, workers can absorbas much as 400 \u00b5g lead, in addition to the 20-30 \u00b5g/day absorbed from food, water and ambientair; significant intakemayoccurfromingestionof largeinhaledparticulatematerial. 1.5Kineticsandmetabolisminlaboratoryanimalsandhumans Lead is absorbed in humans and animals following inhalation or ingestion; percutaneous absorption is minimal in humans. Depending upon chemical speciation, particle size, and solubilityin body fluids, up to 50 per cent of the inhaled lead compound may be absorbed. Some inhaledparticulate matter (larger than 1 \u00b5m) is swallowed following mucociliary clearance from therespiratory tract. In experimental animals and humans, absorption of lead from the gastrointestinaltract is influenced by the physicochemical nature of the ingested material, nutritional status, andtype of diet consumed. In adult humans approximately 10 per cent of the dietary lead is absorbed;the proportion is higher under fasting conditions. However, in infants and young children as muchas 50 per cent of dietary lead is absorbed, although absorption rates for lead from dusts/soils andpaint chips can be lower depending upon the bioavailability. Diets that are deficient in calcium,phosphate, selenium or zinc may lead to increased lead absorption. Iron and vitamin D also affectabsorptionof lead. Blood lead (PbB) levels are used as a measure of body burden and absorbed (internal) doses of lead. The relationship between blood lead and concentration of lead in exposure sourcesiscurvilinear. Once it has been absorbed, lead is not distributed homogeneously throughout the body. There is rapid uptake into blood and soft tissue, followed by a slower redistribution to bone. Boneaccumulates lead over much of the human life span and may serve as an endogenous source oflead. The half-life for lead in blood and other soft tissues is about 28-36 days and much longer inthe various bone compartments. The percentage retention of lead in body stores is higher inchildrenthanadults. Transferof leadtothehumanfetusoccursreadilythroughout gestation. Blood lead is the most commonly used measure of lead exposure. However, techniques are now available for measuring lead in teeth and bone, although the kinetics are not fully174understood.1751.6Effectsonlaboratorymammals;invitrosystems In all species of experimental animals studied, including non-human primates, lead has been shown to cause adverse effects in several organs and organ systems, including thehaemopoietic, nervous, renal, cardiovascular, reproductive and immune systems. Lead alsoaffectsboneandhasbeenshowntobecarcinogenicinratsandmice. Despite kinetic differences between experimental animal species and humans, these studies provide strong biological support and plausibility for the findings in humans. Impairedlearning/memory abilities have been reported in rats with PbB levels of 0.72-0.96 \u00b5moles/litre(15-20 \u00b5g/dl) and in non-human value similar to that reported to initiate renal effects in humans. Cardiovascular effects havebeen seen in rats after chronic low-level exposures resulting in PbB levels of 0.24-1.92 \u00b5mol/litre(5-40 \u00b5g/dl). Tumours have not been shown to occur below the maximum tolerated dose of 200mg lead (as lead acetate) per litre of drinking-water. This is the maximum dose level notassociatedwithothermorphologicalorfunctionalchanges. 1.7Effectsonhumans In humans, lead can result in a wide range of biological effects depending upon the level and duration of exposure. Effects at the subcellular level, as well as effects on the overallfunctioning of the body, have been noted and range from inhibition of enzymes to the production ofmarked morphological changes and death. Such changes occur over a broad range of doses, thedevelopinghumangenerallybeingmoresensitivethantheadult. Lead has been shown to have effects on many biochemical processes; in particular, effects on haem synthesis have been studied extensively in both adults and children. Increasedlevels of serum erythrocyte protoporphyrin and increased urinary excretion of coproporphyrin and -aminolaevulinic acid are observed when blood lead concentrations are elevated. Inhibition of the enzymes -aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase and dihydrobiopterin reductase are observed at lower levels. The effects of lead on the haemopoietic system result in decreased haemoglobin synthesis, and anaemia has been observed in children at blood lead concentrations above 1.92\u00b5mol/litre(40\u00b5g/dl). For neurological, metabolic and behavioural reasons, children are more vulnerable to the effects of lead than adults. Both prospective and cross-sectional epidemiological studies havebeen conducted to assess the extent to which environmental lead exposure affects CNS-basedpsychological functions. Lead has been shown to be associated with impaired neurobehaviouralfunctioninginchildren. Impairment of psychological and neurobehavioural functions has been found after long- term lead exposure of workers. Furthermore, electrophysiological parameters have been shown tobeusefulindicatorsof subclinicalleadeffectsintheCNS.176Peripheral neuropathy has long been known to be caused by long-term high-level exposure at the workplace. Slowing of nerve conduction velocity has been found at lower levels.Theseeffectshaveoftenbeenfoundtobereversibleaftercessationof exposure, dependingontheageanddurationof exposure. The effect of lead on the heart is only indirect and occurs via the autonomic nervous system; it has no direct effect on the myocardium. The collective evidence from population studiesin adults indicates very weak associations between blood lead concentration and systolic ordiastolic blood pressure. Given the difficulties of allowing for relevant confounding factors, a causalrelationship cannot be established from these studies. There is no evidence to suggest that anyassociationof bloodleadconcentrationwithbloodpressureisof majorhealthimportance. Lead is known to cause proximal renal tubular damage, characterized by generalized aminoaciduria, hypophosphataemia with relative hyperphosphaturia and glycosuria accompaniedby nuclear mitochondrial changes and cytomogaly of the proximal tubularepithelial cells. Tubular effects are noted after relatively short-term exposures and are generallyreversible, whereas sclerotic changes and interstitial fibrosis, resulting in decreased kidney functionand possible renal failure, require chronic exposure to high lead levels. Increased risk fromnephropathy was noted in workers with a PbB level of over 3.0 \u00b5mol/litre (about 60 \u00b5g/dl). Renaleffects have been recently seen among general populations where more sensitive indicators offunctionweremeasured. The reproductive effects of lead in the male are limited to sperm morphology and count. Inthefemale, someadversepregnancyoutcomeshavebeenattributedtolead. Lead does not appear to have deleterious effects on skin, muscle or the immune system. Except inthecaseof therat, leaddoesnot appeartoberelatedtothedevelopment of tumours. 1.8Evaluationofhumanhealthrisks-Conclusions Lead adversely affects several organs and organ systems, with subcellular changes and neurodevelopmental effects appearing to be the most sensitive. An association between bloodleadandhypertension(bloodpressure)hasbeen reported. Lead produces a cascade of effects onthe haem body pool and affects haem synthesis. However, some of these effects are notconsideredadverse. Calciumhomeostasisisaffectedthusinterferingwithothercellularprocesses. a) The most substantial evidence from cross-sectional and prospective studies of populations with PbB levels generally below 1.2 \u00b5mol/litre (25 \u00b5g/dl) relates todetriments in IQ. It is important to note that such observational studies cannot providedefinitive evidence of a causal relationship with lead exposure. However, the size ofthe apparent IQ effect, as assessed at 4 years and above, is a deficit between 0 and 5points (on a scale with a standard deviation of 15) for each 0.48\u00b5mol/litre (10 \u00b5g/dl)increment in PbB level, with a likely apparent effect size of between 1 and 3 points. AtPbB levels above 1.2 \u00b5mol/litre (25 \u00b5g/dl), the relationship between PbB and IQ maydiffer. Estimates of effect size are group averages and only apply to the individualchildinaprobabilisticmanner. Existing epidemiological studies do not provide definitive evidence of a threshold. Below the PbB range of 0.48 to 0.72 \u00b5mol/litre (10-15 \u00b5g/dl), the effect of confounding177variables and limits in the precision of analytical and psychometric measurements increases the uncertainty attached to any estimate of effect. However, there is someevidenceof anassociationbelowthisrange. b) Animal studies provide support for a causal relationship between lead and nervous system effects, reporting deficits in cognitive functions which occur at PbB levels aslow as 0.53-0.72 \u00b5mol/litre (11-15 \u00b5g/dl) and which can persist well beyond theterminationof leadexposure. c) Reduction in peripheral nerve conduction velocity may occur with PbB levels as low as 1.44 \u00b5mol/litre (30 \u00b5g/dl). In addition, sensory motor function may be impaired withPbB levels as low as about 1.92 \u00b5mol/litre (40 \u00b5g/dl), and autonomic nervous systemfunction (electrocardiographic R-R interval variability) may be affected at an averagePbB level of approximately 1.68 \u00b5mol/litre (35 \u00b5g/dl). The risk of lead nephropathy isincreasedinworkerswithPbBlevelsabove2.88\u00b5mol/litre(60 \u00b5g/dl). However, recentstudies using more sensitive indicators of renal function suggest renal effects at lowerlevelsof leadexposure. d) Lead exposure is associated with a small increase in blood pressure. The likely order of magnitude is that for any two-fold increase in PbB (for example, from 0.8 to 1.6\u00b5mol/litre, i.e. 16.6 to 33.3 \u00b5g/dl), there is a mean 1 mmHg increase in systolic bloodpressure. The association with diastolic pressure is of a similar but smaller magnitude. However, thereisdoubt regardingwhetherthese statistical associations are really due toaneffectofleadexposureorareanartifactduetoconfoundingfactors. e) Some but not all epidemiological studies show a dose-dependent association of pre- term delivery and some indices of fetal growth and maturation at PbB levels of 0.72\u00b5mol/litre(15\u00b5g/dl) or more. f) The evidence for carcinogenicity of lead and several inorganic lead compounds in humansisinadequate. g) Effects of lead on a number of enzyme systems and biochemical parameters have been demonstrated. The PbB levels, above which effects are demonstrable withcurrent techniques for the parameters that may have clinical significance, are allgreater than 0.96 \u00b5mol/litre (20 \u00b5g/dl. Some demonstrable atlowerPbBlevels, but theclinicalsignificanceisuncertain.1789. EvaluationofHumanHealthRisks6 9.1Exposureassessment Lead is an ubiquitous element detected in all environmental media. However, natural sources contribute only a small fraction of the amounts of lead found in air, food, water and dust.The majority of lead in these media arises from automobile and industrial emissions and from theuseof lead-containing solder and paints. Adults and older children receive the largest proportion oflead intake from foods, whereas for young children dust, soil and food all make significantcontributions to the total lead intake. The major contributions to lead in soil and outdoor dust arefrom the combustion of fossil fuels (principally leaded petrol), stationary sources such as smelters,andpeelingandflakingof lead-basedpaint. 9.1.1 Generalpopulationexposure In the absence of specific stationary sources of lead, concentrations in ambient air are directly related to the density of traffic and whether lead is still utilized as an additive in petrol.Reduction or elimination of lead in petrol in those countries which have instituted regulations hasresultedinadeclinebyasmuchaseight-foldinambient airconcentrationsof lead. Levels of lead in indoor air are affected by the presence of cigarette smoke and dust from lead-paintedsurfaces. Without such sources, air lead levels indoors are about 60 per cent of thoseinambient air. For most adults, the total daily exposure to lead is via food, water and air. For infants ageduptofivemonths, formulaorbreast milk, andwaterarethemainsources of lead. In children,an additional source of exposure is dust and soils. Absorption is dependent on the chemical formof lead, type of soil and particle size (bioavailability). Lead intake may be augmented from unusualsources such as folk remedies, cosmetics and hobby activity. Community contamination andworkplacepracticesmaycontributetoleadexposure. Food (including drinking-water and beverages) is the major source of lead exposure for the general population. Infants and children may receive an added lead burden from soil and dust. The most significant foodstuffs vary from country to country. In areas still utilizing lead-soldered cans, levels of lead are substantially higher. Depending upon life-styles, there may be significantoral intake of lead from some alcoholic beverages and due to the leaching of lead from low-temperature-firedceramiccontainers. Most drinking-water supplies contain lead levels of less than 5 \u00b5g/litre when they leave the treatment plant. However, where the water is known to be plumbo-solvent, up to 40 per cent of thesamples may exceed 100 \u00b5g/litre in homes where lead solder, lead pipes and/or brass fixtureshavebeenused. 6The content of this chapter has been approved by an IPCS Task Group, 1-6 February 1993. During technical editing correctionsmaybemadetonumbersquoted,however,thesewillnotaffecttheconclusionsasshown.179Absorption of lead from the lung is a function of particle size and pulmonary deposition pattern. Small particles (< 0.5 \u00b5m) characteristic of ambient air will be deposited deeply in thelungs with absorption rates of 90 per cent. Larger particles, such as may be encountered inoccupational settings, exhibit high deposition rates in the upper airway. Absorption of suchparticles will be a function of both dissolution in the lung and particle clearance to thegastrointestinaltract. Human dermal absorption of inorganic lead through unabraded skin is of limited significance. 9.1.2 Occupational exposures In addition to exposure from lead in ambient air, water and food, some workers may be exposed to airborne lead and dust within the workplace. Actual levels will vary according to theengineeringdesignof theprocessequipment andtheindustrialhygienepracticesutilized. 9.2Criticalissuesrelatedtoexposureevaluation In view of the heterogeneity of responses to lead within human populations, the complex interrelationships between exposure to lead and a biological indicator for internal dose requireconsiderationofseveralkeyissuesinordertoassesshumanexposures. 9.2.1 Samplingandanalyticalconcerns Reliable comparisons of reported levels of exposure and/or dose can only be made where authors have described the analytical and sampling procedures in sufficient detail to allow thereader to assess, for example, the integrity of the sampling procedures as well as the specificity,precision and accuracy of all analytical methods. Problems related to sampling cord blood alsoneedtobeconsidered. Most studies have utilized analytical procedures of high quality. However, in comparing results, consideration must be given to blood collection procedures (finger stick versusvenepuncture). 9.2.2 Datapresentation Inter-study comparisons of lead exposures are complicated by the variety of methods used to present results including median values as well as geometric and arithmetic means. Someauthorshaveusedlogtransformeddata. In assessing exposure from data on teeth, one must know which tooth and which compartments within the tooth were sampled. Also, if data are to be compared between studies,authors must state explicitly that all teeth analysed were without caries and were shedspontaneously. The exposure index lifetime average blood lead (PbB) level has assisted in the180assessment of cumulative exposures from serial blood lead data. It should not be interpreted as beingequivalent toasinglebloodleaddeterminationat asinglepoint inlife. For some data/analytical purposes, more appropriate than alifetimeaverage. 9.3Relationshipbetweenexposureanddose Themost widelyusedsurrogatefortheabsorbeddoseiswholePbBconcentration. The relationship between PbB level and lead intake is curvilinear over a wide range of PbB values. On the basis of a single study of 17 infants, the relationship between PbB level andlead intake from food has been determined to be 0.16 \u00b5g lead/dl blood per \u00b5g lead intake per dayforamedianPbBlevelof approximately10\u00b5g/dl. Most studies of the relationship between PbB level and lead exposures apply to a single environmental source, i.e. air, food, water or soil/dust. A summary of the relationship between PbBlevelandleadintakefromindividualmediaisgiveninTable9.1. purposes, recognizing that the relationships are curvilinear innature,andarebroadguidelinesthatwillnotapplyatlowerorhigherlevelsofexposure. bA value of between 3 and 5 \u00b5g/dl per \u00b5g/m3intake is obtained when one considers indirect contribution throughdepositiononsoil/dust.181cThe relationship of air lead to blood lead concentrations in occupational settings is best described by a curvilinear relationshiphavingslopes between 0.02 and 0.08 \u00b5g/dl per \u00b5g/m3air). 9.4Surrogatemeasuresofdose 9.4.1 Blood Whole PbB values are widely used as a measure of absorbed dose. However, it is believed that plasma lead concentrations may better reflect the ``active'' fraction of lead in bloodand define the relationship between blood lead and tissue or organ accumulation (and effect),although there is little experimental data (because of analytical limitations). Blood lead isdistributed between plasma and the erythrocyte, with less than 5 per cent being in the plasma;most of theleadisboundtohaemoglobin. Venous and capillary blood levels are generally equivalent provided that the sampling techniquehasbeendemonstratedtobeadequate. 9.4.2 Urine Urinary measurements of lead concentration are of limited value, although they are used occasionallyasascreeningtest foroccupationalpopulationgroups. 9.4.3 Bone Bone lead may be measured by non-invasive X-ray fluorescence but it is limited in sensitivityat present. 9.4.4 Tooth Shed deciduous teeth have been used to provide an index of exposure in early childhood. Interpretationof theanalyticaldataisdependent onwhichtoothandwhichpart of that tooth of leadexposure. 9.5Biochemicaleffectsoflead 9.5.1 Haemsynthesis Evaluation of the quality of analytical data is an important aspect in considering reports182describingeffectsattributedtolead. It shouldbenotedthat much of the data presented in this area hasnotbeenasvigorouslyscrutinizedas,forexample,psychometricstudydata. An increase in EP in children occurs between PbB levels of 0.72 and 1.2 \u00b5mol/litre (15-25\u00b5g/dl). Increases in EP can be detected in men when the PbB level is above1.20-1.44\u00b5mol/litre (25-30 \u00b5g/dl); and in women In children 1-5 years old, there is a linear relationship with PbB in the range 1.2-3.6 \u00b5mol/litre (25-75 \u00b5g/dl). 9.5.1.3 excretion of increases in above 2.16 \u00b5mol/litre (45 \u00b5g/dl) andinwomenabove1.68\u00b5mol/litre(35\u00b5g/dl). 9.5.1.4 -Aminolevulinicaciddehydratase(ALAD) There was a negative exponential relationship between PbB level and ALAD activity in a population of 10- to 13-year-old children with PbB levels in the range 0.19-1.97 \u00b5mol/litre (4.7-41\u00b5g/dl). An effect was seen at a PbB level of approximately 0.48 status, PbB levels below 0.96 \u00b5mol/litre (20 \u00b5g/dl) appear to have no demonstrable effect on circulating concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D.APbBlevel above 0.9 \u00b5mol/litre (20 \u00b5g/dl) is associated with a decrease in the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD. 9.5.3 Dihydrobiopterinreductase Inhibition of dihydrobiopterin reductase mean PbB levelisaslowas0.48\u00b5mol/litre(10\u00b5g/dl).1839.5.4 Haemopoieticsystem 9.5.4.1 Anaemia-adults The estimated PbB level haemoglobin levels in children occur at a PbB level of approximately 1.92\u00b5mol/litre (40 \u00b5g/dl). Anaemia, defined as a haematocrit below 35 per cent, is not found at aPbB level of less than 0.92 \u00b5mol/litre (20 \u00b5g/dl). The risk of having a haematocrit value below 35per cent for a 1-year-old child was 2 per cent at a PbB level of 0.96-1.87 \u00b5mol/litre (20-39 \u00b5g/dl);the contribution of iron deficiency may account for a substantial proportion of this 2 per cent.Inductionof anaemiaisdemonstrableat 1.92\u00b5mol/litre(40\u00b5g/dl). 9.5.4.3 Erythrocytepyrimidine-5'-nucleotidase A reduction by 20 per cent or more in erythrocyte pyrimidine-5'-nucleotidase activity is associatedwithPbBconcentrationsabove10\u00b5g/dl. It was concluded that effects of lead were demonstrable on a number of enzyme systems and biochemical parameters. The PbB levels, above which effects are demonstrable with currenttechniques for the parameters which may have clinical significance, are all greater than0.96\u00b5mol/litre (20 \u00b5g/dl). Some clinically insignificant effects on PbB. 9.6Nervoussystem 9.6.1 exposure resulting in a PbB level in excess of 80 \u00b5g/dl, severe encephalopathy and/or coma may occur. CNS symptoms are found in lead-exposed adults whenthere is a history of several years of exposure to lead at PbB levels that may not have exceeded1853.36 \u00b5mol/litre (70\u00b5g/dl) and a PbB at the time of clinical assessment of at least 1.92 \u00b5mol/litre (40 \u00b5g/dl). Impaired neurobehavioural test performance has been found in lead-exposed workers. Changes in critical flicker fusion test have been detected at a PbB level of about 2.4 \u00b5mol/litre(50\u00b5g/dl). Sensory motor function is generally more sensitive than cognitive end-points in manyneurobehavioural evaluations, with the lowest-observed-effect level being at about 1.92 \u00b5mol/litre(40\u00b5g/dl). It appears also that neuroelectrophysiological tests are sensitive indicators of the CNS effects of lead. Reductions in latencies of sensory evoked potentials and auditory event-relatedpotentials have been found in workers with average PbB levels of approximately 1.92 \u00b5mol/litre (40\u00b5g/dl). 9.6.1.2 Peripheralnervoussystem Numerous studies have measured the conduction velocity of electrically stimulated sensory and motor nerves in workers exposed to lead. These nerve conduction velocity (NCV)studies have yielded somewhat mixed results, with many showing a decrease in NCV in relation tolead exposure (indexed as PbB) and a few showing no effect or occasionally even an increase inNCV associated with lead exposure. Differences in the nerves evaluated, methodologies,characterization of lead exposure, and control of confounding variables underlie some of thevariabilityinresultsacrossstudies. A statistical meta-analysis of 32 NCV studies has indicated thatNCV is significantly reduced in lead-exposed workers compared to reference subjects, but that themedian motor nerve shows more reliable effects of lead than other nerves. This collective view ofthe evidence is supported by key studies that provide compelling evidence of a causal relationshipbetween lead exposure and reductions in NCV, extending to PbB levels as low as 1.44\u00b5mol/litre(30\u00b5g/dl). Theseeffectsmaybereversibledependingonthedurationandlevelof exposure. 9.6.1.3 Autonomicnervoussystem Two reports examining the electrocardiographic RR interval variability during deep breathing and the component CV of respiratory sinus arrythmia demonstrated dysfunctions at anaverage PbB level of 35 \u00b5g/dl. These results suggest autonomic nervous system dysfunction,particularlyinvolvingtheparasympatheticnervoussystem. 9.6.2 Children Prospective and cross-sectional studies of children demonstrate associations of lead exposure, measured by various indices, and intellectual performance. The association has beennoted across a wide range of exposure levels and in a variety of populations before factors otherthanleadhavebeenaccountedfor. A key question is whether this statistical association is directly attributable to the causal influence of lead on child IQ. It is important to consider alternative contributory explanations, i.e.randomchance, unexplainedconfoundingfactors, reversecausalityandselectionbias.186It is a matter of debate and conjecture as to the extent to which these four issues should inhibit claims of a causal relationship in the epidemiological studies. The essential problem is thatobservational epidemiology cannot provide definitive evidence of causality when the key statisticalassociation is small, the temporal relationship is unclear and major confounders are present.Animal studies provide qualitative support for the claim of a causal role for lead in affectingneuropsychological performance, but provide limited assistance in establishing quantitative dose-effect relationships. 9.6.2.1 Typeofeffect The clearest and most consistent associations have been found with global measures, such as IQ, where the largest body of evidence is available. Efforts to delineate theneuropsychological foundations of this association with a wide variety of tests of specificneuropsychologicaldomainshavenotsofarbeensuccessful. 9.6.2.2 Magnitudeof effect Based on the evidence from cross-sectional and prospective studies of populations with PbB levels generally below 25 \u00b5g/dl, the size of the apparent IQ effect (at age 4 and above) is adeficit between 0 and 5 points (on a scale with a standard deviation of 15) for each 0.48 \u00b5mol/litre (10\u00b5g/dl) increment in PbB level, with a likely apparent effect size of between 1 and 3 points. At PbB levels above 1.2 \u00b5mol/litre (25 \u00b5g/dl), the blood relationship between PbB level and IQ may differ. Estimates of effect size are group averages and only apply to the individual child in a probabilisticmanner. Existing epidemiological studies do not provide definitive evidence of a threshold. Below the PbB range of 0.48-0.72 \u00b5mol/litre (10-15 \u00b5g/dl), the effect of confounding variables and limits in the precision of analytical and psychometric measurements increases the uncertainty attached to anyestimateof effect. However, thereissomeevidenceof anassociationbelowthisrange. 9.6.2.3 Reversibility/persistence Whilst the Task Group could not unequivocally state that effects of early childhood exposure were persistent beyond childhood, because the current data are too meagre, it was heldthat neurobehavioural effects detected at age seven or later usually persist. Measures in laterchildhood tend to be more predictive of subsequent performance than those made earlier. It ismore likely than not that effects seen during school years are to some degree irreversible. Thishas also been observed in later follow-up studies conducted on non-lead topics of childdevelopment research. One of the difficulties is that there are too few data concerning long-termoutcome in children with high early exposures whose sources of exposure are subsequentlyremoved. Virtually no useful data are available concerning the effects on IQ of removing children from a ``high'' exposure environment to one of ``low'' exposure or on reduction of body lead burdeninchildren. Thisisnot tosaythat exposureshouldnot bereducedwhenpossible.1879.6.2.4 Age-specificsensitivity From prospective studies it is not possible to determine an age of critical sensitivity. This reflects the findings that serial blood lead measures taken at 2 years and later are positivelycorrelated, with individual rankings remaining approximately constant, and this limits the ability toidentifysensitiveperiodsof exposure. 9.6.2.5 Interactions/subgroups(gender, socio-economicstatus) The evidence is inconclusive regarding whether apparent effects are more or less marked in different gender or socioeconomic status (SES) subgroups. However, where there aresuggestions of SES-related differences, the apparent effects tend to be more marked in lower SESsubgroups. 9.6.3 Animal studies Experimental animal studies of CNS effects provide support for the associations between PbB levels and neurobehavioural deficits described in human epidemiological studies of lead.There is supportive evidence both in terms of demonstrating causal relationships and in the levelsof PbB at which such effects are observed (11-15 \u00b5g/dl). Moreover, they provide qualitativeparallels in the nature of the effects described, as these effects include changes in learning andmemory functions. Experimental animal studies indicate that these CNS effects may depend upontask complexity and can persist long beyond the termination of lead exposure. These studies alsoprovide information possibly relevant to understanding mechanisms of effect. In addition, theexperimental animal studies provide such evidence in the absence of the confounding factors andco-variates, such as parental IQ, socioeconomic status, and quality of the home environment, thatare problematic to human epidemiological endeavours, and in the absence of nutritionaldeficienciesthat mayariseinhumanpopulations. 9.7Renal system-adults Renal function impairment was not associated with a PbB level below 3.0 \u00b5mol/litre (62 \u00b5g/dl) when measured by blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine in lead workers. However,renaltubulareffectsweredetectedinworkers with a PbB level below 3.0 \u00b5mol/litre when measuredbymoresensitiveindicatorssuchasNAG. Most studies on the general population attempting to relate renal function impairment to PbB concentration have not demonstrated an effect with PbB levels below 1.8 \u00b5mol/litre (37.3\u00b5g/dl). More sensitive indicators of renal function may indicate a renal effect of lead below thislevel. 9.8Liver Overexposuretoleadmayinhibit drugmetabolismintheliver.1889.9Reproduction 9.9.1 Female Data are mixed with respect to the risk of spontaneous abortion and reduced birth weight associated with maternal PbB levels below 1.44 \u00b5mol/litre (30 \u00b5g/dl). Recent epidemiological studies have shown exposure-related perturbations in length of gestation, significantly greater risks beingassociatedwithPbBlevelsof 0.72 \u00b5mol/litre(15\u00b5g/dl) or more. 9.9.2 Male Blood lead concentrations above 1.92 \u00b5mol/litre (40 \u00b5g/dl) have been shown to affect sperm morphology and function. At present, the reproductive consequences of these changes arenot known. 9.10 Leadandbloodpressure A quantitative assessment of the collective evidence from all the observational studies in adults is made difficult by the fact that studies have adopted different policies regarding adjustmentfor potential confounding factors (for example, alcohol consumption). Also quantitative findingsfrom the two largest studies (BRHS and NHANES II) have depended on whether adjustment ismadeforgeographicvariationsinbloodpressureandbloodlead. The limited size of most observational studies has inevitably meant that they could not consistently demonstrate a statistically significant relationship. However, an overview of all thestudiesshowsthat evidenceis consistent with the centre-adjusted analysis of the two main studies,i.e.thereareveryweakbutstatisticallysignificantassociationsbetween PbB level and both systolicand diastolic blood pressure. The likely order of magnitude is that for any two-fold increase in PbBlevel (for example, from 0.8 to 1.6 \u00b5mol/litre) there is a mean 1 mmHg increase in systolic bloodpressure. Theassociationwithdiastolicbloodpressureisof asimilarmagnitude. Animal studies have provided plausible mechanisms for an effect of lead on blood pressure. However, from such a small magnitude of statistical associations in the presence ofimportant confounders, one cannot infer that low level lead exposure is causally related to bloodpressure. The two population studies relating PbB level to cardiovascular disease events show no statistically significant associations. Hence, there is no clear evidence to suggest that lead has animpact of publichealthimportanceasregardshypertensionorriskof cardiovasculardisease. 9.11 Carcinogenicity Renal tumours occur in rats and mice administered high doses of lead.

Among the most successful ofthese measures have been restrictions on the use of lead in certain products with significantexposure potential (for example, interior paint, gasoline). Accompanying these measures havebeen actions to establish criteria for acceptable levels of lead in environmental media, to limitindustrial emissions of lead to the environment, to control occupational exposures, and to identifybiologically based indices for determining populations at risk. Despite the success of many ofthese measures in reducing lead exposure, some Member countries continue to consider possiblesteps to further reduce lead exposure. This is because of the uncertainty regarding establishing abloodleadlevelbelowwhichthereisanabsenceof riskfromadversehealtheffects. This chapter reviews risk management activities among Member countries and one non- Member country, Mexico, which has observer status. Included are discussions of steps taken inthe past to reduce lead exposure, as well as current activities and potential future measures contemplated by certain countries. Country-specific risk management activities are summarized in Table5.1 . As shown in this table, the extent of these activities varies substantially among Member countries. The lead risk reduction activities of thirteen countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, the UnitedKingdom and the United States), the Nordic countries and the European Community are describedin this chapter. The descriptions are based on information provided by countries. The remainingMember countries did not provide enough information to develop a detailed description of their riskreductionactivities. Asummaryof industryriskreductionactivitiesisalsoincluded. The series of tables in Appenix A at the end of this chapter summarize available data on lead risk reduction activities in Member countries and in Mexico. Information in these summarytables was either taken from detailed descriptions, or extracted from secondary sources orgovernment publications. Repeated requests for information on lead risk reduction activities weremade to all Member countries in 1991 and 1992. Lack of information in this report on a particularMember country means either that no risk reduction activities have taken place in that country, orthat theMembercountryhasdeclinedtorespondtotherequestsforinformation.192 193AUSTRALIA Australia has taken risk reduction measures on both the national and state/territory levels. In Australia, the Federal Government has responsibility for co-ordinating national approaches to chemical related issues. The Federal Government also represents Australia in international forasuch as the OECD. It also co-ordinates guidelines for environmental standards such as air andwater qualitycriteria. Responsibility for chemicals control and risk management generally resides with the six State governments (New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland, SouthAustralia) and the two Territory governments (Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory)unless specifically legislated for the Federal government. The following discussion describesCommonwealth, State and Territory activities in Australia. This information was provided by theCommonwealthEnvironmentalProtectionAgency(Bainton, 1992; Garton, 1990a)except asnoted. Lead-basedPaint Like most other OECD countries, Australia has established restrictions on the manufacture and use of lead-based paint. There are general restrictions on the use of lead paintsin Australia, including: roofs used to collect drinking water; furniture; toys; non-industrial dwellings;and factory premises used for food preparation, processing or producing of products for humanconsumption. Manufacturing of lead-based paint has been prohibited for the most part since 1960. Reductions on the use of lead in household (building) paint have applied since the early 1960s, and are currently at 0.25percent non-volatile content. In Queensland, action can be taken underthe Health Act to require the removal of lead-based paint in situations where it is considered toposearisktohealth. Current use of lead-based paint in Australia is primarily for industrial purposes. In Tasmania, two classes of lead paint are used. Class 1 paint, with more than one percent ofnon-volatile components as lead, requires warning labels and is primarily used on exteriors. Leadis less than onepercent of the non-volatile component in Class2 paint. In Queensland, lead paintis still used on bridges and boats. Major Australian companies no longer prepare lead-based paintforthedomesticmarket. LeadinGasoline The use of tetraethyl lead as an anti-knock additive in gasoline has been linked to high- levels of atmospheric lead and subsequent human exposure via inhalation and ingestion pathways. Because of the widespread exposure caused by this end-use, restrictions on lead gasoline additives have been implemented in many countries. The regulations for lead content in gasolineare not uniform throughout Australia; lead content restrictions range from 0.3g/l in some city areasto 0.84g/l in country areas. In New South Wales, the concentration of lead in gasoline has beenregulated since 1974, with the current standard of 0.4g/l instituted in 1980, while in Victoria,regulations for leaded and unleaded fuel went into effect in 1983 and 1985. Queensland hasreduced the lead content of its gasoline from 0.84 to 0.4g/l in the capital city area, and thisstandardwillbeprogressivelyextendedtotherest of thestateby1993. Also, it isnow prohibited in194Queensland to use any combustible material that has, or contains fuel having, a lead content exceeding 0.02percent by weight. Unleaded gasoline7was introduced in Australia in 1985. The Federal Motor Vehicles Standards Act requires that all cars manufactured or imported afterJanuary1, 1986operateonunleadedgasoline. LeadinDrinkingWater In 1987, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) set the drinking water lead standard at 0.05mg/l. This limit has legal standing in Australian Capital Territory (ACT)(for domestic water) and in Western Australia (for drinking water) (ILZSG, 1989a). The ACT alsolimitstheconcentrationof leadinthe rawwater supply to 0.05mg/l. Several states have policies to limit lead exposure through drinking water. In Tasmania, potential sources of lead contamination indrinking water are removed when this is practical, and the use of potential lead sources in newinstallations are prevented by local government authorities. In Queensland, lead pipes are notusedforwaterreticulation. StandardsforEnvironmental MediaandPointSourceControls The NHMRC recommends an air concentration of 1.5 \u00b5g/m 3averaged over three continuous months. This limit has legal standing in Victoria, Tasmania and ACT. NHMRC recommendsanemissionslimit at groundlevelaroundstationarysourcesof 10mg/m3. This limit is legally enforceable in most states and territories; however, in Western Australia and NorthernTerritory, the limit is still a recommendation. The Queensland Clean Air Act Regulations, 1982,limit the total emissions of lead, arsenic, antimony, and mercury (and compounds of theseelements) to 20mg/m 3(ILZSG, 1989a); however, the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage has the power to impose stricter emissions limits for lead as a condition of license. TheACT Air Pollution Act 1984 limits emissions from municipal combustors to 10 \u00b5g/m 3of residual gases. Generally, these emissions limits are enforced through a combination of industry emissions reporting and monitoring requirements and state or territorial government auditing of stacks and oftheindustry-operatedmonitors. Certain states make allowances for higher emissions from older facilities. In Tasmania, emissions from installations in operation before 1975 are limited such that the total concentrationsof lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury and compounds of these metals cannot exceed 23mg/m 3. Installations in operation after 1975 are limited to 10mg/m3. Similarly, primary and secondary smelters in operation in New South Wales before 1972 are limited to 20mg/m3, while any subsequent plant must meet the 10mg/m3standard. In New South Wales, bag filter technology is usedat bothprimaryandsecondarysmelters. The NSW Environmental Protection Authority (NSWEPA) requires industry to monitor and report emissions and performs audit testing on plant stacksand monitors. Industry must also operate ambient monitors outside plant boundaries; thesemonitorsarealsoauditedbyNSWEPA. The Australian Water Quality Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Waters, published by the Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (1992), recommend the 7Note: It isgenerallyaccepted internationallythat unleaded 0.013 gofleadperlitre.195followingmedianvaluestoprotect aquaticecosystems,196\u007f0.001-0.005mg/linfreshwater(dependingonhardness), \u007f0.005mg/linmarinewaters. Ambient water quality goals are also established for fresh water and saltwater by individual states and territories. Limits on industrial effluent have been established as one meanstoachievingtheambient goals. The limits set for the discharge of lead to water depend on the nature of the environment and the industry and the uses or the value of the water body, but are typically around 0.05mg/l. InVictoria, minimum levels which are easily achievable are set via statutory policy at 0.10mg/l. Morestringent levels are often set where the environment is sensitive or when lower levels arepracticable. LeadinFood The NHMRC Food Standards Code 1987 has set maximum permissible levels for lead in specific foods between 0.2and 2.5mg/kg, depending on the foodstuff. If a food additive is notspecifically included in the standards, the additive may not contain more than 10 \u00b5g/kg of lead. All food offered for sale in Australia (domestic or imported) must meet these limits. NHMRC monitors consumption of lead in food through market basket surveys. When excessive levels are found,legal action can be taken. State and Territory health authorities also conduct food surveillance andmonitoringprogrammes. The canning industry in Australia produces lead solder side seam cans and welded cans for food use. Although there are no regulations governing the amount of lead used in solder,NHMRC limits the lead content of food. These range from 0.3mg/kg for infant food and milk to2.5mg/kgformeat, tomatoesandfruit juices. Cansforinfant foodareunderstoodtobewelded. LeadinProducts Australia limits the lead content of a number of consumer products. In 1976, the NHMRC recommended applying the British standard \"Permissible Levels of Metals Released from GlazedCeramicWare.\" In1980, NHMRCrecommendedthat anyutensilorapplianceusedtocontainfoodor drink should not release more than 0.2mg/l lead. These limits apply to both domestic andimported goods. NHMRC also recommended in 1976 restrictions of 0.01percent for the leadcontent of pencils, toys, crayons, pastels and other art pigments, and a lead content of not greaterthan0.25percent of leadorleadcompoundsincoatingmaterials. Recycling Though there are no regulations governing the disposal of used lead batteries in Australia, recycling is common. For some end uses of lead, such as roofing, there is great potential forrecycling although the time between installation and removal is often considerable. Lead use inbrass or bronze, for example, is unlikely to be recycled to any great extent because the associatedcosts are considered prohibitive, while for other lead uses, such as wheel weights, the lead is lostto the environment (ALDA, 1992). However, recent Australia-wide industry studies regarding thefateof lead-acidbatteriesindicatethat therecyclingrateisgreaterthan90percent.197Occupational Standards Australian regulation limits both workplace air concentrations of lead and maximum allowable blood lead concentrations for workers. In 1980, the National Health and MedicalResearch Council (NHMRC) recommended an occupational maximum blood lead level of 70 \u00b5g/dl for males and 40 \u00b5g/dl for females. However, those guidelines will soon be abolished in anticipation of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission's proposed standard. All states have legally adopted this level; however, in Queensland and Western Australia it onlyappliesformines. The Australian lead industry (1988) recommended a maximum occupational blood lead level of 70 \u00b5g/dl for males and 30 \u00b5g/dl for females, and in 1992 recommended a maximum of 65\u00b5g/dl for males. The Australian lead industry further recommends concentrations of lead in blood at which return to occupational exposures may occur (50 \u00b5g/dl for males, 25 \u00b5g/dl for females).198CANADA Canadian risk reduction efforts have been a combination of national and provincial regulation, educationalefforts, andvoluntaryindustryinitiatives. BloodLeadActionLevel The Federal Provincial Advisory Committee on Environmental and Occupational Health has recommended 25 \u00b5g/dL as the national \"action level\" for blood lead levels in children that is, thelevel at which intervention is appropriate. This level is under review (Health and Welfare Canada,1989). LeadinConsumerProducts Lead is limited to 0.5 per cent in coating materials applied to children's products such as furniture and toys as well as to pencils and artists brushes (Hazardous Products Act, 1991;Hazardous Products Regulations, Chapter 928, 1988). These regulations were under review as ofJanuary 1992. Leachable lead from glazed ceramics is currently under review as well. It isexpected that the limit for lead (currently 7ppm in leachate) will be substantially reduced(HazardousProductsRegulations, Chapter925, 1988; McBain, 1992). Lead-basedPaint Canada restricts the advertisement, importation and sale of paints containing lead. Lead is permitted in products (paints) only if it is for use on the exterior surface of a building and is labelled: \"Caution: contains lead. Do not apply to surfaces that children may chew.\" This regulation is currently under review (Hazardous Products Act, Chapter 928, 1988; McBain, 1992; Health andWelfare Canada, 1991). On the recommendation of the Canadian Paint and Coatings Association(the trade association for Canadian paint manufacturers), the Canadian paint industry voluntarilystopped using lead in consumer paint at the beginning of 1991. The trade association representsgreater than 90percent of the liquid coatings market in Canada (Health and Welfare Canada,1991; McBain, 1992). LeadinGasoline Between1976and 1985, airborne lead concentrations decreased by 76percent. This drop is believed to be largely attributable to the increased use of unleaded gasoline (Health and WelfareCanada, 1989). In 1989, Canada reduced its tax on lead-free gasoline and prohibited, inDecember, 1990, theuseof leaded gasoline, except in critical equipment such as farm, marine andcommercial transportation and piston driven aircraft engines, in order to avoid premature enginewear (Gasoline Regulations, 1990). In these exceptional cases, gasoline may contain a maximumof 0.026g/l lead. A maximum of 5mg/l is permitted for any other purpose. Enforcement of theserestrictions is carried out through regional inspectors and through reporting requirements forrefineries.199LeadinPesticideProducts All agricultural and forestry pesticides, wood preservatives and disinfectants in use in Canada must be registered under the Pest Control Products Act (1991) and Pest Control ProductRegulations (1978). These products and their ingredients are subject to a comprehensive reviewto ensure the protection of human health, safety and the environment, conducted by theDepartments of Agriculture, National Health and Welfare, Environment, and Forestry. Lead is notusedasanactiveingredient inanypesticideproduct registeredinCanada. LeadinExplosivesandAmmunition Lead azide is classified as a primary explosive. It is used as an ingredient in detonators, blasting caps, and primers. Civilian applications of lead azide are controlled under the ExplosivesAct (1991) and Explosives Regulations (1978) by the Department of Energy, Mines andResources. A separate regulatory scheme exists for military uses of lead azide, under the controlof the Minister of National Defence (Minister of National Defence, 1992; Defence Production Act,1991). The discharge of a lead projectile from a firearm results in microscopic shearing of lead particles from the bullet as it passes down the barrel. These particles are subsequently sprayedfrom the barrel, along with a cloud of lead compounds generated from lead stypanate in cartrigeprimers. Indoorfiringrangesareventilatedtoreduceairborneleadlevels. Leadfreeammunitionisnowunderdevelopment bytheDepartment of NationalDefence. LeadinDrinkingWater Canada currently allows a maximum of 10 \u00b5g/l in drinking water (Minister of National Health and Welfare, 1989). This level was approved by all provinces in the fall of 1989. Possible sourcesof lead in drinking water include solder and brass plumbing fixtures. The 1990 Canadian Plumbing Codepermits a maximum lead content of 0.2percent for solder and fluxes in contact with potable water (National Research Council of Canada, 1990). The Canadian Standards Association iscurrently preparing amendments to the standard limiting lead content of brass fittings to 8percent. Generally, fittings do not contain more than 8percent lead, but this limit is not specified in current regulations. Another possible source of lead in drinking water is lead supply pipes that still remainin many municipalities, although these lines may have acquired a lime interior capable ofpreventingcontact betweenleadanddrinkingwater. LeadinFood Lead levels in food have been regulated since the mid-1970s. Cooperation between government and the canning industry led to reductions in the use of lead in soldering cans and areduction of lead spattering during can production. Canned baby food has been phased out, withmost baby food now packed in glass jars. It is estimated that only about 5percent of canned foodinCanadaisstillpackagedinleadsolderedcans. The Canadian government has set tolerances for lead in various foods which are consistent with international standards (Technical Reports from Annual Meetings of the Joint FAO/WHO200Expert Committee on Food Additives). These tolerance levels vary between 0.08mg/kg for ready-to-serve infant formula to 1.5mg/kg for tomato paste and sauce. Tolerance levels are0.2mg/kg in fruit juices, cider, wine, other beverages (as consumed), and water in sealedcontainers. The tolerance level is 0.5mg/kg in dried fish protein concentrate. A level of 10mg/kgisallowedfor ediblebonemeal(FoodandDrugsAct, 1991). StandardsforEnvironmental MediaandPointSourceControls The Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) (1988) provides the federal government with powers to protect human health and the environment from the effects of toxic substances thatare not already covered under other laws such as the Hazardous Products Act or the Food andDrugs Act. The CEPA approach is a comprehensive \"cradle to grave\" system for the regulationandcontrolof toxicsubstancesinCanada. The Domestic Substances List (DSL) (1991) published under the authority of CEPA cites 84 entriesforleadandleadcompounds. The Non-domestic Substances List (NDSL) (1991) publishedunder the authority of CEPA cites 118 entries for lead compounds. These entries in the DSL andNDSL will determine the status of lead compounds with respect to the Regulations RespectingNotification of Substances New to Canada (in press) scheduled to come into force in 1993. Leadand its compounds listed on the DSL are deemed to be existing substances in Canada and are notsubject to the New Substances notification process. All other lead compounds will be subject tonotificationschedulesdependingonthevolumetobeimportedorproduced. The Canadian federal government has established ambient water quality criteria for the protection of health and the environment. Criteria for lead concentrations in freshwater withdwelling fauna are 0.001to 0.007mg/l, with levels of 0.2mg/l for irrigation (tentative guideline) and0.1mg/l for livestock watering (Environment Canada and Health and Welfare Canada, 1990).Elemental lead and all lead compounds are regulated under CEPA with respect to ocean dumping(Ocean Dumping Regulations, 1989). The discharge of lead and lead compounds from ships inCanadian territorial waters is regulated under the Canada Shipping Act (1991) and the PollutantSubstancesRegulations(1978). Soil criteria have been recommended as part of the Interim Canadian Environmental Quality Criteria for Contaminated Sites (Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment, 1991). They include both assessment and remediation criteria. Assessment criteria are benchmarks againstwhichthedegreeof contaminationat asiteisassessed. Theassessment criterionforleadinsoil is25mg/kg dry are intended as generic guidance benchmarks toevaluate the need for further investigation or remediation for a specific land use. When applied tosite-specific conditions, they become remediation objectives. Suggested interim remediationcriteria for lead in soil are 375mg/kg for agricultural use, 500mg/kg for residential/parkland, and1000mg/kgforcommercial/industrialuse. The recommended maximum lead concentration, as specified in the National Guidelines on Physical-Chemical-Biological Treatment of Hazardous Wastes , is 0.1mg/l in liquid effluents from wastetreatment sites(CanadianCouncilof Ministersof theEnvironment, 1989). Canada has national legislation for lead emissions from secondary lead smelters. The SecondaryLeadSmelterReleaseRegulations(1991), which were first enacted under the Clean AirAct in 1977 and subsequently incorporated into CEPA in 1991, limit emissions of particulates to20123mg/m3or 46mg/m3, depending on the type of operation. The amount of lead is limited to the equivalent of 63percent by weight of the particulate matter. The regulations further prohibit therelease of particulate matter into the ambient air from the storage of lead-bearing scrap orlead-bearing material in or about a secondary smelter, other than as a result of handling. Thefederal government does not regulate other stack emissions of lead, however, primary leadsmelters have been required to comply with these requirements since 1989. Most provinces havelicensing systems in place to regulate stack emissions of particulates, on the order of 29mg/m 3for smelters (other than secondary smelters) and 14to 15mg/m3for refineries. Some provincial controls are in place that specifically regulate lead emissions, such as Ontario's Clean AirProgramme (Government of Ontario, Environmental Protection Act; Ambient Air Quality CriteriaRegulation, 1980; General-AirPollutionControlRegulation, 1980). Controls on lead in industrial effluent exist on both the national and provincial level. Under the federal Fisheries Act (1991), the Metal Mining Liquid Effluent Regulations and Guidekines (1977)are in place to control concentrations of lead and other metals in effluent for metal miningoperations. Maximum liquid effluent emissions are limited to 0.2mg/l monthly average, 0.4mg/lmaximum in a sample (Environment Canada, 1977). Metal Finishing Liquid Effluent Guidelines (Department of Fisheries and Oceans, 1978) limit lead in effluent to 1.5mg/l. Provinces havelicensingsystemswhichcontroleffluent discharges on a site-specific basis. For example, Ontario'sMunicipal and Industrial Strategy for Abatement (MISA) programme will also include controls forlead(Government of Ontario, EnvironmentalProtectionAct). Recycling Canada recycles an estimated 93percent of lead-acid batteries. Lead batteries that are filled with acid are classified as hazardous and, as a result, their transportation and storage areregulated by Federal and provincial requirements (International Lead and Zinc Study Group,1989b). Regulation of the transport and handling of lead-bearing scrap is divided between thefederal Transport of Dangerous Goods Act and the provincial authorities. British Columbia isdrafting provincial lead-acid battery regulations to consolidate these rules (British Columbia BatteryNews, 1991a). The British Columbia Lead-acid battery Collection System is a provincialprogramme to increase recycling, particularly in remote regions of the province. The goal is toachieve a province-wide recycling rate of 98percent. To attract more returns from remote areas,the government offers a cash incentive to offset transportation costs (British Columbia BatteryNews, 1991b). The revenue for this programme comes from a $5.00 green tax on new batteries.Started in 1991, programme recycling facilities have seen a substantial increase in returns fromremoteareas(Keating, 1992). Education/Labelling Labelling requirements exist for lead paints, lead-acid batteries, and other lead products. Under Canada's Hazardous Products Act, bilingual labelling for all lead-based paints is required.Also, the Department of National Health and Welfare has undertaken extensive education andawareness programmes aimed at the arts, crafts and hobby communities to increase awarenessabout the hazards associated with some of the materials used in these activities (Health andWelfareCanada, 1990). The Health Protection Branch of Health and Welfare Canada has published two recent issue202papers to convey general information to the public on issues related to lead. One paper provides facts on lead and health (Health and Welfare Canada, 1989), and a second paper providesinformation on removing lead based paint during home renovations (Health and Welfare Canada,1991). Onemillion copies of a joint federal government-private sector publication entitled Old Paint, Lead, and Your Family's Health were distributed through retail paint outlets during 1992 (CanadianPaint andCoatingsAssociation, 1992). Lead and its compounds are included on the Ingredient Disclosure List (IDL) (1987). The IDL is part of the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS). WHMIS is a nationalsystem of hazard communication for workplace hazardous substances mandated by theHazardous Products Act and the Controlled Products Regulations (1988). Under this system,administered by the Departments of National Health and Welfare, Labour, and Consumer andCorporateAffairs, requirementsarespecifiedforthelabellingof controlledproducts, the informationthat must be on Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), and for employee instruction and the MSDS andtheproduct label. Radionuclides of lead are regulated under the Atomic Energy Control Act (1985), the Atomic Energy Control Regulations (1978) and the Transport Packaging of Radioactive MaterialsRegulations (1983). Under the Atomic Energy Control Regulations, possession of leadradionuclides which exceed 3.7kBq of activity perkilogram of substance requires a license fromthe Atomic Energy Control Board of Canada. The Transport Packaging of Radioactive MaterialsRegulations (1983) specify minimum standards for the safe packaging and transportation ofmaterialscontainingradioactivelead. Occupational Exposures to air containing lead, inorganic dust and fumes, as lead, averaged over a full work shift, must not exceed 0.15mg/m 3. The short term exposure limit (STEL) is 0.45mg/m3.T h e c i t e d limits are prescribed in Part X \"Hazardous Substances\" of the Canada Occupational Safety andHealth Regulations (1986), issued pursuant to the Canada Labour Code (1991). The regulationsstate that no employee shall be exposed to a concentration of an airborne chemical agent inexcess of the value for that agent adopted by the American Conference of Governmental andIndustrial Hygienists (ACGIH) in its publication entitled Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices for 1985-86 . However, Part X is currently being reviewed and consideration is being given to referencing the current TLVs, as 0.15mg/m 3(the TLV-STEL value for lead has been deleted).203DENMARK The Danish risk reduction activities on lead are based on a concern for both human health andtheenvironment. The Danish risk reduction measures on lead are to phase out the use of lead totally through a set of different actions. Possible actions are regulation and voluntary agreements, andthemeanscouldbesubstitutionand,wherethisisnotpossible,improvedrecycling. Risk reduction for lead is clearly an international issue. Trade is spreading worldwide and the application has an enormous dimension and scope. International actions are therefore anecessarymeanstoeliminatetheuseof lead.204FRANCE The following information pertaining to the policies implemented by France to reduce exposure to lead was obtained through the Minister of Environment (Deschamps, 1990; Nichelatti1992). Lead-basedPaint Oldpaint: Theresultsof detectionactivitiescarriedout in the Centre for Child Protection in the north- eastern Paris area from 1987 to 1991 included more than 1550 children with lead levels in bloodexceeding 15 \u00b5g/dl. An additional study carried out by the hospital services in Paris between 1987 and1989identified300supplementarycases. Morethan690children required specialized care by a hospital team. The criteria used by the epidemiological study have led to the identification of apopulation at high intoxication risk, comparable to population groups considered as the mostexposedonesintheUnitedStates. A joint working group of the Ministries of Health, Environment and Housing, in co- operationwithPublicHealthmedicalteams, hasfinancedaseriesof studiesconcerning: the identification of risk factors in domestic accommodations in the Paris urban area. This study showed that in 35 per cent of the habitats and 59 per cent of the common areas which were investigated lead levels were above 1 mg/m 2and above 10 mg/g in flakes of paint. This study should allow the development of a method for drawing upaninventoryofdomesticaccommodationsatrisk; the determination within six French departments of lead levels in blood for children between 12 and 47 months old. This study aims to evaluate the extent of this phenomenon at the national level. From 26 to 27 per cent of children between oneandsixyearshadlevelsabove150 \u00b5g/l; and theevaluationofdetectionmethodsusedbygeneralpractitioners. Furthermore, a monitoring network for infant lead poisoning has been recently created in thedepartment of theIledeFrance, basedonthedemandsforlaboratorytests. Newpaint: Since February 1993, the sale of paints containing white lead is prohibited. The first French \"eco-labels\" will be granted to paints and varnishes not containing lead (and fulfilling othercriteria).205LeadinGasoline The lead content of gasoline and of high-octane gasoline has been reduced from 0.55g/l in 1981 to 0.15g/l on June1, 1991. Since July1, 1989, unleaded gasoline has been granted a taxreduction which makes its retail price lower than the price of leaded high-octane gasoline. As aresult, consumptionof unleadedgasolinehasrisenrapidly; inJuly1991, 27percent of the gasolinesoldcontainedlessthan0.15gof leadperlitre. Current substitutes for lead in gasoline are benzene or other aromatic components. It should be noted that benzene is a known carcinogen. Research is under way concerningaldehydes. However, aldehydes influence the substances emitted from the exhaust pipe, thetoxicity of which differs from the toxicity of the substances contained in gasoline. Other substitutesarealsounderresearch. LeadinDrinkingWater Directive 75/440/CEE on the quality of surface waters destined for the production of drinkingwaterintheECMemberStatessetsat 0.05mg/ltheleadcontent of the three quality typesof surfacewatersdefinedbythis directive. To enforce directive 80/778/EEC, French regulation hasset theleadlimit for drinkingwater at 50 \u00b5g/l. The effects of soft water (i.e. water containing <85ppm calcium carbonate) on lead piping, and especially the creation of soluble lead salts, has been an important cause for concernfortheauthoritiessincethelate1970s. Monitoringof drinkingwatercarriedout in Amiens indicatedcause for concern. A strategy was designed to combat lead poisoning from water ingestion. Thecomponents of this strategy have been the detection of cases of lead poisoning and theestablishment of neutralization facilities, to be completed by the end of 1992, for supplied water inzoneswhichhavebeenidentifiedashardwaterareas. The discovery, both in the scientific litreature and in the city of Amiens, of lead dissolving in so-called non-aggressive waters has widened the range of action priorities of the Health Ministryconcerningtheleadcontent of waterdestinedforhumanconsumption. Activitiesinclude: establishing a synthesis of the scientific and technical information, evaluating the priorities and informing decision-makers concerning public waters, as well as informing andimprovingtheawarenessof themedicalprofession. identifying new zones at risk, especially waters with calco-carbonic equilibrium of a pH lessthan7.5, suppliedbyanetworkincludingleadpiping. analysing water samples. Particular precautions should be taken when measuring tap water samples, such as taking samples as soon as the tap is turned on and not allowingleaks. taking measures for water exceeding regulatory limits, including gradual replacement of lead connections in the public network and modification of building interiors. Pending completion of the work, a public collective treatment can be set up, aimed atmodifyingthequalityof suppliedwater.

LeadinSoils The Ministry of Agriculture in France has assessed the heavy metal content, including lead, infertilizers as part of a strategy to reduce heavy metals in fertilizers and soil. Appendix B at the end of this chapter contains a table outlining the concentration of heavy metals in fertilizers inFrance. StandardsforEnvironmental MediaandPointSourceControls The average annual limit value for the ambient air concentration of lead is 2 \u00b5g/m 3.A national network for continuous automatic sampling has existed since 1984. Standards exist for limiting lead emissions from industrial and other facilities. For incineration facilities for urban waste,a January 25, 1991 decree defines an emission limit value of 5mg/m 3for a facility of nominal capacity greater than 1 tonne of waste per hour. The limit represents a total value for four heavymetals: lead, chromium, copper and manganese. For incineration facilities for industrial waste, a1983 Circular defines an emission limit value in gases of 5mg/m 3; however, this value will have to bereducedto0.5mg/m3followingthedevelopment of arelevant EuropeanDirective. Forsmelters, localauthoritiesdefinebyregulationtheconditionsapplicableineachspecificcase. Limits also exist to protect water from lead contamination. For example, there is a prohibition of lead discharges to the underground waters coming from hazardous installations. Fortheincinerationfacilitiesforurbanwaste, theconcentrationlimit value, beforedischarge, is1mg/l. Several standards have been established to protect soils and sediments. Spreading of sewage sludge must respect the AFNOR U-44-041 standard, which is 800mg/kg for lead. Theapproval of fertilizers takes into account the heavy metal content of the preparations or specialtiesaccording to the quantities deposited per hectare and the quantities marketed. This approachallows managing the risk of introducing heavy metals by means of fertilizers. In addition to thesestandards, the Ministry of Environment set up in 1985 an observatory for soil quality, which allowstheco-ordinationof thestudy, research, evaluationandmanagement of soilpollution. LeadinProducts France has several rules governing lead in products. For food cans, only external207solderingof thecansisallowed. Therearealsolimitsonthemigrationof leadfrom ceramic kitchen utensils into food. These limits are defined according to the dimensions of the utensils. Francealso adheres to the prohibition of lead capsules for overcorking wine bottles imposed by the EECon the 1st of January 1993. This prohibition has accelerated research and development ofsubstitutes. Tin capsules are considered too expensive and are reserved for upper-marketproducts. Plastic capsules don't seem to satisfy consumers, who are accustomed to the touch oflead-tin capsules. This consideration seems to have been taken into account in the developmentof aluminium-polyethylenecapsules. Recycling Two agreements concerning the recovery of spent storage batteries have been set up between the administration and the various professions involved in lead recovery. The first one isan engagement by the garage owners, gas stations and recovery operators to take back batteriesfreeof charge. The second one aims at facilitating the transport of batteries full of acid (electrolyte)inappropriatecontainers.208GERMANY Germany has initiated a number of measures to reduce lead exposure and risk. The followinginformationwasobtainedfrom theUmweltbundesamt (UBA, 1992). BloodLeadActionLevels The concentration of lead in blood of adults and children shows a clear decreasing trend for the last 15years. In 1990, mean levels for children and adults were in the range of 6-7 \u00b5g/dl.This decline is probably attributable to the reduction of lead in gasoline, starting in 1976. InGermany, some physiologists and toxicologists recommend that the blood lead level of adultsshould not exceed the concentration of 15\u00b5g/dl and those of children and women of childbearingageshouldnot exceed10\u00b5g/dl. Lead-basedPaint Germany has taken a number of measures to reduce lead in paint. White lead compounds (\"lead white\") are banned from sale. Lead-based anti-corrosive paint (\"red paint\") isbeing phased out; its use is restricted to repair coatings. In 1989, 880tonnes were produced,compared with 2200tonnes in 1983. In this application, lead is being replaced by zinc coatings.Other lead-based pigments (lead chromates and lead molybdates) are used as colouring agentsfor plastics, printer's ink and lacquer for surface painting. Containers for paint with more than0.15percent lead content must be labelled (\"Paint contains lead; not for objects which can bereachedbysmallchildren\")(Gefahrstoff-Verordnung). LeadinGasoline The maximum lead content of leaded motor gasoline has been restricted to 0.15g/l since 1976. Unleaded gasoline has been on the market since 1982. Economic and fiscal instrumentshave been used to promote the introduction of catalytic converters in private cars and theconsumption of unleaded gasoline in cars with and without catalytic converters. Since 1988,regular grade gasoline has been required to be unleaded. At present, there are one leaded andthreeunleadedtypesof motorgasolineinthemarket: leaded, 98RON In January 1992, the market share of the unleaded types of gasoline was higher than 80percent. The consumption of leaded gasoline is further decreasing and is expected todisappearfromthemarket withinafew years [Benzinbleigesetz (1971, Amendment 1987), GermanStandardDIN51600and51607].209LeadinDrinkingWater Lead pipes are the most important source of lead in drinking water in Germany. Lead pipes have not been installed in new piping systems since the middle of this century; systems thatdo still exist are gradually being replaced by lead-free materials (German Standards DIN 1988 and2000). Municipalities responsible for the drinking water supply system have to maintain a lead level of less than 40 \u00b5g/l at the mains connection. (Trinkwasserverordnung, 1975). The house- owner/landlord is obliged to provide drinking water at the tap with a lead concentration of less than 40\u00b5g/l. If this concentration is exceeded, on request, the owner has to replace the piping (Trinkwasserverordnung,1990Amendment). Copperpipesfordrinkingwater supply systems have to be soldered with lead-free alloys (such as SnCu or SnAg) (German Standard DIN 1707 andDVGW, Blatt GW2of 1983). LeadinFood Germany has set only one limit value for lead in foodstuffs. This limit, for wine, is set at 0.3mg/l. For other foodstuffs, guideline values for lead have been established as follows(inmg/kg): beer, 0.2; milk, 0.03; meat and eggs, relevant European standards from EEC Directive 75/440 as a guide. This value for lead is0.05mg/l. LeadinAmbient Air The maximum tolerable lead concentration in air is limited to 2.0 \u00b5g/m 3(annual mean); the maximum deposition on soil is limited to 0.25mg/m2/day. Diffuse (fugitive) emissions of dust from storage and distribution facilities, including transportation, are also restricted by this rule(Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz,TALuft,1986,Directive82/884EEC). The lead concentration in air, measured at monitoring sites in rural regions, has decreased continuously from about 0.250 \u00b5g/m 3in 1973 to about 0.025 leadedgasoline.210LeadinSoil Arecent compilationof soildataforNorthrhine-Westphaliashowsthat upperboundvalues (95thpercentile) of lead content are very high in inner cities (315mg/kg) as compared to ruralagricultural soils (56mg/kg). After the evident reduction of lead in air and blood, the limiting factorsfor further risk reduction are now secondary sources of inner city dust and soil. Consequently,many German states have limited the lead concentration in the soil of children's playgrounds [forexample, Northrhine-Westphalia: playground soil, 200mg/kg; playground (sandbox) sand,20mg/kg]. Taking into account the great spatial variability of soils and their differing capacity to accumulate lead, no trends in soil lead levels of statistical significance are expected. However, thedepositionof airborneleadtosoilislimitedto0.25mg/m \u00b2/day. PointSourceControls Metal emissions from lead smelters and other non-ferrous metallurgical works are limited to 5mg/m 3in total palladium(Pd). The total dust emission, of which lead is a constituent, is limited to values between 10 (for lead plants) and 20mg/m3(for other non-ferrous sources). The lead emissions from battery- manufacturingsitesarelimitedto0.5mg/m3(TALuft 1986). The total dust emission from waste incinerators is limited to 10mg/m3. In the dust, the emission in total of Pb, Sb, As, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, V, Sn, Pt and Pd must not exceed 1mg/m3 (Abfallverbrennungsanlagen-Verordnung, 17. BImSchV, 1990). For direct discharges to water, limits vary from 0.3to 2.0mg/l, according to the type of plant. The recommendation for indirect discharges in several Federal States is 0.2mg/l; effluentfrom non-ferrousmetalplants, mills, foundriesandelectroplatingplantsislimitedto0.5mg/l. Thereis also an overall limit 15g of lead per tonne of production (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz mitVerordnungen). The use of sewage sludge for agricultural purposes is legally restricted if its lead content exceeds900mg/kg. Agriculturalsoilswithalead content of 100mg/kg or more may not be treatedwithanysewagesludge(Kl \u00e4rschlammverordnung, 1992Amendment). Lead paint removal operations on steel bridges have to take place under effective emission control measures; if feasible, wet sandblasting is required. In cases of dry sandblasting,the structure has to be housed and the blast air to be treated (TA Luft 1986; Special Regulations oftheGermanRailways). LeadinProducts Significant quantities of lead are used as stabilizers for PVC, cable sheathing, optical and technical glass, TV picture tubes, and crystal glass. In these applications, the lead is regarded asimmobileandfixedinaninsolublematrix, fromwhichit cannot beleached. The use of lead in certain products is restricted. There is no use of soldered cans for food packaging any longer. Food cans are resistance welded (longitudinal seam) and folded (lid and211bottom). It is estimated that some 10percent of food cans, imported from non-European Community countries, are soldered. As mentioned above, there are guideline values for themaximumleadcontent of cannedfood. Inaddition, theapplicationof lead compounds in pesticidesis strictly prohibited. Replacement of lead in ammunition (small shot and bullets) is underdevelopment. Positiveresultswithsteelshot arebeingreported. Recycling In 1989, the total production of lead in Germany consisted of more than 50percent recycledmaterials: Primaryproduction 170200tonnes Secondaryproduction 180500tonnes Totalleadproduction1989: 350700tonnes There is a continuous trend towards higher recycling rates. The amount of lead in domestic and industrial waste streams is decreasing. The complete collection, safe handling,processing and final storage of all kinds of waste is regulated by law and controlled by stateauthorities (Blei-Bilanz 1984-1989/ Therecyclingrateforbatteriesisgreaterthan95percent. Occupational Standards In the workplace, the maximum allowable air lead concentration is 0.10mg/m 3(time- weighted average over eight hours) (MAK). The maximum allowable blood lead concentration ofworkers is 70 \u00b5g/dl for men and for women over 45, and 30 \u00b5g/dl for women under 45 (BAT). Theconcentration of d-Amino-laevulinic acid (ALA) in urine should not exceed 15mg/l in men and inwomen over 45, and should not exceed 6mg/l in women under 45 (BAT) (Ref: MaximaleArbeitsplatzkonzentrationen(MAK)undBiologischeArbeitsstofftoleranzwerte(BAT)1991).

Lead-basedPaint Japandoesnot restrict theuseof leadpaints. Instead, throughvoluntary agreements with manufacturers, Japan limits the extent to which lead paint is used. For example, on a voluntarybasis, lead paint is not used for toys (1960) or household painting (1980). Lead compounds areused in paints for colouring purposes, and lead pigments are for anticorrosive purposes inpaints. Lead-basedpaintscontinuetobeusedprimarilyinconstruction, automobilesand electronicproducts(Sasaki, 1990). LeadinGasoline Japanese Industrial Standards limit the lead content in gasoline, and since the 1970s, these limits have encouraged gasoline makers to decrease or eliminate the amount of alkyl andtetraethyl lead compounds in gasoline. In the 1980s, leaded gasoline accounted for only onetotwopercent of Japan's gasoline production. In more recent years, gasoline containing lead is notmanufactured, importedorusedinJapan(MITI, 1991). LeadinDrinkingWater The Japanese maximum permissible lead concentration in drinking water was 0.1mg/l (IRPTC/UNEP, 1990). LeadinFood The Food Sanitation Law of Japan establishes lead content limits for a range of plant products. Theselimitsrangefrom 1.0to5.0mg/kg(IRPTC/UNEP, 1990). StandardsforEnvironmental MediaandPointSourceControls The Air Pollution Control Law establishes Japanese emissions standards for lead smelters, processing facilities and other combustors. Japan has set air emission standards forsmelters and other lead processing facilities at 10to 30mg/m 3, depending on the facility. In addition to meeting these air emission standards, facilities are subject to government requirementsregarding pollution control technologies for new plants (Sasaki, 1990). Prefectural GovernmentOrdinance may impose stricter air emission standards ranging from 1.5to 7.0mg/m 3(ILZSG, 1989a). Since 1958, Japan's Water Pollution Control Law has restricted the lead concentration in effluent discharged from almost all industrial sectors. Effluent must have a lead concentration ofless than 1mg/l (MITI, 1991; IRPTC/UNEP, 1990). Prefectural Government Ordinance mayimpose more rigid maximum allowable water lead concentrations ranging from 0.1to 0.8mg/l213(ILZSG, 1989a). Japan also restricts the disposal, sale, production, and reclamation of industrial wastes with high lead quantities. The Wastes Disposal and Public Cleaning Law established requirementsfor the treatment and handling of such wastes including limits on the spreading or overflow ofwastes, aswellasrestrictionsonthelocationsof potentialreclamationareas(MITI, 1991). LeadinProducts Asignificant portionof the lead consumed by Japan is dedicated to the production of lead- acid batteries. The majority of these batteries are designed for use in automobiles. Because sucha large portion of the lead-acid batteries are sold to consumers, Japan has used market incentives(at different points of sale) to promote recycling of lead-acid batteries. Today almost the entireamountofleadusedforthesebatteriesisbeingcollectedandrecycled(MITI,1991). Occupational Standards Theadministrativelevelforleadintheworkplaceisset at 0.1mg/m 3214MEXICO In light of the level of lead exposure of Mexican populations and potential adverse health effects, the Mexican government has taken both regulatory and nonregulatory actions, most overthe last ten years, to reduce lead exposure. These activities can be placed into four generalcategories: aprogrammetoreducetheuseof leadingasoline; aprogrammetodevelopstandardsandcriteria; establishment of an agreement between government and representatives of industrial, craftsmenandenvironmentalgroupstoreduceleadinconsumerproducts; and ahealtheducationprogramme. AllinformationonMexicanleadpolicywasobtainedfromCortinasdeNava(1992). LeadinGasoline In 1980, a programme to reduce tetraethyl lead concentration in the regular gasoline (NOVA) was initiated. In 1988, the automobile industry was committed by the government tointroduce catalytic convertors on new model cars beginning in 1991. In 1990, unleaded gasoline(MAGNA SIN) was introduced with the same specifications as the most frequently purchased USgasolines. Overall, from 1988-1992, an 88percent reduction in the lead content of gasoline tookplace, decreasing lead concentrations from approximately 1.0 to 0.1g/l. Notably, a 50percentreduction occurred between 1991 and 1992. In 1992, the price of unleaded gasoline decreasedandthepricedifferencebetweenleadedandunleadedgasolinediminishedfrom40to15percent. LeadinDrinkingWater For drinking water, the General Health Law Regulation published in 1988 established a lead level of 0.05mg/l. In 1989, the Ecological Water Quality Criteria set the following surfacewater qualitycriteria: freshwater : average lead concentration adjusted for hardness over 4 days should not exceedonceeach3yearsthefollowingvalues: Pb(mg/l)=e : 0.1mg/l215LeadinFood Mexico has also set several standards for lead in foodstuffs, drugs and cosmetics. The maximum permissible level of lead in tomato sauce is 0.36mg/kg according to a Mexican OfficialNorm (NOM) published in 1982, while the maximum permissible level in vegetable shortening is0.1mg/kg, according to the General Health Law Regulation published in 1988. The maximumpermissible level of lead in synthetic organic dyes (No. 6 twilight yellow) added to food, beverages,drugsandcosmeticsis10mg/kg, accordingtoaNOMpublishedin1975. StandardsforEnvironmental MediaandPointSourceControls The following waste water effluent limits were established as Technical Ecological Norms (thefirst twoin1988, thenext twoin1991): metalindustryeffluents : 0.1mg/ldailyaverage copperindustryeffluents : 1.0mg/l maintenance, gas stations, dry cleaning, and photography developing watereffluents : 1.0mg/ldailyaverage urbanandmunicipalwastewaterusedforagriculturalirrigation :0 . 5 0 m g / l . Lead is included in the list of substances that, if present in waste at concentrations higher than 5.0mg/l, make it hazardous, according to an Technical Ecological Norm published in 1988. Anew Norm that will substitute for the current one includes a list of industrial activities that generatehazardouswastescontaininglead, as: \u007fgalvanoplastyandmetalfinishing, \u007fextraction, separation, andbeneficiationof metals, \u007fbatteryproduction. LeadinProducts On June 5, 1991 President Carlos Salinas deGortari gave instructions to establish within 30daysaprogrammetoreduceleadcontentinconsumerproducts. Government authorities and representatives of industries, artisans and non-governmental environmentalgroupsenteredintoanagreement onJuly5, 1991that establishesthefollowing: \u007fLead-soldered cans: the metallic can industry representatives agreed to eliminate the use of lead solder and introduce a new welding technology by October1992. InJuly1992, the goal was attained. The approximate cost of technology substitution was$30million (US). A Mexican Official Norm has been elaborated to specifyrequirementsforfoodcans. \u007fPaints and pigments: representatives of industries that produce paints and pigments, together with government officials, modified two lead standards for the use of lead onproducts used to cover the surface of toys and school articles. Two NOMs werepublished on the January 6-7, 1992. A maximum permissible level of lead in surface216paint of 90mg/kgwasestablished. Industries agreed to eliminate the use of lead red oxide, and lead basic carbonate from pigments, lacquer, enamel, paint and varnish, on toys, pencils, color pencils and otherschool articles, printing inks, cosmetics, furniture, and paints for interiors, in threemonths. A Technical Health Norm has been elaborated to regulate the use of leadoxidesandcarbonates. Three NOMs had been published in 1992 describing methods to determine lead in paintsandpigments, aswellasondrysurfacepaints. A month after the signature of the Agreement, labels warning about the presence of leadon paints and health effects from inhalation or ingestion were introduced on all theproducts in the market or in stocks. In June1992, a Technical Health Normconcerninglabelingof paint productscontainingleadwaspublished. \u007fLead glazed pottery: Representatives of artisans, Those requirements are considered in a NOM published on December 1991. An additional NOM concerning the method to determine lead solubility was published atthesametime. In1988, aNOMwaspublishedtoestablish lead solubility standards onleadbasedglassdecoration. A research group was established to study technological alternatives to substitute the use of lead on glazed pottery or to decrease lead solubility without changing the typicalcharacteristics of regional glazed pottery. This programme was given 1000millionMexican pesos in support from the National Solidarity Programme. More funding willbeprovidedtochangefuelstofiretheglazedpottery. Education The Health Secretariat has established an education programme to transmit messages to showalternativestoreduceleadexposure. Occupational Standards The maximum permissible level in air in the work place is 150 \u00b5g/m 3, as established by No. 10 Instructive of the Hygiene and Occupational Health Regulation. The reduction of this standardto50 \u00b5g/m3isbeingconsidered.217NEWZEALAND The following information to reduce risks to health and the environment from exposure to leadwasobtainedfrom Dr. N. Foronda(PublicandPersonalHealth-- NewZealand, 1992). The current mean blood level in New Zealand is 7\u00b5g/dl. Lead from paint and food and drink containers are the major sources of the New Zealand mean blood level. Petrol lead accountsfor 5percent. Studies conducted between 1974 and 1984 show that blood lead levels dropped by40percent for adult males and 35percent for adult females and children. This reduction wasattributed to the removal of lead from food and drink containers. In 1986, the lead content of petrolwasreducedfrom0.84g/lto0.45g/lbut nosignificant reductioninleadbloodlevelwasobserved. Lead-basedPaint The Toxic Substances Regulations 1983 requires that the maximum permissible amount of lead in paint is 5000mg/kg. This level will be reduced to 2500mg/kg in the proposed fourthamendment of theregulationswhichareanticipatedtobepromulgatedinJune1993. The current regulations also specify that no person shall manufacture, import, supply, sell, or use any paint, distemper, powder coating, pigment, or anti-fouling composition that containsbasicleadcarbonatewhichisalsoknownaswhitelead. Labelling The container of any paint, distemper, or powder coating that contains in its dry weight more than 5000mg/kg must be labelled as prescribed under the Toxic Substances Regulations1983. LeadinPetrol An amendment to the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Products Specifications) Regulations 1988 has been made which reduced the maximum permissible level of lead contamination in NewZealandunleadedpetrolfrom0.05g/lto0.013g/l. In1986, the maximum permissible level of lead in leaded gasoline was 0.84g/l. This level wasreducedsignificantlyto0.46g/l. Thetarget dateforeliminationof Water Standards for New Zealand\" have been prepared from the WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality 1984 and provides a guideline value of 0.05mg/l. The NewZealand standard is proposed to be reviewed in 1993 to align with the new WHO Guidelines. Thedraft proposalfortheWHO GuidelineshasbeenreleasedandtheywillbefinalizedinJune1993.218LeadinFood The Food Regulations 1984 establishes maximum permissible proportions for a range of foodproducts. Theselevelsrangefrom0.2to10partspermillion(First TabletoRegulation257). LeadinAmbientAir New Zealand has proposed a national ambient air quality guideline of 1.0\u00b5g/m3for an averagetimeofthree-monthmovingaverage. LeadinSewageSludge In 1992, recommended limits for lead in sewage sludge intended for application to arable land were established. The maximum acceptable concentration in dry sewage sludge is600mg/kg, the limit value allowable in soil is 300mg/kg, and the maximum cumulative loading is125kg/ha. LeadinProducts The Toxic Substances Regulations 1983 prohibit the manufacture, importation, packing or selling of any graphic material that contains more than 100mg/kg of lead. A graphic material isdefinedasanymaterialusedforwriting, drawing, markingorpainting. The maximum permissible amount of lead is 5000mg/kg in coating materials as required in the New Zealand Specification for the Safety of Toys. This level will be reduced to 2500mg/kgin the Fourth Amendment of the Toxic Substances Regulations 1983. Accessible plastics materialonatoyisrestrictedtoamaximumpermissibleamount of 250mg/kg. Occupational Standards The Workplace Exposure Standards for New Zealand has adopted a value of 0.15mg/m 3 forair.219SWEDEN Sweden has undertaken an aggressive approach to controlling lead exposure. Sweden advocates an ambitious long term objective of the cessation of lead use. Many of the proposalsput forth by Sweden to control lead exposure are more rigid than other OECD countries. In thenear term, Sweden's active stance is reflected in the range of regulatory policies and measuresadopted. Sweden has implemented risk reducing strategies aimed at a variety of environmentalmedia, environmentalpoint sources, andindustrialandconsumerproducts. Lead-basedPaint In Sweden, white lead compounds are not used in paints; however, some lead is used in paint as pigments, drying agents, and rust-proofing agents. Most lead paint is used on exteriorstructures and equipment. Through a voluntary agreement with the Sweden National ChemicalsInspectorate, Swedish paint producers agreed to eliminate the use of lead chromate pigments inpaint by July of 1990 (Andersson, 1990). There is work on-going aiming at further voluntaryagreementstolimit theuseof leadinpaint. LeadinGasoline In Sweden, limits on the lead content in gasoline are 0.15g/l for leaded gasoline and 0.013g/l for unleaded gasoline. In addition to these limits, Sweden requires all new automobiles tohave catalytic converters and operate on unleaded gasoline (Andersson, 1990). These limits andrequirements were effective in 1989, and the Swedish government anticipates a 360tonnereduction in lead emissions from motor vehicles from 1988to 1995 (NCI, 1990). In addition, in1991, the tax on leaded gasoline was raised in an effort to decrease its use (Wahlstrom, 1992).There is a proposal to further limit lead emissions from motor vehicles by revising standards ongasoline and motor vehicles imported, produced, and sold in Sweden (NCI, 1990). In 1993, the taxdifference between leaded and unleaded gasoline will be raised once again. Recently the SwedishEnvironment Protection Agency in a report to the Government has proposed a ban to manufactureor import leaded gasoline from July 1, 1994. The proposal has not been considered by theGovernmentyet. LeadinDrinkingWater Since there are no lead pipes in Sweden, lead in drinking water is considered to be a minor problem. Nevertheless, beginning in 1980, the National Food Administration set definitionsfor suitable and unsuitable waters. Waters with lead concentrations less than 0.01mg/l aredeemed suitable; waters with lead concentrations from 0.01mg/l to less than 0.05mg/l aredeemed suitable with remark; and waters with lead concentrations greater than or equal to0.05mg/l are deemed unsuitable. In 1989, a special ordinance was issued that prescribed thatinstallations in contact with drinking water must be made of materials that leach less than 0.05mg/lof lead(Andersson, 1990).220LeadinFood Swedish food tolerance levels have recently been lowered to 0.3-0.5mg/kg for most canned food, and to between 0.02-0.5mg/kg for various foodstuffs (higher values for spices etc.).Sweden wishes to eliminate imported lead soldered cans (virtually all cans manufactured inSwedenarewelded)(Wahlstrom, 1992). Swedenalsowishestosubject cannedfoods to the samestandardsasfreshfoods(Andersson,1990). StandardsforEnvironmental MediaandPointSourceControls In Sweden, air and water emission standards are set on a case by case basis during the facility licensing process. For air point sources, the Environmental Protection Act states that leadgases are expected to be collected and controlled by fabric filters (ILZSG, 1989a). For smeltersandothercombustors, licensesgiventofacilitiesarecontingent onfacilitiesusingthebest availabletechnology (BAT), limiting disturbances and/or interferences, and meeting industry specific fluedust standards. For example, primary smelters after 1991 must limit total annual air emissions to30tonnes. In addition, they must meet a maximum allowable flue dust concentration (of theprocessgasafterfilter)of 20mg/m 3drygas(Andersson,1990). A similar regulatory structure is used to control water point sources. Water that is discharged and contains heavy metals (for example, lead) are subject to BAT requirements andreview (ILZSG, 1989a). For example, primary smelters after 1991 must limit total annual wateremissions to 2tonnes. In addition, they must meet a maximum allowable concentration in effluentwaterof 0.1mg/l(Andersson, 1990). LeadinProducts Sweden has worked to actively reduce risks to health and the environment from lead in products. As part of this effort, Sweden has implemented product quality standards, recyclingpolicies, andinformationcampaigns. Ceramic standards were enacted by industry. Ceramic wares intended for handling food or beverages are prohibited from sale if more than 3mg/l lead is leached out during a standardizedaceticacidleachingtest (Andersson, 1990). Sweden also proposes to eliminate the use of underground sheathing cables and lead plastic additives (NCI, 1990). The goal is to eliminate use of lead-sheathed underground cables by1995. There is currently a voluntary effort to not use underground lead-sheathed cables after 1994(Wahlstrom, 1992). Another future area of interest/control is crystal. In this area, Sweden isassisting with the development of semi lead-free crystal and eventually whole lead-free crystal(NCI, 1990). Industry voluntarily agreed not to use lead in the manufacturing of semi-crystal after1991 and today no glassworks use lead for semi-crystal (Wahlstrom, 1992). Miscellaneous usesare presently being investigated, to form a basis for discussions with industry about voluntarymeasures. A total of around 1000 tonnes of lead shot is used in Sweden annually. Since 1991, a voluntaryreduction, stimulatedbyinformation and educational campaigns, is being attempted. Thegoal is to shift to lead-free alternatives by the beginning of the 21st century. Unless significantresultscanbeforseen, bansmaybeconsideredinthenearfuture.221Recycling In Sweden, the Environmental Protection Agency has levied a tax on all batteries to be paid for by producers and importers. The tax is used to support the companies that receive, storeand transport batteries for final disposal. So successful is this programme that in its first 3yearsmore batteries were returned than had been sold during the same period; presumably, manyconsumers returned discarded batteries they had previously stored (Andersson, 1990). Furtherefforts to control lead exposure from batteries (i.e. occupational, disposal, and manufacture) havebeen proposed. These include increased support for the recycling initiative described above (i.e.returnable deposits for new batteries) as well as increased support for lead battery designimprovementsand/orthedevelopment of potentiallead-freesubstitutes(NCI, 1990). Occupational Standards In Sweden, the maximum allowable air lead concentration in the workplace is 0.10mg/m 3 (total) and 0.05mg/m3(respirable) expressed as a time weighted average over eight hours. The maximumbloodleadvaluesforbothmaleandfemaleare 50 \u00b5g/dl in three consecutive checks and 60\u00b5g/dl in one check (ILZSG, 1989a). New regulations will come into force on January 1, 1994. The medical removal blood lead concentration in the workplace will be 1)for men and for women over 50years: 40 \u00b5g/dl for 3 consecutive checks and 50 \u00b5g/dl for any one check, and, 2)for womenunder50years:25 \u00b5g/dlfor3consecutivechecksand30 \u00b5g/dlforanyonecheck.222SWITZERLAND Lead-basedPaint The use of lead in different colours and writing materials is regulated in the Order concerning prohibited toxic substances and in the Ordinance on food (Lebensmittelverordnung).The regulations have been implemented in order to protect the general population from direct leadintake. Theycanbesummarizedasfollows: \u007fThe use of lead and its compounds is prohibited in water paints and non-washable distempersusedforinteriorpaintwork. Leadisprohibitedaswellindyesforclothing. \u007fCoatings and leads of writing and painting materials for household and school are not allowed to release more than 250 mg Pb/kg coating when incubated for one hour into0.07 mol/l HCl at 21 \u00b0C; the maximum concentration of lead in refills and liquid inks is 250mg/kgdryresidue. \u007fWater colours for household and school may not release more than 100 mg PB/kg whenincubatedforonehourinto0.07mol/lHClat 21 \u00b0C. LeadinGasoline,aircraftpetrolandheatingfuel The lead content in gasoline is limited to 0.15 g/l (leaded), to 0.013 g/l (unleaded) and to 0.56g/l in aircraft petrol. In 1992 the market share of unleaded gasoline has reached about 65 percent. The lead content of heating fuel \"Extra leicht\" is limited to 1 mg/kg whereas the fuel qualities\"Mittel\"and\"Schwer\"maynot containmorethan5mg/kg. LeadinDrinkingWater The permissible lead concentration in drinking water is 0.05 mg/l. The use of lead containingpipesandtubesisprohibited. StandardsforEnvironmental MediaandPointSourceControls Effluents discharged into surface waters or public sewers must have a lead concentration of less than 0.5 mg/l. The quality criteria for surface water flows and impounded river water is setat 0.05mg/l. In Switzerland the general emission limit for combusters with a mass flow greater than 25 g/hr is set at 5 mg/m 3. For municipal waste incinerators the sum of lead and zinc including its compounds emitted into the atmosphere must not exceed 1 mg/m3. The maximum tolerable lead concentrationinair(suspendeddust)islimitedat 1 \u00b5g/m3perday. In order to guarantee long-term soil fertility, Switzerland has implemented guide levels for soil pollutants. According to the ordinance relating to pollutants in soil the total lead content islimited to 50mg/kg, soluble lead to 1 mg/kg. The use of sewage sludge and compost foragriculturalpurposesisprohibitedif itsleadcontent exceeds500mg/kgor120mg/kg, respectively.223Occupational Standards The maximum allowable air lead concentration in the workplace is 0.1 mg Pb/m3(time- weighted average over eight hours) for lead and lead compounds (except alkyl compounds), and0.075 mg Pb/m 3for tetramethyl and maximum allowable blood lead concentrationis30 \u00b5g/dlforwomenand70 \u00b5g/dlformen.224UNITEDKINGDOM Over the period from 1973 to 1974, the United Kingdom conducted its first comprehensive study of lead. This study was unique in the sense that no such study had been conducted foralmost any other environmental pollutant. The goal established at that time by the Department ofEnvironment's Central Unit on Environmental Pollution was to implement lead pollution controlpolicies that would ensure that lead exposure in the United Kingdom would not increase. Areasandcircumstancesof highexposuretoleadweretobeidentifiedandremedied(Whitehead, 1989). Much of the United Kingdom's concern stemmed from high-levels of exposure that were found in the early 1970s at works sites in East London. In the area surrounding these industrialsites, families and workers were identified with elevated blood lead levels and air and dust samplesrevealed high lead concentrations (Reed, 1987). These sites would prove to have much influenceon the UK's lead control strategy which, like many other countries, has been focussed onidentifyingandremedyinghot spots. To date, the United Kingdom has shown initiative in establishing lead risk reduction strategies that influence environmental media and sources, consumer products, and environmentalhealth. It is important to note that many of the UK's efforts were done in accordance to EuropeanCommunity guidelines. When problems were not addressed by the EC, however, the UnitedKingdom has relied on a variety of strategies including legal quality standards, voluntaryagreements, action programmes, and subsidized public and private remedial actions (Whitehead,1989). BloodLeadActionLevels United Kingdom government advice published in 1982 recommended taking steps to reduceexposureif bloodleadlevelsexceed25 \u00b5g/dl(Rea, 1991). Lead-basedPaint There have been substantial reductions in the use of white and red lead pigments in paints within the United Kingdom. Some uses remain, however, including those for corrosioncontrolonsteelworkandfor protection of outdoor work. In addition, lead chromates continue to beusedinpaint forroadmarkings(Rea, 1991). A voluntary agreement between the government and the Paint Makers Association (who account for over 90percent of the UK's production of solvent thinned alkyd paint) was establishedto eliminate the use of lead additives in decorative paints and varnishes by 1987 (Whitehead,1989). The United Kingdom has implemented legislation concerning lead paint that prevents theuse of lead carbonates and lead sulphates in paint. Under these rules, lead carbonates andsulfates may only be used in paint for certain historic buildings and art preservation (Atherton,1992). LeadinGasoline In 1983, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution estimated that adults in the United Kingdom derived up to 20percent of their body lead burden from gasoline lead. At this225time, the United Kingdom concurred with certain other European countries (for example, Germany) to phase out the use of lead additives in gasoline entirely (Whitehead, 1989). Since 1973, theallowable lead content in gasoline has been steadily reduced within the United Kingdom. Mostrecently, in 1986, the maximum allowable concentration of lead in gasoline was set at 0.15 g/l.Unleaded gasoline was first widely introduced in 1986 with a maximum allowable leadconcentration of 0.013 g/l (85/210/EEC). Beginning in 1988, the Road Vehicle and Type ApprovalRegulations specified that all new vehicles must be capable of running on unleaded gasoline in the1990s(Rea, 1991). Observing the period from 1986 to 1987, it was estimated that the amount of lead discharged by motor vehicles in the UK dropped by 60percent after the 1986 reduction. Similarly,average airborne lead concentrations at twenty-one of the UK monitoring sites fell by nearly50percent overthissametimeperiod(Reed, 1987). LeadinDrinkingWater In 1973, regional authorities within the United Kingdom were made responsible for water supply, treatment, and management. As part of this responsibility, authorities were asked tomaintain \"wholesome\" drinking water quality. A survey in 1983, however, revealed thatapproximately 10percent of the water supplies required reduction in the plumbsolvency of thewater (Whitehead, 1989). In response to this concern, the 1989 Water Supply Regulations set themaximum concentration of lead in drinking water at 50 \u00b5g/l (the same level proscribed by the EC in 80/778/EEC). These regulations also require water companies to install further treatment where there is risk of exceeding the standard at the customer's tap. Discretionary grants are also madeavailabletocustomerswhorequiretreatment at orneartheirkitchentap(Rea, 1991). Studies concerning lead in drinking water have been conducted in two areas of Scotland. In Glasgow, several areas with high plumbsolvency in their water supplies were identified. Toassess the potential impact of this exposure source, a sample consisting of 131infants and theirmothers were analysed. Mean blood levels for bottle-fed infants; and for breast-fed infants. The study revealed a curvilinear relationship between blood lead and lead intake, suggesting that blood lead was strongly affected by low lead intakes. These results raised concerns about drinking water as a contributor to lead exposure particularlyforinfants(Reed, 1987). To demonstrate the value of abatement efforts, a study was also conducted in Ayr. The sampleincluded 74women. After replacing lead service lines/pipes, the median blood lead level ofthesampledroppedfrom21 \u00b5g/dlto13 \u00b5g/dl(Reed, 1987). The UK government has recently proposed regulations to prohibit the use of certain lead solders and the supply of integral solder ring copper fittings containing lead solder in domesticwater supply installation, and to impose restrictions on the labelling and display of solders. In theregulations, lead solder is defined as that which contains more than 0.1percent lead (Atherton,1992). LeadinFood Theestimatedmeanweeklyintakeof leadthrough the person(MAFF, 1989). TheUnitedKingdom hasestablished qualityand labeling standards for a range of consumer products. Since 1979, the UK government has226enforced a general limit for lead in food of 1.0mg/kg, with exceptions for certain specified foods (i.e. 0.2mg/kg baby food, 2.0mg/kg for liver). Since lead solder has been phased out from use incans manufactured in the UK (and in a number of other countries), the general limit of 1.0mg/kgalso applies to food stuffs supplied in these containers. A survey of cans from 1983 to 1987revealed marked reductions in lead levels with only one can of the 1987 sample not passing thelimits (MAFF, 1987). The United Kingdom has also considered subjecting imported food productstothesameleadinfoodproductslimits(Reed, 1987). LeadinSoils An analysis of metals in urban dust and soils in the UK conducted over several years, beginning in 1981, showed elevated urban dust and soil concentrations relative to agricultural soilconcentrations (Emerson et al., 1992). There are currently no UK standards for lead levels in soils. However, the Department of the Environment promotes guidance drawn up by the Interdepartmental Committee on the Redevelopment of Contaminated Land for the assessment ofpolluted soils (ICRCL, 1987). This guidance incorporates the concept of \"trigger concentrations,\"which depend on the intended use of the contaminated site. The trigger concentration for lead isset at 500mg/kg(airdriedsoil) for land used as domestic gardens and allotments, and 2000mg/kgfor parks and playing fields. When levels at a site are known to exceed these concentrations, it isrecommended that further investigation be conducted to ascertain the risks to human healthassociated with the use of the land, and recourse to remedial action is dependent on the outcomeofsuchastudy. United Kingdom Regulations implementing EC Directive 86/278/EEC were designed to protect soils when sewage sludge is used in agriculture. A maximum permissible concentration forlead in soils of 300mg/kg dry solids after the application of sewage sludge has been establishedalong with an average annual rate of addition of lead amounting to 15kg/hectare calculated over atenyear period. These limits are accompanied by more detailed requirements for sludgeproducers and landowners, aimed at protecting the wider environment and, in particular, grazinganimals. StandardsforEnvironmental MediaandPointSourceControls The United Kingdom has followed the guidelines set forth by the European Community for controlling ambient air emissions. The limit for lead is 2.0 \u00b5g/m 3expressed as a mean annual concentration(ILZSG, 1989a). The United Kingdom regulates air point sources such as smelter and other lead works. Best practicable means (BPM) are used to treat and control air emissions. BPM technologies areagreed upon through negotiations between the government and industry. Using thesetechnologies, industrial sources must meet an allowable lead concentration of 0.002g/m 3with the exception of some sources that must meet an allowable lead concentration of 0.01g/m3. Total particulateemissionscannot exceed0.1g/m3(Rea, 1991). Some water point sources, such as industrial effluents, are also regulated in the United Kingdom. Permissible lead concentrations vary with the plant location and receiving water.Overall, the typical range of permissible lead concentrations is 1.0 through 5.0mg/l (ILZSG,1989a). The content of lead in the effluent should correspond to the Environmental QualityStandard for the receiving waters established by the Department of the Environment (DOE, 1989). These standards vary between freshwater and salt water and with total hardness (mg/l CaCO 3)227andwhetherthewaterisabstractedtopotablesupply. Under the 1974 Control of Pollution Act, the United Kingdom placed some restrictions on the production, disposal, and import of special waste. Wastes consisting of or containing lead areincluded in the special waste category. Individuals wishing to produce, dispose, or import suchwastes are required to complete a consignment note for disposal authorities (Reed, 1991). Since1986, the United Kingdom has also required operators that transport lead-containing wastes tomeet specifictransport requirements(i.e. vehicledesign, drivertraining)(ILZSG, 1989b). LeadinProducts As of 1988, ceramic wares have also been subject to regulations. Industry was given five years to meet maximum lead concentrations of 0.8mg/dm 2for flatware; 4.0mg/l for small hollowware (volume less 1.5mg/l for large hollowware (volume greater than3litres). Follow-up surveys conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Fisheries haveshowncloseto100percent compliancewiththeselimitsintheUK(Rea, 1991). In addition to food and ceramic wares, the United Kingdom also restricts the use of lead- based paint in consumer products. Lead in dry paint film on toys is limited to 0.25percent byweight. The soluble lead content of a paint coating applied to a pencil, pen, or brush is limited to0.025percent byweight (Rea, 1991). Recycling There are currently no regulations governing the disposal of lead batteries within the United Kingdom. Despite this fact, recycling rates are approximately 100percent for batteriesinstalled in buildings and close to 90percent for those installed in automobiles. There is muchdiscussion of passing regulation that would control the disposal of lead batteries in coordinationwith the European Community proposals on this subject (Rea, 1991). The transport of leadbatteries is regulated as individuals transporting batteries that contain more than 1litre ofelectrolyte must abide by restrictive transport conditions (i.e. manifest and vehicle requirements)(ILZSG, 1989b). Education/Labelling In the United Kingdom, a joint informational campaign between the Lead Development Association and angling groups has resulted in a phase-out of lead weights in fishing. The UnitedKingdom also specifies that all paints and varnishes containing more than 0.15percent lead byweight must belabelledaccordingly(Rea, 1991). Occupational Standards In January of 1981, the maximum allowable concentration of lead in the workplace in the United Kingdom was set at 0.15mg/m 3(expressed as a time weighted average over 8hours). The maximum allowable blood lead concentrations were also set at this time at 80 \u00b5g/dl for men and 40\u00b5g/dlforwomen(ILZSG, 1989a). In1986thebloodleadlimit formenwasreducedto70\u00b5g/dl.228UNITEDSTATES Throughout the past 25 years, the United States has been quite active in sponsoring regulatory measures to reduce potential human exposures to lead, many of which have beensuccessful. TheUShasrestricted or banned the use of many products containing lead where risksfrom these products are high and where substitutes for lead or lead-based products are available.For products where risks to human health and/or the environment are lower, or for whichtechnically and economically adequate substitutes are not available, lead control strategies havefocused on recycling, emissions controls on the mining and processing of lead, and the ultimatedisposal of lead-containing products. Finally, in certain important areas where exposure is basedon past uses of lead, education and abatement programmes have been used. The US continuesto pursue additional lead risk reduction measures, focusing on those sources with greatestexposureandriskpotential. BloodLeadActionLevels The definition of a blood lead level that defines a level of concern for lead in children continues to be an important issue in the United States. The childhood blood lead concentration ofconcern in the US has been steadily lowered by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) from40\u00b5g/dl, in 1970, to the current action level of 10 \u00b5g/dl established in 1991. Earlier, the EPA had lowered the level of concern to 10\u00b5g/dl (\"10-15 and possibly lower\") in 1986. The Agency for Toxic Substance Disease Registry (ATSDR) identified the same level of concern in the 1988 Report toCongressonchildhoodleadpoisoning. TheCDChasissuedrecommendationsforactions at different blood lead levels in children (CDC, 1991a). For a community with a significant number of children having blood lead levelsbetween 10-14 \u00b5g/dl, initiation of community-wide lead poisoning prevention activities is recommended. For individual children with blood lead levels between 15-19 \u00b5g/dl, CDC recommends nutritional and educational interventions. Blood lead levels of 20 \u00b5g/dl and higher shouldtriggerinvestigationsof theaffectedindividual'senvironment andmedicalevaluations. Lead screeningforchildrenhasrecentlyincreasedsignificantly. Themedicalremovalbloodleadconcentrationintheworkplace, whichbecameeffective in 1983, is 50 \u00b5g/dl for three consecutive checks and 60 \u00b5g/dl for any one check. Blood level monitoringistriggeredbyanairleadconcentrationabove30 \u00b5g/m 3. is permitted to return toworkwhenhisbloodleadlevelfallsbelow40 \u00b5g/dl. Lead-basedPaint Oneof thehighest-risksourcesof lead for children in the US is lead-based paint. In 1977, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission set a standard for lead in residential paint of0.06percent (16 CFR 1303). Although this restriction effectively banned lead in residential paint inthe US, an estimated threemillion tons of lead in paint still remains in US dwellings (ATSDR,1988). TheUSDepartment of Housingand Urban Development (HUD) has proposed an extensiveprogramme to reduce exposure from deteriorating lead-based paint, including research, technicalassistance, funding for abatement in public housing and assistance to local governments (HUD,1990). As part of their comprehensive plan, HUD estimated that if 500 000 high-priority homeswere tested every year, the total cost of testing these homes and performing abatement where229necessary would be $1.9to $2.4billion. In a separate analysis, the US Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Disease Control (1991b) estimated that total present cost ofabatement of the 23million occupied pre-1950 housing units containing lead paint would be$34billion, if abatements were conducted over a 20-year period. While these costs are high, theestimated benefits of such a programme are also substantial: CDC also estimated that the presentvaluemonetizedhealthbenefitsof the20-yearabatement programme would be $62billion over thelifetime of the occupants; the present value of net benefits (benefits minus costs) was estimated tobe$28billion(CDC, 1991b). To help address the problems of lead-based paint abatement, HUD has established an Office of Lead-based Paint Abatement and Poisoning Prevention. There is also an InteragencyLead-based Paint Task Force that includes EPA and HUD (co-chairs), the Department of Healthand Human Services, Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Department ofCommerce's National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Institute forEnvironmental Health Services (NIEHS), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), theAgency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry (ATSDR), the Department of State, the Council forEnvironmental Quality (CEQ), the Department of Defense (DOD), branches of the military, theResolution Trust Corporation (RTC), the Department of Veteran Affairs and the Department ofEnergy. Major Task Force activities include integrating various agency lead strategies into aunified approach to address childhood lead poisoning and lead paint abatement; establishing aninformation clearinghouse on lead paint and other lead exposures; and investigating improvedanalyticaltechnology. EPA is particularly active in evaluating abatement technologies and measurement technologies, establishing programmes to assure a trained skilled work force is available, and infurthering technology transfer and outreach. A national public education campaign is expected tobe launched in 1993 by the President's Commission on Environmental Quality, a public/privatepartnershipgroup. OSHA is required to develop an interim final standard for lead in construction in 1993. Thisregulationisbeingdevelopedinpart toaddressexposuretolead-basedpaint. In addition to Federal activity, several individual US states have also instituted aggressive programmes to reduce exposures to lead in residential buildings. States have also proposedrestrictions on paint removal activities to limit exposures during abatement. For example, Texas isproposing a ban on sandblasting painted structures when paint contains more than 1percent leadand the structure is located near a residential or public area. Minnesota has developed a set ofpollution control recommendations for the removal of paint that contains more than 1percent lead(EPA, 1991c). In October 1992, the Residential Lead-based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 was enacted. This law provides the framework for a national approach to reduce hazards from lead-based paint exposure, primarily from housing. The law requires HUD to provide grants to States toreduce hazards in non-Federally-owned or -assisted housing, to evaluate and reduce lead hazardsin Federally-owned or -assisted housing, and to issue guidelines for performing risk assessments,inspection, in-place management and abatement of lead hazards. EPA is mandated to promulgateregulations ensuring that those engaged in abatement activities are trained and that trainingprogrammes are certified, to establish standards for abatement activities, to promulgate modelState programmes from compliance with training and accreditation regulation, to establish alaboratory accreditation programme, to establish a clearinghouse for dissemination of information,to promulgate regulations for the disclosure of lead hazards at property transfer, to conduct a study230on the hazards of renovation and remodeling activities, and to develop regulations to identify lead hazardsinpaint, dust, andsoil.231LeadinGasoline The US restricts the amount of lead allowed per litre of leaded gasoline to 0.026grams. Inadditiontothislimit, theUnitedStatesrequiredthat, beginningin1988, allnewlight duty vehiclesand trucks, motorcycles and heavy duty gasoline engines must operate on unleaded gasoline.Unleaded gasoline may not contain more than 0.01g/l of lead (IRPTC/UNEP, 1990). As of March1991, tetraethyl lead is no longer produced in the US. Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of1990, reformulated gasoline shall have no lead content. As of December31, 1995, a total ban onleaded gasoline and lead gasoline additives will be in place for highway use. In addition, all motorvehicle engines and non-road engines manufactured after model year1992 that require leadedgasolinewillbeprohibited. Reduction of lead in gasoline has been successful at reducing the level of lead in blood in several countries, although the magnitude of the reduction has varied. A number of studies in theUS (Annest et al., 1983; Schwartz and Pitcher, 1989) have attributed a drop in blood lead levels ingeneral populations from about 15 \u00b5g/dl to about 5 \u00b5g/dl to reductions in lead in gasoline (EPA, 1991a). Such reductions could yield substantial benefits. A 1985 study conducted by EPA examined the benefits of reducing lead in gasoline in the US (EPA, 1985a). This study examinedboth health benefits and materials benefits of reducing exposure due to misfueling, improved fueleconomy,andreducedmaintenancecostsassociatedwithreducingthecorrosiveeffectsofleadonengines and exhaust systems. The net benefits of the lead phase-down were estimated to rangefrom $6billionand$7billion. LeadinDrinkingWater In rules promulgated in June of 1991, the US EPA outlined new treatment requirements for drinking water systems (EPA, 1991b). The regulation requires tap water sampling from highrisk homes (for example, lead service lines or lead soldering installed since 1982). The first flushsample must be collected after water has sat in the household plumbing at least sixhours. If atleast 10percent of home tap samples exceed 15 \u00b5g/l (the \"action level\"), corrosion control treatment and public education is required. Replacement of lead service lines is required if corrosion control fails to bring water lead levels below the \"action level.\" The potential benefits ofincreased corrosion control are significant. EPA estimates that corrosion control treatment tocomply with this rule will reduce lead exposure from drinking water twoto threefold, and thatmonetized health benefits will total approximately $3-4billion annually. Total monitoring andtreatment costs of the rule are estimated to range between $500and $800million peryear (EPA,1991b). EPA has also taken other activities related to lead in drinking water. Pursuant to the Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988, EPA identified drinking water coolers that are not lead free(EPA, 1990). Based on this action, such water coolers became subject to action under CPSCjurisdiction. As a result of this action, in 1990, CPSC entered into a consent agreement with amajormanufacturerof suchwatercoolerstofundtheirrepair/removal(CPSC, 1990a). Several additional future regulations are under consideration by EPA to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water (EPA, 1992b). First, a more comprehensive ban on the sale of lead solderfor use in drinking water plumbing is being considered. Even though the Safe Drinking Water Actof 1986 prohibited the use of lead solder in drinking water plumbing, lead solder can still be legallypurchased by plumbers and home repairers. Further, this ban applied only to plumbing systemsconnected to public water systems (i.e.systems that serve more than 25people or have more than15 connections). Second, new regulations on fittings for drinking water plumbing are being232contemplated. This would first specify a performance standard for leaching of lead from these fittings to ensure compliance with EPA's new drinking water regulations. After tenyears, theperformance standard would be replaced with lead content standard. Meanwhile, EPA iscontinuing discussions with industry (through the National Sanitation Foundation International) onthe development of lead leaching standards for certification of plumbing fittings. Proposedlegislation in the US Congress also addresses lead in drinking water. Proposals include provisionsfor amending drinking water regulations with regard to sampling and compliance activities,increasing restrictions on lead solder, and setting performance standards for lead in plumbingfixtures. StandardsforEnvironmental MediaandPointSourceControls The Department of Housing and Urban Development has set interim guidelines for abatement of lead-based paint in public housing. These guidelines recommend abatement at1\u00b5g/cm 2paint of 0.5percent lead by weight and clearance levels for lead in household dust of 200\u00b5g/ft2for floors, 500 \u00b5g/ft2for window sills and 800 \u00b5g/ft2for window wells (HUD, 1990). No guidelines currently exist for residential soils, but the EPA has adopted an interim guidance citing levels to be attained once remediation at uncontrolled hazardous waste sites is determined to benecessary. The interim guidance recommends that clean-up should attain soil concentrations ofbetween 500and 1000mg/kg. Generally, these levels are believed to be protective of children inthe residential setting but are not intended to protect for ecological effects. EPA is conductingstudies in several large cities and will consider these studies in developing final guidance. Soilsremoved during remedial activities at waste sites must pass a leaching test or be subject todisposalashazardouswaste. Strategies aimed at reducing ongoing exposures to lead include emissions standards for sources of lead in air and water. The United States ambient air quality standard for lead iscurrently 1.5 \u00b5g/m 3(quarterly average), but a more stringent standard is now being considered. Surface water quality criteria exist for both freshwater and saltwater. In the United States, freshwater lead standards vary by water hardness. The most stringent standard allows amaximum fourday average of 1.3 \u00b5g/l with a onehour maximum of 34 \u00b5g/l. Saltwater criteriafortheUSlimit leadconcentrationstoanaverageof 5.6 \u00b5g/l. Thislimit cannot be exceeded more than once over a three-year period. Also, the EPA has proposed regulations for the use and disposal of sewage sludge containing lead. These proposed rules allow a maximum concentrationof lead in sludge of 300mg/kg and cumulative pollutant loading in the soil of not more than of300kg/ha. TheAgencyisreviewingcommentsonthisproposalandisdevelopingafinal regulationunderSection405Dof theCleanWaterAct tobepublishedinDecember, 1992. FDA has established acceptable lead levels for bottled water and table wine. There is a voluntary industry standard for calcium supplements (FDA, 1992a). Other standards for food andcosmeticadditivesrangefrom10to70mg/kg(IRPTC/UNEP, 1990). PointSourceControls The United States requires various lead smelting and processing facilities to use the best practicable control technology for new facilities and reasonable available control technologies forexisting facilities. In addition, lead emissions from these and other industries are controlled viaspecific facility permits written by states. The states are responsible for ensuring air quality in eachstate meets, at a minimum, EPA's ambient air quality standards discussed above. To do so, stateswrite site-specific permits for each lead source, designed to reduce emissions to the extent needed233tomeet EPAambient airstandards. EPA has initiated a voluntary programme based on the Toxics Release Inventory reporting, called the \"33/50 Project,\" which encourages industry to curtail emissions of 17toxicpollutants, including lead. The specific aim of the project is to obtain commitments from companiesto reduce voluntarily reported emissions, effluents and offsite transfers of these 17 pollutants thatareapplicabletotheiroperationsintwophases -- 33percent by 1992 and 50percent by 1995 --using 1988 as the baseline year. As of 1992, 850 companies have agreed to participate in thisprogramme. Federal effluent guidelines and pretreatment limits for lead-containing effluents exist for over 20 industries. These limits are implemented by states through facility-specific permits, andmaybemorestringent thanfederalrequirements, dependingonstatewaterqualitystandards. In the US, certain lead-containing wastes are specifically listed as hazardous. These include wastes generated by inorganic pigment manufacturing, primary metals production, andsecondary lead smelting. Other wastes are identified as hazardous if they exhibit a characteristic.The toxicity characteristic (TC) is determined by extracting the waste with a simulated leachate. Ifthe concentration of lead in the extract exceeds the regulatory limit of 5\u00b5g/l, the waste ishazardous. Hazardous wastes must be managed by a permitted treatment, storage or disposal facility. Land disposal of most untreated hazardous waste is prohibited. Permitted facilities mustperform groundwater monitoring and may be subject to corrective action if lead is found at levelsexceeding specified concentration limits. Special rules apply to used oil, lead-acid batteries, andhazardous waste burned as fuel in boilers and industrial furnaces. Currently, municipal solid wastecombustion ash is exempt from classification as a hazardous waste; in the past, this material wasclassifiedashazardousbecauseof failureof theTCtest. EPA continues to consider regulations for industries that discharge lead into the air and water. These regulatory actions are taken in the context of overall effluent guidelines for variousindustriesorairemissionslimitationsfornewsources. LeadinProducts Restrictions on lead in two major products, paint and gasoline, were discussed earlier. In addition to residential paint, the Consumer Product Safety Commission also regulates the use oflead paints and surface coatings used in toys, children's products and household furniture (16 CFR1303). Food cans and utensils are other important source of lead exposure. The US canningindustry has undertaken a voluntary phase-out of the use of lead in food cans since alternative,affordable processes for sealing the seams of tin containers are available (FDA, 1992a). The USFood and Drug Administration regulates use of ceramics as food containers. Ceramics fired at lowtemperatures must carry warnings or have a hole to prevent use with food. Ceramic glazes areregulated under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act and must be labelled with health warningsand instructions for use (EPA, 1991c). In November 1991, FDA published non-binding guidelinesfor acceptable levels of lead in ceramic ware, which significantly reduce previous levels (FDA,1991). Through voluntary co-operation of industry with FDA, it is expected that lead foil will not beused on wine bottles after 1993. The crystal ware industry is also sharing technology to reduceleaching of lead from lead crystal (FDA, 1992b). Eight US states have adopted legislation to limitthelevelsof leadinpackagingmaterials(EPA, 1991c).234The US has also instituted controls on lead in other products. The US restricts the use of lead ammunition in an effort to reduce risks to wildlife that may inadvertently ingest lead shot,especially birds. Recently, the EPA requested information on pesticide products that containedleadasaninert ingredient. As a result, 11 pesticides containing lead were canceled, and fourwerereformulated with ingredients other than lead. There are no known current pesticides that use leadasapesticideingredient (EPA, 1992a). RecyclingEvidence suggests that lead-acid batteries are frequently recycled in the United States. Thirty-nine states and one city have enacted legislation to encourage recycling of lead-acidbatteries, and a number of other states are considering similar proposals. Of these jurisdictions,33states and one city adopted laws that prohibit the disposal of lead-acid batteries in municipalsolid waste and require all levels of the collection chain to accept used lead-acid batteries. Ten ofthese 33states also adopted a deposit in lieu of trade system, with deposits ranging from $5to$10perbattery. Sixstateshavebannedthedisposal of lead-acid batteries in municipal solid waste(ITA, 1993). US legislation proposed in 1992 would encourage or require recycling for all lead-acidbatteries. The lead-acid battery not only accounts for the majority of lead consumption but has a higher recycling rate than any other recoverable material. The EPA's 1985 Report on the NationalSmall Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator Survey (US EPA, 1985b) indicated that nearly90percent of spent lead-acid batteries disposed by automobile service stations were sent torecycling facilities. A recycling rate study released by the Battery Council International (a tradeassociation representing the US and international lead-acid battery industry) reported an increaseintherecyclingratefrom88.6percent in1987to97.8percent in1990(ITA, 1993). Education/Labelling New proposed regulations for solder and brass plumbing fittings would require labels on products with information on the applicable use restrictions and rule language (EPA, 1992b). Artsand crafts materials containing lead must be labelled in accordance with the Labeling of HazardousArt Materials Act of 1988. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued severalpublicationson lead, including an alert on lead-based paint (CPSC, 1990b) and lead solder (CPSC,1988). Increased public education and expanded requirements for product labelling are elementsof recent proposed US lead legislation. A Federal Lead Clearinghouse/Hotline (1-800-532-3394),funded by EPA, HUD, the Department of Defense and CDC was put into service in 1992.Information on lead exposure and what parents and homeowners can do to reduce lead in theirchild'senvironment isavailable. Occupational Standards The Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the US Department of Labor has established environmental and biological standards for lead-using industries. Standards take theform of both permissible workplace air concentrations and permissible blood lead levels in workers. Environmental and biological monitoring must be conducted by the employer. Elevated blood lead levels may require the removal of an individual from the workplace (Niemeier, 1991). The currentPermissible Exposure Limit (PEL) generally limits air concentrations of lead to 50 \u00b5g/m 3, except for the construction industry, which, if not achievable with engineering controls, may require the use of personalrespirators.235OSHA is required to lower the permissible exposure limit for lead in construction from 200\u00b5g/m3to 50 \u00b5g/m3. Subsequent rulemaking will deal with provisions for methods for compliance, medical surveillance, exposure monitoring training, and the need to limit exposures below50 \u00b5g/m3. Theseactivitiesareslatedfor1993. Regulations established by OSHA prohibit general industry employees exposed to lead in their workplace from taking lead-contaminated work clothes from the work site, and requireemployers to provide hygiene facilities (showers, washing facilities) to lead workers. Theseprovisions are designed to ensure that family members will not be subjected to secondaryexposure to lead as a result of lead workers' occupational exposures. Recent legislation requiresOSHA to promulgate a final interim standard on occupational exposure to lead in the constructionindustrybymid-1993(OSHA, 1992).236NORDICCOUNTRIES Nordic countries have undertaken a number of joint initiatives towards protecting the environment. Denmark, Sweden and Norway have signed the Ministerial Declaration of the ThirdInternational Conference on the Protection of the North Sea. This declaration states that theemissions of lead (and other micropollutants) shall within 1995 be reduced by 70 per centcompared to the level in 1985. Denmark, Finland and Sweden have through the Baltic MarineEnvironment Commission (HelCom) adopted the goal of reducing lead emissions by 50 per centwithin1995, using1987asareferenceyear. On the commission of the Nordic Chemicals Group under the Nordic Council of Ministers, areport describing Nordic experiences regarding the technological possibilities for reducing the useof lead (G. Havenstrom & S.L. Bjornstad, 1992) has been elaborated. The long-term goal for theNordic countries is to completely eliminate the intentional use of lead in products and to minimizethe amount of lead discharged to the environment. The strategy to reach this goal includes inpreferentialorder: \u007fcleanertechnology(substitutionandprocessmodifications); \u007feffectiverecollectionandrecoverysystems; \u007fenvironmentallyacceptablewastetreatment.237EUROPEANCOMMUNITY Although the European Community published environmental programmes in 1973, 1977, and 1983, there were no explicit legal provisions for Community environmental actions prior to theSingle European Act taking effect in 1987. Despite this fact, over 100 instruments (mostlydirectives for harmonizing environmental protection measures) for environmental protection wereproposedbyMemberStatesfrom1972through1986. Reflected in these instruments, as well as inthoseproposedafter1987, isadesiretocontrolleadintheenvironment. The European Community has issued directives regulating lead in products and across different environmental media and environmental sources. It is important to note that a directive isa legislative action that is addressed to Member States and may either contain very specificinformation or be narrative in nature. A directive often sets a deadline for the Member States toadopt the directive into their own countries' law; typically, however, a directive will contain specificinformation and will set a deadline on the order of three years. If a Member country fails to adoptthe directive into law within the specified amount of time, then action may be taken against thatMemberintheEuropeancourts. Legal realities compound the difficulty of achieving environmental protection across the twelve Member States of the European Community, for the Member States are at different stagesof environmental control, with varied levels of environmental awareness and/or concern, and havedistinct regulatory entities. In regulating lead and other environmental hazards, the EuropeanCommunity must simultaneously prevent Member States from adopting rules that would inhibittradewithinthecommunityandlimit theextent of weakandinadequateenvironmentalpolicies. Theexperienceof developingaleadpolicyintheECexemplifiesthisregulatory challenge. For example, the European Community has issued policies that establish allowable lead contents for leaded and unleaded gasoline and encourage the use and manufacture of unleaded gasoline.Several European Community countries have switched to unleaded gasoline, but in countries suchas Spain and Portugal, unleaded gas is a rare commodity. Despite these types of problems, theEuropean Community has assembled an amalgam of instruments designed to control lead in theenvironment. BloodLeadActionLevels In 1977, the European Community introduced a directive on biological screening of the population for lead (77/312/EEC) designed to identify and control sources of unacceptable leadexposure. Each Member State was required to survey blood lead levels of groups of at least100persons in urban areas (population greater than 500,000) and in areas where significntexposuremight beexpected. At least two campaigns were required in each sampling area within aperiod of fouryears. Reference blood lead levels adopted for the study were 20mg/dl for50percentofagroup,30mg/dlfor90percent,and35mg/dlfor98percent. For most of the study populations, blood lead levels fell well within the reference values. However, a small number of areas were found in which reference values were exceeded andremedial measures were subsequently employed. A general decrease in population blood levelswithtimewasapparent inmost populationsstudied.238Lead-basedPaint Beginning in 1989, the European Community prohibited the use of lead carbonates and lead sulfates in paints intended for all purposes other than preservation work (89/677/EEC; Rea,1987). LeadinGasoline Beginning in 1987, the European Community limited lead levels in gasoline. No specific deadline is designated to the Member States for meeting standards, but a committee wasdeveloped to provide scientific and technical support for meeting the standards. The directive(82/210/EEC) sets the maximum permitted lead compound level of leaded gasoline at 0.15gramslead perlitre and defines unleaded gasoline as gasoline that contains less than 0.013 grams leadper litre (0.020grams lead per litre applied in certain exceptional cases until 1991) (IRPTC/UNEP1990). LeadinDrinkingWater Beginning in 1977, the European Community under Directive 75/440/EEC established classifications (i.e. A1, A2, and A3) for surface waters to be used as drinking water. Treatmentmethodologies were proposed for each classification with all sources having to meet a maximumlead level of 0.05 milligrams lead per litre (vonMoltke, 1987). This directive was supplemented byanother in 1981 (76/869/EEC) that recommended uniform methods of measurement and analysisfor Member States. Effective in August of 1982, the Community maximum allowable leadconcentrationwasestablishedat 0.05milligramsperlitre(80/778/EEC)(vonMoltke, 1987). LeadinSewageSludge The European Community has made concerted efforts to coordinate analysis of the treatment and use of sewage sludge among Member States. In July of 1989, standards(86/278/EEC) for sewage sludge used in agricultural applications became effective. The leadconcentration limit for soils with pH levels ranging from 6to 7 is 50to 300mg/kg dry matter, whilethe limit for lead concentrations of substances in sewage sludge is 750to 1200mg/kg and theannual limit for lead in sewage sludge applied to agriculture is 15kg/ha (based on a ten-yearaverage). In addition to these standards, the directive established analysis and record keepingguidelinesfor thetreatment anduseof sewagesludge(IRPTC/UNEP, 1990). StandardsforEnvironmental MediaandPointSourceControls Several policies have been established within the European Community to protect shellfish areas, ground and surface waters, and bathing waters. In order to support shellfishcommunities, the European Community has designated (as necessary) coastal and brackishwaters for protection and improvement (79/923/EEC). Beginning in 1981, Member States wereasked to implement pollution reduction programmes within sixyears to protect these areas fromlead as well as other heavy metal pollutants. The directive was written to support shellfishcommunitiesratherthanbolsterhumanconsumptionof shellfish(IRPTC/UNEP, 1990). The European Community initiated efforts to protect exploitable ground water supplies in2391982 (80/68/EEC). At this time, inventory and surveillance measures were established to assess the extent of direct and indirect discharge of heavy metal pollutants into underground watersources (IRPTC/UNEP, 1990). Effective in January of 1988, these measures were extended toinclude inland, surface, territorial, and coastal waters (76/464/EEC) (IRPTC/UNEP, 1990). Directdischarge methods and other disposal methods that may lead to indirect discharges are subject tothe authorization of the European Community. Pollution reduction programmes are alsoencouraged to co-ordinate the authorization process as well as the development of alternativecontroloptions(vonMoltke, 1987). The quality of bathing water (76/160/EEC) is specifically designated to be raised or maintained over time for both health and amenity benefits. Several parameters, including leadconcentrationsinwater, areusedtodeterminethequalityof the water. The European Commissionhas also adopted measures to specifically protect the Mediterranean Sea from ocean dumping(vonMoltke, 1987). Programmes to coordinate ocean dumping prevention and assessment wereinitiated in 1977 after the Barcelona Convention. Other additional policy measures have beenproposed to restrict ocean dumping of lead by requiring permits on a case by case basis(vonMoltke, 1987). Beginning in December of 1987, the limit for ambient air concentrations of lead in air (expressed as an annual average mean concentration) was set at 2 \u00b5g/m 3(82/884/EEC) (vonMoltke, 1987). Member States that anticipate exceeding this level are required to notify the Commissionandmust implement measurestoensurenorepeat exceedences. In 1982, the European Community encouraged the exchange of air monitoring data within the community (82/459/EEC) (vonMoltke, 1987). By doing so, the community established aframework for comprehensive ambient air monitoring efforts. Beginning in June of 1987, theinformation exchange was formalized and plants that emitted high levels of pollutants, includinglead, were required to use the best available technology (BAT), except in cases where costs wereprohibitivelyexcessive(84/360/EEC)(vonMoltke, 1987). The burning and refining of used oil contributes markedly to ambient air pollution. Recognizing this source of air pollution, the European Community has taken measures toencourage the safe collection and disposal of waste oil. Beginning in 1990, the discharge of wasteoils to water and drainage systems, deposit or discharge to soil, uncontrolled discharge of residuesfrom processing, or any processing which causes high air pollution levels is prohibited(75/439/EEC) (vonMoltke, 1987, IRPTC/UNEP, 1990). The use of chemicals in agricultural production may contribute to groundwater pollution, as well as ecological and human health risks. The European Community has established acommittee to set maximum permissible levels for heavy metals (including lead) in fertilizer products(76/116/EEC)(vonMoltke, 1987). Todate, however, nostandardshavebeenset. The European Community has also taken initiatives to control the storage, treatment, and disposal of toxic and dangerous waste. To produce or hold these wastes requires a permit withinthe European Community; whereas, the storage, treatment, and deposit of these wastes must beauthorized (78/319/EEC). Beginning in 1987, the European Community agreed to conform to thestandards set forth by the UN Economic Commission for Europe. These standards includelabeling, contractual, andsafetyrequirements(85/469/EEC)(IRPTC/UNEP1990; ILZSG, 1989a). The European Commission has set feed standards to limit the exposure of livestock to lead. Maximum allowable lead contents were established for several products: straight feedingstuffs (10mg/kg); complete feeding stuffs (5 to 40mg/kg) (IRPTC/UNEP, 1990). LeadinProducts To prevent product standards from hindering free trade, the European Community has taken steps to harmonize much of the quality standards and labeling standards for consumerproducts. As of 1988, the marketing of cosmetic products containing lead was prohibited (with theexception of capillary products containing lead acetate) (76/768/EEC) (IRPTC/UNEP 1990).Beginning in 1987, no more than 20mg/kg lead may be contained in colouring matters and notmore than 10mg/kg lead in antioxidants and emulsifiers used for food (IRPTC/UNEP 1990). Themaximum leaching rate for ceramic articles that can be filled is 4mg/l; for ceramic cookware themaximum leaching rate is 1.5mg/l. In addition to these standards, there is a proposal to restrictthe maximum bioavailability resulting from children's use of toys to 0.7 \u00b5g for lead (vonMoltke, 1987). Recycling A 1991 directive on batteries and accumulators containing dangerous substances (91/157/EEC) requires that Member States ensure that spent batteries containing more than0.4percent lead by weight are collected and disposed of under controlled conditions. Specificrequirements of the directive include marking of batteries to indicate metal content and need forseparate collection, design of electrical appliances to enable ready removal of batteries, and theorganization of separate collection systems including, if necessary, the use of economicinstrumentssuchasdepositsystemstoencouragerecycling. Education/Labelling Beginning in June of 1988, paints, varnishes, printing inks, varnishes, and similar products that have onepercent weight associated with heavy metals (including lead), must beclassified, packaged, and labelled according to European Commission standards (77/728/EEC)(IRPTC/UNEP, 1990, vonMoltke, 1987). Occupational Standards Beginning in December of 1983, the European Community designated 14 measures to control occupational exposure to lead. These measures provided the basis for industrialprogrammes, requiring medical surveillance and providing workers with open access to medicalresults and knowledge of potential dangers in the workplace (80/1107/EEC) (IRPTC/UNEP, 1990;vonMoltke, 1987). In 1986, the European Community supplemented these basic measures withmonitoring and analysis techniques, concentration limits for air (0.15mg/m 3) and blood lead (70\u00b5g/dl), and action levels for air (40 \u00b5g/m3) and blood lead (40 \u00b5g/dl) (82/605/EEC) (ILZSG, 1989a; vonMoltke, 1987).241INDUSTRYRISKREDUCTIONINITIATIVES The international non-ferrous metals producing industry has effected a variety of initiatives which can be considered lead \"risk reduction\" measures. Summaries of these activities areprovided in this section. These initiatives generally fall into one of several categories, as follows:1)changes in processing technology and/or emission controls; 2)implementation of medicalsurveillance and occupational hygiene programmes for exposed workers; 3)support of research tovalidate the effectiveness of existing occupational and general population exposure limits and todevelop new monitoring procedures for insuring human and environmental health; and4)implementation of product stewardship programmes to inform downstream users of lead of theprecautionswhichshouldbeexercisedsoastoprotect thehealthof employeesandconsumers. The information presented in this overview was, in large part, collected via a questionnaire administered to the international industry by the International Lead Zinc Research Organization inearly 1992. Respondents to the questionnaire included corporations whose lead productioncapacities comprise a significant proportion of both annual global production and production inOECD Member countries. Responses to this questionnaire were not received from all leadproducing industries. As a result, the information presented must be viewed as a qualitativeoverview that is likely to be incomplete in some areas. Similarly, risk reduction measuresimplemented by the industry show evidence of geographic variation that is reflective of regionaldifferences in the perception of relative risk associated with lead exposure. The nature and extentof riskreductionactivitybyindustryinindividualcountriesis, thus, variable. The following summaryattempts to depict industry risk reduction efforts that have been effected throughout most of theindustry in OECD Member countries. Efforts unique to a specific geographic region or country arenotedassuch. ChangesinProcessingTechnology A broad variety of processing changes have been implemented at mining/smelting operations, resulting in a net reduction in the emission of lead to the environment. Many of thesechanges reflect the natural evolution of processing technology towards more efficient andinherently less polluting methods. Some changes have been made in response to regulatoryagencies, others through voluntary emission reduction initiatives. This overview will summarize thenature and costs of the changes which have been effected over the past 20years and will focusupon production facilities whose primary product is lead. However, it should be recognized that co-production of metals is the norm in the nonferrous metals industry and that lead is often asignificant \"by-product\" of the production of other metals. Technological advancements have alsoproduced emission reductions from facilities that co-produce significant quantities of lead (forexample, zinc or copper production facilities), but the information received was not adequate todiscussthesefacilitiesindetail. The costs associated with various risk reduction measures are difficult to ascertain with accuracy. Where feasible, cost estimates are provided in US$ to provide a bench-mark measureof industry activity in specific areas. However, these cost estimates must be viewed withrecognition of the limitations of the varied data base from which they have been drawn. Riskreduction initiatives have been implemented over time and in different regions of the globe.Adjustments for inflation and changing currency exchange rates are problematic in general.Questionnaire responses indicate that international expenditures for risk reduction activitiescomprise 15to 25percent of the annual operating costs of a typical primary or secondary leadproduction facility. Analysis of regulatory compliance costs in the United States by the US Bureau242of Mines reinforces this estimate (Bureau of Mines, 1987a,b; 1988). Approximately 40percent of capital costs associated with the construction of new facilities were estimated to be for purposes ofriskreduction. Reduction of fugitive dust emissions from concentrates to be used by smelters has been commonplace throughout the international industry. Upgrading or replacement of systems forconcentrate storage and/or transport has been implemented at multiple facilities. Costs associatedwithsuchcapitalimprovementsarevariable, but havetypicallybeen on the order of $2to 10millionper production facility. Windborne migration at many facilities is further limited by intensive on-sitewatersprinklingprogrammes. Lead emissions during the smelting process have been reduced by a variety of measures. Upgrading of existing facilities, or replacement with new smelting technologies, has been commonplace throughout OECD Member countries. Although the adoption of more sophisticatedand efficient smelting technologies is not entirely for the specific purpose of emission reduction,suchobjectivesaregenerallyasignificant part of thejustificationforsuchchanges. Specific measures to limit airborne emissions during smelting have been implemented throughout the industry. Technology for reducing the lead content of exhaust gases has beenevolving and industry adoption of newer methods is widespread. Replacement of scrubbers andother methods of fume collection by high-efficiency electrostatic and bag filters had beenimplemented, or is ongoing, in multiple sectors of the international industry. Incorporation of moresophisticated emission control systems on ancillary systems (for example, electrostaticprecipitators on acid plants) have also reduced lead emissions. Costs for the installation of suchemission control systems are highly variable and dependent upon the nature and scale of thefacility. Technology for the reduction of lead in wastewater has been evolving similarly. Water purification plants and upgraded sewer systems have been installed at many lead productionfacilitiesat coststhat rangeupto$20millionper facility. Solid waste materials produced by smelters are disposed of in accordance with regional regulatory requirements. The volume of waste generated, and/or its lead content, has generallyevidenced a steady decline. At least twofactors contribute to this trend. The advent of moresophisticated smelting technologies has improved the efficiency with which lead is extracted fromconcentrates. Improved process efficiency also permits production facilities to divert significantvolumesof formerlydiscardedwastematerialbackintotheleadsmeltingprocess. The preceding control efforts have had a significant impact upon lead emissions from smeltingfacilities. Baseduponindustrydata, atmosphericemissionsof lead over the past 20yearshave typically been reduced by up to 90percent. Much of this reduction has been achieved overthe past fiveto tenyears. Discharges of lead in water have evidenced similar declines, with muchof this similarly occurring over the past fiveto tenyears. Large lead production facilities reportedcumulativeexpendituresof upto$100millioneachtoachievethesereductions. Several large lead production facilities maintain monitoring programmes which permit some assessment of the impact of emission control efforts upon surrounding human populationsand the environment. Voluntary blood lead monitoring programmes have been established in thevicinity of several smelters within the past fiveto tenyears. Declines in children's blood lead levels,ranging from 25to 65percent, have been reported. These declines must be interpreted within thecontext of overall declines in general population blood lead levels evident throughout much of theOECD membership, but do provide evidence that emission control systems have significantly243reduced the lead exposure of nearby residents. Only very limited monitoring of biota in the vicinity of smelters was reported, but appear to evidence a similar trend (for example, 50percent declineintheleadcontent of marineorganisms). As more sophisticated technologies for ore processing and emissions control are developed, the discharge of lead into the environment by the producing sectors of the industryshould evidence further declines. In addition, the major lead producing companies in the UnitedStates have announced their intention to participate in the voluntary \"33-50\" pollution reductioninitiative announced by the United States government. These companies will actively work toachieve an additional 33percent reduction in emissions by 1992, and a target of 50percentreductionby1995. ImplementationofMedicalSurveillanceandOccupationalHygieneProgrammes In accordance with regional regulatory guidelines, most of the international lead industry maintains rigorous medical surveillance programmes for the monitoring of occupational exposuresto lead. Regional differences with respect to these guidelines are apparent. Medical removallevels for lead workers will typically range between 50and 80 \u00b5g/dl of blood lead. Standards for occupational exposure to airborne lead also vary among OECD countries, with 50, 100 and 150\u00b5g/m 3allbeingspecifiedinnationalregulationsor legislation. Over the past fiveyears, industries in several geographic regions of the OECD membership have made significant voluntary efforts to improve occupational hygiene practices andto reduce average blood lead levels. Engineering controls backed by personal hygiene and otherprotective programmes are employed by lead producing and consuming industries to minimizeworker exposure, and, in areas where exposure limits cannot otherwise be met, personalrespirators are employed. Correlations between lead in air and lead in blood are generally poor,with good personal hygiene widely regarded as the most significant factor in limiting exposure.Thisfactoralsoservestominimizethetransport of leadparticlesintothehome. The cost of such voluntary efforts, which set in-plant goals to lower worker exposure, are difficult to estimate. However, the implementation of such programmes has resulted in significantreductions in blood lead levels in the industry. The general lead industry in OECD Membercountries reports reductions of the average employee blood lead level of approximately 30to40percent over the past 20years. As a reflection of this, the number of individuals exceeding thevarious regional medical removal standards has fallen dramatically. Typically, a facility employing1,000-2,000 employees may experience only a few medical removal cases peryear. Thisrepresentsanapproximate90percent declineinthefrequencyof medicalremovalactions. ResearchSupport The international industry funds significant environmental health research programmes through the International Lead Zinc Research Organization (ILZRO). Annual ILZRO expendituresfortheconduct of leadhealth-relatedresearchwilltypicallyrangebetween$400,000and$600,000. Many of these programmes are oriented towards the assessment of the adequacy of existing medical removal standards or elucidation of any health effects which might be observed at currentoccupational blood lead levels. Substantive efforts are also being made to develop newtechnologies and biomarkers for the monitoring of worker health. Finally, multiple researchprogrammes have been implemented to investigate the effect of lead exposure upon the generalpopulation and the environment. Many of these research programmes are conducted in244cooperation with, and frequently with co-sponsorship by, regional regulatory bodies. Thus, cooperative research programmes with funding entities such as the EC or US EPA has beenoccurringwithincreasingfrequency. Researchsponsorshipbyavariety of regional organizations has also become increasingly commonplace. In addition, the international industry has encouraged worker participation in abroad variety of independent research efforts seeking to more accurately define the effects of leadexposure. Recent studies conducted in North America, the EC and Northern Europe provide goodexamplesofsuchinteractions. ProductStewardshipInitiatives Regional industry trade associations have been implementing product stewardship programmes so as to advise downstream users of lead, as well as consumers, of the potentialhazardsassociatedwithleadexposure. These activities are highly varied in both nature and scopeandareprobablybest describedbyexample. The Lead Industries Association of the United States (LIA), for instance, has been active in the production and distribution of training materials designed to acquaint downstream users ofleadof the precautions which should be observed in the occupational environment. This effort hasincluded an annual Health Conference for Physicians and Allied Health Professionals designed toacquaint health professionals with the medical issues associated with lead exposure. LIA has alsoencouraged monitoring programmes to survey the blood lead levels of children and other at-riskindividuals residing in the vicinity of primary and secondary smelters and promoted the adoption ofvoluntary in-plant goals to lower worker lead exposures to below regulatory limits. In an effort toenhance lead recycling by the small industry user, LIA has also developed and circulated a leadrecycling directory which identifies specific locations in North America which will accept certaintypes of lead scrap. Finally, LIA has undertaken the organization of research efforts to assess theexposurerisktothegeneralpopulationposedbyspecificproduct applications. The activities of organizations such as LIA have been complemented by the actions of specific user groups such as the Battery Council International (BCI). As an organizationrepresentingtheinterestsof theautomotiveandindustriallead-acidbatterymanufacturers, BCI hassuccessfully undertaken the development of initiatives to encourage the recycling of batteries.Model legislation developed by BCI to help further this goal has been adopted by a number ofregionsintheUnitedStates. The European Federation of Capsule Manufacturers (EUCAPA) agreed in June 1990 to stoptheproductionof leadcontainingcapsulesforovercorkingwinebottles. Paint producers and can manufacturers in some OECD countries have voluntarily agreed tophaseout theuseof leadinhighriskapplications(forexample, foodcans, residentialpaints). Finally, the international industry has recently formed the International Council on Metals in the Environment (ICME). The members of this organization are associated with the productionof numerous non-ferrous metals, including lead. ICME is in the process of developing guidelinesdesigned to facilitate international efforts to insure the safe use of metals, such as lead, by multiplesectorsofindustry.245APPENDIXA(CHAPTER5) LEADRISKREDUCTIONACTIVITIES :SUMMARYTABLES Proposedorplannedactionsare inbold.246247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 London.

Its softness, density, low melting point, opacity to radiation, chemical reactivity and resistance to corrosion give itconsiderablefunctionalvalue, bothinitspurestateandinalloysorcompounds. Lead is normally extracted from mined ores containing zinc, silver and minor amounts of copper; however, recycled materials have become an increasing source of supply and currentlyaccountforover50percentofworldproduction. World demand for lead and its products has steadily increased. Lead-acid batteries, used for applications such as starting automobiles, powering electric vehicles or operating as anemergency power source, account for the greatest growth. Demand for most other uses hasremained relatively stable, or has declined due to competitive factors or in response to health andenvironmentalconcerns. Environmental releases of lead can occur naturally (for example, through crustal weathering, volcanism) or from anthropogenic sources relating to industrial activity, incineration,power generation (coal and oil burning), the use of fertilizers and sewage sludge, and the use anddisposalofconsumerproducts. Human exposure to lead occurs through inhalation of contaminated air or ingestion of contaminated water, food, soil, dust or paint. The magnitude of exposure depends on theconcentration of lead in the various media and its bioavailability. There are several approaches toestimatinghumanexposuretolead: \u007fMonitoring of blood lead levels within an exposed population can provide data reflectingcurrent levelsof humanexposure. \u007fMonitoring of environmental media concentrations, together with estimates of human uptakeratesfromthesemedia, allowestimation of the extent to which individual mediaareresponsibleforhumanexposure. Almost all OECD countries have introduced regulatory or non-regulatory measures to reduce unreasonable human and ecosystem risks from exposure to lead. The risk assessmentsand risk characterizations that have led countries to take actions have a national character.Countries develop positions on the need for risk reduction activities after having analysed thehazard and the significance of certain exposures, and after factoring in local social, economic andpolitical considerations. These positions are usually arrived at after considerable debate on thenumerous factors involved, and thus are not expected to be consistent across Member countries.For example, the number of recorded measures initiated by an individual country varies from a fewup to at least 18. Although some countries have taken the same number of measures, no twocountries have adopted the same set of risk reduction measures (i.e. initiatives relating toenvironmental media, industrial or municipal releases, products, occupational exposures, etc.).This variance reflects, in part, the disparate sources of release, exposures, concerns and prioritieswithin countries. Another example of the variance in country priorities is reflected in theeffectiveness of the nature and extent of actions taken by countries to reduce risks from exposuretolead.294Blood lead sampling is one of the methods most widely used to assess human risk from exposure to lead. Approximately 30 per cent of OECD countries have reported blood leadmonitoring data for the general population and/or segments of the population at greatest risk. Datafor the general population (for example, adults, children) in these countries indicate that averagelevels of lead in blood have declined to below levels of national concern. However, some countrieshave identified portions of the population that are exposed to levels of exposure above those ofnationalconcern. Thedataalsoindicatethat thereisnodirect relationshipbetweenthenumber of measures introduced and their effectiveness in reducing blood lead levels. Some countries have reducedaveragebloodleadlevelstobelow10 \u00b5g/dl by introducing only a few regulatory and non-regulatory measures, whileothershaveinitiatedmanymoretoobtainsimilarresults. Given the number of confounding factors, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of a single measure to reduce risks. However, monitoring the level of lead in blood and environmentalmedia over time has allowed countries to determine the extent and magnitude of lead exposureproblems and assess the need for, and the potential effectiveness of, future risk reductioninitiatives. The most common measures associated with reductions of lead in variousenvironmentalmediaandhumanbloodwithinOECDcountriesare: \u007finitiatives to restrict dispersive usesof lead that result in its being readily bioavailable, such as lead in gasoline, packaging where lead is in direct contact with food (forexample, lead soldered food cans, ceramic coatings), lead solders and piping indrinking water systems, lead in household paints or paints for toys, etc., and lead-basedpesticides; \u007fregulatory and non-regulatory measures that monitor and control industrial emissions andeffluents ; \u007freplacing lead piping in drinking water systems or, where lead solders and piping cannot be easily replaced, reducing the lead in drinking water by controlling the pH (in ordertoreducethesolubilityof lead); \u007fdevelopment and implementation of technology for the safe management of wastes , including those that contain lead, destined for final disposal in landfills or incinerators;and \u007fregulatory and non-regulatory measures for the workplace , such as the establishment of maximum allowable blood lead and lead-in-air levels and the implementation ofmedicalsurveillanceandoccupationalhygieneprogrammesforexposedworkers. For those Member countries that monitor lead in various media, data also indicate that the average levels of lead in environmental media have declined to below national levels of concern.However, some countries have identified releases of lead from point sources and/or the long-rangetransport of lead in air as concerns. Others have indicated that, given the recent progress onreducing lead in air, there are more significant domestic concerns such as lead in imported cannedfood, lead in drinking water (especially for critical groups such as bottle-fed infants), or lead in dustand chips from deteriorating old household paint. The latter sources of concern are largely theresult of past practices. In order to address these concerns, a number of governments areundertaking studies to determine the magnitude and extent of their problems. Where the risk fromexposure to lead is high, abatement measures, educational activities, continued monitoring and, in295instances of severe lead poisoning, medical treatment such as chelation therapy, form integral componentsoftheriskreductionstrategy. It is suggested that when considering risk reduction strategies for lead, Member countries maywishtotakeintoaccount thefollowing: \u007fCountries, not already doing so, may wish to undertake environmental and blood lead sampling to identify populations at highest risk and to evaluate the extent of leadexposure in their general population. This would facilitate the establishment of local,regional and national risk reduction priorities, and provide the means to gauge thesuccess of any subsequent risk management strategies. Monitoring also plays a keyrole in assessing compliance with national standards or possible internationalagreements. \u007fCountries may also want to draw on experiences described in the document when developing regulatory and non-regulatory measures to reduce unreasonable risks fromexposure. Measures may include: regulations and standards (for example, lead ingasoline, smelter emissions) aimed at reducing ongoing releases of lead to air, water,soil, dust and the workplace; implementation of cleaner technology (for example,substitution, process modifications), effective recollection and recovery systems, orenvironmentally acceptable waste treatment; abatement activities to reduce risks fromexposure to historical sources of release (for example, deteriorating paint, piping inpotable water systems); and voluntary industry product stewardship programmes suchastheindustryphase-out in some countries of high-risk applications (for example, leadinsolderedfoodcansorhouseholdpaints). In addition, consideration should be given to reviewing progress every few years with lead risk reduction strategies. This could include the collection of Member countries' environmental andblood lead monitoring data, as well as new information on their regulations, criteria, "}
