We cover the latest in sustainable living, fashion, zero waste, beauty, travel, finance and more... What Is Non-Toxic Perfume? We want to know exactly what we're spritzing on our sensitive skin. Unfortunately, many fragrance houses market their products as \"clean\" or \"natural\"\u2014when these terms are not regulated and basically can mean anything. Complicating things further, perfume companies can mislead consumers based on the alcohol content. As explained by [Abel](#9), an Eau de Parfum typically contains around 14 to 20% perfume oils with the remainder of the ingredients coming from plant-derived alcohol. So, in a smell-good form of [greenwashing](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/what-is-greenwashing/), a brand may suggest their perfumes are 85% natural\u2014but in reality, it only includes that single plant-based alcohol while all the fragrance is still artificial (AKA: chemicals). We want artificial fragrance-free perfume without toxins of any kind. Are there toxic chemicals in perfumes? In short, yes. Synthetic fragrances often contain a cocktail of chemicals that put both our own health and the health of the planet at risk. Because of their risk of adverse health effects, synthetic dyes and other toxins like parabens, phthalates, and [butylated hydroxytoluene](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/700741-BHT/) (BHT) are all ingredients of concern that non-toxic perfume brands make sure to avoid. From a sustainability standpoint, synthetic ingredients are usually made of petrochemicals which A) support the oil industry and B) don't biodegrade. Polycyclic musk (PCM), for example, is a known [environmental pollutant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30326456/) posing a risk to aquatic wildlife. However, it's important to know that some synthetic ingredients are entirely appropriate to use if they are proven to be non-toxic and are used in place of otherwise harmful practices (like using animal secretions). Some of the clean perfume brands on our list do use a combination of natural and synthetic ingredients, opting for clean synthetic fragrance oils when they are either safer for the skin, or provide a more sustainable choice. What's the difference between a non-toxic and natural perfume? Truly natural means made with naturally derived ingredients (i.e., those that are found in nature and not created in a lab). A non-toxic perfume doesn't contain any toxic ingredients. This doesn't mean it's 100% natural as it may still contain synthetic ingredients, albeit safe ones. How do I know if my perfume is non-toxic? When looking for a perfume without toxic chemicals, a brand's transparency is key. Look for brands that are happy to share their full ingredients list so you can see exactly what's in (and what's not in) that little glass bottle. Read: \" trade secrets\" which are so common in the fragrance industry. Look for mainly natural perfume ingredients (essential oils, plant extracts, plant-based oils) and if you're not sure about any of the ingredients, don't be afraid to reach out and ask. How We Found Natural & Non-Toxic Perfumes Whether you want a subtle scent for an everyday long-lasting non-toxic perfume or a fine fragrance to celebrate special occasions with, you likely don't want a spritz of harmful chemicals. We used our [ethical and sustainable beauty](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-beauty/sustainableconsumer/) criteria to sniff around for transparency and natural and non-toxic ingredients. [Non-toxic](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable/organic-natural/), natural & organic: In the world of safe perfume, that means using real botanical-derived scents and essential oils rather than synthetically created fragrances. A few brands on this list use select synthetic fragrances, but we made sure they provided sufficient evidence that they knew which [ingredients to avoid in skincare](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-beauty/ingredients-to-avoid-in-skincare/). [Vegan](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/featured/cruelty-free-vs-vegan/)(or vegan options): Perfume commonly includes animal ingredients. Beware of any \"musk.\" - Cruelty-free: Perfume is notorious for animal testing. As a blanket rule, we do not include any brands that test their products on animals. [Palm oil-free](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/palm-oil-free-sustainable/) - Ethically sourced ingredients - Thoughtful packaging; Recyclable, at the very least, but refillable or reusable bottles are best. Final Thoughts On Non-Toxic Perfume Ready to take a whiff of perfumes that are better for you? We get it, you don't want to smell like that garlic you just ate...but you probably don't want to use toxic perfume to cover up either. Thankfully, you can put your mind (and nose) at ease by supporting one of these natural and non-toxic perfume brands making the world a better (and better smelling) place. The more natural something is, the less of a shelf-life it has. So, buying smaller bottles and keeping them tightly sealed and out of direct sunlight will go a long way to preserving that special scent.
