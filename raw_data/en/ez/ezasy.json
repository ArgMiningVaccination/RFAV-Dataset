Background There is substantial variation in how menopausal vasomotor symptoms are reported and measured among intervention studies. This has prevented meaningful comparisons between treatments and limited data synthesis. Objectives To review systematically the outcome reporting and measures used to assess menopausal vasomotor symptoms from randomised controlled trials of treatments. Search strategy We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to May 2018. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials with a primary outcome of menopausal vasomotor symptoms in women and a sample size of at least 20 women per study arm. Data collection and analysis Data about study characteristics, primary vasomotor-related outcomes and methods of measuring them. Main results The search identied 5591 studies, 214 of which were included. Forty-nine different primary reported outcomes were identied for vasomotor symptoms and 16 different tools had been used to measure these outcomes. The most commonly reported outcomes were frequency (97/214), severity (116/214), and intensity(28/114) of vasomotor symptoms or a composite of these outcomes (68/214). There was little consistency in how the frequency and severity/intensity of vasomotor symptoms were dened. Conclusions There is substantial variation in how menopausal vasomotor symptoms have been reported and measured in treatment trials. Future studies should include standardised outcome measures which reflect the priorities of patients, clinicians, and researchers. This is most effectively achieved through the development of a Core Outcome Set. This systematic review is the rst step towards development of a Core Outcome Set for menopausal vasomotor symptoms. Keywords Core outcomes, menopause, randomised clinical trials, vasomotor symptoms. Tweetable summary Menopausal hot flushes and night sweats have been reported in 49 different ways in clinical research. A core outcome set is urgently required.

Variation in menopausal vasomotor symptoms outcomes in clinical trials: a systematic review. BJOG 2020;127:320 -333. Introduction There is general agreement that vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) are the most common and prob- lematic menopausal symptom.1,2Vasomotor symptoms arealso the leading patient priority for treatment.3Oestrogen- containing menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is an effective treatment for menopausal vasomotor symptoms; however, use of MHT has fallen substantially following concerns about safety.4There is a growing focus on the development and evaluation of nonpharmacological and nonhormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms.5In*Joint rst authors. 320 \u00aa2019 The Authors.

DOI: 10.1111/1471-0528.15990 www.bjog.orgSystematic review addition, MHT is contraindicated in women with a per- sonal history of breast cancer who may report more severe vasomotor symptoms than women experiencing naturalmenopause. 6Enhanced understanding of the central mech- anisms regulating vasomotor symptoms is driving thedevelopment and evaluation of novel targeted therapies, 7 but the interpretation and implementation of these studiesis hampered by lack of consensus about how vasomotorsymptoms should be reported and measured. This limits the potential to compare treatments and to synthesise the evidence, which in turn compromises decision-making byclinicians and patients. Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on the management of menopause 8high- light the need for greater standardisation of outcomereporting and measures for treatment trials in menopause,and the consequent difculty in evidence synthesis. There is an urgent need to determine what outcomes are most important to patients, clinicians, and researchers in order toincrease the relevance of future intervention studies andfacilitate comparisons between treatments. 9,10The Core Outcomes in Effectiveness (COMET) initiative is leadingprotocols for the development of Core Outcome Sets. Theseare well dened, condition-specic, and feasible outcomeswhich should be included as a minimum set of outcomes in intervention studies. 11To advance the development of Core Outcome sets in women's health,1280 editors of women's health journals have formed a consortium to support thedevelopment, dissemination, and implementation of coreoutcome sets within the reproductive eld (Core Outcomesin Women's and Newborn Health-CROWN, http://www.crown-initiative.org). 13 The Core Outcomes in Menopause (COMMA) initiative is an international consortium of clinicians, researchers, and consumers developing a Core Outcome Set for menopausalsymptoms. Following a standardised process, we have rstsystematically reviewed all randomised controlled trials(RCTs) of interventions for menopausal vasomotor symp-toms to determine what outcomes have been reported andhow they have been measured. We will then repeat this pro-cess for vaginal symptoms at menopause. This information will then be used to inform a Delphi survey by clinicians, researchers, and patients to identify priorities for inclusionin the nal Core Outcome Set. 12 Methods Study eligibility We included all RCTs with a primary outcome of female menopausal vasomotor symptoms and a sample size of at least 20 women per study arm to minimise the likelihoodof including feasibility or pilot studies 14. We excluded stud- ies that assessed menopausal vasomotor symptoms as asecondary outcome, quasi-randomised studies, secondary analyses of previously published RCTs, conference abstracts of RCTs, observational, analytical, or diagnostic studies andfeasibility/pilot studies. We also excluded studies primarilyaiming to assess pharmacokinetics, the mechanism of drugaction, or tolerability and intervention studies with noexplicit sample size calculations. Search strategy We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Cen-tral Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) until May2018. We hand-searched the reference lists of the included tri-als or other keynote publications. Search terms includedmenopause, menopausal, menopausal symptoms, climacteric,hot flush or flash, night sweat, vasomotor, and a search lterfor RCTs (Appendix S1). There was no language restriction. Data extraction Two reviewers (W.W.L. and S.I.) independently assessedthe studies using the predened criteria described above.Disagreement was resolved by discussion with the steeringcommittee. Full articles were obtained and data wereextracted using a prespecied extraction sheet. Quality assessment Jadad scoring was used for assessing the methodologicalquality of the included trials. 15The 5-point validated scor- ing system assesses the following: whether the trial (1) wasdescribed as randomised (1 point), (2) used an appropriatemethod of randomisation (1 point), (3) was blinded(1 point), (4) used an appropriate method of blinding(1 point), and (5) accounted for all patients randomised(1 point); 2 points was considered low quality and 3 was considered medium to high quality. The quality of describing and reporting the outcome was assessed using the 6-point Management of Otitis Mediawith Effusion in Cleft Palate (MOMENT) scoring criteria, 16 which has been used previously in the context of qualityassessment of studies for the development of a core out-come set and a cut-off of 4 to indicate a high-quality trial. The following points were considered: whether the primary outcome was (1) clearly stated (1 point), (2) clearly dened (1 point); whether the secondary outcomes were (3) clearlystated (1 point), (4) clearly dened (1 point); (5) whetherthe authors explained the use of the outcomes they selected(1 point); (6) whether specic methods were used toenhance the quality of outcome measurement (1 point). Patient involvement Patients were not involved in the stage of conducting thesystematic review but they will be involved in the subse-quent steps (Delphi and consensus meeting) of developingthe core outcome set. 321 \u00aa2019 The Authors.

Our aim is todevelop and disseminate core outcomes of menopausalsymptoms and this systematic review is the rst step of theprocess.

Results The search identied 5591 studies, of which 2711 dupli-cates were removed. We screened 2880 titles and abstractsand excluded 2372 records which did not meet the inclu-sion criteria. In all, 544 studies were read in full. Of these,330 were excluded; 59 included fewer than 20 women perstudy arm and 54 were not an RCT; 126 did not clearlystate a sample size calculation; 52 did not measure vasomo-tor symptoms as the primary outcome; 39 were secondary analysis. Following these exclusions, 214 RCT were included 17-230(Figure 1). Table S1 describes the 214 studieswith a total of 22 682 participants. The studies were pub- lished between 1994 and 2018. More than one-third of the trials (77/214, 36%) were conducted in USA. The follow-up period ranged from 4 to 52 weeks, with half theincluded studies following up participants for 12 weeks(108/214, 50%). Reported outcomes The included trials reported 31 different interventions for menopausal vasomotor symptoms: 68 (32%) included hor- mone therapies and the remaining 146 nonhormonal thera-pies; 46 were prescription therapies; and 100 werenonprescription these interventions,estrogen and/or progestogen therapies (61/214, 29%) andover-the-counter dietary or herbal supplements (68/214,32%) were the most common interventions (Table 1). Forty-nine primary outcomes were identied from 214 RCTs including 22 682 women. Almost half of the RCTs (94/214, 44%) only included postmenopausal women, 12%(26/214) only included women with a history of breast can-cer, and 5% (12/214) included peri- and postmenopausalwomen. Around a quarter of the RCTs (56/214, 26%)included both surgical and naturally peri- and post-menopausal women.

The largest group was purely vasomotor- related outcomes, comprising 33 individual outcomes. Thesecond largest group was composite outcomes, all of whichincluded vasomotor symptoms as one of the parameters.Nine trials assessed quality of life 28,77,98,122,135,163,181,197,228 and ve trials assessed interference33,60,66,92,138as primary outcomes (Table 2). Measurement tools Seven different measurement tool categories were usedto measure purely vasomotor-related outcomes. Most(158/214, 74%,) included trials used diary records symptoms 24.7% (53/214) used menopause- Climacteric Scale(15/57, 26%), and Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) (10/57,18%) were the three most frequently used measurementtools. The Hot Flush Rating Scale (HFRS) 33,60,66,92,138mea- sures how vasomotor symptoms interfere with daily routineand activities 231,232. The Hot Flush Related Daily Interfer- ence scales (HFRDIS) and the shortened Hot Flush Inter- ference (HFI) scale233,234have been used to measure interference due to vasomotor symptoms but were not theprimary outcome of eligible RCTs, and so were notincluded in the systematic review. However, they will stillbe used for the subsequent Delphi process. Other subjectivevasomotor symptoms measurement tools included a20-item structured symptom checklist; two of the itemsasking about the presence of hot flushes and cold/night sweats, 128a 5-point (from none to very severe) scoring sys- tem about the severity of hot flushes and night sweats,103 Interactive Voice Response System to record the numberand severity of the hot flushes, 157and self-reported sur- veys.156Objective measures of vasomotor symptoms such as skin conductance were used in ve trials in addition tosubjective measures 33,68,118,138,167(Table 3). Diaries were used to record 25 different types of meno- pausal vasomotor-related outcomes and accounted for 57% (25/44) of all primary outcomes. The number, frequency,severity, and intensity of menopausal vasomotor symptomswere the most commonly reported vasomotor-related out-comes assessed by diaries. However, there was substantialvariation in the denitions of each outcome. For example,for frequency, the majority of included studies (72/214)reported the 'number of vasomotor symptoms per 24 h' (8 retrospectively and 64 prospectively), and 39/214 measured the 'number of vasomotor symptoms per week'. Table S2shows the complete list of vasomotor-related outcomesrecorded by diaries and how often they have been reportedin RCTs of intervention studies for vasomotor symptoms. Quality of life outcomes was measured by three scales: Menopausal-Specic Quality of Life (MEN-QOL), 28,77,90,98,109,122,130,141,181,197,198,228Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ),135,163and the European Organisa- tion for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life-Care30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). 136Of these, 14 of 15 trials chose scales (MENQOL, WHQ).

Variation in the denitions of vasomotor-related outcomes There was substantial heterogeneity in the denition of vasomotor-related outcomes. Three different denitionswere used to measure the frequency of vasomotor symp- toms. Most studies (79/97, 81%) dened frequency as the number of hot flushes or night sweats, whereas 18 studiesdid not dene how frequency was measured. The severityof vasomotor symptoms was dened in nine different waysand the intensity in seven different ways (Table S3). The 68studies reporting composite outcomes for vasomotor symp-toms utilised 11 different ways of dening the compositescore. The most commonly used approach (27/68, 40%) measured the number of hot flushes and night sweats, and calculated a composite score weighted by severity rating.There was considerable overlap between composite scoredenitions. Quality assessment of trials Regarding methodological quality, 34% (73/214) ofincluded RCTs scored 5 out of 5 points on the Jadad scale. More than half of the trials (118/214, 55%) scored 6 out of 6 points on the MOMENT scale (Table S1).Table 2.

Our ndings demonstrate majorinconsistencies in how treatments for the same symptomshave been evaluated. For example, the severity of hot flushes and night sweats had nine different denitions. Overall, the most commonly used outcomes for vasomotorsymptoms (based on 214 RCTs including 22 682 women)were the frequency and intensity of vasomotor symptomsor a compound measure of these ( n=59). A smaller num- ber of studies ( n=5) took a different approach and mea- sured the interference due to vasomotor symptoms. Itremains unclear which measures of vasomotor symptoms best reflect the priorities of patients, clinicians, and researchers, and this will be addressed by the developmentof a Core Outcome Set. Inclusion of the Core Outcome Setin future intervention studies for vasomotor symptoms willenhance the quality and relevance of trials and facilitatedecision-making by clinicians and patients. Strengths and limitations We conducted a comprehensive search strategy with arobust methodological design to include all large ( >20 par- ticipants per arm) RCTs of interventions for vasomotorsymptoms. Two researchers independently evaluated theavailable evidence to minimise overlooking relevantevidence. To our knowledge, this is the rst time that reported vasomotor-related outcomes have been synthe- sised, a necessary step to inform the Delphi process for keystakeholders to rate the components of the core outcomeset. 12Although most included trials were of medium or high methodological standard, the diverse nature of theoutcome measures used diminishes the value of these trialsto inform patient choices and clinical decision-making. This study focused on menopausal vasomotor symptoms in the rst instance. We recognise that personal, ethnic, cul- tural, and geographical factors influence the nature andexperience of menopause, and that not all women experiencevasomotor symptoms at menopause. 235We comprehensively searched three major databases and it is unlikely we havemissed an RCT published elsewhere. We acknowledge we didnot search CINAHL, but we doubt that additional RCTscould only be identied in that database. We included ran- domised trials with vasomotor-related symptoms as a pri- mary outcome with over 20 participants in each arm,excluding observational studies and pilot studies. However,given the large number of included studies, we do not antici-pate that we have missed outcomes not captured in larger tri-als. We recognise that this systematic review was limited totrials where vasomotor symptoms were the primary out-come. However, given the large number of studies included, we do not considered that we missed important outcomes. The expert panel and Delphi process will highlight any addi-tional important outcomes that may have been overlookedbecause they were not included in treatment studies or werereported as secondary outcomes. We also appreciate that ourndings may be skewed towards FDA-driven outcomes, asmany studies were conducted in USA. We have only listedthe range of outcome measures used and have not applied any qualitative assessment of the value or importance of these measures for women or clinicians. Only a few relativelyrecent RCTs have measured the impact of interventions onthe interference caused in women by vasomotor symptomsand it is uncertain whether the frequency/severity or interfer-ence of symptoms best reflects women's treatment priorities.These issues will be addressed by the Delphi survey and thesubsequent consensus meeting. Most published RCTs of interventions for vasomotor symptoms focused on caucasian women who may experience menopause differently fromother ethnicities. 236The COMMA consortium includes rep- resentation from a wide range of geographical areas and eth-nic groups to ensure that the Core Outcome Set reflectsvariations in stakeholder priorities. Interpretation Inconsistency in measures used for the evaluation of treat-ments for vasomotor symptoms limits comparisonsbetween treatments and the interpretation of ndings forTable 3.

This systematic review is the rst step towards the development of meaningful consensus by identifying how vasomotor symptoms have been measured to informconsensus through the Delphi process. 239 Conclusion Most intervention studies for vasomotor symptoms havemeasured frequency or severity of symptoms, or a combi- nation of both. Some have measured the interference caused in daily life due to symptoms. There is a need forconsensus around the optimum outcomes and how theseshould be measured to facilitate comparisons betweeninterventions and ensure patient-centred clinical practice.
