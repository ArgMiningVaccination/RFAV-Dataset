Promotes balance among body, mind, spirit, and the environment. People who practice Ayurveda often use herbal compounds (Ayurvedic medicines) to treat ailments and promote health. Some products contain heavy metals because of their effects on the body. For example: Small amounts of lead may calm the stomach. Arsenic can be used to treat some types of cancer (but may also cause skin, lung and bladder cancer). Because mercury is toxic, it has been used to kill bacteria. Some herbs are unintentionally grown in contaminated soil or processed with equipment that introduces metal into the product.Some Ayurvedic medicines and other traditional medicines may contain harmful heavy metals. A recent study found that one out of every five Ayurvedic medications purchased online contained lead, mercury, or arsenic. Heavy metals are most harmful to young children because their bodies and brains are still growing and developing. Pregnant women and their unborn children may also be at higher risk. Even tiny amounts of lead, mercury, and arsenic can harm the body. Claims that they can be \"detoxified\" are not supported by research.
