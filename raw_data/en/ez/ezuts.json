Check out these 16 plastic free vitamins and plastic free supplements!", "sitename": "I'm Plastic Free", "date": "2023-02-27", "cleaned_text": "Conventional vitamins and supplements are often packaged in plastic which isn't biodegradable and sustainable. The containers, droppers, labels, and boxes all have some impact on the environment through waste generation. The vitamins and medicines are wasteful as sometimes the tablets are often wasted, as they are forgotten and gone out of date. The plastic elements in medicines eventually lead to more waste generation, which adds to landfills and pollutes water bodies. Fortunately, many companies are applying innovative methods of packaging to create plastic free vitamins and supplements, which contribute to a healthy environment around us. Most have shifted to glass or compostable packaging to avoid plastics and offer refill options. Several companies have put dedicated efforts into creating zero-waste vitamins and supplements and have come up with various solutions. This article will make you aware of the plastic-free vitamins and accessories available in the market. In most cases, if the pill containers are made of hard plastic, they are acceptable in most local recycling schemes provided they are empty, clean, and dry. Make sure to remove the lids as these are often made with a different type of plastic and are not recyclable in your kerbside recycling (please check with your local Council). The same is true for those vitamins and supplements that are packaged in glass bottles. However, even better is to try to reduce your (plastic) waste footprint, and this is what we are here for. Most vitamins and supplements come in single-use plastic packaging, which is not the best choice if you are concerned about its environmental impact. People are now looking for a more sustainable and eco-friendly way to get essential vitamins and minerals. We will mention the best zero-waste supplements on the market and highlight the qualities that make them sustainable, healthy, and environment-friendly.
