Experience the world's first technology-enabled meditation vessel. Merging ancient healing remedies with modern technology, the dome is a personal meditation pod that provides meaningful stress relief in exactly 20 minutes. Breathe in 100% pure oxygen in a pressurized environment, which is known to rejuvenate your skin and tissues and promote a clear, focused mind. Plunge into temperatures of -166\u00b0F or lower for 2-3 minutes creating a 30-40\u00b0F drop in your external skin temperature. This allows blood to flow rapidly to your core, revealing multiple benefits. The shocking cold promotes increased blood flow, bringing fresh, oxygenated white blood cells to areas of your body that need it most. Cold water immersion constricts your blood vessels, helping your body tame inflammation, reduce swelling, and flush toxins. After exiting the Ice Bath, your body naturally begins to r estore heat, and the blood vessels that were once constricted expand to allow blood flow. This constriction and expansion can have a positive lasting effect on blood pressure, circulation and health.
