Researchers and companies are pursuing many different concepts for fusion energy and have reported recent progress, such as the development of high - temperature superconducting magnets that could make fusion devices much more compact. Also, in 2022, an experiment at the National Ignition Facility achieved a key scientific milestone, generating more energy from a fusion reaction than the amount of direct energy spent to start the reaction. National Ignition Facility Ho wever, several challenges must be overcome to achieve commercial fusion, and stakeholders' projections of this timeline range from 10 years to several decades. One key scientific challenge is in the physics of plasmas, the state of matter needed for fusion. Researchers do not fully understand the behavior of burning plasmas, those whose main source of heat is from the fusion reaction itself rather than an external source. Researchers have made advancements in this area but lack sufficient experimental data to validate their simulations. One key engineering challenge is the development of materials that can withstand fusion conditions for decades, such as extreme heat and neutron damage, and no facility exists where materials can be fully tested. More generally, the task of extracting energy from fusion to provide an economical source of electric power presents several complex systems engineering problems that have yet to be solved. Public and private sector misalignments, regulatory uncertainty, and other factors also present challenges to fusion energy development. One area of misalignment is research priorities. Public sector efforts prioritize basic science, but fusion energy development requires an additional emphasis on technology and engineering research. Another factor is regulatory uncertainty, which could slow development of fusion energy, although developing appropriate regulations to ensure safety without constraining development is difficult. Doing so may require sign ificant public engagement, but little is known about public perception of fusion energy in the U.S. View GAO -23-105813 . For more information, contact Brian Bothwell at (202) 512 -6888, bothwellb@gao.gov . Why GAO did this study Fusion could address many energy challenges by providing abundant, safe, low -carbon energy. Researchers have achieved scientific and technological advancements in recent years. Fusion energy companies have received billions of dollars of private investment in addition to federal grants. GAO conducted a technology assessment on (1) the status, potential benefits, and limitations of fusion energy, (2) challenges that might affect the development or use of fusion energy, (3) policy options that might help enhance the benefits or mitigate challenges associated with fusion energy. GAO reviewed key reports and scientific literature; interviewed stakeholders from government, industry, and academia; held focus groups with members of the public; attended a conference on issues related to fusion energy; and convened a meeting of experts in collaboration with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. GAO is ident ifying policy options in this report. U nited States Government Accountability Office GAO developed four policy options that could help address these challenges or enhance the benefits of fusion energy. These po licy options are provided to inform potential actions to address the public policy challenges identified in this technology assessment. They identify possible actions by policymakers, which include legislative bodies, government agencies, academia, industry, an d other groups. See below for a summary of the policy options and relevant opportunities and considerations. Policy Options to Help Address Challenges or Enhance Benefits of Fusion Energy Opportunities Considerations Sustain current efforts (report p. 32 ) Some challenges described in this report may be addressed by current efforts. Could allow policymakers to observe and evaluate the impact of existing efforts, which could limit risk and save money.Current efforts may not address all challenges described in this report. Current efforts alone may delay or inhibit thedevelopment of fusion energy, which could result in forgone benefits or negative impacts, such as to the environment. Align public and private efforts (report p. 33) Implementation approaches: Align programs, missions, and organizational structures with fusion energy development goals Expand use of public private partnerships Reduce barriers to collaboration Leverage international coordination Could accelerate the demonstration and commercialization of fusionenergy by enhancing research onmaterials, technology, and engineering needs. Could leverage strengths across sectors and expand programs that,according to experts andinterviewees, are underused andhave been effective in advancingfusion energy development. Standardized research anddevelopment agreements could accelerate research, encourage knowledge sharing betweenorganizations and countries, and reduce time -intensive negotiation.Aligning public and private efforts can be time intensive and may require additional resources or legislativeaction, according to experts. To achieve fusion energy development timeline goals, policymakers may need to pursue parallel efforts and take more risks, which could incur greater costs. Could require additional resources or reallocation ofexisting resources from other programs. Build shared assets for fusion energy (report p. 34) Implementation approaches: Support facilities that address scientific and engineering challenges Support workforce development Assess sources of critical supplies and manufacturing capabilities Could help fill critical research gaps on the path to fusion energy commercialization. Could help ensure fusion energydevelopment is not limited by criticalworkforce or supply shortages. Test facilities require significant investment and years to build and commission. Workforce development takes significant time and resources. National lab representatives said that long- term funding is needed for education and training. Stakeholders may disagree on the best options tosupport community assets that are usable for a range offusion energy technologies. Engage the public in decision - making (report p. 35) Implementation approaches: Study public opinion through surveys and focus groups Educate through cross -sectoral forums Include affected communities in decision -making related to fusion facilities Could help inform policy decisions, such as those related to regulation ofand investment in fusion energy. Could ensure communitystakeholders' views are representedso that decisions do not negatively impact issues of public concern, such as traffic or the environment. Could ensure that benefits, such as economic development, are sharedbroadly and inclusively with affectedcommunities. Alignment between communities andfusion developers could reduce barriers to their success.Engagement should be proactive, transparent, and should set realistic expectations for benefits, risks, andtimelines. It may be difficult to ensure broad participation andrepresentation. Engagemen t should be used to learn about the public's perspectives about fusion energy rather than to persuade the public to support fusion.

National Spherical Torus Experiment - Upgrade Fusion Energy GAO-23-105813 1 441 G St. N.W. Washington, DC 20548 Introduction March 30, 2023 Congressional Addressees Nuclear fusion, the process that powers stars, could produce electric power without direct carbon emissions, long-lived nuclear waste, or risk of meltdowns. However, no fusion energy device has yet produced more energy than it consumes. Fusion occurs when one or more lighter elements combine to form a heavier element \u2014hydrogen fusing to form helium, for example\u2014 releasing energy in the process. By comparison, current nuclear reactors use fission, where heavier elements split into ligh ter elements. Producing the conditions necessary for fusion on Earth is incredibly challenging because it requires control of a complex system at temperatures hotter than the sun. In addition, materials need to be developed that can withstand the condition s\u2014high heat, ion damage, and bombardment by highly energetic neutrons \u2014that will be present in a fusion energy system. These technological challenges have prevented the generation of usable fusion energy. Furthermore, if fusion can be harnessed for electric ity in the future, it may not be commercially viable or cost -competitive with other energy sources depending on the future electricity market. However, recent fusion experiments have reported significant progress toward the goal of usable fusion energy. In December 2022, a U.S. facility became the first to get more energy out of a fusion experiment than the energy directly injected into the experiment. 1 The development of high -temperature superconducting magnets in recent years was another key step, which may enable the construction of more compact fusion devices. Meanwhile, advances in computer modeling are helping scientists better predict the behavior of plasma, the state of matter needed for fusion. Such advancements have prompted renewed interest in and funding for fusion energy. Private investors have committed several billion dollars of new investment to fusion startups. In fiscal year (FY) 2022, the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science received appropriations of $713 million for its Fusion Energy Sciences program, continuing a steady increase since its 2017 appropriation of $380 million. In FY 2022, the National Nuclear Security Administration received $580 million in appropriated funds for its Inertial Confinement Fusion program. In March 20 22, DOE announced a department -wide initiative to accelerate the development and commercialization of fusion energy in partnership with the private sector. We prepared this report under the authority of the Comptroller General to assist Congress with its o versight responsibilities, in light of broad congressional interest and the potential high value of fusion energy. We examined (1) the status of fusion energy technology, and the potential benefits and limitations of fusion energy; (2) challenges to the de velopment or use of fusion 1Operating the lasers to run the experiment required about 100 times the energy released by the fusion event, so the experimen t did not produce more energy than it consumed. Fus ion Energy GAO -23-105813 2 energy; and (3) policy options that may help enhance the benefits or mitigate challenges associated with fusion energy development and adoption. We interviewed agency officials and other stakeholders, visited fusion energy experiments, held an expert meeting, conducted focus groups with the general public, attended the 2022 American Nuclear Society annual meeting, and reviewed agency documents and other literature. See appendix I for a full discussion of the objectives, scope, and methodology and appendix II for a list of experts who participated in our meeting. We conducted our work from February 2022 to March 2023 in accordance with all sections of GAO's Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to technology assessments. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations to our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 3 1 Background 1.1 Fusion could provide abundant, safe, low -carbon energy If commercial fusion energy works, it could address many energy c hallenges, including the following: Emissions: It would reduce greenhous e g as emissions compared to fossil fuel energy because it does not involve combustion . E nergy needs: It might more easily meet growing energy use, which the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts will increase globally by nearly 50percent by 2050. Fusion uses relativel y ab undant materials for fuel, such as d euterium, a common isotope of hydrogen. It uses these fuels in relatively small amounts: 1 ton of fusion fuels could produce as much energy as about 7million tons of oil. Safety and waste: It does not create high-level or long-lived radioactive waste anddoes not pose the risk of a meltdown. Increased energy access: It may bepossible to site fusion power plants in mo re locations than renewable energy sources because they are not limited by 2Selected GAO reports on fusion energy include: GAO Management of the Atomic Energy Commission's Controlled Thermonuclear Research Program B-159687 (Washington, D.C.: Dec., 1972); Fusion - a Possible Option for Solving Long- Term Energy Problems EMD- 79-27 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 28, 1979); Performance of Inertial Confinement Fusion Program T-RCED -90-58 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 5, 1990); Fusion Energy: Actions Needed to Finalize Cost and Schedule Estimates for U.S. Contributions to an International Experimental Reactor, GAO- 14-499 (Washington, D.C.: June 5, 2014).natural events like wind and sunshine. This capability would increase access to energy that can be produced without direct greenhouse gas emissions. While fusion energy could provide these benefits, key limitations (see 1.3) and challenges (ch.3 -4) may affect its development and potential use. GAO has reported on fusion energy and these issues over the past 50 years. 2 1.2 Fusion is the reaction that powers the sun Fusion occurs when two atoms fuse to create a heavier atom, releasing energy in the process (see fig. 1). This process has been underway for billions of years on the sun, but it is extremely challenging to achieve on Earth because of the temperature and pressure required. Every atom contains a central mass known as a nucleus, which is positively charged and therefore repels other nuclei. In order to fuse, nuclei must be moving fast enough and have many chances for a collision. To achieve this, they must be extremely hot and either highly pressurized or confined in a small space for long enough, often at least a few seconds. Fusion in the sun Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 4 occurs at 15 million Kelvin (about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit) and a pressure that is about 100 billion times the pressure of the Earth's atmosphere at sea level. That pressure is extremely challenging to achieve on earth, so fusion experiments use much higher temperatures, often greater than 100 million Kelvin (about 180 million degrees Fahrenheit), to create the conditions for fusion. How ever, at the high temperatures needed for fusion the electrons and nuclei in atoms separate, creating plasma, which is difficult to control and which researchers are still working to fully understand. There are two pathways to create and control plasmas so 3A deuterium nucleus has one proton and one neutron. A tritium nucleus has one proton and two neutr ons. Most naturally occurring hydrogen is protium, which has one proton and no neutrons. Protons and neutrons are particles found in the nuclei of an atom. Protons are positively charged and neutrons do not have an electrical charge. that fusion can occur: magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. Magnetic confinement uses magnetic fields to control the charged particles in the plasma and contain them for long periods of time at moderate pressures. Inertial confinement compresses the fuel very quickly to very high pressures and temperatures, but for a comparatively short time. It is also possible to combine properties of magnetic and inertial confinement fusion, sometimes called magneto -inertial fusion. Fusion fuels include isoto pes of hydrogen, such as deuterium and tritium, or heavier elements, such as boron. 3 The deuterium - tritium reaction is the easiest to achieve, so it is highly studied and the likely basis for the first fusion energy systems. Because the first generation of fusion energy systems will likely use deuterium and tritium as fuel, this report refers to deuterium -tritium fusion unless otherwise stated. Other fuels may mitigate some challenges associated with deuterium - tritium fuel, but they require significantly higher temperatures. Figure 2 shows examples of fusion fuel combinations, resulting products, and required temperatures to produce sufficient fusion results. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 5 Note: The temperatures required for fusion are for attainable pressures. 1.3 Harnessing fusion energy requires engineering complex systems For a fusion energy system to be viable, it must produce more energy through fusion reactions than the energy needed to produce and maintain those reactions in a plasma. While there are fusion devices that produce fusion events, such as existing fusion research facilities, fusion energy systems will need to incorporate fusion reactors as well as supporting structures, systems and components. Furthermore, fusion energy systems will need to be integrated into power plants, which will require solving many complicated engineering problems. 1.3.1 Fusion energy requires controlled plasmas that take significant energy to create Although fusion can generate large amounts of energy from a smal l fuel supply, it takes significant energy to create a plasma that can sustain fusion. Fusion researchers denote the gain of energy from a plasma undergoing fusion using the letter Q. A Q greater than one means that more fusion energy is Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 6 released than is put into creating and maintaining the plasma, as seen in Figure 3. More specifically, Q Scientific considers only the energy that goes into the plasma. On December 5, 2022, a National Ignition Facility (NIF) experiment reached a Q Scientific of 1.5, the first time a fusion experiment achieved a QScientific greater than one. QEngineering , on the other hand, also considers the energy needed to operate the fusion energy system and generate electricity for transmission and use. Economically viable commercial fusion energy will need a Q Engineering significantly greater than one over power plant operation timescales. To achieve this, a fusion energy plant needs to maintain a burning plasma, whose main source of heat is from the fusion reaction inside the plasma, as opposed to an external energy source. Note: Q Scientific compares the energy into a plasma to the energy out, while Q engineering considers the energy in and out of the whole fusion energy plant. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 7 There are many sources of energy loss and inefficiencies in a fusion energy system. Building a fusion power plant will introduce more sources of energy loss and inefficiencies in supporting equipment built around the fusion energy system. Some inefficiencies are unique to fusion, and some are common to all energy sources. For example, some fusion techniques require cooling large magnets to cryogenic temperatures, which is very energy intensive. 4 Others use lasers, which are very energy inefficient, requiring significantly more energy to operate than the energy that the laser emits. Similar to other energy sources, fusion energy systems will need to convert heat energy to electricity, a process that inevitably results in energy loss. 1.3.2 Neutrons from fusion reactions damage materials and produce low- level radioactive waste Fusion reactions that use deuterium and tritium release high-energy neutrons.5 These subatomic particles damage the materials containing the fusion reaction and can make them radioactive. New materials will need to be developed and tested to withstand the fusion environment, and fusion plants will need to safely contain radioactive materials and dispose of low -level radioactive waste. Chapter 3 discusses engineering, design, and safety challenges associated with the se issues. 4Cryogenic temperatures are often below 120 K ( -240 degrees F). 5Because the first generation of fusion reactors will likely use deuterium and tritium as fuel, the report is referring to deuterium -tritium fusion unless otherwise stated. 1.4 The U.S. has pursued fusion energy since the 1950s 1.4.1 History of fusion energy Federally funded fusion research in the U.S. For decades, researchers in the U.S. have been studying fusion, with funding primarily from DOE and its predecessors. The U.S. began federally funded magnetic confinement fusion research at national laboratories in 1951, and in FY2022 Congress appropriated nearly $1.6 billion for fusion energy sciences and the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) inertial fusion program, including $280 million from the Inflation Reduction Act. 6 Some major DOE activities included: In 1963, the Atomic Energy Commission, aDOE predecessor agency, began fundin g la ser fusion research. In response to energy shortages duringthe 1970s, Congress approved funding for the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor, a magnetic confinement project operatingfrom 1982 to 1997 at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. From 1983 to 2014, the national Advanced Reactor Innovation andEvaluation Studies (ARIES) proje ct asse ssed the economic, safety, and environmental features of various powerplant design choices and the degree of 6The inertial fusion program supports NNSA's stockpile stewardship mission, and only part of that program supports research applicable to fusion energy. The Inflation Reduction Act provided a one -time budget increase for fusion energy science. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 8 extrapolation from existing capabilities needed to accomplish those designs. In 1996, DOE significantly restructured itsfusion energy program at the request of Congress. Congress reduced the budget by 40 percent and DOE shifted emphasisto fusion and plasma science research. Since 2008, U.S. researchers at theNational Ignition Facility (NIF) atLawrence Livermore National Laborator y h ave been supporting national security by conducting experiments with powerfullasers, using inertial confinementapproaches, to enhance nuclear weapon stockpile stewardship and some basic fusion science. 7 DOE also supports efforts to study plasmas for fus ion energy at government labs, universities, and private industry. For example, in FY 2021, the Fusion Energy Sciences program awarded $174 million in cooperative agreements, grants, and interagency agreements. Figures 5 and 6 provide a summary of DOE funding for fusion research through the Office of Science and NNSA. Note: Current appropriations is a term DOE uses to reflect the enacted appropriation, as well as funding transfers from other accounts. All values are nominal dollars. 7Stockpile stewardship includes science -based assessment of the reliability of nuclear weapons to assess and certify the stockpile without nuclear explosive testing. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 9 Note: All values are nominal dollars. Inertial confinement fusion funding is to support stockpile research, technology, and engineering. International collaboration Researchers have pursued fusion energy through inter national collaboration for decades. Beginning in 1973, European countries and researchers from around the world collaborated to build the Joint European Torus (JET) magnetic confinement fusion device in the United Kingdom. In 1997, JET set the then world r ecord for fusion output at 16 megawatts and for Q Scientific of 0.67. Researchers continue to test plasma physics, systems, and materials using JET. Meanwhile, the U.S. fusion research and development program has collaborated with other countries throughou t the history of 8ITER (pronounced \"eater\") originally stood for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor but the project is now known simply as ITER. 9Scientists and engineers from the United States, Soviet Union, European Union, and Japan worked on the design for ITER from ITER, an experimental fusion project in southern France. Design of ITER started in 1988 and construction started in 2008, with construction still in progress today.8 Researchers from around the world have collaborated to design, build, and eventually operate this large magnetic confinement fusion device to study long -duration burning plasma reactions.9 The ITER Agreement of 2006 provided for sharing among the project collaborators the cost of project construction, operation, and decommissio ning, as well as intellectual property. Today, 35 participating countries continue to build ITER with plans to address many of the technical challenges of commercial fusion energy after the device has been completed. If ITER demonstrates the technical feas ibility of fusion through plasma 1988- 2001. The U.S. temporarily withdrew from ITER from 1998 to 2003. The People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, and India joined the effort in the 2000s. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 10 energy gain, there are preliminary designs for a project or set of projects, known as demonstration power plants (DEMOs), to show the economic and environmental feasibility of fusion energy by integrating and demonstrating all relevant technology in a prototype fusion power plant. 10 Private industry In addition to some federal support in the form of grants and agreements, the fusion industry has received significant private funding in recent years. In a 2022 survey by the Fusion Industry Association, fusion companies declared $117 million in funding from government sources and over $4.7 billion of private funding commitments to date, an increase in private funding of $2.8 billion since the association's first report in 2021. 11 In addition, eight fusion energy companies were founded, or became known to the public, and at least seven companies received investments of $200 million or more since the 2021 survey. 1.4.2 Laws and regulations Several laws established or clarified the roles of federally sponsored research programs for 10Future development programs are different in various ITER member states, but in general DEMO consists of a phase where each ITER member uses the knowledge gained by ITER participation to design and build their own unique devices with the goal of demonstrating industrial -scale fusion electricity by 2050. According to DOE, the U.S. plans to address these goals with a fusion pilot plant. 11Fusion Industry Association, \"The Global Fusion Industry in 2022: Fusion Companies Survey by the Fusion Industry Association\". 12Nuclear Energy Innovation and Capabilities Act of 2017, Pub.

In 2019, the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (NEIMA) directed NRC to develop a regulatory framework for fusion reactors by the end of 2027. 17 NRC is determining the framework with which it will regulate fusion energy. NEIMA requires that a technology -inclusive regulatory framework include the use of risk informed, performance- based licensing techniques for \"advanced nuclear reactors,\" which includes both nuclear fission and fusion reactors. In September 2022, NRC released a white paper on op tions for licensing and regulating fusion energy systems. In January 2023, NRC staff submitted a paper to NRC commissioners, putting forth three options for regulating fusion energy systems: Under a byproduct material frameworkaugmenting NRC regulations in 10 C.F.R .

The Fusion Industry Association, in contrast, has called to regulate fusion energy faci lities under Part 30 - a byproduct material approach. According to NRC, there are four states participating in NRC's Agreement State Program that regulate some fusion facilities, such as fusion test facilities, as byproduct materials facilities. 17Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, Pub.

Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 12 2 Despite R ecent Advancements, Fusion Has Not Achieved Net Energy Gain 2.1 Projections of the time to putting fusion energy on the grid vary widely Fusion energy stakeholders disagree on when fusion energy will become technically feasible as an energy source for the electrical grid, as well as when it will become commercially viable. 19 Projections range from 10 years to several decades in the future. Some companies are claiming that they will achieve commercial fusion energy in about 10 years, while other stakeholders and experts said fusion might put electricity on the grid in 10 to 20 years but would require significant resources to do so. Still other stakeholders and experts said fusion energy will take more than 20 years. 20 We identified several technica l challenges to fusion energy, described in chapter 3, some of which could take at least a decade to solve. Specific projections for fusion energy on the grid include the following: 19Stakeholders refers to ent ities that GAO interviewed, as described in Appendix I Objective, Scope and Methodology. 20Experts refers to attendees of the GAO meeting of expert s, as described in Appendix I Objective, Scope and Methodology. 21Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee, Powering the Future, Fusion & Plasmas : A Long -Range Plan to Deliver Fusion Energy and to Advance Plasma Science (2020). The Fusion Energy Sciences AdvisoryCommittee, which advises DOE, in 2020described a timeline to make fusion economically viable by the mid-2040s. 21 T he National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies) in 2021 described atimeline for a fusion pilot plant in the 2035 to 2040 time frame, which coul d demonstrate solutions to technical challenges of fusion energy. 22 In 2022, at a White House Summit DOE and the Office of Science a nd Tec hnology Policy announced a \"decadal vision\" for fusion energy, with the goal of having fusion energy on th e gr id by th e early 2030s.23 Se veral countries are proposing demonstration power plants togenerate electricity in the 2050 timefra me. Th e Fusion Industry Association reported that many commercial companies predict fusion industry will be commercia lly viable in the 2031 to 2035 time frame. 22National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Bringing Fusion to the U.S. Grid (Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press, 2021). 23White House, Fact Sheet: Developing a Bold Vision for Commercial Fusion Energy, Press Release (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 15, 2022). DOE described this goal as a pilot -scale fusion energy power pl ant on the grid. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 13 2.2 Fusion researchers have reported significant accomplishments in the past decade Fusion science has made many significant advancements in the past decade, the culmination of decades of work. The following describes three of them. In December 2022, the NIF reported the first fusion experiment with a Q Scientific greater than one. Using inertial confinement fusion, the experiment delivered 2.05 megajoules of energy to the container holding the fusion fuel, known as a hohlraum, and produced 3.15 megajoules of fusion energy output, resulting in a Q Scientific of about 1.5.24 Inertial confinement fusion will need to produce significantly more energy before it is a viable energy source. The energy to power the lasers was about 300 megajoules, so if this were used in a fusion power plant the Q Engineering would be no higher than 0.01 - meaning that at least 100 times more energy would need to be produced by the experiment just to account for the energy required to run it. Accord ing to a laboratory representative, NIF was not designed to be energy efficient, and significantly more efficient lasers are envisioned to help improve the Q of the experiment, although these will have to be demonstrated. Another important advancement was a record sustained energy output for a fusion device, set by JET. The project reported an 24A megajoule is 1 million joules. The average U.S. home in 2021 consumes about 38,000 megajoules of energy in a year according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. output of 59 megajoules over 5 seconds from a fusion experiment on December 21, 2021. While the Q Scientific of this experiment was only 0.33, the experiment allows scientists to better understand fusion over longer durations. A third advancement is the development of high -field magnets using high -temperature superconducting materials, which could help reduce the cost of fusion energy systems. In September 2021, Massach usetts Institute of Technology Plasma Science and Fusion Center researchers and Commonwealth Fusion Systems reported operating a 20 tesla magnet for about 5 hours using a material known as rare earth barium copper oxide. 25 This magnetic field is significantly stronger than other magnets designed for fusion energy. For example, the magnets used for ITER are designed to have a maximum field of 11.8 tesla. The strength of the magnetic field drives the size of many magnetic confinement fusion devices, so creating high -field magnets could allow for smaller devices, potentially reducing cost. 2.3 Commercial fusion energy requires major advancements Even with recent accomplishments in fusion technologies, significant advancements are needed before fus ion can become an economically viable energy source. Fusion energy will need to show that it can create more power than the whole power plant 25Household refrigerator magnets are about 0.01 tesla. Magnetic resonance imaging devices in hospitals often range from 1.5 to 3 tesla. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 14 consumes, demonstrating a Q Engineering greater than 1. This means that fusion energy machines will require Q Scientific to be much greater than 1. For example, ITER is planning for a Q Scientific greater than 10. Figure 7 shows how Q Engnieering needs to improve significantly for inertial confinement fusion. Chapters 3 and 4 detail the challenges that need to be overcome to make fusion a competitive energy source. 2.4 Researchers and companies are pursuing many different concepts for fusion energy There are many different proposed concepts to achieve fusion energy. Most either use magnetic fields to control the plasma - magnetic confinement - or use lasers or electrical discharges to compress the plasma - inertial confinement. Some approaches combine techniques. The two concepts that have set significant records for fusion energy are inert ial confinement and tokamaks, a magnetic confinement approach. Other concepts are less advanced but are improving and have unique advantages. Below, we highlight a selection of concepts researchers and companies are pursuing. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 15 Inertial confinement fusion Inertial confinement fusion uses high -power lasers or electrical discharges to compress a small capsule of fusion fuel to extreme temperatures and pressures for a short time. Using high -power lasers NIF has reported a Q Scientific of 1.5, but inertial confinement needs to advance significantly before it could be an energy source. For example, it will need to dramatically 26National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, An Assessment of the Prospects for Inertial Fusio n Energy (Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press, 2013). increase how often it compresses fuel targets. A 2013 National Academies report said that an inertial confinement power plant would need to compress about 10 targets every second.26 According to laboratory representatives, NIF was designed to conduct single experiments for the Stockpile Stewardship Program, and it compresses about 20 deuterium-tritium Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 16 targets for inertial confinement fusion and thermonuclear burn research in a year. In addition to NIF, inertial confinement research is underway at Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Naval Research Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester. Several private companies are also pursuing inertial fusion energy. Tokamaks A tokamak is a magnetic confinement concept, which confines the plasma in a donut shape, called a torus, for several seconds at a time using magnetic fields. While the Q Scientific record is only 0.67 for tokamaks, the supporting technologies are some of the most advanced for fusion. It is the design basis for many fusion energy projects; ITER and JET both use tokamaks, and a larg e fraction of U.S. fusion funding goes towards supporting tokamak-based fusion. A benefit of a tokamak is that it is simpler than other designs to simulate and build because it is geometrically symmetric. Several other facilities in the U.S. and internatio nally are working to understand how tokamaks behave, including General Atomics' DIII -D National Fusion Facility in San Diego, National Spherical Torus Experiment - Upgrade (NSTX -U) at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, JT - 60SA in Japan, KSTAR in the Republic of Korea, EAST in China, and MAST Upgrade in the United Kingdom. Several private companies are also using this concept in their pursuit of fusion energy. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 17 Stellarators Stellarators are another type of magnetic confinement fusion energy concept. While the plasma performance of stellarators to achieve fusion energy conditions is not as advanced as tokamaks, 27 they could avoid disruptio ns described in chapter 3. A stellarator contains the plasma using twisted magnets that are challenging to 27The plasma performance with respect to fusion energy conditions are often compared using the Lawson criterion, which incorporates a plasma's temperature, confinement time, and fuel density. The Lawson criterion for stellarator devices is about 1/10th of the value for tokamaks and about 1/100th of the value for inertial confinement fusion. simulate and build. Major stellarator projects include the Wendelstein 7 -X at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Germany, the Large Helical Device in Japan, and the Helically Symmetric eXperiment at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Several companies are pursuing stellarator designs to achieve fusion energy. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 18 Z-pinch The Z -pinch is a hy brid approach that uses an electrical current to magnetically confine and compress the plasma. It was an early design for fusion energy, with research starting in the 1950s; however, the performance of Z -pinch machines is significantly lower than tokamaks and inertial confinement fusion. 28 Z-pinch devices will need to improve significantly before they are commercially viable. The experimental design does not require external magnetic fields, resulting in a simpler design and potentially lower cost 28Z-pinch Lawson criterion values are about a ten thousandth of the value for tokamaks. compared to other concepts. Early designs for Z -Pinch devices were susceptible to plasma instabilities that prevented the devices from achieving fusion energy. More recently, research has demonstrated ways to stabilize Z -pinch machines, renewing interest among acad emic, national laboratory, and industry researchers. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and private companies are studying Z -pinch designs. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 19 Field reversed configuration The f ield reversed configuration design is another magnetic confinement approach that uses a much simpler magnetic field compared to tokamaks to create a compact plasma torus whereby the plasma can contain itself using its own magnetic field rather than external magnets. The simpler 29Field reversed configuration Lawson criterion values are about 1/10,000th of the value for tokamaks. design could make it easier to engineer and less expensive than tokamaks and could offer a potential solution that does not require deuterium -tritium. However, field reversed configuration devices are susceptible to many plasma instabilities, and the performance of such machines is lower than tokamaks and inertial confinement fusion. 29 Researchers have studied field reversed configuration devices since the 1950s. Several companies are pursuing this concept for fusion energy. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 20 3 Signi ficant Scientific and Engineering Challenges Impede Fusion Energy Development 3.1 The behavior of burning plasmas needs to be better understood Some aspects of plasma behavior are poorly understood, making it difficult to optimize plasma confinement and reliably drive fusion energy production. For example, turbulence is a highly complex behavior in which regions of a burning plasma move in ways that current methods cannot fully predict. Plasma turbulence is a multi -dimensional problem involving both the positio ns and velocities of large numbers of particles. In the last decade, more powerful computers have improved the accuracy of simulations, allowing scientists to adjust plasma confinement to compensate for turbulence. However, these models lack some experimen tal data needed to fully validate their performance, so they cannot yet predict how turbulence will affect the behavior and performance of plasmas with sufficient accuracy. In addition, self -heating or \"burning\" plasmas could exhibit as -yet-unknown behavi ors. So far, nearly all plasma research has been done on plasmas heated by an external source. As of March 2023 only one facility, NIF, has created a burning plasma. 30 Therefore, most scientific understanding of burning plasmas on earth is derived from simulations, and it is possible that burning plasmas in fusion energy devices will behave differently. For example, they may generate greater 30Prior to NIF's demonstration of a burning plasma, JET and the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory studied the heating of plasmas by energetic particles released by fusion reactions. electromagnetic instabilitie s, which in turn may trigger equipment failure because of sudden, very high heat loads and other stresses on system components. Scientists need experimental data to study the behavior of burning plasmas further and enable the design of fusion energy systems. 3.2 Available materials cannot withstand fusion conditions for sustained operations A key challenge for the development of fusion energy is that fusion energy systems, particularly components that are exposed directly to the plasma, will need to withstand extreme physical conditions for extended periods in order to generate commercial electricity. In a commercial fusion energy power plant, materials will need to last for months or longer to avoid frequent repair or replacement of components. However, when subjected to the stresses that fusion plasmas generate, materials currently available degrade or fail too quickly for commercial use. Without advances in materials, it will not be possible to build fusion energy systems that can reliably produce commercial electricity. In order for fusion to occur, the plasma must reach a temperature of about 150 million Kelvin, about 10 times as hot as the sun. The plasma then transfers heat to the parts of the Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 21 fusion device that face the plasma. A key component is the blanket, which surrounds the plasma and must simultaneously harness heat energy, enable the creation of more tritium to fuel the device, and shield other device components from radiation. In magnetic confinement devices, including tokamaks and stellarators, another critical component is the divertor, which removes heat and impurities from the plasma. In tokamaks like ITER, the divertor can experience extremely high bursts of heat that create significant thermal stress, causing even heat -tolerant materials to f ail. 31 Using simulations and experimental data, researchers have developed methods to avoid such bursts, but these methods remain to be fully tested. Another factor that will degrade fusion device materials is bombardment by the helium ions created by fusion. These particles can embed themselves within the material, changing its mechanical properties. For example, helium ion damage causes brittleness in tungsten, a candidate for plasma -facing components in fusion devices. A third source of stress is high -energy neutrons, which can cause multiple types of damage to components. Neutrons can degrade the mechanical and thermal properties of materials, and change their physical properties. They can also transmute elements in components into new elements, which would reduce their structural soundness and even make them radioactive. Furthermore, damaging helium ions can more 31The continuous heat flux experienced by the divertor is as high as 20 MW/m2, with bursts up to 1 GW/m2. easily accumulate in components that have been irradiated with neutrons. The effect of neutrons cannot be entirely overcome, but they could be reduced through the use of specialized materials that are resistant to neutron damage and could transmute into short-lived or nonradioactive isotopes. Some materials can withstand high heat, high neutron flux, or ion damage, but no existing material can simultaneously tolerate all three of these stresses at the levels and durations that would be needed for a commercially viable fusion energy system. Due largely to a lack of durable materials, experimental fusion devices are not designed to run for long periods, usually operating for a matter of seconds or minutes at a time. The National Academies has estimated that for a demonstration fusion energy plant to be considered successful, its materials, including those used in the plasma -facing components that will experience the greatest stresses, will need to last for around 1 year under fusion conditions. Scientists will therefore need to develop more advanc ed materials if fusion energy is to improve the economics of fusion energy . However, developing new materials will be difficult because, as of March 2023, no facility exists where materials can be fully tested under fusion- relevant conditions. The Material s Research Facility at the United Kingdom's Culham Science Centre has equipment to test materials against stresses like those induced by fusion, including mechanical and ion damage, but no facility has a source of high -energy neutrons like Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 22 those produced b y fusion. Efforts are in the planning stage to build such facilities in some countries. For example, the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) is currently under development through a collaboration between the European Union and Japan. IFMIF will allow the study of fusion neutron damage when it is completed. However, stakeholders have said that the need for a Fusion-Prototypic Neutron Source (FPNS) that produces neutrons similar to those from a fusion energy system is urgent. Stakehold ers have also called for facilities that would allow the evaluation of materials under the full range of stresses that fusion energy will impose. Stakeholders and experts said that materials testing facilities would benefit a wide range of fusion energy st akeholders; but they are expensive and time- consuming to build. Stakeholders said that such facilities are unlikely to provide a high enough return on investment for the private sector to fund their construction. In addition, personnel at one national labo ratory said that it would take at least 6 years to build an FPNS and another 6 years to get useful data from it, and that the wait would be too long to make it an attractive investment for the private sector. 3.3 Harnessing fusion energy poses complex systems engineering challenges Fusion energy will require complex systems engineering to efficiently extract energy from the fusion reaction and provide an economical source of electric power. The complexity of fusion systems means that solving one challenge may r eveal another. Examples of the complex challenges of engineering a fusion energy system include: Extracting fusion byproducts from theplasma. These byproducts can reduce th e ef ficiency of fusion, but so can removing them because it would also mea n r emoving some of the heat energy that promotes the reaction . C reating plasma -facing systems that are easily maintained and replaced. Plasma - facing systems will be very comple x be cause they will need to perform multiple functions at the same time,including harnessing heat to generateelectricity, shielding the outer parts of the plant from heat and radiation, and enabling the creation of more tritium.They will also need remote maintenance systems, because radioactivity will make it unsafe for human technicians to workwith them directly. These systems will need to be robust enough to allow maintenance of complex componentswithout damaging them. They will also need ports to access the components, but these must be placed so they do notweaken the device or interfere wit h o peration. Managing extremes of both heat an d c old. Fusion energy systems hav e c omponents that need to operate at both temperature extremes. ITER, for example, requires insulating its superconductin g ma gnets with both thermal insulatin g m aterial a nd a vacuum, and cooling the m to cryogenic temperatures, while simultaneously making the plasma hotter than the sun. Experimental fusion devices have successfully operated superconducting magnets at cryogenictemperatures, but engineering cryogenic systems for a largescale fusion energy device introduces challenges.Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 23 3.4 Using tritium fuel raises supply, safety, and security concerns The use of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, as fuel raises many concerns for fusion energy.32 One is that the global sup ply of tritium is far too limited to meet the needs of commercial fusion energy plants. The only appreciable source is from fission in certain nuclear power plants, many of which are expected to retire in the coming decades. Meanwhile, tritium cannot be ef fectively stored because it decays quickly, with a half - life of around 12 years. The global available inventory is predicted to peak in 2027 at about 27 kilograms (about 60 pounds), of which ITER experiments could consume the majority. Further, a fusion energy system that produces 1GW of power could consume about 56 kg of tritium per year. Fusion energy systems may be able to produce\u2014 or breed \u2014their own tritium by bombarding lithium with high-energy neutrons. While this ability to breed its own tritium fue l is key to many fusion energy system concepts, some estimates suggest that fusion energy systems may not be able to breed enough tritium to fully provide for their ongoing fuel needs. Many fusion energy system designs include a component called the breeding blanket , which incorporates lithium to create tritium. However, as of March 2023, there has been no large -scale demonstration of a tritium breeding blanket. Though researchers have demonstrated that lithium can release tritium and have tested materials against neutron damage, 32These concerns will not apply to fusion energy systems that do not use tritium. See section 1.2 for information on potential alternative fuel types. demonstrating tritium breeding at a scale relevant to commercial fusion energy would require testing in ITER or a pilot fusion energy plant. Tritium can also pose health risks and raise proliferation concerns. For example, ingesting water that contains tritium may lead to health effects, such as an increase in cancer risk. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a maximum allowable level of exposure of radiation in drinking water from tritium. In addition, tritium is used in nuc lear weapons, so deliberate production could be considered sensitive from a nuclear weapon proliferation standpoint in certain circumstances. To address these concerns, fusion energy plants will need systems to account for their tritium inventories. However, containing and accounting for tritium is challenging because, as a light element, tritium can permeate many materials, becoming embedded in the plasma -facing components of a fusion energy system or escaping into the environment. Therefore, fusion energy systems will also require complex equipment for handling tritium, as well as procedures for managing the radioactive waste from materials embedded with tritium. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 24 4 Public and Private Alignment of Efforts, Regulatory Uncertainty, and Othe r Factors Affect Fusion Energy Development 4.1 Public and private efforts are not fully aligned The fusion energy programs, missions, and organizational structures of the public and private sectors are not fully aligned. Coordination between the public and private sectors is key to accelerating the development of fusion energy. However, stakeholders and experts identified a number of areas, including research priorities, risk tolerance, and time frames, where each sector could align efforts to complement the other. Public sector efforts prioritize basic science, but fusion energy development requires an additional emphasis on technology and engineering research. In the 1990s, DOE restructured the U.S. fusion program, shifting its mission to focus on plasma science research and away from technology and engineering. Stakeholders told us that this shift has caused the U.S. to fall behind in areas such as heat -resistant materials and breeding blanket development research. DOE has established relatively small public -private partnership programs in recent years to support this research. For example, in 2019, DOE put forth the Innovation Network for Fusion Energy (INFUSE) initiative to support research in enabling technologies, such as materials science a nd modeling and 33Typical INFUSE awards are for up to $250,000 for 1 year, but INFUSE may grant 2 year awards of up to $500,000. In September 2022, DOE announced up to $50 million to launch another public private partnership program to help recipients meet major technical and commercialization milestones toward the successful design of a fusion pilot plant. simulation.33 Stakeholders said these programs are highly effective and recommended that they be expanded, as they account for a small portion of the nearly $1.6 billion in DOE funding for fusion research in FY 2022 (see ch.1.4). Because of this historical focus on enabling science rather than technology and engineering, experts said that the U.S. fusion program is not well organized to support the commercialization of fusion energy, including the transfer of newly developed technology to com mercial use. One expert contrasted the science-focused mission of DOE's Fusion Energy Sciences program to that of DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy, which has an energy -focused mission and is organized to support the research, development, and transfer of new technologies to industry. For example, the Office of Nuclear Energy is planning to develop an advanced nuclear fission test reactor to address research and development gaps, such as testing materials, fuels, and instrumentation, that stand on the path to commercialization. In addition, according to experts, the public sector's focus on basic science limits federal funding for fusion energy development because research programs with science missions generally have lower funding than energy programs. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 25 Another difference in alignment between the public and private sectors is their different attitudes toward risk. Industry representatives said that government should commit resources to support multiple technological approaches. However, some private companies' c oncepts for fusion energy systems may have a high risk of failing. Public sector stakeholders said that supporting high - risk efforts may not be a good use of public funds and could divert resources from more productive lines of research and development. Some national lab personnel said that they would like to see more transparency and accountability from private companies seeking access to national lab facilities and expertise. These personnel noted that some private companies seeking help from national labs have not produced peer-reviewed publications or credible design documentation. The public and private sectors also work on different timelines. Private sector investors expect returns on their investments, typically within about 20 years, according to f usion industry stakeholders. Therefore, private companies must demonstrate progress toward intermediate goals or milestones quickly to satisfy investors. However, industry stakeholders said that processes required to work with the public sector make it challenging for them to work as quickly as they want to. For example, one industry stakeholder said that it can take a long time for them to gain access to government funding when they receive awards. Furthermore, negotiating cooperative research and developm ent agreements 34National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Bringing Fusion to the U.S. Grid, National Academies Press (Washington, D.C.: 2021), p.43. (CRADAs) between private companies and national labs is time intensive, with some companies reporting it taking over a year. According to stakeholders and experts, this process should be much quicker because these agreements are usually similar to one another. 4.2 Regulatory uncertainty could slow development, but developing regulations for fusion energy is complex Lack of regulatory clarity could add time and cost to fusion energy development and commercialization, according to stakeholders, but developing regulations tailored to fusion energy poses complex challenges. A regulatory process that minimizes unnecessary regulatory burden is critical to the timely development of a cost-effective fusion pilot plant. 34 At the same time, regulations must be sufficient to protect the public and reassure them it that it is safe to accept the development of fusion energy projects in their communities. NRC is still in the process of developing the regulatory framework for fusion energy plants. States participa ting in NRC's Agreement State Program regulate some fusion facilities, such as fusion test facilities, as materials facilities. NRC is also considering regulating fusion energy plants under a utilization facility approach (see ch.1), which could impose requirements that are considered appropriate for fission reactors but may not be needed for fusion, such as Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 26 those related to financial protection or mandatory hearings. Imposing legislative and regulatory burdens on fusion that are similar to those for fissio n might slow or prevent the development of fusion energy plants. For example, experts said that similar excessive requirements from the French nuclear regulatory body were responsible for most of the delays and cost increases that ITER has experienced. Experts also said that the risks of fusion and fission are very different, and that fusion would not be cost competitive if subjected to the same regulations as fission. However, while fusion is likely safer than fission, some stakeholders have argued that commercial fusion energy plants will pose greater risks than the technologies for which 10 C.F.R Part 30 was developed, and that fusion energy plants should therefore be regulated under a stricter framework. One nuclear safety stakeholder told us that the amount of tritium that may be kept on site at certain fusion energy facilities could cause serious harm to workers and surrounding communities if released. Another nuclear safety stakeholder told us that fusion regulations should include siting criteria, emergency planning, financial assurance, and environmental impact assessment, similar to requirements for fission energy. NRC officials recognized these issues, stating that the most critical regulatory challenge for fusion energy is ensuring regulations are adequate to protect human safety without constraining technology development. These officials added that their goal is to right size the regulations as much as possible and to provide flexibility for different technological approaches and levels of risk. In addition to the materials facility and utilization facility approaches, NRC is also considering a hybrid approach to regulate different fusion energy systems based on their potential hazards. The length of time required for NRC to develop a regulatory framework for fusion may pose a challenge for fusion energy development by creating uncertainty for private investors. On e expert said that clear regulation appropriate for the benefits and risks of fusion could be significant for improving cost competitiveness, speed to market, and the cost of capital. Meanwhile, stakeholders said that the lack of regulatory certainty could be inhibiting investment and slowing the development of fusion energy, and could lead companies to choose sites in countries with greater regulatory certainty for their pilot plants. Another expert said that some private investors may not step up unless t here is more certainty in the legal and regulatory processes. However, achieving regulatory certainty without enough public engagement could impede fusion development in the long term. Experts said that if the public is not involved early in the regulatory process it will cause delays later on, and that public education and buy-in about fusion are critical to its success. NRC held public meetings with fusion stakeholders to inform NRC's January 2023 paper on options for licensing and regulating fusion energy systems. However, experts stated that the stakeholders attending these forums may not be representative of the broader population. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 27 4.3 Little is known about public perception of fusion energy Public perception of fusion energy could affect its development an d adoption. For example, if the public is enthusiastic about fusion energy, it may support devoting additional resources to research and development and welcome fusion facilities in communities. Conversely, if the public is skeptical, it may raise barriers to government investment in fusion research or the construction of fusion facilities. Understanding public perceptions of fusion is critical to its development, according to stakeholders. However, few studies have assessed public opinion of fusion energy, particularly in the U.S. To begin to address this gap, we held three focus groups with members of the public regarding fusion energy. Participants across the three groups offered reactions and raised questions and concerns in the following areas: Safety Multiple participants said that safety was an important concern. Participants said that they would want sufficient regulatory oversight before they would be comfortable with fusion energy plants in their communities. One participant said they may not want t o live near a fusion energy plant if it were radioactive, while others said that their safety concerns were not specific to fusion energy plants, adding that they would have concerns about living next to a coal -burning power plant as well. One participant said that the first fusion energy plants should be built in deserts or other areas away from where people live, to allow time for the full spectrum of risks to become known. Environmental impact Multiple participants said that the lack of direct carbon emi ssions was an appealing quality of fusion energy. One said that all decisions regarding energy in the U.S. should be guided by limiting environmental impact. Another noted, though, that fusion energy development may take decades, and that it might be more productive to invest in technologies that could solve climate issues in the nearer term. Cost Multiple participants asked about the cost of fusion energy, including how much money would be needed to develop it. Participants asked whether the government or the private sector would be primarily responsible for financing fusion energy. One said that tax dollars should not go to fusion energy until a net benefit is proven on a small scale. Impact on daily life Participants asked how a fusion energy plant might affect daily life in their communities. Some noted that fusion energy could benefit them by bringing jobs and other economic opportunities. One said that they would oppose the construction of any power plant that would affect the aesthetics of their community, noting, for example, that certain Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 28 industrial features would be unattractive.35 One participant raised other community effects, like traffic congestion, as a potential negative impact of fusion energy on daily life. Public engagement Multiple participan ts said that they would want government and industry to engage with communities where fusion energy facilities might be sited. They said they would want to receive information regarding the benefits and potential risks of fusion energy in an open and trans parent manner, and that they would expect government and industry to listen to their concerns and take them seriously. Some participants expressed concern that fusion energy, like other energy technologies, might have disproportionate negative impacts on disadvantaged communities. 4.4 Fusion energy development relies on a limited workforce and limited suppliers The lack of a sufficient fusion workforce, which would include professionals in many 35Participants said that aspects like smokestacks are unattractive. Fusion power plants will not have smokestacks but will likely have cooling towers, which may be confused with smokestacks. areas of expertise, may hinder the development of fusion energy. A shortage of fusion scientists, nuclear engineers, and electrical engineers has reportedly made it difficult to meet timelines and has resulted in fusion developers needing to recruit from other countries that are producing more qualified professionals in t hese fields. Experts said that the U.S. does not produce enough graduates in fusion-related physics and engineering disciplines and that many existing fusion researchers have or will soon retire. Training engineers, advanced technicians, and physicists tak es many years, and funding and training opportunities are limited. Most research programs for masters and PhD candidates in magnetic confinement fusion are connected to federal funding, and a reduction in government funding to universities a decade ago resulted in significantly fewer positions available at universities for fusion energy research. Stakeholders said that emphasizing diversity, equity, and inclusion in education and hiring could help expand the pool of available talent and bring new ideas and perspectives into the field. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 29 A related challenge to the development of fusion energy is that specialized components are produced by few suppliers and sometimes by a single vendor. For example, stakeholders stated that only one or two companies in the world make certain commercially available diagnostic systems needed for fusion energy systems. The producer of a critical component for ITER stated that they only created one spare, and that the suppliers for the necessary parts to produce another component are no longer in business. One stakeholder stated that it is not possible to obtain some components in the quantities needed for a fully developed device. Limitations in the supply chain could prevent the ability to bui ld fusion energy systems at scale. For example, stakeholders said accumulating the needed supply of power electronics, such as semiconductors, may be unattainable due to their use in other industries. Further, stakeholders said that raw materials such as r are earths and helium are also in limited supply. 4.5 The path to commercialization is uncertain Various factors make the economic viability of commercial fusion power plants uncertain. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 30 The costs of commercial fusion energy power are unknown, making cost estimates likely unreliable. Fusion energy could have some cost advantages, such as potentially inexpensive fuel. However, other costs, such as capital costs and maintenance and operations, will be determined by many of the factors previously discussed in this report. For example, fusion energy will likely not be economically viable without significant advancements in materials for components susceptible to damage from plasma, as materials affect the amount of time a plant can produce energy and generate revenue. Maintenance costs and run time may also be impacted by complex engineering challenges, such as how the system is designed for ease of maintenance or reliability. National lab representatives told us that they do not trust the accuracy of estimated costs for fusion energy until there is more information on the materials and maintenance routines proposed for a fusion power plant. Regulations could also impact costs, such as by increasing timelines and costs of capital, but regulatory decisions may depend on how fusion energy develops and whether new risks emerge or existing risks, such as tritium handling, are mitigated. Fusion energy, if it becomes viable, will face competition with other developing energy technologies. We have reported on many emerging technologies that could modernize and diversify the electrical grid while reducing 36Selected GAO reports on emerging energy technologies include GAO Technology Assessment Decarbonization: Status, Challenges, and Policy Options for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage, GAO -22-105274 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 29, 2022); Science and Tech Spotlight: Alternative Materials for Solar Cells, GAO- 22-105378 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 4, 2021); Technology Assessment: Nuclear Reactors: Status and Challenges in Development and Deployment of New Commercial Concepts, GAO- 15-652 (Washington, D.C.: July 28, carbon emissions. These technologies include carbon capture, renewable energy sources, energy storage, and advanced nuclear fission reactors.36 Fusion, similar to fission, will likely operate as a steady supply to meet continuous energy demands, known as baseload. However, the future development and adoption of other energy technologies may alter the energy landscape, including the need for baseload energy sources. See the text box for more information on how different energy sources work together. 2015); Science and Tech Spotlight: Advanced Batteries, GAO- 23- 106332 D.C.: Dec. 8, Renewable Energy, GAO- 533SP Nuclear Microreactors, GAO- 20-380SP (Washington, D.C.: Fe b. 26, 2020)). Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 31 Electrical grid energy generation capacity needs The electrical grid addresses various energy demands using different energy generating capacity types such as baseload, intermediate load, and peak load: Baseload generating units operate continuously at an essentially constant rate and are designed to maximize system mechanical and thermal efficiency while minimizing operating costs. Nuclear fission and some hydropower, gas, and coal power plants are examples of baseload units. Intermediate load generating units are responsive to changing energy needs and can adjust operation between base load and peak service as needed to support baseload generating units. Natural gas is often the fuel for intermediate energy, but solar and wind power can also function as intermediate energy sources. Peak load generating units are able to turn on quickly to meet electricity demands at their highest, and although peak energy generators are often more inefficient and costly to operate than baseload and intermediate generators, they are able to quickly provide energy in a high demand period. Natural gas and petroleum fueled generators are examples of peaking units. Figure 14 shows how baseload, intermediate, and peak load generating units can address energy demands throughout the day. It is important to have a diverse set of energy generation sources to meet both baseload and peak demand, and to ensure the electrical grid is resilient to disruptions. Fusion energy will need to work with many other energy sources and be economically competitive. Source: . | GAO -22-105813. 37National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Bringing Fusion to the U.S. Grid, p.93. Fusion energy may need to be cost - competitive on a life -cycle basis with these other energy technologies. The future costs of energy from these sources are difficult to predict and will be affected by economic conditions as well as state and federal policies. One stakeholder suggested that it could be more difficult to integrate fusion energy into a grid if renewable energy sources are meeting most of that grid's energy needs because fusion energy would be most profitable when it operates 100 percent of the time. However, at least one study noted that baseload nuclear may work well with grids using highly intermittent renewable sources, and another suggested fusion may not need to operate 100 percent of the time as baseload power to be economical. Time to market could also affect fusion's competitiveness, and a delayed timeline could diminish opportunities for fusion to enter the marketplace. 37 However, private investors have expressed confidence in fusion energy's potential to compete in the energy market, as evidenced by their recent increase in funding for fusion projects. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 32 5 Policy Options to Help Enhance Benefits or Address Challenges to the Development or Use of Fusion Energy We developed policy options that policymakers \u2014legislative bodies, government agencies, academia, industry, and other groups \u2014could consider taking to help enhance the benefits of fusion energy or address challenges to the development or use of fusion energy. This is not an exhaustive list of policy options. We intend for these options to provide policymakers with a broader base of information for decision-making. 5.1 Policymakers could maintain status quo efforts If policymakers do not find the prospects of fusion energy particularly compelling, or if they find other technologies more suitable to their energy goals, they could choose not to take any new actions to support the development of fusion technology. The following table provides further detail on this policy option. Table 1: Policy Option: Status Quo Implementation approach Opportunities Considerations Sustain current efforts until key near -term milestones for commercialfusion are achieved before taking additional action.Some challenges described in this report may be addressed by currentefforts. For example, NIF's recentQ Scientific results are promising, suggesting some fundamentalchallenges might be overc ome. Could allow policymakers to observeand evaluate the impact of existingefforts, which could limit their riskand save money.Current efforts may not address allchallenges described in this report.Current efforts alone may delay orinhibit the development of fusion energy, which could result in forgone benefits or negative impacts, such asto the environment. Some challenges, such as materialsresearch or workforce development,can take many years to address. Source: GAO. | GAO- 23-105813. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 33 5.2 Policymakers could align public and private sector efforts to accelerate development of fusion energy As section 4.1 describes, misalignments between the public and private sectors could result in missed opportunities to develop commercial fusion energy. In particular, federal efforts focus more on basic science and less on energy research than industry would need to bring fusion energy to the grid. Policymakers wishing to accelerate development of fusion energy could atte mpt to align public and private efforts. The following table provides illustrative approaches for implementing this option, along with opportunities the option may present and factors to consider. Table 2: Policy Option: Align Public and Private Sector Efforts Implementation approach Opportunities Considerations Align existing programs, missions, and organizational structures with fusion energy development goals. Expand use of public privatepartnerships that focus onaccelerating fusion energydevelopment. For example, theINFUSE program is a public - private partnership forresearch focused on innovation in critical areas such as materials science and modelingand simulation. Increase use of fundingmechanisms that providegreater predicta bility for recipients and accountabilityfor funders. For example,milestone -based programs reimburse funding uponreaching performance targets. Reduce barriers tocollaboration, for example byusing standardized CooperativeResearch and DevelopmentAgreem ents (CRADAs). L everage international coordination by, for example,increasing the use of facilities that are unavailable in the U.S. Could accelerate the demonstration andcommercialization of fusion energy by enhancing research on the materials,technolo gy, and engineering needs of fusion energy. Leverage strengths across sectors andexpand programs that, according tostakeholders, are underused and havebeen effective in advancing fusion energy development. Could provide predictability and flexibility to funding recipients, while ensuring performance and accountability for the funder. Standardized research and developmentagreements could accelerate research,encourage knowledge sharing betweenorganizations, and reduce time intensivenegotiation. Improve d knowledge sharing with other countries could help accelerate fusion energy research and workforce development. For example, a fusiondeveloper recommended bringing stafffrom the U.S. to ITER to learn how todevelop and operate a fusion plant onthe grou nd so they could bring that knowledge back to the U.S. to supportfuture fusion power plants.Aligning public and private sector efforts can be time intensive and may requireadditional resources orlegislative action, accordingto experts. To achieve fusi on energy development timeline goals,policymakers may need topursue parallel efforts andtake more risks, which could incur greater costs. Could require additional resources or reallocation ofexisting resources fromother programs. Reimbursement -based funding can be challenging for recipients, especially ifreimbursement processes are slow. Some research results maybe proprietary, inhibitingknowledge sharing orcoordination acrossorganizations and countries. Source: GAO. | GAO- 23-105813. Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 34 5.3 Policymakers could build shared assets for fusion energy development Given the many technical challenges to fusion energy (ch. 3) and the limited workforce and suppliers available to the industry (section 4.4), policymakers could choose to promote fusion energy development by enhancing shared assets for use by the research community, such as research facilities and training programs. The following table provides illustrative approaches to implementation, opportunities this policy option may present, and factors to consider. Table 3: Policy Option: Build Shared Assets Implementation approach Opportunities Considerations Support facilities to address shared needs of the fusiondevelopment community'sscientific and engineeringchallenges, such as advancedmaterials and tritiummanagement. Support workforce development to address labor shortages specific to fusionenergy. This approach couldinclude supportingmultidisciplinary education andtraining programs atunive rsities and technical colleges. Assess sources of critical supplies and manufacturing capabilities that will be neededto demonstrate and commercialize fusion energy,along with options to fill anygaps. Could help fill critical research gapson the path to fusion energy commercialization. C ould help ensure fusion energy development is not limited bycritical workforce or supplyshortages. Test facilities require significantinvestment, and years to buildand commission. For example, astudy prepared for DO E in 2019 estimated that a fusionprototypic neutron source to testmaterials in a fusion environmentcould cost about $470 million to $1.18 billion and take 5 -7 years to build and commission. Workforce development takes significant time and resources.For example, one expert told us that it can take 8 years to trainengineers and advancedtechnicians in the fields neededfor fusion energy. National lab representatives also said that long -term funding is needed for education and training. Stakeholders may disagree on thebest options to supportcommunity assets that aretechnology inclusive. Somestakeholders recommendedfocusing efforts on the mostpromising approaches, while others warned that picking a winner too early could crowd outother approaches that may bebetter options in the long term.

Fu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 35 5.4 Policymakers could engage the public in decision -making Little is known about the U.S. public's perception of fusion energy (section 4.3), and it will be complex to craft a regulatory framework that allows the industry to develop while protecting the public (section 4.2). Policymakers could therefore choose to engage the public in decision-making about the appropriate level of government support and the appropriate regulations, among other things. The following table provides illustrative approaches to implementation, opportunities this policy option may present, and factors to consider. Table 4: Policy Option: Engage the Public in Decision -Making Implementation approach Opportunities Considerations Study public opinion, for example through surveys andfocus groups, or host events tounderstand the public's questions and perspectives onthe benefits and risks of fusionenergy. Engage and educate the publicthrough cross -sectoral forums to ensure balance,transparency, and inclusivity. Include affected communities in making decisions aroundsitin g, construction, design, and operations.Help inform policy decisions, such asthose related to regulation of andinvestment in fusion energy. Help ensure community stakeholders' views are represented so that decisions do not negatively impact issues of public concern, such as traffic or the environment. Help ensure that benefits, such aseconomic development, are sharedbroadly and inclusively with affectedcommunities. Alignment between communitiesand fusion developers could reduce barriers to their succ ess. Engagement should be proactive, transparent, and should setrealistic expectations for benefits,risks, and timelines. It may be difficult to ensure broadparticipation and representation. Engagement should be used tolearn about the public'sperspect ives about fusion energy rather than to persuade thepublic to support fusion. Source: GAO. | GAO- 23-105813.

We examined (1) the status of fusion energy technology, and the potential benefits and limitations of fusion energy; (2) challenges that might affect the development or use of fusion energy; and (3) policy options that may help enha nce the benefits or mitigate challenges associated with fusion energy development and adoption. To conduct our work, for all objectives, we: Interviewed officials from the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. We also interviewed a nongeneralizable set ofstakeholders from academia, industry, national laboratories, international fusio n o rganizations, professional organizations, and nonprofits. We identified andselected interviewees with expertise in fusion energy or expertise in economic,social and legal factors for fusion energy, using a review of relevant documents and recommendations by those w e int erviewed over the course of our work. Visited three companies, two nationa l l aboratories, and an academic institution to observe their fusion energy experiments and learn about the status oftheir research. Attended the American Nuclear Societyannual conference in Anaheim, CA, fro m J une 13 -16, 2022, on emerging topics in nuclear science, including fusion energy. Reviewed agency documents, peer-reviewed literature, and other literature,such as white papers and industry reports. We identified literature based on online searches and at the recommendation of agency officials, experts, and other stakeholders. We also conducted a literature search on public perception of fusion energy in the U.S. A GAO librarian searched databases using keywords such as fusion energy and public perception, awareness, or opinion to identify relevant articles that were published in the U.S. from 2019 -2022. Cond ucted a virtual 3 -day meeting of 21 experts, convened with the assistance ofthe National Academies of Sciences,Engineering, and Medicine. We selected experts based on their expertise on fusion energy, understanding of the electricalgrid, and knowledge o f social, legal, and economic challenges with fusion energy . E xperts included representatives from government agencies, national laboratories, professional and international fusion organizations,industry, and academia. We also worked to ensure the experts represented a balanced perspective of the status, benefits, limitations, challenges, and policy options related to fusion energy. Experts provided documentation of anypotential conflicts of interest, and, upon review, we found the group of experts, as a whole, did not have any inappropriate bias. This meeting of experts was planned and convened with assistance from th e N ational Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to betterensure that a breadth of expertise was brought to bear in its preparation . Ho wever, all final decisions regardingFu sion Energy GAO -23-105813 39 meeting substance and expert participation are the responsibility of and were made by GAO. Consistent with our quality assurance framework, we offered our meeting experts the opportunity to review and provide tec hnical comments on a draft of our report, which we incorporated as appropriate. We received comments from 15 of the 21 experts. We incorporated expert comments into the report, as appropriate. For objective two, in addition to the stepsabove, we conducted three virtual focus groups of four participants each to obtainnongeneralizable qualitative insight intohow the U.S. public views fusion energy and questions the public may have about fusion energy. We conducted these focusgroups because interviews and th e lit erature indicated a lack of information about public perception of fusion energy,which may affect fusion energ y d evelopment and adoption. Focus group participants were selected to reflect adiverse range of perspectives, identities, and backgrounds in the U.S. Characteristics we used to achieve a range of perspectives included gender, geography, race and ethnicity, education, and income level. We piloted the focusgroup protocol with a group of four current and former GAO employees and interns who were not part of th e en gagement team and did not hav e a dvance knowledge of the focus grouptopic before the pilot session. Based on the findings from this pilot, we made modifications to the protocol to improve the focus group sessions. For example, we simplified our description of fusion energy and provided more time for questions from participants. We reviewed focus group transcripts to identify themes and key findings. For objective three, we identified policy ideas or options that appeared in th e lit erature, or that we heard about or discussed in interviews, our expert meeting, or focus groups. We synthesized and analyzed this information to developpolicy options, including the status quo, that could address challenges or enhance the benefits of fusion energy. The policy options are not intended to be inclusive of all potential policy options. We conducted our work from February 2022 to March 2023 in accordance with all sections of GAO's Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to technology assessm ents. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations to our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product.
