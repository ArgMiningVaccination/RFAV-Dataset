Basic Course Requirements Course Work : Each student must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours of courses numbered 500 or above. Without special prior approval of the student's advisor, committee, and the director of graduate studies neither ANTH 691, 692, 693, or 694 (Special Problems Courses) nor ANTH 699 (Thesis Research) will count towards the minimum 30 hours. (Note that there are additional course requirements for two of the three options). Core Curriculum : All students are required to complete satisfactorily a core curriculum composed of one graduate course in at least three of the four fields of anthropology. These three should be chosen from among: 1) linguistics - ANTH 608 (Advanced Linguistic Anthropology), 2) archaeology - ANTH 609 (Advanced Archaeological Anthropology), 3) soc io-cultural anthropology - ANTH 605 (Advanced Cultural Anthropology), and 4) physical anthropology - ANTH 610 (Advanced Physical Anthropology). Additionally, a course in research methodology (e.g., ANT 600 at UA or ANTH 615 at UAB) is required. Entering students must provide evidence of having passed introductory level courses in each of the four fields before taking the graduate courses. A student who has not had an introductory course may be required to take or audit the appropriate undergraduate course before enrolling in the graduate course. Credits earned from such preparatory course work may not be applied to the 30 credit hour requirement. Language/Research Skill Competency : Each student is required to demonstrate competency in a foreign language or research skill. This requirement may be satisfied in several ways including: successful completion (meaning a grade of B or better) of at least the second course in a language course sequence such as FR 101/102, GN 101/102, or SPA 101/102; certification of competency by examination from the appropriate language department; successful completion of a graduate level statistics course such as Sociology 701 or another statistics course subject to the approval of the chair and the program director. Students must get the approval of their advisor before undertaking any of these options. The student will be responsible for furnishing evidence of completion of this requirement to the director of graduate studies and the department chairman. M.A. Committee : By the start of the second year of academic work each graduate student will be required to have identified a faculty member willing to serve as permanent advisor and at least three additional faculty members to comprise an M.A. jury. This committee is subject to final approval by the chair and program director and functions as the principal advisory and research project approval board. The committee may include an external member of the Graduate Faculty. Comprehensive Examinations : All students must take and pass comprehensive examinations on their knowledge of the field of anthropology. The student will take written exams in at least three of the four subdisciplines. The selection of the three areas will be made in collaboration with the faculty advisor. The entire anthropology faculty will participate in composing the exam questions and evaluating each student's responses. The faculty's evaluations will be communicated to the director of graduate studies and to the chairman of the department. Interinstitutional Requirement Students must take at least 6 hours of graduate credit at the University of Alabama (Tuscaloosa) as required by the Interinstitutional MA. Three Plans of Study for the Master's Degree In addition to choosing one of the two program options outlined above, the student must satisfy the requirements for one of the following three plans of study. Choice of the plan of study must be made by the student in consultation with the M.A. Committee and the faculty advisor. Thesis Option : Thirty (30) hours of non-thesis course work, successful completion of the comprehensive examinations, plus a master's thesis. A student electing this plan of study will be required to conceive and execute a research project under the direction of his or her M.A. committee. The student's advisor will convene the committee as necessary to discuss, refine, and approve this plan. After twenty hours of course work are completed, the student may enroll in ANTH 699 (Thesis Research). The purpose of this coursework is to provide a structure for supervised contact hours with the student's faculty advisor. Such coursework, including the decision as to the number of contact hours required, must be pre- arranged in consultation with the faculty advisor. Hours completed in ANTH 699 must be over and above the 30- hour minimum. In preparing a thesis, the student should consult the booklet, A Manual for Students Preparing Theses and Dissertations available from the Graduate School. Students who take the thesis option will present a departmental colloquium based on the results of their research in the final semester in residence. Students should consult their faculty advisor and the director of graduate studies in scheduling and posting advance notice of their colloquia. Non-thesis Research Project Option : Thirty -six (36) hours of non- thesis course work plus successful completion of one of the following: Presentation of a research paper at a national meeting which has been approved in advance by the student's M.A. Committee; Acceptance for publication of a research paper submitted to a refereed journal which has been approved in advance by the student's M.A. Committee. In either case, it will be the responsibility of the student's committee to approve a written draft of the research paper. Approval of the paper will be conveyed in writing to the director of graduate studies and to the department chairman by the student's advisor. Final approval of the research project requirement is at the discretion of the M.A. committee. Students who elect the the sis option will be required to defend their thesis before a departmental committee in the final semester of residence. Non-thesis Option by Examination : Thirty -six (36) hours of non- thesis course work and successful completion of written examinations.

Program Description Students in the graduate program can concentrate their studies in any of three areas: Literature, Composition and Rhetoric, or Creative Writing. The requirements for each of these concentrations are explained below. Concentration in Literature Most literature courses can be considered to fall into one of the following areas, each of which has its own reading list. Group I: British Lit before 1500 British Lit 1500- 1660 British Lit 1660- 1790 British Lit 1790- 1900 British Lit 1900- present Group II: American Lit before 1800 American Lit 1800- 1900 American Lit 1900- present African American Lit 1746 -present African Diaspora Lit Group III: Composition Pedagogy Rhetorical Theory Linguistics Critical Theory Concentration in Literature Plan I. 1.

All students must choose at least one test area from each Group. 5. By the time students have earned 24 credit hours toward the M.A., students must secure the agreement of a graduate faculty member to serve as chair of their Graduate Study Committ ee (GSC). Students are encouraged to secure this faculty mentor as early as possible since the chair of a student's GSC has primary responsibility for mentoring the student through the exam process. The Committee chair must coordinate the composition, administration, and evaluation of all area tests for that student. The chair is also responsible for informing the student (and graduate program director) of the criteria for evaluation of the subject area tests; for notifying the student of the results; and f or meeting with the student afterwards to review the tests. The chair is also responsible for keeping the graduate program director informed of the student's progress and maintaining a complete exam file on the student. 6. In consultation with the student and the graduate program director, the Committee chair will appoint at least three other faculty to serve on the student's GSC. All members of the GSC must be graduate faculty. Once constituted, membership of the GSC cannot be changed without the approval of the departmental graduate program committee. 7. Each two- hour area test must follow a standard format that allows students to demonstrate their ability to read closely and to synthesize ideas. a. Area tests in literature and critical theory will give the following instructions based on selections from the area reading list: Choose one of the following passages and write an essay that (1) establishes -based on the chosen passage- some significant literary, intellectual, and/or cultural context and presents a thesis having to do with that context; (2) explains, by a close reading of the text, why the chosen passage is important both to the work from which it is taken and to the thesis of the present essay; and (3) discusses the context and thesis in relation to at least two other works from the area reading list. b.

Students must provide their GSC with a minimum of three weeks' notice in scheduling area tests, which must be taken Monday -Friday during the tenth week of each semester (sixth week during the shortened summer term). 9. Students are limited to three attempts at passing a test for the same ar ea. 10. The GSC will hold a group grading session to evaluate individual tests as Failing, Passing, or High Pass (the latter designation must be a unanimous decision of the GSC).

With thoughtful planning, many students have found the program offerings helpful in building a strong foundation to pursue doctoral (Ph.D. and M.D.) studies. The program also offers, in conjunction with the Department of Computer and Information Sciences, the opportunity for students to pursue a graduate certificate in computer forensics that involves additional, elective coursework. The program support includes many UAB faculty members from other departments, personnel from the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences' Birmingham laboratory, the Jefferson County Medical Examiner's Office, the Birmingham Police Department, and local forensic science- related private institutions. In addition, the program maintains a close working relationship with the DNA profiling laboratories of the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences and hosts the editorial offices of the Forensic Science Review (the only review journal in forensic science). Faculty research and practice focus especially on forensic aspects of drug chemistry and DNA -based identification. Minimum admission requirements include a B.S. degree in Chemistry, Biology, or a related natural science. Coursework should include the completion of one year of general chemistry, one year of organic chemistry, and quantitative analysis. Coursework is designed for qualified students to begin in fall and complete the program in 21 months. Admission is granted for the fall term only. According to the National Institute of Justice (2004), students wishing to pursue a career in f orensic science should be aware that positions in these fields usually require extensive background checks similar to those required for law enforcement personnel, and are likely a condition of employment. (National Institute of Justice (2004). Education and Training in Forensic Science: A Guide for Forensic Science Laboratories, Educational Institutions, and Students. NCJ Report 203099. Washington, DC: United States Department of Justice, pp. 7- 10). UAB graduates from the Master of Science in Forensic Science program are very successful in gaining employment within a year of graduating. During 2009- 2011, the program graduated 25 students. Twenty -two of them currently are working in a laboratory, are teaching, or continuing their education in graduate sc hool. Of these graduates, 14 are working in forensic science laboratories ranging from the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia to a Sheriff's Department Lab in Ventura, California.

Admission Admission into the physics graduate program is by recommendation of the graduate admission committee of the Department of Physics. The committee takes into consideration GRE General Test scores, prior academic performance, personal statement, prior research experiences, and the letters of evaluation, usually from former instructors and research supervisors. Beginning the Program All students must take a placement examination on basic physics concepts before registering for any courses. Upon arrival at UAB, international students may be required to take English as a Second Language course or Scientific Communication courses at UAB during their first year of study. M.S. Program Plan I The student must successfully complete at least 30 semester hours of coursework, including at least four core courses selected from PH 610- 611, 650-651, and 671- 672 and 6 semester hours of Thesis Research (PH 699). The student must also write and complete a successful oral defense of a thesis under the direction of a graduate faculty member. Additional coursework should be selected with the advic e of the student's graduate study committee to meet the particular needs of the student. An interdisciplinary track for an M.S. degree Plan I is also offered. Students admitted to this track will typically hold a bachelor's degree in a science area other than physics, such as astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics, or psychology, or an engineering degree, including optics and materials science. Thesis research will be in an interdisciplinary area, including astrophysics, astrobiology, biophysic s, chemical physics, geophysics, mathematical physics, neurophysics, optics, materials science, or engineering physics. Students awarded an M.S. degree within this track will be prepared for an Assistant Research Physicist position, including qualification for co authorship, and would typically work under the direction of a doctoral -level person. The acquired skill would be highly marketable, as individuals trained in multidisciplinary areas for basic and applied research are increasingly in demand in indus try, government laboratories, and other research institutions. Acceptance into this interdisciplinary track will be through a Physics Graduate Faculty member, who will be prepared to supervise the student's thesis research and develop a plan of study. This plan of study will include a core of courses (Classical Mechanics, PH 561- 562; Electromagnetic Theory, PH 545- 546; and Quantum Mechanics, PH 550- 551), other physics graduate- level courses, and a minimum of 12 hours of graduate- level courses offered by other departments. The Department of Physics will establish a standing Physics Interdisciplinary Track Committee to review and concur in each student's plan of study. As is current practice, thesis oversight will be by the student's M.S. Graduate Study Commit tee. Plan II With approval of the physics graduate program director, a nonthesis option (Plan II) is available for all tracks in the Masters program. In this case, the graduate study committee requires an additional 6 semester hours of coursework instead of a thesis and gives the student an M.S. -degree exit examination. Ph.D. Program Students may choose from a Physics Track or Applied Physics Track. All students are required to pass a written qualifying examination covering the areas of classical mechanics, electromagnetic theory, and quantum physics. This examination is to be taken within two terms of completing at least four core courses, PH 710- 711, 750 -751, and 771- 772. Under no circumstances may the examination be taken more than twice. Following satisfactory completion of the qualifying examination and consultation with individual faculty members, the student selects a specific area for dissertation research under the supervision of an appropriate graduate faculty member . The Graduate Study Committee, chaired by the major advisor , will administer an oral examination to test the student's knowledge in the area of research. The student must pass this oral examination in no more than two attempts. Based on the results of the exam, the Committee will outline a program of study including graduate courses such as computer and/or foreign language competency. The types of courses and distribution of credit hours depends on the PhD track chosen. See below for details. With direction from the major advisor, the student should focus on formulating and writing a formal research proposal that must be presented and defended before the Graduate Study Committee; this should lead to a recommendation from the committee for admission to candidacy. Dissertation research culminates in the successful oral defense of the dissertation. Physics Track : 90 total credit hours Twenty semester hours of existing core course work chosen from classical physics, quantum physics, statistical physics, and electromagnetic theory. Two semesters of scientific communications is required.

A terminal master's degree is not offered. The Medical/Clinical Psychology Specialization is approved by the American Psychological Association. Behavioral Neuroscience Study in the Behavioral Neuroscience specialization is designed to prepare students for independent research and teaching in the neurobiology of behavior. Research training is provided by faculty in the Department of Psychology and in the UAB Schools of Medicine and Optometry, who share an interest in the biological basis of behavior. The course of study includes a core curriculum in neuroscience and recognizes the interdisciplinary nature of this field. Students obtain strong backgrounds in behavioral science and in neuroscience and gain expertise in the content and techniques of selected areas of neuroscience as they apply to the study of behavior. Faculty laboratories are equipped for research in behavior, neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, neuroimaging, neuropharmacology, neurophysiology, and molecular biology. The research interests of the faculty include neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the visual system; interactions between the central nervous system and the periphery in the control of feeding and energy balance; neural underpinnings of obesity and plasticity in participants in a weight loss program; autism; emotional substrates of conditioned fear; neurophysiology and neuropharmacology of pain. Lifespan Developmental Psychology The Lifespan Developmental Psychology doctoral program trains scientists to conduct research to discover and apply basic principles of developmental psychology in an interdisciplinary context and to apply those principles to a variety of problems. Graduates are capable of taking positions in institutions of higher learning, medical schools, research institutions, government agencies, and other research and teaching positions. Research training is provided by the faculty of the Department of Psychology and may occur in collaboration with faculty at the Civitan International Research Center, the Center for Aging, the Center for Applied Gerontology, the Department of Pediatrics, The School of Public Health, and other centers and depar tments. The research programs of faculty with interests in lifespan developmental psychology include a wide variety of topics from infancy to the elderly. Much of this research is funded by federal research grants. Research subareas include: developmental disabilities (with special interests in Autism Spectrum Disorders, prenatal development and exposure to toxic substances, early intervention, adolescent psychosocial development and mental health, and how family members adapt to the problems of a child with a disability); adolescence (with special interest in longitudinal studies, interactions between health and development, alcohol and drug use, predictors of depression and suicide, family and peer relations, those with special health care or education needs); and aging (with special interest in visual -perceptual problems of older adults with low vision, memory skills training with elderly populations, the psychological aspects of chronic illness in the elderly, chronically ill individuals, care giving in f amilies of elderly persons, human factor issues in vision and aging). Developmental Psychology students must complete a master's thesis. Admission to candidacy for the doctoral degree is based on satisfactory completion of coursework and completion of an area review in the form of a Psychological Bulletin or Psychological Review article. The doctoral degree is awarded upon successful defense of the dissertation. It is also possible to enroll in the Gerontology Certification Program concurrently with enrollment in the Lifespan Developmental Psychology Program. More information about this program may be found at: http://www.aging.uab.edu/SubChannel/Training/pdf/gep- student -policy -2006.pdf Medical/Clinical Psychology The Medical/Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program provides scientist -practitioner training in clinical psychology wi th an emphasis on investigation and service delivery in a medical setting. It is oriented toward assessment and intervention of behavioral factors associated with disorders, their symptoms and risk reduction, enhanced treatment, prevention, and the enhancement of health. The Program is cosponsored by the UAB School of Medicine. Coursework, research, and clinical clerkship training are provided by faculty psychologists in the Departments of Psychology, Rehabilitation Medicine, Psychiatry, Neurology, Pediatrics, Surgery (Divisions of Gastric and Cardiovascular Surgery), and Medicine (including Divisions of General and Preventive Medicine, Rheumatology, Arthritis, and Gastroenterology), the Center for Aging, Center for Palliative Care, Sparks Center for Developmental and Learning Disorders, Civitan International Research Center; VA Medical Center, and UAB School of Public Health. In addition, psychologists in several health psychology -behavioral medicine and mental health centers in the community play an active teaching, research, and clinical supervisory role in this program. Current research programs in which faculty and students are involved include AIDS treatment -- efficacy and compliance; HIV/AIDS--risk reduction; Autism Spectrum Disorder intervention outcome; cardiology -- cardiovascular surgery --open- heart surgery outcome; pediatric virology --congenital infections and mental development; gastroenterology; gastric bypass surgery, anorexia- bulimia and other eating disorders programs; head injury center --rehabilitation, neurovascular surgery research; epilepsy assessment and treatment research; cocaine and other drug dependence--treatment, development and evaluation; very low birth- weight project; mental retardation--Down's syndrome parent coping project, Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and caregiver projects; and neuropsychological evaluations for early cognitive decline, competence, and Alzheimer's Disease; brain injury studies of behavioral and medical interventions and of imaging correlates of psychological processes; improving health status and utilization; cardiovascular risk assessment and reduction in minority populations; access to cancer screening and care in underserved populations; Women's Health Initiative Multi -Center Project; assessing and modifying women's cancer and other health risks; and smoking cessation interventions. This is a representative but not exhaustive list. Most Medical/Clinical Psychology Program faculty research is extramurally funded by private foundations and federal support, especially the Centers for Disease Control and multiple institutes of the National Institutes of Health. It is possible to enroll in the Master of Public Health degree program concurrently with enrollment in the Medical/Clinical Psychology Program; this requires the approval of both the Medical/Clinical Psychology Clinical Director and the UAB School of Public Health. Application The deadline for receipt of a complete application for admission is: November 30 for the Medical/Clinical Psychology Pr ogram; December 6 for the Lifespan Developmental Psychology Program; and January 15 for the Behavioral Neuroscience Psychology Program. Applications are solicited both from students with bachelor's degrees and from those who may have already completed some graduate study. The GRE General Test is required. The GRE Subject Test in psychology is recommended. Admission Admission to the program is highly selective. We follow an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity process to ensure applicants are evaluated on their individual merit. Successful applicants usually present scores of at least 600 on both the verbal and quantitative portions of the GRE General Test and a minimum 1,200 overall score (verbal plus quantitative). Minimum grade point averages of 3.2 (on a 4.0 scale) overall, over the last two years and in psychology courses, are required for admission. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the Behavioral Neuroscience specialization, students with diverse backgrounds in psychology, biology, and physical science are encouraged to apply. All students are expected to have undergraduate training in psychology, biology, physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Students not trained in one or more of these areas may be required to make up deficits after enrollment. Admission to the Lifespan Developmental Psychology specialization requires a solid background in psychology as well as some courses in the life sciences. Research experience is essential. Excellent grades in statistics and mathematics are also valued. The criteria for admission to the Medical/Clinical Psychology specialization include a minimum of 18 semester hours in psychology courses (specific courses recommended are Introduction to Psychology, Psychological Statistics, Physiological Psychology, Psychology of Learning, and Abnormal Psychology or Psychology of Personality) and a minimum of 18 semester hours in life science courses (courses in chemistry and biology/physiology). Courses in mathematics through calculus and in computer programming are recommended. Students with deficits in any of these areas may be required to take suitable additional coursework before and/or after enrollment. Relevant research or clinical service experiences are considered important indications of the applicant's motivation and commitment to psychology. The relevance of the student's goals and interests to the research- health psychology orientation of the specialty is also an admission consideration. Advisement Behavioral Neuroscience students are advised by the Behavioral Neuroscience specialization director in consultation with a graduate program steering committee and by their research preceptors until the dissertation committee is appointed, usually early in the third year of study. Students accepted in the Lifespan Developmental Psychology specialization are matched with a faculty member who agrees to mentor that student. Therefore, applicants will need to identify faculty members with whom they share research interest and would like to study. The associate director of the Medical/Clinical Psychology program is the initial Graduate Study Committee (GSC) chair for each student during their first year. Throughout the first academic year the chair will meet with students as necessary to assess their goals, interests, and background, and to provide general advising as needed. As the year progresses, the initial chair and student will nominate faculty to serve as permanent chair and members of the GSC beginning after the first academic year. Thereafter, students are encouraged to suggest changes in their GSC membership to accommodate evolving interests, advising needs, research collaborations, etc. Curriculum Behavioral Neuroscience The curriculum in Behavioral Neuroscience provides a student with advanced training that is broadly based in neuroscience. All students have a plan of coursework that includes Overview of Behavioral Neuroscience (PY 753), a two- semester statistics sequence (PY 716- 717), and an ongoing seminar in current research (PY 756). Advanced academic coursework is determined by the student and mentor. Each student must enroll in a research practicum directed by a member of the graduate faculty during each term in residence. The student initially rotates among faculty and laboratories during the first year to obtain breadth in points of view and experimental techniques. Student then chooses a mentor with whom they normally complete the remainder of their research training. Before admission to candidacy, each student must fulfill the pre- dissertation research requirement and pass the qualifying examination. Following acceptance of a proposal for dissertation research, the student is admitted to candidacy. The Ph.D. degree is awarded upon successful defense of the dissertation. Lifespan Developmental Psychology Each student in the Lifespan Developmental Psychology specialization is encouraged to develop a systematic line of research that complements that of his or her advisor. With intense exposure to an important aspect of developmental research, the student acquires skills that can be generalized to a variety of problems. Students are required to complete a core curriculum which includes 21 hours of developmental psychology classes, 15 hours of research design and statistics, 9 hours of general psychology and related discipline classes; 6 hours of teaching practicum and teaching; and at least 48 credit hours of research. Lifespan Developmental Psychology students must complete a master's thesis. Admission to candidacy for the doctoral degree is based on satisfactory completion of coursework and completion of an area review in the form of a Psychological Bulletin or Psychological Review article. The doctoral degree is awarded upon successful defense of the dissertation. Medical/Clinical Psychology The Medical/Clinical Psychology specialization places strong emphasis on integration of biological and behavioral sciences. Research and clinical training require an undergraduate background in both psychology and life science. The program requires continued pursuit of applied skil ls, biological and psychological skill, and knowledge basic to health psychology research and practice. The curriculum includes three broad areas: 1. Basic biological and psychological knowledge, including cognitive biological and social -emotional basis of behavior, individual differences, statistics and research methodology, professional issues, and ethics; 2. Professional skill and knowledge, including assessment, intervention, evaluation, and consultation; and 3. Medical psychology. Students pursue research and a clinical focus on one or more of the several available health psychology areas through advanced scientific and applied coursework, clinical clerkship, and directed research activities that typically culminate in the doctoral dissertation. Course requirements for the Medical/Clinical Psychology specialization include but are not limited to 1. Statistics and Research Design--a four -course sequence; 2. Clinical Psychological Assessment --a one- year modular course sequence; 3. Psychological Interventio n--a four -course sequence; 4. General Psychology --Developmental Psychology (core course for all three programs); 5. Biological Bases --Behavioral Neuroscience (core course for all three programs); 6. Health Psychology --a four -course series, three of which involve choices from alternatives such as neuropsychology, psychopharmacology, psychophysiology, neural bases of behavior, and health psychology, plus elective seminars in fields such as rehabilitation, aging, cardiology, and neuropsychology; and 7. Other Required Courses --Adult Personality & Psychopathology, Professional Issues and Ethics, History & Systems, and Social Psychology. Additional courses and/or seminars may be taken as electives. The student's advisor may also require additional coursework for a chosen area of emphasis. Courses in many departments of the university are available on an elective basis. Students are required to complete a minimum of 18 semester hours of research and 18 semester hours of clinical clerkship. Students are required to complete a master's project. Students in Medical/Clinical Psychology are also required to serve a 12- month internship in clinical psychology in a medical facility. The internship must be in a program outside of UAB and accredited by the American Psychologic al Association. The PhD is awarded upon successful defense of a dissertation and completion of internship.

To be admitted in good standing, candidates must meet all Graduate School admission requirements. Plan I applicants lacking 18 semester hours in social science courses will be evaluated individually for academic deficiencies. Supplemental coursework may be recommended by the graduate faculty. The program provides a Plan I (thesis) option. The M.A. degree is conferred upon the fulfillment of the requirements outlined below. All of the following core courses are required for all students: SOC 701 Introduction to Sociological Research Methods SOC 703 Regression Analysis SOC 705 or SOC 711 Quantitative Methods/Qua litative Methods SOC 720 Classical Theory SOC 722 Contemporary Theory SOC 702 (3 continuous semesters) Proseminar on the Profession 2 or more substantive courses (these may be in areas outside of Sociology, subject to approval by the Sociology graduate program director) Additional requirements for the Plan I M.A. degree include the following: 6 semester hours of thesis research (SOC 699); an acceptable research- based thesis; and a final oral examination based on the thesis. Medical Sociology Ph.D. Program This program is designed to provide students with the coursework and research experiences to become leading researchers and practitioners in medical sociology. Doctoral training in medical sociology exposes students to the central issues of the field through a variety of methodological techniques encompassing both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Graduate students study the social and cultural bases of health beliefs and behaviors, organizational structures of health care delivery, and patient -practitioner relationships, to name just a few examples. Students acquire expertise in theory formulation and data analysis. There are abundant opportunities for graduate students to work with faculty on research projects in medical settings across the campus. Admission Admission to the Ph.D. program in medical sociology generally requires a minimum overall score of 1150 on the GRE (verbal and quantitative); minimum GPA of 3.0 (A = 4.0), or a 3.2 GPA for the last 60 semester hours in a B.A. or B.S. program; and minimum GPA of 3.5 in all previous graduate coursework. Students should have completed at least 18 hours in social science courses, including social theory, statistics, and research methods. Students entering the program with a master's degree can receive up to 12 hours of transfer credit that were not used for any other degree program (see graduate school guidelines). They also have waived 6 credits of SOC 699 (thesis research credits). Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the Medical Sociology Ph.D. program, students with diverse backgrounds in social science and health- related fields are encouraged to apply. Students lacking adequate backgrounds in theory, research methods, or statistics may be required to make up deficits after enrollment. Advising The Graduate Director and/or the student's faculty mentor will provide continuous advisement on academic progress during the student's graduate study, including assistance with course selection and recommendations for research experiences that are consistent with the student's developing interests and abilities. In addition, each year the student will be formally evaluated by the Graduate Committee and will be provided with performance feedback. Research supervision is provided by faculty whom students select to chair the master's thesis and doctoral dissertation committees. Typically, the student will select persons with whom a close, supportive relationship develops. The placement of Ph.D. students in research sites within the Department and/or in areas across campus is an important part of the Medical Sociology Program. Such placements usually involve assisting faculty on research grants. Such experiences provide students with invaluable real -life exposure to medical sociology \"in action.\" As such, they are important accompaniments to the coursework of the Ph.D. program. Teaching and research positions are offered to students based on department needs, funding available and student merit. Curriculum The components of the Ph.D. program are as follows: 1. Required Coursework Medical Sociology Core (9 hr) Required: SOC 780 Medical Sociology 2 of 5 Required Electives: SOC 734 Global Health SOC 735 Special Topics in Global Health SOC 755 Race and Health SOC 756 Gender and Health SOC 775 Place and Health SOC 781 Sociology of Health and Illness SOC 783 Health Care Delivery Systems SOC 785 Family and Health SOC 786 Health Disp arities SOC 787 Sociology of Mental Health SOC 788 Social Medicine Theory Core (6 hr) Required: SOC 720 Classical Theory SOC 722 Contemporary Theory Statistics and Research Core (15 hr) SOC 701 Introduction to Sociological Research Methods SOC 703 Regression Analysis SOC 704 Categorical Data Analysis SOC 705 Quantitative Methods SOC 711 Qualitative Methods Research Hours Master's Thesis Research Hours (6 hr) Doctoral Dissertation Research Hours (24 hr) Sociology/Health Electives/Transf er Credits (30 hr --up to 15 hours outside department) Proseminars (3 hr) Proseminar, SOC 702 - 1 hr Fall Research Proseminar, SOC 702 - 1 hr Spring Professionalization and Proposals Proseminar, SOC 702 - 1 hr Summer Teaching *students may take up to 3 790- 793 classes for credit as electives. *students may take 2 in- department online courses towards their degree 2. Graduate Proseminar Functions The graduate proseminar series (SOC 702) is required of all entering doctoral graduate students for their initial t hree terms in the graduate program. These classes familiarize new students with departmental policies and procedures, as well as various facets of the profession of sociology. This series should not only help students become situated within the graduate program, but also give them an opportunity to become better acquainted with the faculty and graduate student body. Students should also gain experience with basic professional skills such as identifying appropriate journals, creating a curriculum vitae, identifying one's own research interests, developing basic classroom skills, and addressing ethical issues associated with the profession of sociology. 3. The Master's Thesis Students pursuing the doctoral degree must follow Plan I (Thesis Plan) of the existing master's degree program by producing a research- based thesis, but two types of documents will be acceptable. The first is a traditional thesis organized in the form of an extensive book monograph. This option is especially appropriate for qualitatively based research. The second acceptable type of document is a manuscript in the standard form of a journal article with appended materials. Specifically, this journal article thesis will consist of: 1) a forward which places the research in context, specifying the journal to which the article is to be submitted, delineating the rationale for co- authorship (if appropriate), and making acknowledgments; 2) a journal article manuscript with a text no longer than the page limitations of a journal selected by the committee, plus footnotes, references, tables, and figures; 3) an appendix with an annotated bibliography of relevant literature; 4) an appendix that details, in full, the methodological procedures; 5) an appendix of measurement instrumentation (e.g., survey instruments, in- depth interview schedules, observational logs, etc.); 6) an appendix of additional tables and/or samples of observational notes, and 7) an appendix of other research documentation such as survey cover letters, human subject review approval forms, and letters of support and approval from facilities at which the research was conducted. The master's thesis process involves; 1) formation of the thesis committee; 2) oral defense of a written thesis research proposal; 3) oral defense of the completed thesis; 4) submission of the completed manuscript to the Graduate School, and 5) submission of the journal article for publication. The thesis committee consists of a minimum of three full -time faculty members, including one from outside the Department of Sociology. This committee will be responsible for guiding the research process, evaluating the final draft of the thesis, presiding over the oral defenses of the thesis proposal and the completed manuscript, and approving the journal article for submission for publication. In addition to meeting general M.A. degree requirements, before being admitted to candidacy for the M.A. degree, a student in the Ph.D. program in Medical Sociology must have completed the master's level core courses in theory (SOC 707 and 720) and two core methods courses (SOC 701 and SOC 703, or SOC 705 and SOC 711), completed two of the five courses in the medical sociology core, and made a successful oral defense of the thesis proposal. For those students entering with a master's degree, the student's doctoral advisory committee will review the student's transcript, evaluate course transfers (if any), and devise a course plan. This committee also will handle the student's admission to candidacy and the requirement of submitting a journal article for review. The student with the master's degree will not be required to make oral defenses of his/her thesis work from another institution. 4. Comprehensive Exams All doctoral students who enter the program in Fall 2010 or later must take a comprehensive examination no later than the end of the third summer after being admitted to the Ph.D. program. The comprehensive examination should be taken in a specialty area chosen by the student. The specialty area must be a combination of health and one substantive area reflecting the specialties of the faculty (e.g., aging and health, health behaviors, community health, health and demography, health and family, health inequality, health policy, etc.). The advisory committee will consist of three faculty members selected by the Graduate Committee. Prior to taking the examination, the student should meet with the advisory committee to develop a reading list based on the specialty area. The comprehensive examination will include five questions decided by the advisory committee reflecting major theoretical, methodological, and substantive issues in the student's chosen specialty area. The student will answer four of the five questions as a take- home exam, which will be distributed at 4:00 p.m. Friday and will be due the following Monday at 9:00 a.m. The members of the advisory committee will grade the examination on a pass/fail basis. Students who fail the examination but wish to continue in the program must take a make- up examination in the following Fall Semester. Students who fail the make- up examination will be terminated from the Ph.D. program. 5. The Doctoral Dissertation The dissertation process is as follows: 1) formation of the dissertation committee; 2) oral defense of a written dissertation research proposal; 3) oral defense of the completed dissertation, and 4) submission of the completed manuscript to the Graduate School. In consultation with faculty, and near the completion of all substantive coursework, a student forms a dissertation committee consisting of at least five members, with two from outside the Department of Sociology. This committee will be responsible for guiding the research process, evaluating the final draft of the dissertation, and presiding over the oral defenses of the dissertation proposal and the completed manuscript. A student is admitted to candidacy after successful oral defense of the dissertation proposal and no earlier than the term in which the required substantive coursework is completed. Financial Aid All students admitted to the Ph.D. program will be considered for financial aid. Sources include graduate fellowships and assistantships.

Students will receive training over a broad base- integrating molecular, cellular, biochemical and biological experimental approaches. Combinations of courses, seminars, small group discussions and hands -on research provide each student with a customized dissertation experience. Students will have opportunities to work with outstanding investigators throughout the UAB campus in the areas of tumor microenvironment, metastasis, cancer genetics, stem cells, gene therapy of cancer, pharmacology/toxicology, signaling and tumor immunology. Successful graduates will have a firm foundation upon which they can build careers in academia, research institutions, industry or government. Students are expected to complete the entire program in four or five years. During the first year, students will participate in the GBS core curriculum and will begin more specialized training by exploring potential laboratories in which they may do their dissertation research as well as courses representing the multiple disciplines involved in cancer research. A course focusing on \"classic papers\" in cancer research will set the stage for modern approaches to studying the disease. Following three laboratory rotations, each student will select a mentor for his/her dissertation research. Following the core curriculum, students will begin specialized cancer research electives. During the second year, students will complete their specialized courses and will participate in journal clubs and special topics curricula. After the second year, cancer biology students will write a proposal for their dissertation research and presented to their graduate advisory committee for approval. The focus following advancement to candidacy is hands -on research, although students can elect to participate in other advanced courses that will round out their education or provide opportunities to expand the research. Admission Requirements A baccalaureate degree in the natural or physical sciences is required. Undergraduate level courses in organic and analytical chemistry, cell biology, biochemistry and genetics are strongly encouraged.

CMDB students will receive comprehensive training and instruction in cell, molecular, and developmental biology using modern tools and approaches as well as a wide range of model organisms and cell culture systems. The overall goal of the theme is to develop well -rounded scholars with expertise applicable to multiple fields pertinent to a productive research and teaching career in academic science centers, research institutions, and industry. Admission Requirements Students are admitted into UAB Graduate Biomedical Sciences (GBS) umbrella program and indicate a theme preference. Applicants to the UAB Graduate School are reviewed by the GBS Admissions Committee and will be evaluated on the basis of their undergraduate performance (both the curriculum and grade point average), letters of recommendation, GRE scores, a personal statement of research interests, performance in other graduate programs or research activities and, if possible, a personal interview. Although students select a theme on admission into the GBS program, they may change theme affiliation at anytime; however changes that occur late in the doctoral program may require additional fundamental course work related to the specific theme. Acceptance into CMDB requires a bachelor's degree including undergraduate coursework in calculus, general and organic chemistry, and at least one introductory course in zoology or biology by the time of entrance. The CMBD theme invites applications from individuals committed to obtaining a graduate education in biomedical sciences. Once accepted into GBS, students must complete the GBS core curriculum and three scientific research rotations in GBS laboratories. CMDB students will then begin course work in areas related to his/her research interests and training needs determined through the advice of faculty mentors and staff. Overview of the CMDB Theme The CMDB theme is comprised of over 60 primary and secondary faculty members with appointments in many of the academic departments and Centers at UAB including Cell Biology, Genetics, Biochemistry, Neurobiology, Medicine, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Nutrition Sciences, Cardiovascular Disease, Clinical Immunology, Rheumatology, Pathology, Environmental Health Sciences, Physiology and Biophysics, Psychiatry & Behavioral Neurobiology, Vision Sciences and Optometry. The scientific interests of the faculty are very diverse and interdisciplinary in nature. As such, the CMDB theme can provide students an individually tailored, comprehensive training program in cell, molecular, and developmental biology using modern tools and approaches in a wide range of model organisms. The research conducted by CMDB faculty addresses fundamental cellular and molecular questions that provide the basis for understanding and treating human disease. In the first semester, all students accepted into the GBS program will complete a 14- week core course covering fundamentals in biochemistry, metabolism, genetics, molecular and cellular biology. After completion of the core GBS curriculum, CMDB students will complete a course entitled Cell Signaling. In addition, starting early in the first semester each student will obtain research experience through three laboratory rotations that will be completed by the end of the first year. Laboratory rotations are for ten weeks and are an integral part of the first year curriculum. They are the first opportunity to truly experience what graduate level scientific research is all about. These rotations are highly structured and are meant for you to become acquainted with the laboratory and the mentor and to gain practical exper ience in a variety of the techniques and types of scientific questions being addressed within the different theme areas. At the end of each rotation the students will present their research in the form of a poster presentation that is open to the GBS community. After completion of the rotations, students choose a mentor and laboratory for their dissertation research. In the second semester, CMDB students must attend Methods and Scientific Logic, a journal club designed to demonstrate how to critically evaluate data and experimental design in the scientific literature and research. In addition, beginning in the second semester CMDB students will complete a series of one month modules in areas related to cell, molecular and developmental biology that are in the general research and scientific interest of the individual student. The CMDB curriculum is tailored to the student's research and scientific interests. As such, the student will be able to select from modules in the CMDB theme as well as from other GBS themes approved by the student's mentor and the CMDB theme directors. The student must complete eight modules, five of which should be listed as a CMDB course. Additional course work may be required to fill gaps in the student's knowledge based on the recommendation of the mentor and the student's thesis committee. In the summer of the first year, all CMDB students must complete course in Biostatistics and Bioethics as well as conduct non- dissertation research in their selected laboratories. At the b eginning of the second year, students will assemble a thesis committee in consultation with their mentors. This committee will be formed by anywhere between 4 and 6 members, 3 of which should be faculty associated with the CMDB theme. In the second year, students continue non- dissertation laboratory research and take module course work to fulfill the requirements described above. By the beginning of the third year, CMDB students must complete their qualifying examination consisting of a written dissertation research proposal in the format of an NIH style grant and an oral defense. The examination will evaluate whether the student has gained a sufficiently broad knowledge necessary for successful academic research. To help in this process, the second year curriculum will include a course in scientific writing and grantsmanship with a mock NIH grant review session. After successful completion of the exam the proposal will be submitted to a funding agency (if applicable) for possible support. After the second semester, all students must participate in a CMDB approved Departmental Seminar Series and a weekly journal club until completion of the doctoral degree. The curriculum of each Ph.D. candidate usually requires five years of training and is individually t ailored to the interests and needs of the student by the advisor and a graduate committee chosen by the student. The Ph.D. degree is awarded upon successful defense of your dissertation, which includes an oral presentation of original, creative scientific investigations, and a written dissertation which is expected to include published manuscripts or manuscripts in preparation. Because pursuit of the Ph.D. degree is a full-time activity, all graduate students are supported by monetary stipends and do not have any required teaching duties. The level of activity required does not permit outside jobs or excessive extracurricular activities. Continuous registration and satisfactory academic standing during all terms is required.

Theme Information Objectives The main goal of the Genetics and Genomic Sciences Graduate Program (GGS) is to provide studen ts with an outstanding, flexible, didactic training experience to prepare them for independent and innovative careers in research. The Program emphasizes a broad approach to the fundamental principles of genetics and genomics, and offers a large pool of mentors with expertise in a wide variety of areas. The GGS offers close day -to-day interactions between students and faculty, both in the classroom and the laboratory. The research interests of our program faculty span the fields of genetics, genomics, cance r, biochemistry, cell biology, and developmental biology. Modern molecular approaches are used to study gene structure, expression, and function in diverse experimental systems including humans, mice, Drosophila, C. elegans , and other organisms such as bacteria. The GGS is also designed to permit close collaborations during the Ph.D. training period between graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty, while also encouraging full participation in the larger community of biological scientists at UAB. Admission Requirements Students are admitted into UAB Graduate Biomedical Sciences (GBS) umbrella program and indicate a theme preference. Applicants to the UAB Graduate School are reviewed by the GBS Admissions Committee and will be evaluated on the basis of their undergraduate performance (both the curriculum and grade point average), letters of recommendation, GRE scores, a personal statement of research interests, performance in other graduate programs or research activities and, if possible, a persona l interview. Although students select a theme on admission into the GBS program, they may change theme affiliation at anytime; however changes that occur late in the doctoral program may require additional fundamental course work related to the specific theme. Acceptance into GGS requires a bachelor's degree including undergraduate coursework in calculus, general chemistry, organic chemistry, and at least one introductory course in zoology or biology by the time of entrance. Doctoral students will receive financial aid in the form of a stipend/fellowship plus full payment of tuition, fees, and their insurance premium. Current stipend/fellowships are $26,000 per year for 20011- 2012 entering students. The GGS theme invites applications from individuals committed to obtaining a graduate education in fields related to genetics or genomics. We recommend that applicants take prior courses covering basic concepts in genetics and biochemistry if possible; however, this is not required for admission. Applications are strongly encouraged from individuals with previous research experience, a master's degree in related area, or a professional degree such as the M.D. or D.V.M. Once accepted into GBS, students must complete the GBS core curriculum and three scientific research rotations in GBS laboratories. GGS students will then begin course work in areas related to his/her research interests and training needs determined through the advice of faculty mentors and staff. Overview of the GGS Program The GGS theme is comprised of over 80 primary and secondary faculty members with appointments in many of the academic departments and Centers at UAB including Genetics, Cell Biology, Microbiology, Biochemistry, Neurobiology, Medicine, Pathology, Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Nutrition Sciences, Vision Sciences, and others. The scientific interests of the faculty are very diverse and interdisciplinary in nature. As such, the GGS theme can provide students an individually tailored, comprehensive training program in genetics and genomics through use of modern tools and approaches in a wide range of model organisms. The research conducted by GGS faculty addresses fundamental cellular and molecular questions that provide the basis for understanding and treating human disease. In the first semester, all students accepted into the GBS program will complete a 14- week core course covering fundamentals in biochemistry, metabolism, genetics, molecular and cellular biology. After completion of the core GBS curriculum, GGS students will then take the Principles of Genetics course that will cover Mendelian and nonmendelian inheritance mechanisms, cytogenetics and chromosome disorders, and basic epigenetic concepts. Students are also expected to attend a weekly journal club and seminar series, such as those offered by the Department of Genetics, during all years of their graduate training. These weekly events generally start in September and run through May of each academic year. In addition, starting early in the first semester each student will obtain research experience through three laboratory rotations that will be completed by the end of the first year. Laboratory rotations are for ten weeks and are an integral part of the first year curriculum. They are highly structured and allow the student to become acquainted with the laboratory and the mentor, gain practical experience in a variety of the techniques, and to learn about the different scientific questions being investigated within the GGS theme. At the end of each rotation, the students will present their research in the form of a poster presentation that is open to the GBS community. After completion of all three rotations, students choose a mentor and laboratory for their dissertation research. In the second semester, GGS students will complete a series of one month modules that cover a wide variety of subjects including genome structure and function, linkage and association analyses, bioinformatics, and model systems for genetic analyses. In the summer of the first year, all GGS s tudents must complete course in Biostatistics and Bioethics and conduct non -dissertation research in their selected laboratories. During the subsequent years of the program, GGS students will focus on their laboratory research, as well as take a small number of specialized courses related to genetics and genomic sciences, or their specific areas of investigation. At the end of the second year of graduate training, students will assemble a thesis committee in consultation with their mentors. This committee will contain 4- 6 faculty members, 3 of which should be faculty associated with the GGS theme. By the midpoint of the third year, GGS students must complete their qualifying examination consisting of a written dissertation research proposal in the format of an NIH style grant and an oral defense. The examination will evaluate whether the student has gained a sufficiently broad knowledge necessary for successful academic research. To help in this process, the third year fall curriculum will include a course in scientific writing and grantsmanship with a mock NIH grant review session. After successful completion of the exam the proposal will be submitted to a funding agency (if applicable) for possible support. After passing the qualifying exam and the necessary advanced coursework, GGS students are accepted to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The curriculum of each Ph.D. candidate usually requires five years of training and is individually tailored to the interests and needs of the student by the advisor and a graduate committee chosen by the student. The Ph.D. degree is awarded upon successful defense of your dissertation, which includes an oral presentation of original, creative scientific investigations, and a written dissertation which is expected to include published manuscripts or manuscripts in preparation. The pursuit of the Ph.D. degree is a full - time activity, therefore all graduate students are supported by monetary stipends and do not have any required teaching duties. The level of activity required does not permit outside jobs or excessive extracurricular activities. Continuous registration and satisfactory academic standing during all terms is required.

Introductory Immunology is a team -taught survey course that covers basic concepts of innate and adaptive immunity. These integrated series of lectures provide a firm foundation in immunology, especially for those with minimal immunology background, and serve as an important refresher for the developing immunologist. Students actively participate in the course through weekly presentations of selected immunology topics based on the current literature. Lymphocyte Biology. The objective of this class is to provide first year immunology students with the opportunity to gain a more in- depth understanding of selected aspects of lymphocyte biology. Possible topics include T cell subsets, B cell biology, lymphocyte activation, and transplantation immunology. The course is literature intense and students are required to read and present numerous scientific papers. Dendritic Cell Biology. Understanding the biology and function of the immune system's professional antigen presenting cells, the dendritic cells, is a fast moving challenge. The course will cover the seminal papers in the field that have laid the groundwork for our current understanding of this group of complex cells. The major component of the class will emphasize student presentations of assigned reviews and journal articles. Presentations wi ll include an overview (provided by the review article) and 2- 3 papers per class. History of Immunology. This course will examine the concepts that have shaped what we now consider pillars in our knowledge of the immune system. The course will cover the major events and discoveries that led to these established concepts and, where possible, the advent of technologies that facilitated these advances. The course will involve student participation in the form of presentations in selected areas as well as lectures by some individuals who were part of this history. Neuroimmunology. The purpose of this course is threefold; 1) to provide students with a basic overview of immunology and neuroscience in conjunction with a specific focus on how neuroinflammatory processes affect the brain, 2) to teach students basic neuroanatomy of the brain, and 3) to have students understand the clinical implications of neuroinflammatory diseases by attending rounds with clinicians. How the immune system influences the brain is an emerging field in neuroscience research and is currently not being addressed in a graduate or medical course. Innate Immunity. The study of innate immunity has made a resurgence in recent years and its critical role, not only in host defense against invading pathogens, but in the development of adaptive immune responses is now appreciated. This course will provide an in- depth look at selected aspects of the innate immune response including the cellular and molecular components critical to its development. The course will involve student presentations on selected topics. Mucosal Immunology. The mucosal immune system is essentially the primary site of interaction between invading pathogens and the immune system. Mucosal immunity has always been a strength of the immunology community at UAB and is rarely covered at most other institutions. This class will provide in-depth analysis of the structural features that distinguish the mucosal immune system from the peripheral immune system. Features of innate and adaptive immunity as they relate to mucosal immune responses will also be covered. The course will involve student presentations on selected topics.

Students entering the Neuroscience Graduate Theme will find a home and anchor for their entire graduate experience. Throughout a student's entire Ph.D. career, the faculty and staff of the Neuroscience Graduate Program provide continued support, encouragement, and guidelines for success. The theme- based UAB Neuroscience Graduate Program seeks to equip and train students to become tomorrow's innovative neuroscientists by teaching basic neuroscience ideas that become stepping stones to more in- depth research providing unique professional and scientific avenues through which they can develop their presentation skills, learn critical thinking and how to design experiments offering students the opportunity to choose neuroscience research from a multitude of options available through labs all over campus, not limiting students to a department but, rather, a discipline providing opportunities for informal interaction with other students to discuss research, scientific writing, as well as a social network of peers to assist students in staying grounded Students enter the neuroscience theme either through direct admit into the program or after their first year when moving into the permanent lab of a neuroscience mentor. Neuroscience theme students follow the neuroscience curriculum and do not join a departmental graduate program nor follow a departmental graduate program curriculum. The student becomes affiliated with the department in which the mentor holds his/her primary appointment for the purpose of the awarding of the degree. Some of the affiliated departments: Neurobiology Cell Biology Neurology Psychiatry Pediatrics Pathology Physiology & Biophysics Vision Sciences ADMISSION TO THE PROGRAM Admission to our program is highly competitive. We generally admit only 6- 7 students each year. Students admitted to our students meet and usually exceed general requirements of: 3.0 or above undergraduate GPA GRE scores of 550 or better on each section for a minimum composite score of 1100 Strong background in biology, chemistry and/or mathematics Research experience TOEFL (for international students) of greater than 500 on paper -based test and greater than 173 on computer -based test Required Application Materials Domestic students: (No application fee) Application and personal statement Official transcripts from all undergraduate institutions attended Official GRE scores (Institutional code 1856) 3 letters of recommendation International students: ($60 application fee) Application and personal statement Official transcripts from all undergraduate institutions at tended Official GRE scores (Institutional code 1856) Official TOEFL scores 3 letters of recommendation All students accepted into the program receive free tuition free health insurance $26,000/year stipend. CURRICULUM All first year students follow the same curriculum, designed to provide them with the foundations they will need as they move into permanent labs and begin their own research projects. Students begin their year attending the Intro to Neurobiology course at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab on Dauphin Island, Alabama, on the Gulf of Mexico. While there, the student is exposed to a variety of learning opportunities, including lectures, hands -on experiments, and going out into the Gulf to \"fish\" for marine life. Students live at Dauphin Island, dorm style, for 2 1/2 weeks in late summer, working hard with UAB faculty and teaching assistants and playing hard during their downtime. This course provides a very unique opportunity for neuroscience students. General Requirements for Ph.D. Students are required to successfully complete 2 electives prior to their last semester. Registration for the Student Summer Seminar Series (GBS 737) is required for each student each summer semester. Participation includes attendance, completion of an evaluation form for each speaker, and the presentation of a 20 minute PowerPoint talk and 10 minute Q -A session. Students will present once each summer. First year students are excluded from presenting. Students must register for and attend a seminar series of their choosing (with advice from their mentor) each semester until graduation. A biostatistics course is required. At this time, a particular stats course is not recommended. Work with your mentor on choosing the stats course that works best for you. All students must successfully complete an ethics course. This is taken during the summer semester of the student's first year (GRD 717). Students must register for a journal club of their choosing (with advice from their mentor) each semester until graduation.

PBMM represents an expansion of the Integrative Biomedical Sciences Program and is designed to give students the very best multidisciplinary training within the emerging and exciting field of molecular medicine. The main objective of the program is to expose students to a diverse faculty with research interests that range from molecules - to whole organisms - to disease processes - to new therapies. Our premise is that students, when trained in basic principles of molecular and cellular biology, in addition to organ- based physiology, pharmacology and pathology, will be prepared to study biological processes at any level of organization. The important biomedical issues of today are sufficiently complex that the successful investigator must be able to tackle these issues using integrated, multi -faceted approaches. The advantage of joining PBMM is that students have full access to all faculty within the GBS, including those not within PBMM. This gives students the broadest opportunity possible to move their studies in the direction that they find most interesting. In addition, PBMM is composed of over 125 active research faculty that are utilizing state- of-the-art resources and ideas to drive the field of molecular medicine forward. Within PBMM, you will have the opportunity to immerse yourself at the leading edge of biomedicine and share in the excitement first -hand by working alongside research pioneers. During your first y ear, you will complete a series of rigorous courses that includes training in biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, cellular physiology and pathobiology. You will also have the opportunity to take courses within designated \"Focus Areas.\" These Focus Areas are organized around specific research strengths represented by faculty within the PBMM and address important issues in diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer among others. In addition, you will have full access to courses offered by other programs within the GBS where strengths exist in multiple fields including immunology, neuroscience, structural biology and others. There will also be ample time allotted for you to attend research seminars, learn to make scientific presentations and to perform 3- 4 laboratory rotations. These rotations are designed to give the student a practical introduction to bench research and to help the student choose a faculty mentor. After the first year there will be additional coursework directed in your ar ea of interest, but the main focus will be on intensive research training within the laboratory. Here, guided by your mentor and graduate advisory committee, you will develop critical technical and analytical skills that will form the basis of your dissertation research. Graduates of the PBMM training program will be fully prepared to address the most complex and challenging issues in disease biology and therapy and be well positioned to pursue work in academic, industrial or government research or related positions. Training for the PhD degree is generally completed within four to six years, depending on the student's background and training goals. Admission Requirements UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION A baccalaureate degree in the natural or physical sciences is required. Undergraduate level courses in organic and analytical chemistry, cell biology, biochemistry and genetics are strongly encouraged. Undergraduate mathematics through calculus and physics are also recommended. GRADES & SCORES The Graduate School recommends that entering students have a minimum grade point average ( GPA ) of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale and a minimum combined verbal/quantitative score on the Graduate Record Exam (GRE ) of 1100. International students must submit scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Language ( TOEFL) earned within the last two years. Applicants with scores of 600 (paper -based) or 250 (computer -based) or higher will be considered. RESEARCH Most students admitted to the program have undergraduate or postgraduate research experience. APPLICATION REVIEW Applications are reviewed by the GBS Admissions Committee, representing all GBS thematic programs. Acceptance will be based on a combination of factors including: Undergraduate performance (both the curriculum and grade poi nt average) Letters of recommendation GRE scores A personal statement of research and career interests Previous research experience Personal interview, at program expense (international applicants may be interviewed by phone or video conference) Admi ssion to our Programs is very competitive and the number of positions is limited; thus not every qualified applicant can be offered a position. Academic Program Year 1 Courses Integrated, science- based teaching is the foundation of every PBMM course. You will learn from a team of faculty that will contribute their expertise in the basic biology and physiology of each topic coupled with an emphasis on understanding relevant diseases, clinical correlates, and therapeutic approaches. The lectures also emphasize the sci entific techniques and experimental approaches that are essential to the concepts being discussed. In addition, many instructors assign journal readings and independent projects, which may include Web- based searches or literature reviews, to actively engage you in the learning process. First year students in all Graduate Biomedical Sciences Themes take a common 12- week core curriculum emphasizing the fundamentals of biochemistry, genetics, and cell biology. This coursework will include an overview of the principles of biochemistry, metabolism, molecular biology, genetics and biological organization. This will be followed by an integrated course in experimental medicine that focuses on mechanisms that drive specific diseases and exposes students to approaches being taken by UAB scientists who are addressing disease- based problems. Additional coursework in the first year will include integrative physiology, pathophysiology, endocrinology, immunology, pharmacology and molecular medicine. Journal Club You will present relevant published research papers to help hone your presentation skills and to teach you to learn to think like a scientist. Seminar Series Faculty from participating departments, other UAB faculty, and faculty from other institutions discuss their latest research. Lab Rotations (3 rotations of 10 weeks each) Based on your specific interests, you will choose from a wide range of research laboratories available to you. This \"hands on\" research experience will provide you with the background to decide on a laboratory and mentor to guide you through your dissertation research. Second year and beyond - Qualifying examination, courses, journal clubs, research, completion of degree. Qualifying examination. Students must pass a Qualifying Examination that assesses their general knowledge, ability to read the literature, and ability to formulate and defend testable hypotheses. The examination involves a written proposal and oral defense of the proposal. Journal Clubs. From the second year until completion of the program, students participate in a Journal Club related to their specific area of interest. The purpose of the journal club is to enhance the ability to critically read the literature and to stay abreast of current findings in the field. Pathobiology and Molecular Medicine courses. Advanced courses in areas relevant to the student's area of interest are required and may be completed anytime from the second year on. Students are encouraged to take these courses as early as possible in order to achieve the most benefit in their training. Dissertation research. After completion of the Qualifying Examination, and no later than the third year, the student forms a dissertation committee comprised of five faculty members (including the mentor) whose expertise will be beneficial in helping direct the research and course of study. Awarding of the PhD degree. The PhD is awarded upon completion of the academic requirements and defense of the dissertation. The dissertation consists of a written document that is expected to include published papers or manuscripts in preparation, along with a scholarly introduction and discussion of the work that has been completed. A successful private defense of the dissertation in front of the dissertation committee is then followed by a seminar presentation and public defense of the dissertation as the final step in completion of the PhD degree. Student Support All students accepted into PBMM receive a competitive annual stipend and fully paid tuition and fees . Single coverage health insurance is also provided at no cost to the student through VIVA Health UAB. The annual stipend for the 2011 -2012 academic year is $26,000. The total annual award value, including stipend, tuition, fees and health insurance is $37,500. Stipends are reviewed and updated regularly. First-year students are funded through the PBMM Graduate Program by Graduate School Fellowships and occasionally by other national and University fellowships. In subsequent years, students are supported through their advisor's research grants, institutional funds or training grants. In addition, highly qualified students are encouraged to apply for individual fellowship awards, with the guidance of their advisors. See Fellowships and Awards for additional fellowship information and resources.

The program is a combination of the conventional work for the M.S. degree plus the achievement of proficiency in some phase of clinical dentistry. The course of study requires a minimum of two academic years; most students will require three years to complete the work. The applicant must be a graduate of an accredited school of dentistry and must have achieved, in both predental and dental requirements, a superior scholastic record. At the time of enrollment in the Graduate School, the student is assigned an appropriate faculty advisor, who works with the student in outlining a course of study consistent with objectives. This curriculum must cover the three areas of a selected phase of clinical dentistry, a related basic health science, and research. Major and Minor The major field of study must be selected from the following: dental biomaterials, endodontics, general dentistry, hospital dentistry, maxillofacial prosthetics, oral surgery, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, periodontics, prosthodontics, public health dentistry, or dental radiology. Not less than 18 semester hours of credit in the program must be in the major subject, with the minimum acceptable grade being B. A minor must involve at least six semester hours of study in one or two basic health science departments related to the student's major and research interests. By the time the student has been in residence one year and has finished some of both major and minor courses, the student and the advisor should recommend to the Graduate School dean at least two additional graduate faculty members, one from the minor area, for appointment to the graduate study committee. The student should discuss with this committee plans for the remaining course of study, including a proposed thesis title and outline of experimental design. Depending upon the nature of the research plan, it may be desirable for a different advisor to be appointed, serving either as co- chair or as new chair of the graduate study committee. At this time, demonstration of a reading knowledge of one foreign language, competence in biostatistics, experience with computer techniques, or other tools of research may be required, as appropriate to the student's investigation. Admission to Candidacy When the graduate study committee is satisfied that the student is prepared to undertake the research, the student is admitted to candidacy for the master's degree. This step should be taken at least three semesters before the anticipated date of completion of the program. Research and Thesis Sufficient research work to train the candidate in the principles and methods of scientific investigation is required. The research project should involve the student's own intensive work in some area of dentistry, preferably related to the basic health sciences. The thesis is based on the research study and must show the candidate's ability to delineate a problem, plan its solution, and present the results of the work in an orderly fashion. Familiarity with the literature of the field is expected. Final Examination The final oral examination is administered by the student's graduate study committee before the deadline is set by the Graduate School. The examination begins with oral presentation and defense of the thesis and may include any work fundamental thereto. At the close of the examination, the committee votes on the candidate, taking into account all of the work undertaken. Majority approval is required.

The objective of the program is to relate basic biological sciences to health and disease of the oral cavity. This program is designed for individuals holding a D.D.S., D.M.D., or B.S. in Science (e.g. biology, chemistry etc) with little or no experience in basic research. This program will provide insight into dental academics and teaching in basic or applied research. Students are required to pursue studies in oral biology and in the basic biological sciences. These studies include course work, seminars, journal club, and a laboratory component. Course work includes formal lectures from within the School of Dentistry and courses offered by the basic sciences departments, School of Public Health and the School of Medicine. The seminars include the \"Dean's Seminar Series\" and the Institute of Oral Health Research seminars. The Seminars cover a wide array of topics relevant to various research areas as well as other disciplines of dentistry or dental education. A significant portion of the program is devoted to the design and completion of a thesis research project in the form of one publishable paper in a reputable scientific journal which is a requirement of the program. Thesis research will be carried out under the supervision of a faculty member. Faculty involved in the Master of Science program with emphasis in Oral Biology are actively engaged in research that represents a variety of oral and basic b iomedical disciplines within the UAB. The diversity of the research interests offers opportunities for students to pursue studies in a stimulating research environment. The program requires a minimum of 30 graduate credits . Of these, at least 24 credits must be selected from graduate- level courses approved for the program and a minimum of 6 credits at the master's research level. Each student must orally defend a master's thesis based on their research. If the applicant holds a D.D.S. or D.M.D. degree, the Master in Science may be combined with a clinical dental specialty training only after acceptance into the clinical program. Admission Applicants must hold a B.S., D.D.S., or D.M.D., or an equivalent degree and should possess a cumulative grade- point average of at least 3.00 on a 4.00 scale. Standardized test such as GRE or DAT is required for all applicants. Students whose first language is not English must earn a score of 560 or better on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Applicants are asked to submit a statement describing past research experience and current research interests, and stating how completion of the Master in Science program fits into their career goals. For International applicant; transcripts and all related material should be received no later than February 28 to enroll in the fall semester of the same year. For US applicants; transcripts and all related material should be received no later than March 31 to enroll in the fall semester of the same year. Financial assistance is not available. Students must show that they can support themselves.

DMD/PhD Program Degree Offered: School of Dentistry DMD/PhD program prepares students for an exciting career in dental academics through an innovative integrated clinician scientist training program. Students in the program are allowed to apply credits earned in both dental and graduate school towards a specialized program earning both a DMD degree and a PhD degree in a biomedical science. Applicants interested in the DMD/PhD program must have completed an undergraduate degree program (BA or BS) that fulfills all requirements for both dental school and graduate school admissions. Students need to directly contact Dr. Steve Filler, Director of Admissions, UAB -School of Dentistry at 205.934.3387 or by email at admissions@cs1.dental.uab.ed . Separate applications are submitted to the UAB School of Dentistry and the UAB Graduate School (1530 3rd Avenue South, HUC 511, Birmingham, AL 35294-1150). UAB School of Dentistry participates in the American Association of Dental Schools Application Service (AADSAS). Students should initiate AADSAS applications as early as possible. Applications received by AADSAS after November 1 can cause a delay in the admission process. All Alabama applicants and those out -of-state residents, whose AADSAS applications indicate they can be given serious consideration, will be requested to file a supplemental DMD/PhD application. This form requests additional information that is not part of the AADSAS material and includes a photograph, a one page assay on the interest of the candidate in a dental academic research career, a pre- dental advisory committee evaluation if available, and three letters of recommendation from professors related to the applicant's interest in research or major field of study. A non- refundable $75 fee is required to file this supplemental application. This supplemental application, along with all transcripts, letters of recommendation and other specified documents, should be received by the School of Dentistry Admissions Office no later than December 1 for the upcoming year for which admission is sought. Applicant s whose credentials indicate they may qualify for admission will be invited for a personal interview with the Admissions Committee. Candidates will be evaluated based on their academic record, DAT scores, research accomplishments, commitment to a research career, character, and personality traits indicating potential for success in a DMD/PhD program. An acceptable interview makes the student eligible for participation in the program and for admission to the School of Dentistry DMD/PhD program. To be accepte d into the program, applicants must: 1) Contact Dr. Steve Filler at UAB School of Dentistry indicating intent to apply for the DMD/PhD program. 2) Submit a formal application to the UAB School of Dentistry through AADSAS. 3) Submit a formal application to the UAB Graduate School through the integrated program General Biomedical Sciences or an individual participating department e.g., Microbiology, Pathology, etc.) 4) Have successfully taken the Dental Aptitude Test (DAT). 5) Have completed all the recommended courses for both dental and graduate school admissions. Sequence of the DMD/PhD Program: 1) Completion of at least two years of graduate school coursework and requirements including graduate school qualification examinations and dissertation proposal defense maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least a 3.0 2) Receive a positive recommendation for transition into the dental school's curriculum by the DMD/PhD Advisory Committee Important Points: 1) Generally it is anticipated that the DMD and PhD degrees will be awarded within the same year upon completion of all dental and graduate school requirements 2) Duration of the program is expected to be 7.0 years; however students with strong prior research experience have completed the program in 6 years. 3) If a student is accepted into the DMD/PhD program and chooses not to complete the PhD training program, they will be required to re- apply to the School of Dentistry for admission as a traditional DMD candidate. Financial Support Opportunities: Students enrolled in the DMD/PhD training program are eligible for funding through an individual NIDCR supported F -30 Training Award. Detailed information about the F -30 grant application is available at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa -files/PAR -08-119.html The F30 grant program provides an annual student stipend of $25,000 per year (as of July 2010), a percentage of total tuition costs (60% of the allowable costs), health and dental insurance, and scientific meeting travel funds ($800). DMD/PhD Career Opportunities: Upon completion of the DMD/PhD program students may be qualified for additional post -doctoral training related to their research interests as well as a dental specialty program. Successful completion of the DMD/PhD program and post -graduate training could make the student a viable candidate for a faculty position in academic dentistry. The National Institute of Craniofacial and Dental Research (NIDCR) sponsors a number of institutional or individual grant award programs to provide funding for these types of additional training. Information about these programs can be found on the NIDCR webpage at http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/Funding/FundingMechanisms/default.htm Education: General Information General Information UAB's programs in education are fully approved by and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. Teacher certification programs within the School of Education have been approved by the Alabama State Board of Education. There are 13 graduate majors in the area of education; these are described in sections arranged alphabetically following this general information section. Degre es and Certificates Degrees are awarded by UAB in recognition of scholastic achievement and may be pursued for their own sake. However, employment in the public schools is governed not by the degree but by the professional certificate issued by the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE). Since many students in these programs are preparing for work in the public schools, the pursuit of a degree is usually coupled with pursuit of SDE certification. There is a rough correspondence between degree level and certification class, as follows: Degree Level Certification Class Bachelor's B Master's A Specialist (post - master's) AA Doctoral No Equivalent In spite of this correspondence, we emphasize that the admission and completion requirements for the degree and for the certificate are often significantly different. Furthermore, not all education students are pursuing SDE certification. Students seeking certification should verify requirements with an advisor or program director. State regulations governing certification change often; therefore, it is incumbent upon the student to seek advisement each term. Students should not register for any coursework without having first met with an advisor. Education: Curriculum and Instruction Chair: Dr. Lynn Education, M.A.Ed.) Art Education (M.A.Ed.)

At the master's level, students acquire core knowledge and clinical skills, which enable them to enter the profession of counseling. All counseling concentrations (Clinical Mental Health and School) are designed to meet the course- work and field experiences requirements for professional licensure in the State of Alabama. The School Concentration is accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP). The School Counseling Concentration meets the course work and field experiences required by the Alabama State Department of Education for certification. The Counselor Education program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham is accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP). The accreditation is through January 15, 2018. The Clinical Mental Health Counseling concentration, a 61 hour program, is currently accredited under the 2001 standards for Community Counseling program s as a Community Counseling program. The CACREP 2009 standards combine the Community Counseling and Mental Health Counseling standards into standards for Clinical Mental Health Counseling programs. The counseling program intends to seek accreditation for this program as a Clinical Mental Health Counseling program when it comes up for reaccreditation, per CACREP guidelines. Admission Process Consideration for admission to graduate study in counseling will occur each term The completed application packet must be received by the Counselor Education Program from the Graduate School by the dates shown: Term Deadline Fall June 1 Spring October 1 Summer April 1 Admission to graduate study in counseling is initiated through the Graduate School and all requir ed materials are to be submitted per specified instructions delineated by the Graduate School. Each applicant seeking admission to a counseling program concentration must include with the other required materials, a typewritten statement of professional purpose that reflects the applicant's background, development, pertinent work -related experience, professional career objectives and specified ways that completion of this program will contribute to his/her goal for becoming a professional counselor. Standardized Test Scores and GPA Requirements GPA 2.75 or better GRE 850 (combined score of verbal and quantitative) or, MAT 388 The application packet is reviewed by the Counselor Education faculty. Applicants deemed to have acceptable scores, strong references, appropriate statement of purposes, and grades will be invited for an interview that will include a group experience and a writing sample with the Counselor Education faculty. Applicants should not infer they have been admitted into the program if granted an admissions interview. Selection will be made by the Counselor Education faculty after reviewing the applicant's credentials in their entirety, and some candidates meeting minimum requirements may not be admitted. Candidates participating in the int erview may be given one of two decisions: a) admit, b) denied. Students are notified of their admission status following the interview. Non- Degree Seeking Students Potential students may take classes prior to admission to the Counselor Education Program as \"non- degree seeking\" students. However, non- degree seeking students are limited to 12 hours of coursework that may be transferred into the Counselor Education Program. Non- degree seeking students may enroll in elective courses with the permission of the instructor. It would be important for non- degree seeking students to make an advising appointment with a Counselor Education faculty member prior to enrolling in Area II courses as choices made could impact on future clinical placements. Non- degree seeking students are not permitted to take Area I counseling courses. It is also important to note that students taking coursework as a non -degree seeking student do so at their own risk. Enrolling and passing non- degree seeking coursework does not guarantee admission into the program as admission criteria (e.g., test scores, undergraduate GPA, and interview) are the primary factors considered when reviewing student suitability for the program Program Outcomes Students in the program are required to meet specific outcomes for the program. These outcomes involve knowledge, skills, and abilities. Outcomes are met when students pass critical \"high stakes\" assessments in the program. Failure to achieve the required outcomes will result in termination from the program . Evaluation of Candidates There are 7 Checkpoints in the assessment system for counseling candidates: Admissions, Course-based Assessments, Comprehensive Exams, Practicum, Internship, and Eligibility for Graduation/Certification. Evaluation of the couns elor-in-training is an on- going process. The faculty reserves the right to assess the candidate's appropriateness to be a professional counselor. Dispositions Counselor Education faculty individually review the professional dispositions (behaviors and attitudes) of students within each course in accordance with the School of Education's policy and procedure. Additionally, faculty will collectively review student dispositions and overall progress in the program at the end of each semester. Dispositional ar eas identified as deficient could result in termination from the program . Clinical Experience: Master's Level Upon admission, within the first semester of study, students in the school counseling concentration must submit to fingerprinting and a Background Review conducted by the Alabama State Department of Education at the student's cost. For information on the cost and how to complete this requirement, go to http://background.alabama.gov/. No school counseling student shall begin a clinical placement (P racticum or Internship in an education environment) in Alabama without a suitability letter from the Alabama State Department of Education demonstrating that the student's criminal background has been reviewed and cleared by the Department of Education. Mental Health counseling students are not required to submit to fingerprinting or a background review upon admission to the Counselor Education Program. However, mental health counseling students are required to complete clinical placements in order to ob tain the master's degree in counseling and many of the outside agencies/entities require fingerprinting and background reviews prior to accepting a student for clinical placement. For all counseling students, the appearance of one or more felonies and/or several misdemeanors on a student's background review may negatively impact placement potential and/or credential obtainment. Prerequisites for the clinical experience include successful completion of required coursework, meeting the required outcomes and competencies in Areas I and II, and successful completion of comprehensive exams.

Program The Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering prepares students for entry into the doctoral program, biomedical industry, or professional school. Primary research areas are biomedical imaging, biomedical implants and devices, cardiac electrophysiology, multiscale computational modeling, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Other research opportunities are available through our ongoing collaborations with the UAB Medical and Dental Schools. With the terminal degree, employment is usually found in health- care delivery, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, biomedical imaging, instrumentation, medical sales and marketing, regulatory agencies, or computer application groups. For admission to the program, a student should have earned a bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering, engineering or a closely related field. Students with undergraduate degrees in the physical sciences, life sciences, or mathematics will also be considered for admission; however, such students may be required to demonstrate competence in engineering areas usually found in an undergraduate engineering curriculum. In some cases, preparatory courses in mathematics, engineering or life sciences may be required, with specific recommendations made by the Biomedical Engineering (BME) Graduate Program Committee. Admission to the BME Master's program is competitive, and successful applicants will usually present scores of at least 156 on the verbal and at least 159 on the quantitative sections of the GRE General Test (equivalent to 550 and 750 under the previous scoring system).. Typical students have an undergraduate GPA of 3.5 or greater and have participated in at least one research project while an undergraduate (e.g., honors research, summer research experience, laboratory research, senior design, internship). The student's research advisor and the Graduate Program Committee work to devise an individualized curriculum developed to ensure each student obtains the coursework to provide an in- depth knowledge of both quantitative methods and human physiology necessary to succeed in completion of the thesis research. The master's degree requires a minimum of 24 semester hours of graduate coursework beyond the bachelor's. This includes: BME 517 Engineering Analysis, BME 670 Quantitative Physiology, three one- hour departmental seminar courses (BME 601), at least one 3- hour Biostatistics course. Additional coursework is a combination of graduate level life sciences and bioengineering courses selected in consultation with your thesis advisor and approved by the BME Graduate Program Committee. The majority of students carry out research leading to a thesis (plan I option). To receive a master's degree in BME, the student must publish their research in a peer -review journal article; typically a first - author public ation. The student is expected to present their research at a scientific or technical conference; preferably at a relevant national or international scientific meeting. Publication of at least one peer-reviewed manuscript is a requirement for graduation f rom the BME M.S.B.M.E. Program. Plan I students must register for at least six semester hours of BME 699 (thesis research) and successfully write, present and defend a thesis based on their research. Additionally, BME now offers a Master's in Biomedical Engineering with a Certificate in Life Sciences Entrepreneurship. This represents a unique graduate training program featuring collaboration between BME and the UAB School of Business. Biomedical engineering principles are blended with business - model planning in an effort to equip students to not only become scientists and researchers, but also capable business professionals. BME students partner with Business students pursuing an MBA to turn biomedical devices into commercial successes that are marketed w orldwide. They will participate in the Invention to Innovation (i2i) activities, in which they will pitch their start -up companies and enter business plan competition with the Alabama Launchpad ( http://www.alabamalaunchpad.com/ ). In addition to the BME course and thesis requirements, students in the MSBME with a Certificate in Life Sciences Entrepreneurship will take 12 credit hours of MBA coursework, including MBA 681: Idea to IPO; MBA 673: Technology -based V enture MBA 690: Managing Innovation; and MBA 691: The i2i Entrepreneur Accelerator Directed Independent Study. Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. degree prepares students for careers in industry and academics. Students entering the doctoral program will possess an M.S. or be currently enrolled in the D.M.D/Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D. program at UAB. Students earning an M.S. in BME and desiring to stay for the Ph.D. can petition the BME Graduate Program Committee upon successful defense of their M.S.B.M.E. Only Plan I M.S. students are considered for the Ph.D. program; these students do not have to reapply to the Graduate School, but instead petition the BME Graduate Program Committee. The decision is based on the student's academic record as well as recommendations from the student's M.S. thesis committee. Students who have earned a M.S. degree elsewhere may apply directly to the BME Ph.D. program. Admission to the Ph.D. program is competitive, and successful applicants will usually present scores of at least 156 on the verbal and at least 159 on the quantitative sections of the GRE General Test (equivalent to 550 and 750 under the previous scoring system).. Typical students have a graduate GPA of 3.5 or greater and have their previous research in a peer -review journa l. Students admitted to the Doctoral program typically receive a competitive stipend that usually includes payment of tuition. The Ph.D. degree requires a minimum of 18 semester hours of graduate coursework beyond the master's. This includes: BME 517 Engineering Analysis, BME 770 Quantitative Physiology, and at least one 3- hour Biostatistics course (BST 621) if not taken as part of the students master's program. One additional statistics course is strongly recommended for the Ph.D. degree (BST 621 and 622) . Additionally, Ph.D. students must complete three semester hours of Departmental Seminar (BME 701). At least 12 hours of Dissertation Research (BME 799) is required for the Ph.D. degree. Additional graduate level life sciences and/or bioengineering coursework may be required in conjunction with the student's dissertation research committee. The program of study for each student is defined by the student and the Research Advisor and approved by the Graduate Program Committee during the student's first year of doctoral study. Near the completion of the course plan, a written proposal for the dissertation research must be submitted and presented to the Dissertation Committee before the student can be admitted to candidacy for the degree. A dissertation that presents the results of the student's original research must be successfully defended. Ph.D. students are required to publish two additional manuscripts, typically first -author peer -review publications. Ph.D. students are required to present their research in a BME seminar near the end of their studies. Ph.D. students are expected to present their research at a relevant national or international scientific or technical conference meeting.

These test scores will be used primarily if an applicant fails to meet minimum standards for admission in good standing and is being considered for admission on probation. 1. Verification of registration by examination as a Professional Engineer (P.E.) will satisfy criteria 2, 3, and 4 above. M.S.C.E. Program Requirements The following minimum requirements apply to the plan of study for a student who has earned a baccalaureate degree in civil engineering. A student with an undergraduate degree in another field may also be accepted into the civil engineering program but will normally have to take additional preparatory coursework as part of an expanded plan of study. Continuous enrollment for at least 3 credit hours per term is required. Students receiving an assistantship are required to be enrolled as full -time students every semester. A full- time student is one who is enrolled in at least 9 credit hours per term. Enrollment in Civil Engineering Graduate Seminar (CE 641) is required at least once per academic year. Plan I (Thesis Option) 1. In addition to the general Graduate School requirements, the student must successfully complete at least 33 semester hours of graduate credit, including: (a) A minimum of 18 semester hours in civil engineering; (b) Up to 6 semester hours in disciplines outside civil engineering, such as other engineering disciplines, mathematics, biology, earth science, physics, urban affairs, or public health. (c) A minimum of 9 hours of CE 699 - Masters Thesis Research. 2. The student must pass a comprehensive examination on the content of the program. This examination may be written, oral, or both and shall include an oral defense of a thesis. Plan II (Nonthesis Option): Research/Design Emphasis 1. The student must successfully complete at least 33 semester hours of graduate credit including: a) A minimum of 24 semester hours in civil engineering; b) Up to 6 semester hours in disciplines outside civil engineering, such as; other engineering disciplines, mathematics, biology, earth sciences, physics, chemistry, or public health; and c) A minimum of 3 hours of CE 698 - Nonthesis Research under the direction of the graduate study committee chair, resulting in a committee approved written report. 2. The student must pass a comprehensive examination on the content of the program. This examination may be written, oral, or both and shall include an oral defense of the nonthesis research project. Areas of Specialization Specialization programs are available in the fields of environmental engineering, structural engineering/structural mechanics, construction engineering management; and transportation engineering. Supporting courses are offered in geotechnical engineering, optimization, engineering law and other areas. Enrollment in the Civil Engineering Graduate Seminar series (CE 641/741) is required of all graduate students at least once per academic year. Required Courses for Specialization in Environmental Engineering In addition to the M.S.C.E. program requirements, the following undergraduate classes (plus all associated prerequisites) are generally required of all M.S.C.E. students specializing in environmental engineering: CE 236 Environmental Engineering CE 337 Hydraulics CE 344 Civil Engineering Analysis CE 430 Water Supply and Drainage Design or CE 480 Water and Wastewater Treatment Require d Courses for Specialization in Structural Engineering/Structural Mechanics In addition to the M.S.C.E. program requirements, the following undergraduate classes (plus all associated prerequisites) are generally required of all M.S.C.E. students specializing in structural engineering/structural mechanics: CE 332 Soil Engineering CE 344 Civil Engineering Analysis CE 360 Structural Analysis CE 450 Structural Steel Design CE 455 Reinforced Concrete Design Required Courses for Specialization in Construction Engineering Management In addition to the M.S.C.E. program requirements, the following undergraduate classes (plus all associated prerequisites) are generally required of all M.S.C.E. students specializing in construction management.

Interdisciplinary Engineering (Ph.D) Concentrations offered: Computational Engineering, Environmental Health & Safety Engineering Faculty - Because of the interdisciplinary nature of this program, participating faculty come from various areas of engineering. A complete listing of all engineering faculty can be found at http://www.uab.edu/engineering/school -profile/fac -staff -dir. Program Objectives For more than a decade, research- focused centers at UAB and elsewhere have brought together expertise from many disciplines to solve problems. This same problem -solving approach is now finding its way into academic programs through the implementation of interdisciplinary graduate education. It is the premise of these interdisciplinary programs that students must be educated in more than one area to remain competitive and have successful careers whether they choose to stay in academia or work in industry. Industries are particularly interested in graduate education that emphasizes breadth of knowledge as well as depth in a particular field. Today's professional must be able to change, focus, and move between disciplines in order to keep up with rapid market shifts and technological advances. The Ph.D. program in Interdisciplinary Engineering takes advantage of unique resources and strengths at UAB. This program fosters interdisciplinary interactions between the School of Engineering and medical and biomedical units and the Schools of Business and Public Health and the College of Arts and Sciences. Students in Interdisciplinary Engineering will have the opportunity to develop a plan of study and research topic which incorporates course work and faculty expertise from two or more of these disciplines. The students enrolled in the Interdisciplinary Engineering Ph.D. program will gain the skills needed to succeed as independent and productive investigators in multidisciplinary analysis and design, with applications over a wide spectrum of science, engineering, health, and medical fields.

Jennings, Professor; Infectious Diseases. Kristopher Maday , Assistant Professor; Trauma Kelley Swatzell, Assistant Professor; Public Health General Information Physician Assistants (PAs) are valuable members of a multidisciplinary healthcare team. The profession was established in 1965 to help physicians provide healthcare services to underserved and rural populations. While the profession remains committed to its historical mission, PAs are now employed in almost all m edical and surgical specialties. PAs are healthcare professionals licensed to practice medicine under the supervision of a physician. Individual state practice laws and hospital bylaws define the scope of practice and prescribing authority of physician assistants. In general, most states authorize PAs to prescribe non- controlled substances and perform any task delegated by a supervising physician. To be eligible for licensure, PAs must graduate from an accredited physician assistant program and pass the P hysician Assistant National Certification Examination (PANCE). To maintain licensure, PAs must complete 100 hours of continuing medical education credits every two years and pass the Physician Assistant National Recertification Examination (PANRE) every six years. PAs may obtain additional training through postgraduate residency programs in subspecialty areas, but these programs are not required for licensure or practice in subspecialty areas. The mission of the UAB Surgical Physician Assistant Program is to provide qualified individuals with the knowledge, skills, and judgment needed to assist physicians in the care of patients in surgical, acute-care, and medical settings. While surgical physician assistants function under the direction of the physicians, they are capable of performing selected tasks autonomously. Accreditation: The Surgical Physician Assistant Program is accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, Inc. (ARC -PA). Credentials Conferred: Diplo ma-The Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies (MSPAS) degree is awarded by the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Professional Certification: Graduates of the UAB SPA program are eligible to take the Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam ination (PANCE) sponsored by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants to become a certified PA Essential Requirements Fundamental tasks, behaviors, and abilities necessary to successfully complete the academic and clinical requirements of the program and to satisfy licensure/certification requirementshave been outlined and are available upon request from the academic program office.

Since that time, the program has expanded considerably and offers diverse academic opportunities. Students have access to a number of faculty members from multiple disciplines who bring research and academic expertise to the study of aging and the aged. The Gerontology Education Program offers multidisciplinary academic courses in gerontology leading to a graduate certificate. The study of gerontology at these levels is designed to provide people educated in various disciplines with the background needed to work in programs related to aging and the aged. The main goals are to provide students with a thorough background in existing theory and research in gerontology, and a supplement to their existing backgrounds and professional disciplines. We have designed the program to prepare students for leadership roles in this field of growing importance for both the private and public sectors. Our program's curriculum integrates research, theory, and practice. Its multidisciplinary approach reflects the urban mission of UAB. The program office is located at the UAB Center for Aging. This academic program is administered by the Director of the Gerontology Education Program, who also serves as Chair of the Guidance Committee on Graduate and Undergraduate Education in Gerontology. This committee is made up of representatives of academic departments and schools throughout the UAB campus active in the study of aging and the aged. The multidisciplinary gerontology program is offered to all UAB students in good standing with the sponsorship and support of the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, the School of Health Related Professions, and the Center for Aging. Student Admissions and Advisement UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 571 Although general advisement is handled through UAB student advising and parent departments, student advisement in gerontology is handled formally by the Director of the Gerontolog y Education Program. The director facilitates student advisement with other members of the Committee on Graduate and Undergraduate Education in Gerontology. A graduate specialty is offered to students who want a special emphasis in gerontology or geriatrics. The major objective of this specialization is to provide a strong academic background for professional careers in academic and aging- related settings. There are two avenues for undertaking the graduate gerontology certificate requirements. Students in good standing in the graduate school can specialize in gerontology through their primary department. Letters of application also are accepted from students who have already completed requirements for an advanced or professional degree. Students not currently enrolled in a graduate program at UAB may petition the university for nondegree admission status. Once accepted, the student can undertake a course of study to receive a graduate certificate upon completion of the required sequence of classes. A careful review of proposed curriculum is recommended before the student enrolls for gerontology study. This will give students an opportunity to receive initial advisement while reviewing available study plans and course schedules. Requirements Students must complete at least 15 credit hours of graduate- level work in gerontology or geriatrics, achieving a grade of B or better in each course. The curriculum consists of a required multidisciplinary course offered through the graduate school (GRD 600), three gerontology electives chosen from a roster of courses approved by the Committee on Graduate and Undergraduate Education in Gerontology, and a required research project or a relevant internship. To ensure a multidisciplinary perspective, courses must represent at least two departments. Additional Information For detailed information, contact Dr. Patricia L.

General Information The Department of Biostatistics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is one of five departments in the School of Public Health: Biostatistics, Environmental Health Science, Epidemiology, Health Behavior, and Health Care Organization and Policy. Dr. Naomi Fineberg is the Chair of the department, Dr. Leslie McClure is the Director of Graduate Studies, and Della Daniel is the department liaison to the graduate program. The department currently has 24 faculty members, 56 full -time staff, and is organized into two sections: 1) The Section on Statistical Genetics (S SG), led by Dr. Hemant Tiwari and 2) The Section on Research Methods and Clinical Trials (RMCT), led by Dr. Gary Cutter. Members of the department conduct research in statistical methodology and applications, as well as in fundamental problems of modeling in biological systems. Much of the department's research is collaborative in nature involving projects from basic science, genetics, clinical medicine, public health, and other health- related areas, both within and outside of UAB. UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 657 Grant support for faculty in the department fall into four broad areas: 1) applied grants involving the application of statistical methods to health- related issues, 2) statistical coordinating centers for large multi- center randomized clinical trials, 3) methodological grants advancing statistical techniques, and 4) training grants for preparing the next generation of statisticians. The Department offers programs leading to the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Master of Science (MS), Master of Public Health (MPH), Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH), and a Certificate in Statistical Genetics (CSG). The MS and PhD degrees are offered through the Graduate School. The MPH and MSPH degrees are offered through the School of Public Health. MPH in Biostatistics The MPH degree in biostatistics is intended primarily for those who wish to acquire an MPH degree with an emphasis on statistical methodology. This can include individuals from decision- making positions in health care settings as well as those interested in data management, statistical analyses and interpretation, and presentation of analytical results. This degree can be completed in approximately 2 years. Note that the MPH does not require some of the theoretical courses required for the MS, and as such, it is not a direct route to prepare a student for a PhD. Students anticipating that they will wish to continue for a PhD in biostatistics are advised to pursue the MS rather than the MPH. All international students must demonstrate proficiency in spoken and written English before graduation, through the Graduate School's ESL Assessment. Dependent on the results of that assessment, the GPC may require additional course work in both written and/or oral English for students not showing proficiency upon arrival, or during any period of their graduate studies.

Outside Electives: A minimum of 3 graduate credit hours of electives must be taken from some field of Biology, Public Health or Medicine. The academic advisor must approve these courses. The MPH Non Coursework Requirements: The Internship As a student in the MPH program, you are required to complete three credit hours of an inter nship experience. The internship is a field experience which bridges professional academic preparation and public health practice. Knowledge and skills learned in coursework are applied in an agency setting under the supervision and guidance of an experienced public health specialist. You may check with the schools internship coordinator Emily Tubergen ( ejt3@uab.edu or 934- 7791) , or the school's website at www.soph.uab.edu/internships for internship opportunities. Faculty research projects are not appropriate venues for an internship, nor are positions which are primarily administrative or focused on data management. Registering for Internship E xperience Before the hold on the internship course can be lifted, we require that the internship description and agreement form is completed and on file. This form is to be completed in the online internship database Intern Track. You can log in to this program with your BlazerID and password at www.soph.uab.edu/interntrack . Your faculty advisor and site supervisor will also be required to sign off on this document, so it is important that you communicate with them as you complete the form, and do UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 659 not wait until the deadline to register. A hyperlink allowing you to formally request the hold to be lifted will become active once all the signatures are on file. You should register under your academic advisor for BST 697 - Internship in Biostatistics. For three credit hours, you are expected to spend a minimum of 240 hours during the 12 weeks working for the agency. The internship must be completed in one semester , and all hours must be completed by the last day of exams. You are required to complete your core course work before registering for internship hours. Credit cannot be applied retroactively to work you have done prior to registering for the internship. Students should feel free to contact the Graduate Program Director (Dr. McClure) or Internship Coordinator (Emily Tubergen) if they have any questions or problems during the summer. Grading and Requirements The internship is a pass/fail course. Your grade will be assigned by your faculty advisor based on the completion of all the components below. All forms related to the MPH internship will be completed in the InternTrack program. Internship Description and Agreement Form Midpoint Meeting Form, and confirmed meetings with the faculty advisor and site supervisor Final student evaluation Final student paper Completion of poster and attendance at the internship poster session Evaluations (Midpoint and Final) from the site supervis or Any additional product required by your internship site Midpoint meeting: You will be required to complete a midpoint form halfway through your internship. This is to prompt your reflection on the internship to that point, and steps to make the remainder of the internship a success. You will set up times to individually meet with your faculty advisor and site supervisor; use the midpoint form as a guide for your conversation. If you are not able to meet in person, discussions via telephone, email, or Skype will be accepted. Your faculty advisor and site supervisor will need to confirm the meeting took place in the Intern Track system. Internship Poster Session: At the end of the internship, prior to the end of exams for that semester, a poster session will be held to showcase the internships completed during that semester. You will receive additional instructions on creating your poster prior to the event. Attendance is mandatory, as it is a required component to the internship experience. Limited exceptions will be made for students completed internships out of the state or country or that are completing the MPH program online. UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 660 For complete internship requirements please check out the syllabus on the UAB School of Public Health website: https://www.soph.uab.edu/files/internship/InternshipSyllabus2011.pdf . MSPH in Biostatistics There is a growing interest in medical and other health science schools in developing the clinical research skills of faculty members and fellows. This interest has been fueled by increased support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to prepare such individuals to meet the demand for clinical investigators in the field. Locally, the Schools of Medicine and Public Health have combined efforts to create a training program for young faculty members and fellows from a variety of disciplines. This program is a post- medical or other health science degree training program, aimed primarily at fellows and faculty members interested in developing skills required for clinical research. It is anticipated that this academic training will supplement extensive training in the content area in which the student is trained, and senior mentoring in the politics and policies of project development and management. A graduate of this program will have the academic training to develop and lead independent research programs and projects. The program consists of a core set of courses common to all students, plus research elective and focus elective courses that reflect the academic interest of the student. At this time, the program can accommodate students with specific interest in biostatistics (CTBS), epidemiology (CTE), and health behavior (CTSH). As a result, there will be some variation in the specific knowledge and skills acquired by each graduate. However, the primary learning objectives will apply to all students, irrespective of departmental affiliation. As such, graduates will be able to do the following u pon completion of the program: design, conduct and evaluate clinical research studies; understand issues of data collection and study management; follow appropriate policies and procedures relating to the utilization of human subjects in clinical researc h; demonstrate an understanding of the ethics of research on human subjects; prepare competitive applications for extramural research funding; prepare manuscripts for publication in the scientific literature; and critically evaluate published research. Required Courses: MSPH in Biostatistics The MSPH in Clinical and Translational Science consists of a minimum of 41 credit hours. Of these, 14 hours are required, including 9 hours of specific Biostatistics courses and 5 hours of specific Epidemiology courses. Students then select at least 9 credit hours from a list of approved Masters UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 661 Research Electives, complete 9 hours of focus specific electives in Biostatistics, and take at least 9 hours of directed (698 level) Masters research to fulfill the MSPH requirement for conducting a research project. All international students must demonstrate proficiency in spoken and written English before graduation, through the Graduate School's ESL Assessment. Dependent on the results of that assessment, the GPC may re quire additional course work in both written and/or oral English for students not showing proficiency upon arrival, or during any period of their graduate studies.

The grading is on a Pass/No Pass basis. To earn a grade of Pass, students must attend a minimum of 80% of the lectures over two semesters and participate in all discussion for which they are present. [2] Care must be exercised when selecting these courses since some have prerequisites that must be taken earlier in the sequence of classes or taken concurrently. Biostatistics Electives: Minimum 9 credit hours of regular BST courses of 623 or higher -level. With approval of the advisor, courses included in the research electives that are not taken to meet that requirement may be taken as part of the focus specific electives. Masters Project Research: Minimum 9 credit hours of supervised research in clinical setting (BST 698). The MSPH Research Project The student, with the advice of his/her chosen MSPH project co- directors forms a small committee to guide the research project. The committee co- chairs should consist of a faculty member from Biostatistics and an MD with experience in the area of clinical research. Upon successful completion of the project, the student must submit a final write- up of the research. MS in Biostatistics The MS degree in Biostatistics is intended primarily for those who wish to acquire a master's degree with an emphasis in statistical methodology. Generally, students who anticipate a career performing data management and statistical analysis would enroll in the MS program. Further, the MS program is the appropriate program to prepare students to enter the PhD. Succ essful completion of this degree requires a GPA of 3.0 or better, passing the comprehensive examination at the MS level, completion of a master's project under the direction of an advisor with committee approval, and oral and written defense of this projec t. UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 663 All international students must demonstrate proficiency in spoken and written English before graduation, through the Graduate School's ESL Assessment. Dependent on the results of that assessment, the GPC may require additional course work in both written and/or oral English for students not showing proficiency upon arrival, or during any period of their graduate studies. Required Courses: MS in Biostatistics Biostatistics Core: BST 621 Statistical Methods I 3 Credit hours BST 622 Statistical Methods II 3 Credit hours BST 623 General Linear Models 3 Credit hours BST 626 Data Management / SAS 3 Credit hours BST 631 Statistical Theory I 4 Credit hours BST 632 Statistical Theory II 4 Credit hours BST 655 Categorical Data Analysis 3 Credit h ours BST 691 Biostatistics Predoctoral Seminar Series 4 Credit hours Biostatistics Electives: Minimum 6 credit hours of regular courses of 624 or higher -level. For those students planning to go on for the Ph.D., it is a good idea to take more advanc ed biostatistics courses as electives. Outside Requirement: EPI 610 Principles of Epidemiological Research (or another comparable course in Epidemiology) 4 Credit Hours Outside Electives: A minimum of 3 additional graduate credit hours of electives mus t be taken from a non -quantitative field (i.e. Biology, Public Health or Medicine). The academic advisor must approve these courses. Upon completion of the first year -and-a- half of course work, the candidate is given a written examination consisting of tw o parts - Applied Statistics and Theory of Statistics. The exam will test the students on their understanding and comprehension of the foundation of the theory and applications of statistics, and will generally cover materials from BST 621, 622, 623, 626, 631, 632 and 655. This will be a standard departmental exam, administered by the Graduate Program Committee (GPC). The criteria for evaluation UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 664 are the candidate's understanding and competency in basic principles and foundations of biostatistics, understand ing of the appropriate use and interpretation of statistical methods, and ability to succinctly express in writing the results of the problems. This examination is offered during the first half of January. At first attempt, a student must take both parts at the same time. For those years during which at least one student needs to take the exam a second time, the exam may be offered in July at the discretion of the GPC. Students must be registered for at least 3 semester hours of graduate work during the semester in which the comprehensive examination is given. The student must pass each part of the exam at the Masters level. If a student fails either part of the exam, one additional chance will be given to retake the part of the exam that was failed. A student who fails the qualifying exam more than once will be dismissed from the MS program. The student has the opportunity to appeal the decision of his/her dismissal. The Graduate School policies on dismissal from the program and appeal of dismissal ar e described in detail in the UAB Student Handbook. The MS Project Immediately after passing the MS Comprehensive examination, the student must form a research project committee consisting of at least 3 members, chaired by the research advisor. Upon succes sful completion of the project, the student must submit a final write- up of the research and present their work orally in a departmental seminar. It is strongly suggested that the write- up is such that it may lead to an article submitted for publication in the subject matter area. The date and time of the oral presentation will be advertised in the Ryals Building. PhD in Biostatistics The PhD degree in biostatistics provides a balance between theory and application. In addition to providing students with an in- depth understanding of statistical theory and methodology, the main objectives of the program are to train students to become independent researchers, effective statistical consultants and collaborators in scientific research, and effective teachers . All international students must demonstrate proficiency in spoken and written English before graduation, through the Graduate School's ESL Assessment. Dependent on the results of that assessment, the GPC may require additional course work in both written and/or oral English for students not showing proficiency upon arrival, or during any period of their graduate studies. Required Courses: PhD in Biostatistics All students entering the PhD program are required to complete the coursework required for the M S degree. It is possible for a student entering the graduate program with an MS degree in statistics or biostatistics from another institution to waive up to 12 credit hours of coursework at the discretion of the UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 665 GPC. It will be the student's option whether to actually obtain the MS degree, but the department strongly encourages them to do so, since the completion of the MS project is very good research experience and may lead to a publication. PhD students are required to take the following courses: Biostatistics Core: BST 621 Statistical Methods I 3 Credit hours BST 622 Statistical Methods II 3 Credit hours BST 623 General Linear Models 3 Credit hours BST 626 Data Management / SAS 3 Credit hours BST 631 Statistical Theory I 4 Credit hours BST 632 Statistical Theory II 4 Credit hours BST 655 Categorical Data Analysis 3 Credit hours BST 691 Biostatistics Predoctoral Seminar Series 6 Credit hours BST 723 Theory of Linear Models 3 Credit hours BST 735 Advanced Inference 3 Credit ho urs BST 760 Generalized Linear and Mixed Models 3 Credit hours BST 765 Advanced Computational Methods 3 Credit hours Biostatistics Electives: Minimum 12 credit hours of 624 or higher -level regular courses, including at least 9 hours of 700 level c ourses. Outside Requirement: EPI 610 Principles of Epidemiological Research 4 Credit Hours Outside A minimum of 3 additional graduate credit hours of electives must be taken from a UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 666 Electives: non-quantitative field (i.e. Biology, Public Health or Medicine). The academic advisor must approve these courses. Readings & Research: Students are strongly recommended to take Research in Statistics (BST 698) under various faculty members every semester after completion of the first -year equivalent of c ourse work, until a research advisor is chosen. PhD Qualifying Exam Upon completion of the first year -and-a- half of course work, the candidate is given a written examination consisting of two parts - Applied Statistics and Theory of Statistics. The exam will test the students on their understanding and comprehension of the foundation of the theory and applications of statistics, and will generally cover materials from BST 621, 622, 623, 626, 631, 632 and 655. This will be a standard departmental exam, administered by the GPC. The criteria for evaluation are the candidate's understanding and competency in basic principles and foundations of biostatistics, potential for conducting independent research in statistical methods, and ability to express in writing the results of the problems. This examination is offered during the first half of January. At first attempt, a student must take both parts at the same time. For those years during which at least one student needs to take the exam a second time, the exam may be offered in July at the discretion of the GPC. Students must be registered for at least 3 semester hours of graduate work during the semester in which the comprehensive examination is given. The student may pass each part of the exam at the PhD level, fail at the PhD level but pass at the Master's level, or fail at the Masters level. If a student fails to pass either part of the exam at the PhD level, one additional chance will be given to retake the part of the exam that was failed. A student wh o fails the qualifying examination more than once will be dismissed from the PhD program. The student has the opportunity to appeal the decision of his/her dismissal. Graduate School policies on dismissal from the program and appeal of dismissal are described in detail in the UAB Student Handbook. PhD Dissertation Research After forming a graduate committee, the student should present and prepare a written proposal to their committee for suggestions/approval. The whole committee must approve the proposal , not just the advisor. This is to ensure that the work is novel, feasible, and significant. The word \"novel\" here is important. A dissertation must add to the body of knowledge in biostatistics, meaning that a careful review of the existing literature on the chosen subject is necessary. It would be very unfortunate to get to the last stages of your work and to have someone suddenly point out to you that it had already been done! During the early stages of the research, it may be useful for the student to register for readings UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 667 courses (BST 798) under the direction of the research advisor. The purpose of such courses is to review the literature for the research area of interest in order to help the student formulate a research problem. After a literature survey and a clearer definition of the scope of the proposed research under the direction of the advisor, the student must submit a written proposal and present it orally to the dissertation committee . The dissertation proposal is closed to the general public and should be attended only by the dissertation committee. The committee may approve unconditionally, approve conditionally, or disapprove the proposal. The oral presentation also represents the oral doctoral candidacy exam. As such, a student is expected to demonstrate a good understanding of materials relevant to the general field in which the dissertation is written. The format of the questions for the proposal is left to the discretion of the committee. The outline and the organization of the proposal must follow the graduate school requirements described in the UAB Graduate Student Handbook. The Dissertation Committee and the Graduate Program Director will recommend the student to the Graduate School Dean for admission to candidacy. The committee meeting at which candidacy is discussed must be scheduled through the Graduate School to allow the Dean to attend. If the proposal is not approved, the student may be given only one other opportunity to re- present the proposal and it must be done within six months of the first attempt. You must be registered for at least 3 hours in the semester in which you present your project proposal to your committee. Once the student has (1) passed the qualifying exam at the doctoral level, (2) written a formal di ssertation proposal, and (3) had the dissertation proposal approved by the dissertation committee as an acceptable proposal for research, the committee will recommend to the Dean of the Graduate School that the student be admitted to candidacy. This requires that the student file an \"Admission to Candidacy\" form with the Graduate School. A student must be in good academic standing to be admitted to candidacy. Admission to candidacy must take place at least two semesters before the expected completion of the doctoral program. Students must be admitted to candidacy before they can register for dissertation research hours (BST 799). PhD Final Exam After the student has completed all formal requirements for the PhD degree, the dissertation committee administers the final oral examination. The final examination should take the form of a presentation and defense of the dissertation, followed by an examination of the candidate's comprehensive knowledge of the field. This examination must be scheduled through the Graduate School to allow attendance of the Dean. The defense must be announced at least 2 weeks in advance. It is the responsibility of the student to schedule the defense at a time convenient to all parties involved. A preliminary copy of the dissertation must be submitted to the dissertation committee for approval at least two weeks prior UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 668 to the defense, unless otherwise approved in advance by the dissertation committee. The meeting must be open to all interested parties, publicized on the UAB campus, published in the UAB Reporter, and must take place at least 30 days before the expected date of graduation. Candidates must be registered for at least 3 semester hours of Dissertation Research (BST 799) during the semester in which the final examination is taken. The dissertation committee will evaluate the student's performance in the final exam. In order for the student to pass, all of the committee or all but one member of the committee must pass the student in the final exam. Upon approval by the committee and the Graduate Program Director, the result of the final exam should be forwarded to the Graduate School Dean for approval. Final copies of the dissertation after final approval of the committee, including any changes required by the committee, must be submitted to the Dean within two weeks following successful completion of the defense. Please see the Graduate Student Handbook for various deadlines and further details. Upon satisfying all requirements, the dissertation committee and the Graduate Program Director will recommend the student to the Graduate School Dean for the doctoral degree. Admission Students in the Graduate program are admitted in the Fall semester of each academic year. Applicants for the MS and PhD programs are expected to have a strong foundation in Mathematics. At the very minimum, they should have had a 3- semester sequence of calculus or equivalent and a semester of advanced matrix algebra. With few exceptions, applicants to the PhD must have a relevant MS degree. The MPH applicants should also be quantitatively oriented with background in calculus and linear algebra. Application requirements include completion of the online application form, a non- refundable application fee, official transcripts from all undergraduate coursework and all prior graduate coursework, (International transcripts must be submitted to World Education Services (WES) or Educational Credential Evaluators (EC E) for an official course- by-course credential evaluation; document -by-document evaluations will not suffice), three letters of recommendation (submitted online), a statement of purpose, and Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores. International applica nts for whom English is not their first language are also required to submit TOEFL scores. Please note that the department has an ongoing admissions process that begins in February. Thus, it is recommended that prospective students submit completed applications as early as possible (specifically if financial support is desired). Minimum admission requirements include: a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university, a score of 156 (146 for MPH) on the verbal and 146 on the quantitative sections of the newly revised GRE exam. GRE exams taken prior to August 1, 2011, a minimum score of 1100 on the combined verbal and UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 669 quantitative sections, with a verbal score of at least 550 (400 for MPH) and a quantitative score of at least 550, a score of 3.5 on the analytic section of the GRE test, and an undergraduate grade point average of 3.0 or better (on a 4.0 scale). The department also requires a TOEFL score of at least 250 (600 on the old scale) for all international students whose native language is not English. Financial Support Unfortunately, the department is not able to guarantee funding for all students. However, there are many on-campus part -time employment opportunities with ongoing research projects across campus that are available to qualified students with experience in statistical analysis. Within reason, the department will work with all students in order to assist them with finding a funding source for their studies. Fellowships, Traineeships, and/or Assistantships are awarded to well -qualified students. The financial support of a fellowship or traineeship typically consists of (i) an annual stipend of $22,032 paid over 12 months, and (ii) tuition, fees, and health insurance paid by the department directly to your student account. The financial support of an assistantship typically consists of (i) an annual stipend of $21,000 paid over 12 months, and (ii) $7,000 additional funds to assist with tuition and etc. (paid as additional salary to the student in two installments in August and January, $3,500 each month). The financial support is intended to help full -time students in the graduate program. Accordingly, (i) students must register as a full -time student in approved graduate courses each semester (9 hours fall, 9 hours spring, 3 hours summer) and (ii) students may not engage in any other remunerated activities either on or off campus (exceptions to this rule are rare and require prior approval in writing). In order to continue receiving financial support students must remain in good standing, continue making satisfactory progress towards their degree, and perform their work in a satisfactory manner. Should the faculty responsible for the funding source determine that a student fails to meet any of these criteria, he/she forfeits the award. A research assistantship requires the student to devote approximately 20 hours per week average effort on research/teaching projects under the supervision of a faculty mentor. Students must be enrolled full - time in order to maintain a research assistantship. This requires the student to take at least 9 credit hours of coursework during the regular semesters and at least 3 credit hours of coursework during the summer. Assistantship appointments are typically for one year at a time. A student fellowship does not require any work effort, but requires the student to register for a greater number of credit hours each semester. A student on Fellowship is required to take 9 credit hours of coursework during the regular semesters and 6 credit hours during the summer semester. The department currently has one NIH -funded T32 doctoral training grant. This appointment carries special distinction, is an honor to have, offers certain privileges, and also confer certain obligations. UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 670 Trainees are required to pursue their research training on a full -time basis, devoting at least 40 hours per week to the program. This minimum of 40 hours includes both classroom studies and their research. All new trainees will receive: 1) \"On Being a Scientist\" published by the National Academy of Sciences, and 2) a selected list of references on ethical conduct of research. Trainees are expected to review these materials. All trainees must complete and maintain IRB training/certification, complete and maintain IACUC training /certification (if they work with animal studies), complete the Principles of Scientific Integrity course (GRD 717), and complete university diversity training. Trainees are expected to attend all departmental seminars, journal clubs, and grant writing clubs, except when those activities interfere with classes. Trainees are also expected to attend and ideally present their work at one conference each year. Funds are available for this. Additional funds are usually available to allow trainees to attend at least one continuing education workshop outside of UAB each year. The department holds all T32 students to a very high standard. The purpose of the T32 training grants is to train future independent scientists, that is, individuals that can direct their own research programs. Trainees are expected to work actively with a faculty mentor on research projects, with the expectation of co- authoring publications. All trainees must meet with the T32 program directors twice annually (and additionally as requested) in order to review progress.

Total Credit Hours Required for Degree 42 MSPH in Clinical and Translational Science There is a growing interest in medical and other health science schools in developing the clinical research skills of faculty members and fellows. This interest has been fueled by increased support from the NIH to prepare such individuals to meet the demand for clinical investigators in the field. Locally, the Schools of Medicine and Public Health have combined efforts to create a training program for young faculty members and fellows from a variety of disciplines. This program is a post -medical or other health science degree training program, aimed primarily at fellows and faculty members interested in developing skills required for clinical research. It is anticipated that this academic training will supplement extensive training in the content area in which the student is trained, and senior mentoring in the politics and policies of project development and management. A graduate of this program will have the academic training to develop and lead independent research programs and projects. The program consists of a core set of courses common to all students, plus research elective and focus elective courses that reflect the academic interest of the student. At this time, the program can accommodate students with specific interest in Biostatistics (CRBS), Epidemiology (CTE) , and Health Behavior (CRHB). As a result, there will be some variation in the specific knowledge an skills acquired by each graduate. However, the primary learning objectives will apply to all students, irrespective of departmental affiliation. As such , graduates will be able to do the following upon completion of the program: design, conduct, and evaluate clinical research studies understand issues of data collection and study management follow appropriate policies and procedures relating to the ut ilization of human subjects in clinical research demonstrate an understanding of the ethics of research on human subjects prepare competitive applications for extramural research funding prepare manuscripts for publication in the scientific literature critically evaluate published research Admission: Applicants should possess a medical or other health science professional degree. They may be in their final years of training as residents or fellows or hold positions as junior faculty members. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required for applications to all MSPH programs in the School of Public Health. The GRE may be waived at the discretion of the committee, for applicants who have been pre- screened by the clinical investigator training grant committee of the School of Medicine. The applicant must produce three letters of reference and a letter stating that he/she will be guaranteed sufficient release time from clinical duties to be able to attend classes regularly and fulfill course requirements in a timely manner. A medical/health sciences mentor should be identified and a setting where the student can gain experience in conducting clinical research.

Health Behavior MPH and PhD students use theories and methods from the social and behavioral sciences to develop programs that encourage adopting healthy behaviors. They learn state- of-the-art techniques and methods for research and program evaluation, and doctoral students study these topics in depth as they apply their knowledge and skills to conducting research and writing funding proposals and manuscripts. Many students are involved in faculty research projects concerning a broad range of health problems including infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases), tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use, obesity, aging, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and intentional or unintentional injuries. Career Opportunities Demand for qualified behavioral scientists and health education specialists continues to increase with the current national focus on preventive care. Graduates of our master's degree programs are typically employed in public and private agencies at the local, state, and national levels such as health departments, health care institutions, and health- related outreach and non- profit agencies. They work to develop, implement, and evaluate health promotion and disease prevention programs. Graduates of our doctoral program go on to research and service careers in academic settings or public agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health Behavio r MPH Learning Objectives The objectives of the MPH in Health Behavior are: \u00b7 Understand and apply social and behavioral science theories as they relate to public health; \u00b7 Review and critically evaluate the existing health education and behavior li terature; \u00b7 Develop valid and reliable theory -based assessment tools; UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 715 \u00b7 Develop, implement, evaluate and disseminate health promotion and disease prevention programs; and \u00b7 Gain the professional experience and expertise with the goal to protect the in public's health. MPH in Health Behavior (HB) The Master of Public Health program in health behavior is the basic public health professional degree in social and behavioral science. Students in this track take 44 -47 credit hours. The number of credit hours is determined before admission based on students' education and professional experience. Full- time students can generally complete the program in four to five semesters depending on number of credit hours needed. Students in the MPH in Heal th Behavior are taught methods to identify and understand factors that affect behaviors related to personal and community health and to develop and evaluate intervention programs that promote healthy lives. Students are required to complete an internship. The internship is three credit hours and takes place following the completion of core course work. Admission: Applicants should have a strong academic record and meet the minimum requirements for admission to the School of Public Health. Curriculum: In addition to the MPH core requirements, students take 9 hours of health behavior track courses, 9 hours of electives, 4-7 hours of SOPH requirements, and a 3 hour internship.

MSPH Clinical Research In response to interest in medical and other health science schools in developing the clinical research skills of faculty members and fellows, the Schools of Medicine and Public Health have combined efforts to create a training program for young faculty members and fellows from a variety of disciplines. This program is a post -medical or other health science degree training program, aimed primarily at fellows and faculty members interested in developing skills required for clinical research. It is anticipated that this academic training will supplement extensive training in the content area in which the enrollee is trained, and senior mentoring in the politics and policies of project development and management. A graduate of this program will have the academic training to develop and lead independent research programs and projects. The program consists of a core set of courses common to all students, plus research elective and focus elective courses that reflect the academic interest of the student. Graduates will be able to do the following upon completion of the program: UAB Graduate Catalog 2013 720 design, conduct, and evaluate clinical research studies; understand issues of data collection and study management; follow appropriate policies and procedures relating to the utilization of human subjects in clinical research; demonstrate an understanding of the ethics of research on human subjects; prepare competitive applications for extramural research funding; prepare manuscripts for publication in the scientific literature; and critically evaluate published research. Admission: Applicants should possess a medical or other health science professional degree. They may be in their final years of training as residents or fellows or hold positions as junior faculty members. Applicants must meet the minimum requirements for admission into the School of Public Health. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required for applications to all MSPH programs in the School of Public Health. The GRE may be waived at the discretion of the committee, for applicants who have been pre-screened by the clinical investigator training grant committee of the School of Medicine. The applicant must produce three letters of reference and a letter stating that he/she will be guaranteed sufficient release time from clinical duties to be able to attend classes regularly and fulfill course requirements in a timely manner. A medical/health sciences mentor should be identified and a setting where the student can gain experience in conducting clinical research. A faculty member within the School of Public Health will be assigned as an advisor based on the stated interests of the applicant. Curriculum: The MSPH in Clinical Research consists of a minimum of 41 credit hour s. Of these, 14 hours are required, including 9 hours of specific biostatistics courses and 5 hours of specific epidemiology courses. Students then select at least 9 credit hours from a list of approved Masters Research electives, complete 9 hours of focus specific electives in Health Behavior, and take at least 9 hours of (698 level) Masters Research to fulfill the MSPH requirement for conducting a research project.

The Graduate School staff is always available to answer your questions and provide assistance, but you will find that many of your questions about the policies and procedure s surrounding important milestones in your graduate career are answered in the pages that follow. The policies that are reprinted here are those that are most pertinent to graduate students. They address specific aspects of academic performance, academic and non - academic conduct, and student responsibilities . UAB students are expected to be familiar with these policies and to abide by them. Failure to do so may impede a student's progress or may result in disciplinary action and, in some cases, dismissal. Other policies printed below address UAB's responsibilities to its students. All policies are subject to revision. Students are advised to consult the UAB Polices and Procedures Library at http://sppublic.ad.uab.edu/policies/Pages/default.aspx for the most current versions of these and other UAB policies. The Graduate Council The Graduate Council is comprised of all graduate program directors. The Graduate Council Advisory Committee is a subset of these program directors who have been designated by their school deans to serve in an advisory capacity to the Graduate School Dean. The Graduate Council Advisory Committee has developed polici es and procedures to ensure that high standards for graduate study are maintained at UAB. These policies and procedures are available at the Graduate School's Web site ( http://www.uab.edu/graduate/graduate -catalog/72 - policies -and-procedures ). The Graduate Council Advisory Committee , through consultation with the D ean, is responsible for developing academic requirements and describing these requirements thr ough appropriate policies. The Dean, through consultation with the Graduate Council, is responsible for developing procedures that effectively enforce academic requirements and implement policies. The Advisory Committee reviews new graduate program or certificate proposals, academic requirements, policies, procedures, and Graduate School activities . The committee recommends and approves appropriate changes. Changes in academic requirements and related policies require a majority vote of the Advisory Committee . The Graduate Faculty Graduate faculty membership may be granted by the Dean of the Graduate School to faculty members who demonstrate a high level of competence in teaching and scholarship. Graduate faculty membership is required (a) of all individuals teaching courses for graduate credit and (b) of members of graduate study committees. A complete listing of the graduate faculty can be found on the Graduate School Web site ( http://www.uab.edu/graduate/faculty/gradfaclist ).

UAB Graduate Career Awareness and Trends (GCAT) The UAB GCAT, previously called the Industry Roundtable, is sponsored by the UAB Graduate School . The GCAT is a student -initiated and student- run informal discussion group open to all graduate students and dedicated to fostering a greater awareness of career opportunities outside academia. Its goals are to provide a forum for networking with industry representatives; establish an interface between academia and industry; introduce students to the process of making indus try contacts; encourage students to comment, ask questions, and seek advice from nonacademics; stimulate students to begin career development early in their educational experience; and provide information to students about career opportunities outside acad eme. More information regarding the GCAT can be found at http://main.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=47488 . Graduate Student Research Days Graduate Student Research Days (GSRD) is an annual competition in which graduate students present their original research in an open forum. Deadlines for submitting abstracts and presentations for GSRD are announced at the beginning of spring semester and are available at the GSRD Web site (www.uab.edu/graduate/researchday ). Awards are presented at the Graduate School Awards Luncheon ceremony each spring semester. General Academic Requirements Categories of Graduate Student Two broad categories of graduate students are recognized: degree- seeking and nondegree -seeking. Degree- Seeking Students Degree- seeking graduate students are those accepted into a specific graduate program to work toward a specific advanced degree. In add ition to the completed online application , the application procedure includes the submission of official transcripts, standardized test scores, and letters of recommendation. Each application is reviewed by the graduate program faculty, who make an admissi ons recommendation to the Graduate School Dean or a representative of the G raduate Dean . Nondegree -Seeking Students The nondegree category serves students who do not wish to pursue a graduate degree at UAB, as well as those who wish to begin graduate study before being admitted to a degree program. Not all graduate courses are open to nondegree -seeking graduate students. Although there is no limit to the number of credit hours that may be earned as a nondegree- 5 seeking student, should a student later wish to pursue an advanced degree at UAB, the credit earned while in nondegree -seeking status is not automatically acceptable toward the degree. In no case can more than 12 semester hours earned as a nondegree graduate student be applied toward an advanced degr ee at UAB . Because of U.S. immigration requirements, international applicants (i.e., those who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents) cannot normally be considered for the nondegree category unless already residing in the United States. Immigr ation laws should be consulted to determ ine eligibility of international students. Unless otherwise stated, the policies in this section apply to both degree -seeking and nondegree - seeking graduate students. Information on applications for admissions can be found on the Graduate School Web site ( http://www.uab.edu/graduate/area- 3/prospective - students ) and in the Graduate Catalog. Special Conditions of Admission Admission with Contingencies Students lacking a limited number of specific qualifications may be admitted to graduate programs contingent on completion of those qualifications within a specified period of time. Students are informed of specific requirements for continued enrollm ent and the time allowed for completion at the time of admission. Failure to meet the requirements during the stipulated time may result in dismissal. Admission of Students Previously Dismissed When any individual applies to a graduate program, a major part of the admissions decision involves an estimate, based on the applicant's academic history, of whether the applicant can perform satisfactorily at the graduate level. To be readmitted, applicants who have previously been dismissed from the Graduate School based on unsatisfactory academic performance must present convincing evidence to the faculty and the Graduate School Dean that a substantial improvement has occurred so that it is probable that the applicant can now perform at the required level in gr aduate work. Readmission The records of students , who have not registered for courses for one year or more, will be removed from the UAB computerized registration system. Such students must apply for readmission before they may register again. Degree -seeking students who (1) were admitted to a UAB Graduate Degree -Seeking Program within the last five years, and (2) have not registered for courses for one academic year (3 semesters) or more BUT have registered for and successfully passed at least one graduate course at UAB after being admitted to a UAB Graduate Degree- Seeking Program, and (3) have not attended any other university or college in the interim, and (4) wish to return to the graduate program to which he or she was earlier admitted, must fill out the Application for Readmission to Graduate Degree Program form and pay the appropriate fee. These readmitted students must meet the degree requirements operative at the time of readmission. Students who wish to return to the nondegree category after an absence of one or more years must submit a new nondegree online application , together with the required processing fee. These forms can be obtained online at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/online -forms . Faculty To maintain university accountability, UAB faculty and staff who wish to take occasional graduate courses must register for these courses after admission to the Graduate School i n the nondegree - seeking basis. Admission of a UAB faculty member as a degree- seeking graduate student requires the concurrence of the applicant's department chair and dean (s), as well as the approvals required for other applicants to the same program. For more informatio n regarding Educational Assistance, visit the UAB Human Resources Web page at http://www.hrm.uab.edu/main/index.html Graduate Credit For purposes of academic accounting, credits expressed in \"semeste r hours\" are assigned to each course. The guideline for lecture courses is that one semester hour of credit is awarded for 13- 15 contact hours. Laboratory credit is assigned on the basis of one semester hour of credit for approximately 30 hours of work in the laboratory. Undergraduates Seeking Enrollment UAB undergraduate students may be allowed to enroll in a graduate course with the approval of their advisor, the course instructor, their undergraduate program director, and the graduate program director. The Undergraduate Student Request for Enrollment in Graduate Level Coursework form can be obtained online ( http://w ww.uab.edu/graduate/online -forms ). Credits earned by undergraduate students may be applied to either an undergraduate degree or a graduate degree, but not both. If the student is subsequently admitted to the Graduate School, use of this credit toward a gra duate degree requires the approval of the graduate program director and the Graduate School Dean . Course Numbering System The scholastic level of UAB courses is indicated by the century number. Courses numbered 500 and above are graduate and post baccal aureate courses. Courses numbered 500- 599 are available to upper - level undergraduate and beginning graduate students. Courses numbered 600 and above are for graduate students. Those numbered 600 -699 are intended 6 primarily for students at the master's level, with 698 reserved for nonthesis research and 699 reserved for thesis research. Courses numbered 700 -799 are primarily for students at the doctoral level, except in the School of Education where the numbers from 700-729 are reserved for courses leading to the degree of Educational Specialist (Ed.S.). The number 798 is reserved for nondissertation research and 799 for dissertation research. Seminars, practica, individual studies and projects, internships, and residencies will generally carry numbers in the upper range of these centuries. Time Limitations Graduate students are generally expected to complete all degree requirements with 5 years of matriculation for master's and 7 years of matriculation for doctoral students . One extension of these time limits can be requested when mitigating circumstances preclude completion of requirements within 5 years (master's) or 7 years (doctoral). The request for an extension should include a plan and timeline for completion. Such requests require the approval of the student's dissertation committee and graduate program director and must be presented in writing to the Dean of the Graduate School for consideration and approval. Courses taken more than 5 years (master's) or 7 years (doctoral) before graduation may not be applied toward a degree without the approval of the graduate program director and Graduate Dean. Leave of Academic Absence A graduate student may request a leave of academic absence. The request for a leave of academic absence may not exceed one (1) academic year. The Request for Leave of Academic Absence form can be found at the Graduate School Web site ( http://www.uab.edu/graduate/images/ acrobat/forms/l eaveofabsence.pdf ). The request must be approved by the student's graduate program director and Graduate School Dean . Before a student can return from an approved leave of academic absence, the graduate program director must submit to the Gr aduate School a request to allow the student to re- enroll in courses. Course Enrollment Registration Students must register for all work to be taken for graduate credit. To be classified as \"full -time,\" a graduate student must register for at least 9 gr aduate semester hours of work each semester. To be classified as \"part -time,\" a graduate student must register for at least 5 graduate semester hours of work each semester. If you are a degree- seeking student, you must be enrolled at least part -time in order to receive financial aid. The UAB class schedule can be found on the BlazerNET website located at https://blazernet.uab.edu/cp/home/displaylogin . The class schedule lists the courses and other work to be offered and gives full details on prerequisites, registration dates, and procedures. Adding or Changing Courses Adding or changing courses after registration is possible each semester until the date specified on BlazerNET. Procedures are also specified. Withdrawal from Courses Graduate students are expected to complete courses for which they have registered, unless unusual circumstances require withdrawal. The procedures for withdrawal are specified on BlazerNET . Mere cessation of class a ttendance does not constitute withdrawal, either academically or for tuition charges . If you must withdraw from a class or classes after the Add -Drop period, the withdrawal request must be made no later than the posted date for all withdrawals. Check the Academic Calendar , https://www.uab.edu/students/academics/academic - calendar , for the appropriate semester to verify the last date for withdrawal. If a student follows the procedures to withdraw in Blaz erNET, then a grade of \"W\" will be entered on the transcript. Credit by Examination Students may not earn \"credit by examination\" at the graduate level. Audits Graduate students may audit courses available for graduate credit with the permission of the instructor and payment of appropriate fees; this approval must be secured before registration . Courses taken for audit credit are not counted toward the hours required for full -time status. Provided the instructor's requirements are met, the course will appear on the transcript with the notation AU. T he request to audit form can be obtained online at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/online -forms . Course Completion Grading System The grade of A is used to indicate superior performance, B for adequate performance, and C for performance only minimally adequate for a graduate student. In most programs, a grade of C is a failing grade. Any graduate student completing a course at the 50 0 level or above with a performance below the C level will receive a grade of F. The Graduate School does not use the grade of D. Grades in Pass/Not Pass Courses With the approval of the graduate program director, a course may be designated as a \"pass/no t pass course.\" The grade of P (passing) signifies satisfactory work. The grade of NP (not passing) indicates unsatisfactory work, without a penalty being assessed with respect to the grade point 7 average (GPA). Research courses with course numbers 698, 699, 798, and 799 are considered pass/not pass courses. Temporary Grade Notations Temporary notations used by the Graduate School are N for \"no grade reported,\" and I for \"incomplete\" coursework. If there is a special circumstance in which an instructor d oes not submit a grade at the end of a semester, a temporary grade of N will be recorded. If no permanent grade has been reported by the end of the following semester, an F will automatically be entered in the student's academic record. The temporary notation of I may be reported at the discretion of the instructor to indicate that the student has performed satisfactorily in the course but, due to unforeseen circumstances, has been unable to finish all course requirements. An I is never given to enable a student to raise a deficient grade. This notation should not be used unless there is reasonable certainty that the requirements will be completed during the following semester, because at the end of that semester the I automatically changes to an F if the I has not been replaced with a letter grade. In highly unusual circumstances, the student may request an extension of the time to complete the requirements. This request must be submitted in writing in advance of the time when the grade automatically change s to an F because the approval of the instructor, graduate program director, and Graduate School Dean are all required. Cumulative Credits and Grade Point Average (GPA) Semester Hours Earned The student's \"semester hours earned\" are increased by (1) earning a grade of C or better in a course for which the student was registered on a regular (\"letter grade\") basis or (2) obtaining a P grade in a course taken on a pass/not pass basis. Semester Hours Attempted The student's \"semester hours attempted\" are increased by receiving a grade of A, B, C, or F in a course for which the student was registered on a regular basis. Quality Points Four quality points are awarded for each semester hour in which an A is earned, three quality points are awarded for each s emester hour in which a B is earned, and two quality points are awarded for each semester hour in which a C is earned. No quality points are added for other grades. Grade Point Average (GPA) The grade point average is determined by dividing the total quality points awarded by the semester hours attempted. Repeated Courses Graduate students may be allowed to repeat courses for graduate credit with the permission of the graduate advisor and graduate program director. All courses taken and all grades earned are permanently recorded on the student's transcript. The first time a student repeats a course, he or she receives the grade earned for the second attempt. If a course is taken three or more times, all grades after the first are counted. The Graduate School Records Office must be notified of the first repeat at the time of registration because the calculation using the repeat grade is not automatic . Some graduate programs may not allow the Repeated Course policy. Check with your advisor to make sure your program has a repeat policy. Note: Many graduate programs also base retention decisions on programmatic guidelines and not on grade point average. Academic Performance Good Academic Standing For a student to ma intain good academic standing in the Graduate School, a grade point average of at least 3.0 (B average) and overall satisfactory performance on pass/not pass courses are required. Satisfactory performance on pass/not pass courses is defined as earning at least as many hours of P grades as hours of NP grades. Conditional Dismissal A degree -seeking or nondegree -seeking graduate student , who has been in good academic standing but who, at the end of any semester, fails to meet the criteria to continue in good academic standing will be placed on probation. Such a student must re -establish good academic standing within the next two semesters of graduate study undertaken. Students who do not accomplish this level of performance will be dismissed from the UAB Graduate School. The rules stated above govern university probation and dismissal, administered by the Graduate School. Individual graduate programs may establish and administer program probation and dismissal governed by more stringent requirements. In gene ral, a student's retention in a specific graduate program is contingent on the faculty's belief that the student is likely to complete the program successfully. If the faculty ceases to hold this belief, the student may be dismissed from the program. UAB Student Record Policy Federal law guarantees students certain rights with respect to their educational records. It is the student's responsibility to become familiar with the university's stated policies on these rights (i.e ., Student Records Policy ). 8 Graduate School Deadlines All Graduate School deadlines, as indicated on the calendar or in explanation of policies and procedures, unless otherwise stated, are final by 5:00 p.m. on the date specified, by which time all transactions must be completed and d ocuments received in the Graduate School. Transactions and documents requiring the action or approval of graduate advisors, committee members, instructors, department chairs, academic deans, or others prior to receipt by the Graduate School should be initi ated by the appropriate person (student, instructor, graduate advisor, or other) sufficiently in advance of the Graduate School deadline for the required actions to be taken and approvals made or declined before the deadline. Deadlin e dates are available o nline at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/deadline -dates . Responsibilities of the Graduate Assistant or Trainee A fundamental responsibility of the graduate assistant is to work closely with the faculty supervisor in carrying out research or teaching activities, while at the same time making good progress toward the completion of the degree program. If the student's assistantship responsibilities and academic program are properly coordinated, these responsibilities will be compatible. The assistant should articulate his or her goals early in the term of appointment and work with the supervisor to achieve them. The gr aduate assistant is obligated at all times to maintain high ethical standards in academic and nonacademic activities, and to report violations of these to the faculty supervisor. The graduate assistant should keep well informed of departmental, school, and institutional regulations, and follow them consistently. If problems arise in the assistantship assignments, the graduate assistant should seek help first from the faculty supervisor. If problems cannot be resolved, the student should consult the Program Director. In general, graduate assistants are expected to be available in the periods between academic terms. Graduate assistants are entitled to the following short -term leaves: A maximum of 15 calendar days (one -half month) paid leave of absence (vacati on) per calendar year, 3 calendar days paid sick leave of absence per calendar year, and Parental leave of absence (with pay) of 30 consecutive days per calendar year upon the birth or adoption of a child. Either or both parents are eligible for parental l eave. These leaves (vacation, sick, parental) do not accrue. All leaves must be requested and require approval by the mentor and graduate program director. With the agreement of the mentor and graduate program director, extended, unpaid, non-emergency absences from campus for periods up to a month may be approved. Extended absences (without pay) for non- academic purposes should be limited. Program policies regarding leaves of absence must apply equitably to all full time students in good stand ing in the program. Students should consult the Graduate School Policies and Procedures concerning leaves of academic absence. In emergencies, graduate assistants should inform their mentors or program directors as soon as possible about the need for a leave of academic absence. NOTE: Graduate students (Trainees and Assistants) are not eligible for FMLA. Graduate Level Postbaccalaureate or Post - Master' s Certificates Several UAB graduate programs offer Certificates which do not involve conferral of either a Masters or Doctoral degree. Earning a certificate usually involves taking a specific set of graduate level course s which is designed to provide the Certificate holder expertise in a specialty area of a profession or practice. Certificate programs often consist of 12 or more credits of course work. In some cases the nature of the course work is specified by skill requirements, or may be mandated by State level requirements, for example , by the Alabama State Department of Education. Certificate requirements vary by discipline. Therefore students should determine what the requirements are of the Certificate program in which they are interested by communicating directly with the program director of the program in which the Certificate is offered. Requirement s for the Master's Degree Faculty Advisor Immediately after a degree- seeking student enters the UAB Graduate School, a member of the faculty of the graduate program to which the student has been admitted should be assigned to serve as the student's adviso r. The assignment may be a temporary arrangement. The student and the advisor should confer about courses and any special work to be taken on the basis of the student's previous experience and the requirements of the graduate program. Graduate Study Commi ttee As soon as possible, a specific plan of study should be developed. Traditionally, graduate study is highly flexible and individualized, and a graduate study committee is appointed, chaired by the student's advisor, to guide the student toward the degree. (Some graduate programs, particularly where flexibility in the course of study is limited by 9 accreditation and other external constraints, do not always use a graduate study committee for Plan II students.) When used, the committee should consist of at least three Graduate School faculty members, one of whom should be from outside the student's graduate specialization and each of whom should be able to contribute some relevant insight and expertise to guide the student. Recommendations for graduate study committee membership are submitted by the advisor and the student to the graduate program director, who subsequently submits these recommendations to the Graduate School Dean. Committee members must have credentials equal to or exceeding that of the degree that the student is pursuing and must have been approved by the Graduate School Dean for Graduate Faculty status. Graduate faculty appointees and instructions for requesting new appointments are available at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/faculty/gradfaclist . New Graduate Faculty appointments should be requested by the department and approved by the Grad uate School Dean prior to being placed on the recommendation to serve as a member of a student committee. Graduate Faculty status definitions are available at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/faculty/definitions -of- graduate -faculty -categories . Changes to a student's committee must also be submitted on the appropriate form available at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/online -forms . Plan I or Plan II The Graduate School recognizes two principal paths, known as Plan I and Plan II, that lead to the master's degree. One or the other of these plans may be appropriate in particular circumstances, and in some programs a choice is available. Plan I requires the completion, in good academic standing, of at least 24 semester hours of appropriate graduate work and 6 semester hours of thesis research, with the presentation of an acceptable thesis embodying the results of original research work. Plan II may not require research and does not require a formal thesis, but a minimum of 30 semester hours of appropriate graduate work must be completed in good academic standing. Although thesis research is not required as part of a Plan II course of study, the student is often expected to gain insight into the techniques of problem posing and problem solving and to use these insigh ts to prepare a written report. A plan of study/course curriculum outline is required for all Plan II master's students when submitting the application for degree (before graduation). Where both Plan I and Plan II are available within the same graduate program, an early and meaningful choice should be made by the student, in close consultation with the advisor. A change in choice of plans requires the approval of the program director and the Graduate School Dean. Transfer of Credit Previously earned graduate credit that has not been applied toward another degree (either at UAB or elsewhere) is eligible for transfer into the stu dent's current degree program. Ordinarily no more than 12 semester hours of transfer credit c an be applied to a degree program. Acceptance of more than 12 hours will require approval by the program director, department chair, and Graduate School Dean. All credit transfer requests must be initiated by the student and require the approval of the gra duate program director and the Graduate School Dean. Transfer of Credit forms are available online at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/online -forms . An application for transfer of credit will not be consid ered until the student has completed at least 9 semester hours of graduate credit in the current UAB program and is in good academic standing. Once transfer credit has been accepted, it will be included in the calculation of the grade point average in the student's current UAB program. Graduate credit earned with a grade of B or above while a graduate student in another accredited graduate school may be considered for transfer. In programs offered jointly by UAB and other universities, all graduate credits earned in the program at a cooperating university are eligible for transfer to UAB. If a student earns credit in one UAB graduate program and is later admitted to another program, unused credits from the previous program are eligible for consideration for transfer into the current program. Additional Program Requirements In consultation with the faculty, the director of each graduate program will specify any additional requirements, such as a reading knowledge of a foreign language or a working knowl edge of statistics, which are considered essential to mastery of the academic discipline. Such requirements become conditions for the completion of the degree. The program may also adopt a system of examinations that the student must pass at various points in the program. Admission Into Degree Candidacy (Plan I Only) Admission to candidacy is a formal step recommended by the student's graduate study committee and approved by the graduate program director and the Graduate School Dean , acknowledging that the student has been performing well and is likely to complete the degree. For Plan I students, admission should occur when the student has obtained an adequate background (although not all coursework needs to be complete) and has provided the committee with an acceptable proposal for thesis research. Students must be in good academic standing to be eligible for admission to 10 candidacy, and admission must take place no later than one semester before the expected graduation. Before being admitted to candidacy, students must complete a Research Compliance Verification form and attach photocopies of the appropriate assurance letters and/or forms. Students must be admitted to candidacy before they can register for thesis research hours (i.e., 699). Forms are available online at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/online -forms . IRB and IACUC Approval If the research involves human or animal subjects, approval from the IRB or IACUC must be documented before admission to candidacy can be approved and must be kept current until the research is completed (please refer to the Tip Sheet for Students Involved in Research Involving Human or Animal Subjects located on pages 5 0 and 5 1 of this Handbook . The student's name must appear on the IRB approval form . The IACUC form must display the appropriate research protocol number. Application for Degree Each candidate for a master's degree must signify the intention to complete the requirements by a parti cular graduation date by submitting a completed Application for Degree Form. Because this form is used to document completion of requirements, order the diploma, and to include the student 's information in the commencement program, the form must be received in the Graduate School Office no later than 3 weeks into the semester of expected graduation . However, because each graduate program may have an earlier deadline, the student should check with his or her program office for those deadlines as well. A pla n of study/course curriculum outline is required for all Plan II master's students when submitting the application for degree (before graduation). See deadline dates, http://www.uab.edu/graduate/deadline -dates . Students must be registered during the semester in which degree requirements are completed. If degree candidates are covered by the student health insurance policy, or have student loans, it may be necessary to maintain at least half time registration status of 5 credit hours to retain these benefits. Check with the appropriate office if these are concerns. Forms are available online at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/online -forms . Thesis The thesis required under Plan I should present the results of the candidate's original research and the interpretation of those results. The document should also demonstrate the candidate's acquaintance with the literature of the field and the proper selection and execution of research methodology. Signatures of committee members and program directors on the approval form indicate their assurance that they have examined the document and have found that it is of professional quality from all standpoints, including writing quality, technical correctness, and professional competency, and that the document conforms to acceptable standards of scholarly presentation. The Graduate School is responsible for ensuring that the final version of the thesis meets the physical standards required of a permanent, published document and for adherence to the requirements stated in the UAB Format Manual (available online at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/images/acrobat/forms/t heses/FormatManual.pdf ). T he final approved version of the thesis must be submitted as a single PDF for final review no later than 2 weeks (10 business days) following the public defense. Master's students must submit the Approval Form, signed by each committee member and the program director. The UAB Publication Agreement form is submitted online. Additional information concerning completing the final steps of the publication process is available online at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/submitting -your-thesis - or-dissertation -to-the-graduate -school . If in the opinion of more than one member of the thesis committee, the student has failed the thesis defense, there is no consensus to pass. The chair of the committee shall advise the student that the thesis fails to meet the requirements of the program. The chair shall notify the student in writing about the reason(s) for failure. If the student resubmits or submits a new thesis for consideration by his/her graduate program at least two members of the new examining committee shall be drawn from the original committee. If the modified or new thesis fails to meet the requirements of the program, the student shall be dismissed from the graduate program. In the event that only one of the three committee members dissent, that individual must submit a letter in which he/she outlines the reasons for their dissent to the student's advisor. The advisor and student may then prepare a rebuttal statement that is submitted, along with the letter of dissent, to the advisory or executive committee of the program for review. The advisory committee can then decide to accept or reject the rebuttal statement. If the rebuttal is accepted, the student is passed on his/her thesis defense. If the rebuttal is rejected, the advisory committee can recommend to the student or advisor potential steps nec essary to remediate the thesis and potentially also the work therein, or the committee can recommend that the student be dismissed from the program. Thesis Defense Under Plan I, the final examination should take the form of a presentation and public defense of the thesis, followed by an examination of the candidate's comprehensive knowledge of the field. The time, date, and location of this examination is reported to 11 the Graduate School via the online Request for Thesis or Dissertation Approval forms (sub mitted at least 10 days before the public defense) . The meeting must be appropriately announced on campus, must be open to all interested parties, and must take place before the posted semester Thesis or Dissertation defense deadline . Plan I candidates mus t be registered during the semester in which degree requirements are completed. If degree candidates are covered by the student health insurance policy, or have student loans, it may be necessary to maintain at least half time registration status of 5 credit hours to retain these benefits . Check with the appropriate office if this is a concern. When Plan II is followed, the final examination should take the form of a comprehensive survey of the candidate's activities in the graduate program. (A Plan II fi nal examination is not required in some graduate programs.) Recommendation for Degree The candidate will be recommended for the master's degree to the Graduate School Dean by the graduate study committee or by the student's advisor and the graduate progr am director. This recommendation must be received no later than 20 days before the end of the semester in which the candidate is expected to complete all degree requirements http://www.uab.edu/gradua te/deadline - dates . The recommendation will be based on evaluation of all work performed, the final examination, and the thesis if Plan I was followed. The recommendation will automatically be nullified if (1) the remaining courses needed for the degree are not passed, (2) the candidate fails to maintain good academic standing, (3) the candidate fails to re move all temporary grades from his/her transcript, or (4) the Plan I candidate fails to complete the thesis. Award of Degree Upon approval by the Gradua te School Dean and payment of any outstanding financial obligations to the university, the President confer s student s' degrees by authority of the Board of Trustees . Steps Toward Earning the Master's Degree Admission to master's degree program Selection o f faculty advisor Maintenance of good standing Appointment of graduate study committee \u2014 Plan I (Thesis) only IRB and/or IACUC approvals obtained and renewed annually Admission to candidacy \u2014at least one semester before graduation is expected \u2014 Plan I (Thesis) only Application for Degree \u2014no later than 3 weeks after the beginning of the semester in which graduation is expected (see http://www.uab.edu/graduate/deadline - dates ) Production of preliminary version of thesis (Plan I only) Defense of thesis (for Plan I only) (see http://www.uab.edu/graduate/deadline - dates ) One PDF of the defended committee - approved thesis (Plan I only) submitted online no later than 2 weeks (10 business days) after the public defense Recommendation for degree Conferring of degree Requirements for the Doctoral Degree General Statement The doctoral degree is granted in recognition of (1) scholarly proficiency and (2) distinctive achievement in a specific field of an academic discipline. The first component is demonstrated by successful completion of advanced coursework (of both a didacti c and an unstructured nature) and by adequate performance on the comprehensive examination. Traditionally, the student demonstrates the second component by independently performing original research. In certain doctoral programs, performing a major project may be acceptable even though it may not consist of traditional research. However, in all programs, with the exception of DPT and DNP , a dissertation presenting the results of the student's independent study is required . The Graduate School also recognizes professional doctorates awarded in preparation for the autonomous practice of a profession. Professional doctorates are accredited programs of study usually designed to prepare students for the delivery of clinical services or to assume specific types of administrative responsibilities . Students in professional doctorate programs must demonstrate competence in clinical practice and /or scholarship but are not required to conduct and defend original independent research. In li eu of a dissertation, students in programs designated as professional doctorate programs are required to demonstrate that they are capable of evaluating existing research, applying it to their professional practice, and expanding the body of knowledge on w hich their professional practice is based. This requirement is often met by the design and co mpletion of a research or scholarly project submitted in writing and presented formally before the faculty in the program. Faculty Advisor Immediately after a d egree- seeking student enters the UAB Graduate School, a member of the faculty of the graduate program to which the student has been admitted should be assigned to serve as the 12 student's advisor. This initial assignment may be a temporary arrangement. The s tudent and the advisor should confer about the initial courses and any special work to be taken on the basis of the student's previous experience and the requirements of the graduate program. Graduate Study Committee As soon as possible, a graduate study committee should be formed to guide the student in a program of courses, seminars, and independent study designed to meet the student's needs and to satisfy program and Graduate School requirements. This committee should consist of at least five graduate faculty members, one or two of whom should be from outside the student's graduate specialization and each of whom should be able to contribute some relevant insight and expertise to guide the student. In all cases, at least three of the committee must be comprised of UAB Graduate Faculty members. Recommendations for graduate study committee composition are submitted by the advisor and the student to the program director, who subsequently submits these recommendations to the Graduate School Dean . Committee members must have credentials equal to or exceeding that of the degree that the student is pursuing and must have been approved by the Graduate School Dean for Graduate Faculty status. Graduate faculty appointments and instructions for requesting new appointments are available at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/faculty/gradfaclist . New Graduate Faculty appointments should be requested by the department and approved by the Graduate School Dean prior to any faculty member being recommend ed for placement on a student 's committee. Graduate Faculty status definitions are available at http://www.uab.edu/graduat e/faculty/definitions -of- graduate -faculty -categories . Changes to a student's committee must also be submitted on the appropriate form located at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/online - forms . Transfer of Credit Previously earned graduate credit that has not been applied toward another degree (either at UAB or elsewhere) is eligible for transfer into the student's current degree program. Ordinarily, no more than 12 semester hours of transfer credit can be applied to a degree program. Acceptance of more than 12 hours will require approval by the program director, department chair, and Graduate School Dean . All transfer requests must be initiated by the student and require the approval of the graduate pro gram director and the Graduate School Dean. Transfer of Credit forms are available online at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/online -forms . Once transfer credit has been accepted, it will be included in the calculation of the GPA in the student's current UAB program. Graduate credit earned with a grade of B or above by a graduate student in another accredited Graduate School may be considered for transfer. In programs offered jointly by UAB and other univer sities, all graduate credits earned in the program at a cooperating university are eligible for transfer to UAB. If a student earns credit in one UAB graduate program and is later admitted to another program, credits not applied toward meeting the degree from the previous program are eligible for consideration for transfer into the current program. Minimum Course Credit Requirements The Graduate School has minimum course credit requirements for students in doctoral programs. Program requirements for cou rse work may exceed the Graduate School minimums. Graduate School minimum requirements are as f ollows: 1. If entering with a baccalaureate degree: a. Completion of 48 credit hours of course work prior to candidacy b. Up to 16 credits of the 48 can be as non-disser tation research credits c. Up to 10 credits can be as lab rotation, seminar, or directed study credits d. Doctoral students must satisfy one of the following: Must complete at least two semesters in candidacy and accumulate at least 24 semester credit hours in 7 99 dissertation research. OR Must complete at least two semesters as a student i n candidacy and have accumulated at least 12 semester credit hours in 799 dissertation research, AND, either during or before candidacy, 12 semester credit hours in other appropriate research -based coursework, which has been approved by the graduate student's program. Courses which have been previously applied toward meeting the requirements of another degree are not eligible to satisfy the research credit requirement. The student's graduate department or program should provide a course planning curriculum worksheet detailing the courses taken which are intended to be used toward meeting degree requirements along with the student's application for degree. 2. If entering with a previous Masters degree appropriate to the doctoral degree field (Also applies to previously earned M.S., D.V.M., D.M.D., D.D.S., etc.): 13 a. Completion of 27 credit hours of course work prior to candidacy b. Up to 6 credits of the 27 can be as non- dissertation research credits c. Up to 6 credits can be as lab rotation, seminar, or directed study credits d. Doctoral students must s atisfy one of the following: Must complete at least two semesters in candidacy and accumulate at least 24 semester credit hours in 799 dissertation research. OR Must complete at least two semesters as a student in candidacy and have accumulated at least 12 semester credit hours in 799 dissertation research, AND, either during or before candidacy, 12 semester credit hours in other appropriate research -based coursework, which has been approved by the graduate student's program. Courses which have been previou sly applied toward meeting the requirements of another degree are not eligible to satisfy the research credit requirement. The student's graduate department/program should provide a course planning curriculum worksheet detailing the courses taken which are intended to be used toward meeting degree requirements along with the student's application for degree. Up to 12 credits of course work that have not been applied toward meeting the requirements for an earned degree taken at UAB or other institutions ma y be used to satisfy these course credit requirements upon approval of the graduate program director and the Graduate School Dean. Residence Requirement The usual minimal period in which the doctoral degree can be earned is three academic years of full - time study, or longer if the student has periods of part-time enrollment. The nature of doctoral study requires close contact between the student and the faculty of the graduate program, and the individual investigation or other special work leading to the dissertation must be performed directly under the guidance and supervision of a full member of the UAB graduate faculty. Therefore, doctoral students should be in residence (enrolled) for three full semesters each year , including summers , during a three year period or collectively a minimum of nine semesters if the student has to take a leave of absence or stop o ut during the course of their doctoral education. Foreign Language or Other Special Tools of Research In consultation with the faculty, the director of each graduate program will specify any additional requirements, such as a reading knowledge of a foreign language or a working knowledge of statistics, that are considered essential to mastery of the academic discipline. Such requirements become conditions for the completion of the degree. Comprehensive Examination The scholarly proficiency of a doctoral student in the chosen field of study must be evaluated by comprehensive examination. The conduct of these examinations is the re sponsibility of the graduate program in which the student is enrolled and may consist of either individual examinations in several appropriate areas or a single combined examination. When both written and oral examinations are given, the written examination should precede the oral so that there is an opportunity for the student to clarify any misunderstanding of the written examination questions. Comprehensive exams should be administered no later than the end of the third year of the student's program. Admission Into Degree Candidacy When the student has passed the comprehensive examination, satisfied any program requirements for foreign language proficiency or mastered special research tools, and presented to the graduate study committee an acceptable proposal for dissertation research or special study, the committee will recommend to the Graduate School Dean that the student be admitted to degree candidacy. A student must be in good academic standing to be admitted to candidacy . Admission to candidacy must take place at least two semesters before the expected completion of the doctoral program. Students must be admitted to candidacy before they can register for dissertation research hour s (i.e., 799). Admission to candidacy is an important step forward in the student's pursuit of the doctoral degree. By approving admission to candidacy , the graduate student's committee indicates its confidence that the student is capable of completing th e proposed research project and the doctoral program. IRB and IACUC Approval If the research involves human or animal subjects, approval from IRB or IACUC must be documented before admission to candidacy can be approved and must be kept current until the research is completed (please refer to Tip Sheet for Students Involved in Research Involving Human or Animal Subjects located on pages 51 and 52 of this Handbook . The student's name must appear on the 14 IRB approval form . The IACUC form must display the app ropriate research protocol number. Application for Degree Each candidate for a doctoral degree must signify his/her intention to complete the degree requirements to meet a particular graduation date by submitting a completed Application for Degree Form. Because this form is used to check requirements, order the diploma, and include the student 's information in the commencement program, it must be received in the Graduate S chool Office no later than 3 weeks into the expected semester of graduation . However, because each graduate program may have an earlier deadline, the student should check with his or her program office for those deadlines as well. The deadline dates can be accessed on the Graduate School website at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/deadline - dates . Students must be registered during the semester in which degree requirements are completed. If degree candidates are covered by the student health insurance policy, or have student loans, it may be necessary to maintain at least half time registration status of 5 credit hours to retain these benefits. Forms are available online at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/online -forms . Dissertation The results of the candidate's individual inquiry must be presented in a written dissertation comprising a genuine contribution to knowledge in the partic ular academic field. The document should also demonstrate the candidate's acquaintance with the literature of the field and the proper selection and execution of research methodology. Signatures of committee members and program directors on approval form s indicate their assurance that they have examined the document and have found that it is of professional quality from all standpoints, including writing quality, technical correctness, and professional competency, and that the document conforms to acceptable standards of scholarly presentation. The Graduate School is responsible for ensuring that the final version of the dissertation meets the physical standards required of a permanent, published document and for adherence to the requirements stated in the UAB Format Manual (available online at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/images/acrobat/forms/t heses/FormatManual.pdf . Dissertation Defense The dissertation defense should take the form of a presentation and defense of the dissertation work , which may include an examination of the candidate's comprehensive knowledge of the field. The time, date, and location of this examination is reported to the Graduate School via the online Request for Thesis or Dissertation Approval forms (submitted at least 10 days before the public defense). The meeting must be open to all interested parties, publicized on the UAB campus, and must take place before the posted semester thesis and dissertation deadline . Candidates must be registered during the semester in which the final examination is taken. If in the opinion of one or two of the five members of the dissertation committee, the student has failed the dissertation defense, there is no consensus to pass. The chair of the committee shall advise the student that the dissertation fails to meet the requirements of the program. The chair shall notify the student in writing about the reason(s) for failure. If the student resubmits or submi ts a revised dissertation for consideration by his/her graduate program at least t hree members of the new examining committee shall be drawn from the original committee. If the revised dissertation fails to meet the requirements of the program, the student shall be dismissed from the graduate program. In the event that only one of the five committee members dissent, that individual must submit a letter in which he/she outlines the reasons for their dissent to the s tudent's advisor. The advisor and student may then prepare a rebuttal statement that is submitted, along with the letter of dissent, to the advisory or executive committee of the program for review. The advisory committee can then decide to accept or reject the rebuttal statement. If the rebuttal is accepted, the student is passed o n his/her dissertation defense. If the rebuttal is rejected, the advisory committee can recommend to the student or advisor potential steps necessary to remediate the dissertation and potentially also the work therein , or the committee can recommend that the student be dismissed from the program. Submission of the Dissertation No later than 2 weeks (10 business days) following the public defense, the completed, final version of the committee -approved dissertation must be submitted (as a single PDF) for final review. Also submitted online are the UAB Publication Agreemen t, Survey of Earned Doctorates , and Graduate School Exit Survey. One copy of the signed approval form is submitted to the Graduate School office. Ad ditional information concerning completing graduation requirements and the dissertation submission and publication process is available online at http://www.uab.edu/graduate/theses -and- dissertations -at-uab. Graduate Student Exit Survey Doctoral graduates are required to take the Graduate School Exit Survey as part of graduation requirements. Collecting important information and feedback from graduate students will help to improve the quality of graduate program offerings. After submission of the revised version of the student's final dissertation, he/she will be contacted via email 15 and provide d the secure link to take the electronic survey. Recommendation for Degree The candidate will be recommended for the doctoral degree to the Graduate School Dean by the graduate study committee and the graduate program director. This recommendation , in the form of a signed approval form, must be received no later than 20 days bef ore the end of the semester in which the candidate is expected to complete all degree requirements. Candidates must be in good academic standing to graduate, with no temporary grades for courses required for the degree on their transcripts , or any outstand ing balance on their student account . Award of Degree Upon approval by the Graduate School Dean and payment of any outstanding financial obligations to the university, the President confers student s' degrees by authority of the Board of Trustees . Doctora l students are generally expected to complete all degree requirements within 7 years of matriculation. Steps Toward Earning the Doctoral Degree Admission to doctoral degree program Selection of faculty advisor Maintenance of good standing Appointment of graduate study committee Passing of comprehensive examination IRB and /or IACUC approvals obtained and renewed annually Admission to candidacy \u2014no later than two semesters before expected graduation Application for degree \u2014no later than 3 weeks into the expec ted semester of graduation (see http://www.uab.edu/graduate/deadline - dates ) Draft of preliminary version of dissertation Review of the draft by committee members Revisions made to dissertation in response to committee feedback Defense of dissertation (see http://www.uab.edu/graduate/deadline - dates ) A PDF of the defended committee- approved dissertation to UAB/ProQuest submission web site --no later than 2 weeks (10 business days) following the public defe nse Recommendation for degree Conferring of the doctoral degree Academic Ethics and Conduct As a graduate student at UAB, you have joined a distinguished academic community that is guided by a conviction in the worth of knowledge and its pursuit. By virtue of your membership in this community, you accrue many benefits \u2014among them, access to the ideas and materials of others. Graduate students not only learn from others but also engage in the pursuit of new knowledge and, in some instances, teach or provide service to others. Being a member of an academic community and functioning in multiple roles in the community carries with it certain responsibilities. For this reason, we provide guidance here in the forms of both general standards of conduct and univers ity policies. As members of an academic community, students, faculty, and administrators share a responsibility to seek truths and communicate them to others. As we pursue knowledge and encourage learning, we acknowledge the need for a free exchange of i deas and recognize the importance of listening to and maintaining respect for the views of others. We must always aspire to learn, apply, and communicate to others the best scholarly standards of the disciplines in which we are involved. High scholarly sta ndards demand high ethical standards. We must commit to learning and communicating the best ethical standards and their application to our disciplines. In interactions with others, we must demonstrate respect for them as individuals, give credit for signif icant academic or scholarly assistance, and respect the confidential nature of some exchanges. We must adhere to the highest standards of academic conduct, avoiding those acts of misconduct and dishonesty that undermine the purposes of the academic communi ty. All UAB students are expected to be familiar with the UAB Academic Honor Code as well as any honor codes that are specific to their schools or disciplines. The code represents a commitment to integrity in the academic community and a respect for an in dividual's educational endeavors: I have read and, by choosing to become a member of the UAB academic community, accept the UAB Honor Code. I understand that violation of this code will result in penalties as severe as expulsion from the university. I prom ise and confirm that I will not, at any time and under any circumstances, involve myself with abetting, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, or misrepresentation while enrolled as a student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Academic Integrity \u2014 Honor Code The University of Alabama at Birmingham expects all members of its academic community to function according to the highest ethical and professional standards. Students, faculty, and administration of the institution must be involved to ensure t his quality of academic conduct. Academic misconduct undermines the purpose of education. Such behavior is a serious violation of the trust that must exist among faculty and students for a university to nurture intellectual growth and development. Academi c misconduct can generally be 16 defined as all acts of dishonesty in an academic or related matter. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following categories of behavior: ABETTING: helping another student commit an act of academic disho nesty. Allowing others to copy your quiz answers, or use your work as their own are examples of abetting. CHEATING: use or attempted use of unauthorized materials, information, study aids, the answers of others, or computer -related information. PLAGIAR ISM: claiming as your own the ideas, words, data, computer programs, creative compositions, artwork, etc., done by someone else. Examples include improper citation of referenced works, use of commercially available scholarly papers, failure to cite sources , and copying others' ideas. FABRICATION: presenting as genuine falsified data, citations, or quotations. MISREPRESENTATION: falsification, alteration or misstatement of the contents of documents, academic work, or other materials related to academic m atters, including representing work substantially done for one class as work done for another without receiving prior approval from the instructor. Misrepresentation also includes misrepresenting schedules, prerequisites, transcripts, or other academic records. A student who commits an act of academic misconduct within the context of meeting course requirements will be given the grade of F in the course or on the assignment at the discretion of the department or program in which the misconduct occurred. Academic misconduct can occur in other contexts as well, such as when taking comprehensive examinations, performing research, preparing manuscripts or generally during the performance of other activities related to the process of satisfying degree requirem ents. Under Graduate School policy the program in which the student is enrolled may choose to expel the student from the university on the first offense . If, as determined by the records of the Graduate School or the department or program, the act of academic misconduct is a second offense, the student will be expelled from the university. The transcript of a student expelled for committing academic misconduct will bear the statement \"Expelled for Academic Misconduct.\" Withdrawal from a course while a possi ble violation of the Academic Honor Code is under review will not preclude the assignment of a course grade that appropriately reflects the student's performance prior to withdrawal if the violation is substantiated. Procedure for Reporting a Suspected V iolation When a faculty member or another student sees cause to charge a student with academic misconduct, within 7 days of noting the incident that individual will communicate the charge to the department chair or program director of the department or pr ogram in which the accused student is enrolled. The department c hair or program director to whom the charge is presented will notify the student of the charge and provide the student with an opportunity to respond. If the student can respond in a way that, in the opinion of the program director and the department chair, either dispels the charge or provides the opportunity to resolve the issue informally, an informal resolution can be prescribed. If the student cannot refute the charge effectively, the depa rtment chair or program director will expeditiously notify the student of the admi nistrative action to be taken. The notice shall also inform the student of the right to appeal and the steps involved in that process. Copies of any such communi cation will b e provided to the academic d ean of the school in which the student is enrolled. If the school or department in which the student is enrolled has its own honor code, then the procedures of that honor code must be followed, including any prescribed appeal s process. For dual degree students whose academic misconduct occurs in one of their two schools, the honor code of the school in which the infraction occurred should prevail. However, if no local honor code exists, the following procedure must be followed. Righ t to Appeal and Formation of an Honor Council If a student is the subject of an administrative action as the result of an academic misconduct violation and wishes to contest that administrative action, he / she may appeal in writing to the d ean of the school in which the student is enrolled. The dean will then convene an Honor Council consisting of five students and three faculty members from various departments within the school. All of the students chosen to serve must be in good academic standing. The Honor Council shall elect a chairperson from among the eight members. The Chair may be either a student or fac ulty member. The duties of the Chair include convening the Honor Council, presiding over hearings and communicating with the admini stration of their school on behalf of the Honor Council. In all matters, the members of the Honor Council are instructed to treat the information put forward to them with the strictest confidence. Breaches of confidentiality are themselves violations of the Student Honor Code and will be treated as such. Initial Procedures After being informed of the charges and the 17 failure to reach an informal resolution, the Academic Dean may also attempt to informally resolve the impasse between the stud ent and the fa culty member(s). In the event this attempt is unsuccessful, the Academic Dean shall refer the allegation(s) to the Honor Council. The Academic Dean will provide the Honor Council with a statement of the allegation(s) against the accused student, a descript ion of the evidence and supporting documents (if available). The Honor Council shall convene to review the charge a nd all evidence supporting it. After review, the Council may either dismiss the allegation(s) on the grounds that insufficient substantiatin g evidence exists, or support the charge s, also based on the evidence. The Honor Council shall provide notice of the specific charge or of the dismissal of the alleged violation to the accused student by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by hand deliv ery, and to the Academic Dean. If substantiated, the statement of the charge shall include a brief summary of the alleged violation and the evidence presented in support of the charge, in enough detail as to allow the accused the opportunity to rebut the charge, and shall provide notification to the accused student of his/her right to a hearing. The accused student must respond to the charge within five days, unless excused by the Honor Council. In his/her written response to the Honor Council, the ac cused student must admit or deny the charge and must formally request or waive his/her right to a hearing before the Honor Council. Once notice of the specific charge has been provided to the accused student and to the Academic Dean, the Honor Council sha ll decide on a time for the hearing and any preliminary deadline(s) for the submission of supporting documents and the names of proposed witnesses. Granting a request from the accused, or from the School, to reschedule the hearing is within the discretion of the Honor Council, but shall not be unreasonably denied. The Honor Council shall provide written notice to the accused student of the time and place for the hearing, and if witnesses are to be called in his/her defense, ask the student to provide their names along with a statement describing the testimony of each witness. The Honor Council shall review any documentary evidence provided by the student in advance of the hearing. The Hearing The process shall generally include the following: (1) call to order by the Chair; (2) introduction of those present; (3) statement of the Charge and possible penalties if the charge is proven; (4) statement of the evidence and testimony in support of the charge, and questioning of witnesses; (5) statement of evid ence and testimony in opposition to the charge (rebuttal), and questioning of witnesses; (6) closing statement. All questioning of witnesses shall be by the Honor Council unless the Honor Council shall decide otherwise. A hearing before the Honor Council shall not be bound by formal rules of evidence or judicial rules of procedure. The Honor Council may hear any testimony or receive any supporting evidence that it deems to be pertinent to the charge. Both the accused and a representative of the School may be present throughout the hearing. The accused student shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard, to question witnesses indirectly through the Honor Council, to rebut adverse evidence, and to make a brief closing statement. Members of the Honor Council may ask any questions at any time during the hearing and may elect to disallow or to curtail testimony that the Honor Council determines to be unnecessarily redundant or not relevan t to the issue(s) being heard. Throughout the hearing, all persons present shall conduct themselves in an orderly manner. The accused may be accompanied at the hearing by an advisor of his/her choosing, however, the advisor may n ot participate in the hearing. The Honor Council shall be responsible fo r the conduct of the hearing at all times and shall keep a record of the proceedings in a format it chooses. Hearings before the Honor Council are confidential proceedings and only those persons determined by the Honor Council to have a need to be present shall be included. Except for the accused (and an advisor if invited by the accused) and the representative of the School, all other witnesses shall be excluded from the hearing room, except when testifying. No more than one witness shall b e called to testify at a time. The School or the Honor Council may elect to invite UAB Security to be present at an Honor Council hearing. As soon as practicable following the conclusion of the hearing, the Honor Council shall meet in private session to consider all of the evidence presented, and shall decide on one of two outcomes. The decision of the Honor Council shall be that the charge is either (1) proven by a preponderance of the evidence or (2) not proven by a preponderance of the evidence. A vote of six of the e ight members shall be required for the charge against the accused to be proven. Following the vote, the Honor Council shall record the vote and shall provide a brief narrative statement explaining the rationale for their finding(s). The written decision and rationale of the Honor Council shall be transmitted to the Academic Dean, by internal communication, upon the conclusion of the Honor Council's deliberations. The Honor Council shall notify the accused of the outcome by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by hand delivery. A decision of the Honor Council in favor of the accused student shall conclude the case. Penalties for Violation of the Honor Code Generally, a first violation of the Honor Code shall result in the assignment of a failing grade in the assignment or in the course in which the violation occurred, at th e discretion of the instructor. A notation on the student's permanent academic record 18 may also be made to indicate that a reduced or failing grade was assigned because of an Academic Misconduct violation (e.g., \"F, Academic M isconduct violation, June 15, 2006\"), on the judgment of the Honor C ouncil. A second violation of the Honor Code shall result in expulsion from the University. No student may graduate until pending allegatio ns of an Academic misconduct violation have been resolved. No student expelled from the Graduate School because of an academic misconduct violation shall be eligible for readmission. If at the end of the appeals process performed at the school level, the accused student wishes to appeal to the Gr aduate School Appeals Board, he/ she must follow the procedure outlined in this Handbook. Upon receipt of the appeal from the student, the Graduate Dean will request from the Academic Dean of the school in which the student is enrolled all appropriate documentation accumulated to that point. The Graduate Dean will then be responsible for maintaining records of all additional proceedings. Nonacademic Conduct The university is a community of scholars and learners; therefore, all participants are expected to maintain conduct that (1) facilitates the institution's pursuit of its educational objectives, (2) exhibits a regard for the rights of other members of the academic communi ty, and (3) contributes to the maintenance of a healthy learning environment. Through appropriate due process procedures, conduct action will be taken in response to behavior that violates these principles. The office of Non - Academic Student Conduct supports the mission of the university by prot ecting the rights of all members of the university community and by promoting civility, integrity, responsibility, openness, mutual respect and justice by enforcing community standards . A more detailed description of nonacademic misconduct can be found in the student handbook, Direction . It is the student's responsibility to be fully aware of the policies and procedures described in Direction . The Office of Student Life and the Vice Provost for Student and Faculty Success have the responsibility for coordinating policies and procedures regarding students' nonacademic misconduct. Graduate School Appeals Board (GSAB) A. Purpose: The purpose of the GSAB is to review appeals brought by graduate students of decisions made by university representatives concerning 1. reten tion in graduate programs, 2. charges of academic misconduct or dishonesty, 3. selected other issues related to graduate education as deemed appropriate to forward to the GSAB by the Graduate Dean, the provost, or other university officials. B. Limitations : The GSAB will not review 1. appeals of course grades, 2. appeals for which t he student has not previously fully used all other applicable appeal or r eview processes, 3. appeals file d more than 30 calendar days from the date of a prior review or 30 calendar day s from the date of receiving notification of an action or decision , 4. misconduct i n research which falls under the Policy C oncerning the Mainte nance of High Ethic al Standards in Research and Scholarly Activities. 5. grievances brought against the faculty of a specific program. Program faculty report to the chairpersons and deans in the schools in which they hold their primary appointments. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of those chairpersons and deans to adjudicate at the school level any appeals brought by graduate students against their faculty. Decisions made at the school level in such cases will not be reviewed by the Graduate S chool Appeals Board. C. Composition: The GSAB will consist of five members of the graduate faculty and three graduate students in good standing, all broadly representative of the graduate programs in the university. The GSAB will be chaired by a designee of the G raduate Dean. Members of the committee will be appointed on an ad hoc basis as needed by the Gra duate Dean . The Graduate School will provide support personnel for the board to record proceedings of hearings. D. Meetings : The GSAB will meet as soon as possible after assembly by the Graduate Dean to adjudicate a pending appeal. A quorum for a meeting will be at least five persons: three graduate faculty members and at least two graduate student member s. Any member of the GS AB may disqualify himself or herself. After notification of the Board composition, the student bringing the appeal may disqualify one faculty and one student member of the board. If the disqualification of board members results in absence of a quorum, the process will be suspended until the Graduate Dean can appoint additional members. E. Notification : The chair of the GSAB will notify the student bringing the appeal and the student's program director of the decision reached by the GSAB in the initial re view of the appeal \u2014specifically, whether an appeal will be heard. If a hearing is to be held, the chair will notify the student and student's program director of the date, time, and place for the hearing. The chair of the GSAB is responsible for notifying the Dean of the Graduate School of the findings and 19 recommendations reached by the GSAB after the hearing. The Dean of the Graduate School will notify the student and student's program director of his or her action. F. Authority : The GSAB may recommend affirming or reversing the decision being appealed and making such recommendations for further actions as seem appropriate. In the course of any hearing, the GSAB is authorized to request additional evidence from, or the appearance of, any student, facult y or staff member, or other employee of the university, or other individual as a witness. The GSAB shall have final authority in procedural matters. The GSAB will forward recommendations to the Dean of the Graduate School along with a record of the hearing proceedings. The Dean will make a final independent decision, taking into account the findings and recommendations of the GSAB and the records of the hearing. The Dean will inform the relevant parties and the GSAB of the decision in writing within 14 calendar days of receiving the GSAB recommendation. Procedures A. Filing an appeal : Before a request for an appeal is accepted by the GSAB, the normal channels for resolving disputes must have been follow ed. First, the student should consult with his or her advisor to resolve the issue at that level. If the issue is not then resolved, the student should seek out the progra m director or department chair to request a resolution. If the program director and department chair have not been able to resolve the appeal or the action still needs to be pursued, it is then appropriate to pursue the issue with the academic college or school dean. At that point either the Honor Code of the school in which the student is enrolled should be invoked, or if no school based Honor Code exists, the Honor Council procedure described previously should be followed. If the concern has not been resolved to the satisfaction of the student at any one of these levels, an appeal to the GSAB may then be pursued. All requests for appeal s to be considered by the GSAB must be submitted to the Dean of the Graduate School, in writing, on the approved form (available in the Graduate School office and online) along with supporting documents and any other pertinent evidence. The written appeal must specify the grounds for the appeal. It is the responsibility of the student making the appeal to demonstrate to the GSAB that grounds for the appeal exist. The Dean of the Graduate School will notify those individuals whose decisions are being appeal ed and will request relevant information. Information and evidence will be transmitted to both parties and to all members of the GSAB. Any additional evidence brought to the hearing is subject to acceptance or rejection by the GSAB. All information submitted becomes part of the permanent record of the GSAB hearing record maintained by the Graduate School . B. Initial review of appeals : The GSAB will be convened by the chair to conduct an initial review of the appeal to determine whether the appeal is subj ect to dismissal or if further action by the GSAB is warranted. Appeals that fail to set forth grounds for a full review by the GSAB shall be dismissed. The GSAB will consider appeals when 1. all other levels of appeal have been exhausted. 2. the student can show grounds that he or she was previously denied a fair hearing. 3. the decision being appealed is not supported by substantial evidence. 4. the sanction being imposed is beyond the authority of the personnel involved. 5. the sanction or action is unduly severe or dis - proportionatel y harsh in comparison to like cases. When the GSAB determines that a graduate student should be afforded a hearing on an appeal, the chair of the GSAB shall give written notice to all parties involved in the appeal, allowing no less than one week of preparation time before the hearing. C. Hearings : All hearings by the GSAB shall be subject to the following requirements: 1. Any additional materials requested by the GSAB at the time of the initial review to be considered at the hearing shall be made avail able to all parties prior to the hearing. 2. Parties to the appeal have the right to be present and hear all arguments and oral statements made to the GSAB committee . 3. Parties to the appeal shall ma ke arguments, present oral statements and written documents, and question witnesses with regard to any issues of fact relevant to the grounds for appeal. 4. Hearings shall not be adversarial in nature and shall be conducted in a manner conducive to ascertaining the facts of the case upon appeal. 5. The GSAB may establish time limitations for presentations before the board. 6. Hearings shall be closed to the public. 7. GSAB members may address questions to any person giving testimony before the board. 8. In hearings involving more than one student, a single hearing may be scheduled for each. 9. It shall be the responsibility of the GSAB chair, together with the recording secretary, to see that the integrity of the record is maintained. 10. The chair shall preside and rule on matters of procedure and evidence. 11. The chair shall have the right to dismiss anyone from the hearing should his or her conduct 20 become disorderly. D. Findings, decisions and recommendations of the GSAB : Upon completion of hearings, the GSAB shall meet in closed session for deliberations. A simple majority vote of the GSAB is required to substantiate all findings and recommendations. In determining its findings and rec ommendations, the board shall concern itself only with whether reasonable people, acting on the available evidence, could have made the same decision or taken the same action as the one being appealed. The GSAB shall prepare written findings addressing all issues presented in the appeal and shall make a recommendation that indicates whether the appealed decision or sanction should be affirmed, set aside, or modified. The GSAB may also make recommendations, if appropriate, for further actions by university authorities. The Dean of the Graduate School has 14 calendar days to act upon the findings and recommendations of the GSAB.

Financial Information UAB Payment Policies Beginning fall 2011, standard tuition payment deadlines for all UAB graduate students chan ged. For detailed information regarding tuition payments and deadlines, check the Student Billing and Payment Policy Web site at http://www.uab.edu/whentopay/policy . Student account payment deadlines are av ailable on the Academic Calendar , https://www.uab.edu/students/academics/academic - calendar , for each term. Internal Payment Options There are multiple ways to pay tuition and fees . Payment by mail should be directed to UAB Student Accounting Services; HUC 322, 1720 2nd Ave. S., Birmingham, AL. 35294- 1150. Questions for Student Accounting may be directed to (205) 934- 3570. Payments may be made in person in the Hill University Center, 1 400 University Boulevard, in Room 322; Making p ayment s via the Web is available through BlazerNET . Monthly Payment Option Tuition Management Systems (TMS) is UAB's education payment partner. This Interest -Free Monthly Payment Option is an alternative to large annual or term payments and helps limit borrowing. The monthly payment option allows students and parents to begin making tuition payments before the semester begins ~ May, June, or July for Fall term and October, November, or December for Spring term. Students contract with TMS, and then TMS submits the student's payments to UAB. Funds are then applied to the student's account prior to the 21 payment deadline. Students may split their semester costs into either 3, 4 or 5 payments per semester (8 or 10 payments per academic year) depending on when they enter into the contract with TMS. For more information, please go to http://www.afford.com/uab Amount Owed A n account balance summary is provided for each student under the Student Resources tab on BlazerNET . Charges shown on that statement are based on the student's status and courses as of the date of registration. School, classification, or course changes made after registration may result in additional charges. Credit for financial aid, external payment plans, UAB Educational Assistance benefits, or payments to be billed to a third -party vendor may not be reflected on the account summary . Fifty percent of the student's account balance is due before classes begin. Failure to meet payment deadlines will result in the student's being dropped from his/her courses for non -payment (see Academic Calendar located at https://www.uab.edu/students/academics/academic - calendar ). For information or clarification concerning the amount due, please call Student Accounting Services at 205-934-3570. Delinquency Policy If any student has an unpaid financial obligation to UAB, all grades will be withheld and no transcripts will be issued for that student. Such a student will not be permitted to register at UAB again and all services will be withheld until the obligation is paid in full, at which time withheld grades will be reinstated. A debt to UAB is, of course, legally enforceable. To be fair to the overwhelming majority of students who honor their commitment, UAB's policy is to pursue unpaid student debts vigorously by all legal means. Withdrawals and Refunds If you withdraw from a course (using the appropriate procedures) prior to the close of business on the published date for Last Day to Drop Without Paying Tuition and Fees, you will owe no tuition for that course. However, if you are still registered for a course at the close of business on the Last Day to Drop /Add Without Paying Full Tuition and Fees, you must pay full tuition and fees for that course, even if you withdraw lat er. No refunds can be made unless a licensed physician certifies that a condition, which arose after the last day to withdraw during the Drop/Add period, was of sufficient duration and severity to make it impossible for you to continue in the course. Students who wish to withdraw from courses for which they are registered must use the official procedures specified on BlazerNET. Mere failure to attend class does not constitute a drop or withdrawal . If the withdrawal request is received after the Last Day to Withdraw Without Paying Full Tuition and Fees during the Drop/Add period , full tuition and fees will be due for the courses from which the student withdraws. Withdrawal deadlines can be found on the Academic Calendar, https://www.uab.edu/students/academics/academic - calendar . Academic Common Market The Academic Common Market is an interstate agreement among selected states for sharing academic programs at both the baccalaureate and graduate levels.

Mandatory students are automatically charged the appropriate Student Health Fee. This allows unlimited visits with a provider with no co -pays and/or medical clearance services through a web -based program. Optional students, those not mandated to participate, may also pay the $100 per semester fee, allowing for unlimited provider visits with no co -pay. Optional students also have the option of paying a $30 per -visit fee, which covers a one- time visit with a SHS provider. However, if a student visits the SHS three times in a semester, paying $30 each time, they are converted to the semester plan at that point, with unlimited provider visits without additional charge for the remainder of that semester. For all of the above options, services not included in the fe e, as defined in the Plan Fee Coverage section , will be billed to the student or the student's insurance. Students are not required to have insurance to participate with SHS. More information regarding the Student Health Service can be found at http://main.uab.edu/Sites/students/student -health - services/48149/ . Hospital and Major Medical Insurance Programs Hospitalization and major medical insurance coverage is available at attractive rates to students enrolled in the Student Health Service. Spouses and children of eligible graduate students may also obtain coverage under this policy at a proportionate increase in premium. Students who are already covered by hospitalization insurance that offers coverage equivalent to that in the UAB student hospitalization policy may sign a waiver to this effect and not be required to take the UAB policy. Failure to sign and file a waiver with the Student Health Service will result in automatic coverage with Student Health Service insurance, and the student will be billed.

These include additional policies concerning health care for international students and visiting international scholars, AIDS and AIDS - related con ditions, a drug -free workplace, alcoholic beverage use, smoking, electronic data processing security, and computer software use. Copies of these policies are available in the Graduate School office, in the online Graduate Catalog , and on the UAB Policies and Procedures Library Web site (http://sppublic.ad.uab.edu/policies/Pages/default.asp x) August 28, 2007 Faculty, staff, and students of a university create, disseminate, and apply knowledge for the benefit of society. When faculty of the university are involved in research, some of which may be of a proprietary nature, particular care must be taken to ensur e that the need for graduate students to publicly present and publicly defend the results of their thesis or dissertation research is not compromised. Graduate student advisors, graduate program directors, and graduate students themselves, therefore, share in the responsibility to ensure that graduate students are well informed if they become involved in thesis or dissertation research that is, or has the potential to become, proprietary if participation in that research will delay completion of their degre e requirements or negatively affect their productivity or future employability. Students must be made aware of the implications of performing thesis or dissertation work of a proprietary nature. For example, will that work delay time to degree, or will it have a potential negative effect on obtaining a postdoctoral position or an employment opportunity? In cases where the thesis or dissertation work has intellectual property implications, adherence to university policies on intellectual property is required. It is the policy of the Graduate School that a faculty member or a graduate student should not enter into an agreement that prevents or significantly delays the presentation or publication of research results unless the delay is required for propri etary reasons. Students and their advisors can embargo the release of the contents of a thesis or dissertation by both the UAB library and ProQuest UMI for up to two years to provide time to resolve intellectual property considerations or prior publication issues. If, however, a decision is made to embargo a student's thesis or dissertation, or delay publication of work described therein, these decisions should not delay the student's time to completion of his/her degree requirements. In instances where , despite good faith efforts on the part of the graduate student advisor, the graduate program director, and the graduate student, a dispute arises regarding the release or publication of a graduate student's thesis or dissertation research, the Graduate S chool Dean must be notified. The Graduate School Dean will immediately convene a meeting of the graduate student, the graduate advisor, the involved graduate program director, and members of the student's thesis or dissertation committee. This group, in co nsultation with the Vice President for Research and/or the Executive Director of the Research Foundation, will resolve the problem. If the situation cannot be resolved through the efforts of this group, a ruling will be made by the Senior Vice President and Dean, School of Medicine; the Vice President for Research and Economic Development; or the Provost. January 27, 1997 [Editorial changes made June 28, 2007] This policy ha s been adapted from a statement on \"The Maintenance of High Ethical Standards in the Conduct of Research\" published by the Executive Council of the Association of American Medical Colleges and has been revised to be in compliance with the Public Health Service final rule entitled \"Responsibilities of Awardee and Applicant Institutions for Dealing With and Reporting Possible Miscondu ct in Science.\" It incorporates recommendations of the UAB Faculty Policies and Procedures Committee and the UAB Faculty Senate. Introduction The principles that govern scientific research and scholarship have long been established and have been applied by faculties and administrators for the discovery of new knowledge needed by mankind. The maintenance of high ethical standards in research based on these principles is a central and critical responsibility of faculties and administrators of academic institutions. Validity and accuracy in the collecting and reporting of data are intrinsically essential to the scientific process; dishonesty in these endeavors runs counter to the very nature of research, that is , the pursuit of truth. The responsibility of the academic community to the public is acknowledged. The maintenance of public trust in this pursuit is vital. In short, it is in the 25 best interest of the public and of academic institutions to prevent misc onduct in research and to deal effectively and responsibly with instances in which misconduct is suspected. Policy Statement 1. UAB shall accept as faculty members only those individuals whose career activities clearly demonstrate the highest ethical sta ndards. To this end, the credentials of all potential faculty are to be thoroughly examined by the appropriate department/unit heads or their representatives in order to verify the claimed accomplishments of the candidate. The appropriate department/unit heads or their representatives shall seek further confirmation of the candidate's accomplishments during the normal procedures of personal interviews and letters from references. Proof of faculty credentials shall be maintained by the appropriate dean or department head. 2. Faculty members who are in supervisory positions with regard to colleagues, fellows, technicians, and students are expected to work closely with those individuals to provide them with appropriate guidance and counsel to the end that those individuals continue to maintain the highest professional and ethical standards. 3. The faculty is encouraged to increase student and staff awareness of the importance of maintaining high ethical standards in research and to discuss issues related to re search ethics in formal courses, in seminars, and by other informal means. 4. Research results should be supported by verifiable evidence. Faculty and staff should maintain sufficient written records or other documentation of their studies. It is the responsibility of department/unit heads, division directors, and experienced investigators to develop among junior colleagues and students the necessary respect for careful recording and preservation of primary data. 5. The faculty is encouraged to engage in free discussion of results, to share data and techniques, and to avoid secrecy in the conduct of original investigations. It should be remembered that independent confirmation of results is important in direct proportion to the potential significance of th e results in question and may be crucial to the establishment of new concepts. 6. Faculty members are responsible for the quality of all reports based on their own efforts or on the collaborative work of students, technicians, or colleagues, especially those which bear the faculty member's name. The term \"reports\" as used here includes, but is not limited to, manuscripts submitted for publication and abstracts submitted for presentation at meetings. The same standards of scientific integrity apply to abstracts as to full -length publications. Abstracts or other reports of preliminary findings should indicate clearly that the findings are preliminary. No faculty member shall allow his or her name to be used on any report containing results for which that facu lty member cannot assume full professional and ethical responsibility. 7. Any UAB employee (including, but not limited to, regular and adjunct faculty, fellows, technicians, and student employees) or any UAB student who has reason to suspect any other employee or student of misconduct with regard to the conducting or reporting of research has the responsibility of following up these suspicions in accordance with the procedures outlined below. For purposes of this policy, \"misconduct\" means fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other practices which seriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the scientific community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research. It does not include honest error or honest differences in interpretations or judgments of data. Intentionally withholding information relevant to the investigation of an alleged case of misconduct, intentionally pressuring others to do so, or bringing malicious charges against another individual shall itself be considered m isconduct. Also, any act of interference, retaliation, or coercion by a UAB employee against a student or employee for using this policy is prohibited and is itself a violation of this policy. Procedures To Be Followed The \"Scientific Misconduct Allegation Review Checklist\" is to be used in conjunction with the procedures in t his section. It is the responsibility of student employees, trainees, fellows, faculty members, staff members, or other employees who become aware of misconduct in research and other scholarly activities to report such misconduct to one of the following: (a) their department/unit head, (b) the dean of the school in which their department/unit is located, or (c) the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer. In the case of graduate students or of trainees at any level, such eviden ce also may be reported to the Dean of the Graduate School. The individual receiving such evidence of misconduct must immediately report such evidence and the allegation of misconduct to the UAB Scientific Integrity O fficer, the department/unit head and the dean of the unit in which the allege d misconduct occurred, and the P rovost. If the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer determines that the allegation warrants initiation of the inquiry process, the inquiry shall be ini tiated immediately, and the Office of C ounsel shall be informed. Allegations of this nature are very serious matters, and all parties involved should take measures to assure that the positions and reputations of all individuals named in such allegations and all individuals who in good faith report apparent misconduct are protected. Details of the charge, the name of the accused, the identity of the individual bringing suspected fraud, and all other information 26 about the case shall be kept confidential as far as possible, compatible with investigating the case. Revealing confidential information to those not involved in the investigation shall itself be considered misconduct. Because UAB is interested in protecting the health and safety of research subjects , students, staff, and faculty and because UAB is responsible for protecting sponsored research funds and for ensuring that those funds are spent for the purposes for which they are given, if the situation warrants it, interim administrative action may be used prior to conclusion of either the inquiry or the investigation to provide for the protection of individuals and funds in accordance with existing UAB policy. Such action includes, but is not limited to, administrative suspension; re -assignment of student(s); involvement of the Institutional Review Board, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and the Office of Internal Audit -UAB; or notification of external sponsors when required by federal regulations. Initial Inquiry For purposes of this policy, \"inquiry\" means information gathering and initial fact finding to determine whether an allegation or apparent instance of scientific misconduct warrants an investigation. 1. The department/unit head or dean shall investigate immediately the charges through an inquiry process, including an interview with the suspected individual. The person conducting the inquiry shall ensure that individuals with the necessary and appropriate expertise are consulted concerning technical aspects of the activities in question. At least one of those individuals must be from outside the suspected individual's department. The record of the inquiry shall document the review of relevant evidence. The department/unit head or dean conducting the inquiry keep the UAB Scienti fic Integrity Officer informed and may request assistance from the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer. The UAB Scientific Integrity Officer shall keep the Office of Counsel informed during the inquiry process, and the Office of Counsel shall provide advice c oncerning procedural matters. In order to ensure that a real or apparent conflict of interest does not exist, the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer shall review the selection of persons to be involved in the inquiry. If it is determined that a conflict of i nterest exists, the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer is responsible for designating who will be involved in the inquiry . If UAB plans to terminate an inquiry for any reason prior to completion of the normal progression of such an inquiry, the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer shall notify the federal Office of Research Integrity and shall include in that notification a description of the reasons for termination of the inquiry. UAB will make every effort to complete the inquiry within 60 days of its initiation. If the inquiry extends beyond 60 days, the reasons for the extension will be documented by the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer and will be retained with the record of the inquiry. The written report of the inquiry shall state what evidence w as reviewed, shall indicate the relevant expertise of the persons reviewing the evidence, shall summarize the relevant interviews, and shall include the conclusions of the inquiry. The individual(s) against whom the allegation was made shall be given a cop y of the inquiry report and shall have an opportunity to make written comment regarding the report. This report, including a conclusion as to whether there is reasonable cause to believe that misconduct has occurred, shall be forwarded to the provost (with a copy to the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer) through the appropriate dean who should make whatever comment or recommendation is deemed warranted. 2. The Provost, with the advice and counsel of the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer and others as appropr iate, shall decide whether to close the matter or to appoint an Investigating Committee. If findings from the inquiry provide sufficient basis for conducting an investigation, the investigation must be started within 30 days of completion of the inquiry. The written report of the inquiry will be made available to the Investigating Committee. 3. If the Provost determines that it is not necessary to undertake an investigation, the Provost will report to the President the reasons for this decision and the fin dings of the inquiry. The report will be maintained in a secure manner for at least 3 years by the Office of the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer. Investigation For purposes of this policy, \"investigation\" means the formal examination and evaluation by a committee of all relevant facts to determine if scientific misconduct has occurred. 1. The Investigation Committee is appointed by the Provost and will elect its own chairperson. Members of the Committee shall consist of at least three tenured faculty me mbers who have the expertise to deal with technical aspects of the activities in question. At least two of these faculty members must be from outside the suspected individual's department. The Provost shall take precautions not to appoint any committee mem ber who has a real or apparent conflict of interest with the outcome of the investigation. The chairperson shall conduct meetings of the Investigating Committee as frequently as required in order to determine whether or not the activities in question do i ndeed constitute misconduct. All such meetings and the deliberations thereof shall be held in confidence to protect the affected individual or individuals. Those accused of misconduct shall be 27 Copyright Policy given a written summary of the charges and supporting evidence and shall be afforded an opportunity to appear before the Committee to comment on allegations. The accused may be represented by counsel. The Office of Counsel shall be kept informed of the investigation process and shall advise the Investigating Committee concerning procedural matters. The Committee should take no more than 60 days to complete its review and to prepare its report for submission to the President. UAB will make every effort to complete all investigative matters within 120 days from initiation of the investigation. This includes the work of the committee, preparing the report, submitting the report to the President, making the report available for comment by the subject(s) of the investigation, and submitting the final report to the federal Office of Research Integrity. If the investigation cannot be completed within 120 days, the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer shall request an extension from the federal Office of Research Integrity. The extension request will include an explanation for the delay, an interim report on progress to date, an outline of what remains to be done, and an estimated date of completion. If UAB plans to terminate an investigation for any reason prior to completion of the normal progression of such an investigation, the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer shall notify the federal Office of Research Integrity of UAB's plan to terminate the investigation and shall include a description of the reasons for such termination. 2. The President, based on the Investigating Committe e's findings and responses to those findings, shall determine what actions are appropriate. Appropriate actions may include discharge from employment at UAB or expulsion from UAB in the case of a student. Such actions shall be consistently applied througho ut UAB. The President will notify the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer who in turn will work with the Office of Grants and Contracts Administration to notify any agencies or foundations supporting the research in question and any journals or other publicat ions which may have been affected by the publication of results of that research. 3. The UAB Scientific Integrity Officer shall submit the report of the investigation to the federal Office of Research Integrity and shall include in that report the policie s and procedures under which the investigation was conducted, how and from whom information was obtained relevant to the investigation, the findings of the investigation, and the basis of the findings. Also included will be a description of any sanctions t aken by UAB and the actual text of, or an accurate summary of, the views of any individual(s) found to have engaged in scientific misconduct. Additional Notifications 1. If the Provost initiates a formal investigation, any agency or foundation supporting the research in question shall be notified by the Director of the Office of Grants and Contracts Administration upon receipt of information from the UAB Scientific Integrity Officer. Any such agency or foundation shall be notified immediately if it is asc ertained at any time during the initial inquiry or subsequent investigation that there is an immediate health hazard involved; an immediate need to protect federal funds or equipment; an immediate need to protect the interest of the persons making the allegations, the individuals who are the subject of the allegations, or any co -investigators and associates, if any; a probability that the alleged incident is going to be publicly reported; or a possibility that criminal violation has occurred. The agencies also will be given interim reports of any investigation should the circumstances warrant. 2. If the initial inquiry or the subsequent investigation indicates that the allegations are unsubstantiated, UAB will make diligent efforts to restore the reputation of those accused at UAB, with any involved funding agencies and elsewhere. 3. Any involved funding agencies shall be notified of the final outcome of any investigation.

As a general rule, creator(s) retain all rights to copyrightable works, unless subject to the conditions discussed in this section. A. Individual efforts : The copyrightable work produced by faculty, staff or students on their own initiative shall be th e exclusive property of such individual(s) unless the work was specifically commissioned or assigned (refer to Section B), or unless the work was prepared under the terms of a contract or grant, or unless preparation involved substantial use of University resources. Except in the cases covered in paragraphs B through E below, the ownership of books, scholarly articles/monographs, trade publications, maps, charts, articles in popular magazines and newspapers, novels, nonfiction works, supporting materials, artistic works, syllabi, lecture notes, and like works will reside with the creator(s) and any revenue derived from their work will belong to the creator(s). B. University assigned efforts : The copyright in a copyrightable work prepared by faculty, staff or st udents in the course of their regular employment duties or by special direction or commission shall be the property of the University. Such condition of employment or such directions shall be in writing and shall be agreed to in advance by both the Univers ity and the individual. A faculty member's general obligation to produce scholarly and creative works does not constitute a University assignment in the context of this paragraph. Works created by students in the normal course of their coursework, such as a term paper, thesis/dissertation or similar scholarly work, does not constitute a University assignment in the context of this paragraph. A copyright agreement provided for the sharing of royalties, as discussed later in this policy, may, at the discretio n of the University, be entered into by the University and the individual in regard to the work. C. Sponsor supported efforts : Copyright ownership in copyrightable materials developed during work supported partially or in full by an outside sponsor, through a contract or grant with the University, is determined by the applicable provisions of such contract or grant. In the absence of any governing provision, the ownership of any copyright shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs A, B, D or E herein. D. University- assisted individual efforts : A copyrightable work that is developed with substantial use of University resources and is not sponsor -supported hall be the property of the University. \"Substantial use\" of institutional resources may include the commitment of staff, faculty or material support in the creation of the copyrightable work, but does not include the ordinary use of the University's libraries, faculty time, faculty offices, departmental office equipment, routine secretarial support or University owned personal computers. Should a question arise as to whether substantial use of University resources has occurred or may occur, a determination will be made by the Provost of his or her designee. E. Distance Learning : With respect to distance learni ng materials, ownership of such materials shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs A through D above. F. Shop Rights : \"Shop Rights\" means a non - exclusive, non -transferable, royalty -free license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, or make derivative works of the copyrighted work, for educational or research purposes only. Except for textbooks and articles published in scholarly journals, the University shall have shop rights to copyrighted materials developed by its faculty, staff and students, pursuant to paragraph A above, and faculty, staff and students of the University shall have shop rights to copyrighted materials owned by the University, pursuant to paragraphs B and E above; provided, however, that no faculty, staff or student shall use any shop rights hereunder in competition with the University while such individual is employed by the University. Disclosure There is no mandatory disclosure requirement for works created by faculty, staff or students for works that meet the criteria set forth in paragraph A 29 Computer Software Copying and Use Policy above. For works that meet the criteria set forth in paragraphs B, C, or D, the creator must disclose the existence of the work during or immediately after its creation. Disclosure shall be made in writing to the creator's unit leader and to The UAB Research Foundation. If any questions exist regarding whether disclosure is required, contact The UAB Research Foundation. Commercialization/Distribution of Net Revenues All costs and revenues from the commercialization of any intellectual property hereunder, owned by the University, shall be distribute d in accordance with the University's Patent Policy ( approved by the Board of Trustees on February 23, 1980, and revised on January 14, 1986 ). Nothing contained in this policy shall be construed to supersede the University's Patent Policy or Computer Software Policy ( approved on January 14, 1986, corrected on may 28, 1986, and edited February 26, 1996), and the terms of the University's Patent Policy and Computer Software Policy shall control in the case of any conflict between those policies and this policy. July 13, 1999 Introduction Respect for the intellectual work of others is a tradition at UAB. UAB va lues the free exchange of ideas but not plagiarism or the unauthorized copying of computer software, including programs, applications, and data. Under federal copyright law, it is illegal to make a copy of computer software except for archival or back -up purposes without the permission of the copyright holder. Therefore, unauthorized copying of computer software or its documentation is illegal for substantial damages. The person responsible may be held liable. All state and federal laws and UAB policies mu st be adhered to in the use of UAB's computer equipment and systems. Any use of UAB equipment that violates copyright law or licensure contracts, that compromises or attempts to compromise the integrity of UAB -based or any other computers or computer syste ms, or that involves gambling or other illegal activity also is forbidden and may subject the computer user to criminal, civil, and/or UAB sanctions. Any use of UAB's software, including shareware, must comply with all copyright laws and with the terms of the license granted by the software owner, including any prohibitions against simultaneous use on multiple computers. Unauthorized use or copying of any software (whether or not owned by UAB) is not permitted on any UAB equipment. This policy covers compu ter software which has been purchased by, acquired by, donated to, and/or licensed to, UAB and includes software that is bundled with, or preloaded on, computer systems purchased by UAB. It also includes software downloaded from networks (including the Int ernet), and in those instances it is important for UAB users and departments/units to ensure that any such commercial software or shareware may legally be downloaded, that the software is freeware, or that the software is in the public domain. UAB and individuals must comply with all terms and conditions of software downloaded from networks, including the Internet. If computer software carries a UAB copyright, it may be used and distributed by UAB as long as such distribution is in keeping with the desires of the originating department/unit and is not in violation of the \"Computer Software Policy.\" If a UAB determination of interest in licensing the software is pending, the software would be considered non -UAB software for the purposes of this policy until such time that UAB determines its interest in licensing the software. This policy does not alter the categories of software and the rights pertaining thereto as indicated in the UAB \"Computer Software Policy.\" Definitions For purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply: \" Computer software \" includes, but is not limited to, purchased or commercial software, sound, graphics, images, or datasets; shareware, freeware; and electronically stored documentation and the media that hold it. Not include d in the definition as used in this policy are noncopyrighted computer data files that have no significance beyond the individual or department/unit. \" UAB software \" is defined as computer software purchased or acquired by a UAB department o r unit or by a UAB employee as part of his or her role at UAB. It includes software donated to UAB or software purchased by related foundations and donated for use by UAB. It includes computer programs written by UAB employees or students if creating such software is a U AB-associated effort. \" Non-UAB software \" is defined as computer software purchased, acquired, or created by an individual(s) and not officially acquired by a UAB department or unit. \" UAB -associated efforts \" (related to computer software development) is d efined relative to the UAB \"Computer Software Policy\" as UAB -assisted efforts and UAB -assigned efforts. Policy Statement It is the policy of the University of Alabama at Birmingham to comply with copyright law and license agreements enter ed into with vendors or authors of computer software. No illegally obtained 30 or illegally copied (often referred to as \"pirated\") computer software is allowed at UAB. UAB does not, and will not, condone illegal copying of computer software or the use of illegally copied or obtained computer software. Anyone connected with UAB who causes unauthorized computer software to be installed or loaded in connection with his or her role at UAB is in violation of this policy. Whenever a staff member, faculty member, contractor of ser vices to UAB, student, or visitor to the campus, in connection with his or her role at UAB, receives a copy of computer software from UAB, requests software to be loaded or installed on a UAB computer, or loads or installs computer software on a UAB computer, he or she must abide by the stipulations included in the license agreements associated with that computer software. It is the responsibility of anyone requesting installation of, or installing or loading, computer software onto a UAB computer to be fam iliar with the license agreements for that computer software, as documented by the vendor. Individual employees are accountable for software they load or install on UAB computers or which they supply for loading or installing on the department's or unit's computers or networks. They also are accountable for any existing software on UAB computers over which they have control . The installation or use of non -UAB software on UAB computers is prohibited unless approved in writing by the department/unit head. The department/unit head may choose to give blanket permission to an individual on a per- machine basis. The non- UAB software should be free of viruses or other destructive mechanisms to the greatest extent possible and must be used for legitimate UAB purposes directly related to UAB's instruction, research, and service activities. Taking UAB -owned computer software home or elsewhere off campus to use on a non -UAB computer, even if the purpose is to perform UAB - related work, also is prohibited unless such u se is authorized in writing and is permitted in the license agreement associated with the computer software. This constitutes theft of UAB property unless the software license specifically allows concurrent use and such use has been approved in writing by one's supervisor or department/unit head. If the software license does not allow such use and a department/unit requests an employee to perform such work, the department/unit should purchase a separate copy of the software for installation on the employee' s computer. A computer lab or a department/unit with publicly accessible computers which allows non - UAB software to be installed temporarily on the network or computers for purposes such as completing class assignments, printing documents, converting docu ment formats, etc., must have documented procedures in place for removing any non-UAB software installed on the computers. This practice is not considered a violation of this policy as long as use of the non -UAB software on such UAB computers is directly r elated to UAB's instruction, research, and services activities. Proof of Ownership of Software Computer software purchased by, and/or licensed to, UAB is an institutional resource and, therefore, should be safeguarded and accounted for in the same manner as other UAB resources. All commercial computer software license agreements, records of purchase, and original and back -up disks (or other software distribution media) must be kept by the department/unit in a safe place and must be made available for revi ew or inspection. All license or use agreements for shareware or freeware computer software also must be available for inspection. Likewise, any written authorizations for the use of UAB -owned software on non- UAB computers must be available for inspection. The following are examples of documents which can be used to show ownership or right to use software: A. The dated purchase order, invoice, or sales receipt for purchased software or proof of a site - license agreement covering all copies in use or access ible by users in the department. B. The original software distribution media. C. The original documentation. D. Vendor software that is bundled with, or preloaded on, computer systems purchased by UAB, an itemized listing of the software on the dated purchase order, invoice, or sales receipt for the computer. E. For software downloaded from external networks or acquired from noncommercial sources, a statement indicating the nature of the software (for example, downloadable commercial software, shareware, freeware, or public domain), the use and registration requirements for the software, and proof of registration of the software, when applicable. Acquisition of software universally known to be available free to educational institutions and/or to the gene ral public does not have to be documented. (Note: Examples of statements to document legality of downloaded software include, but are not limited to, receipts for payment of shareware registration, printed copies of e -mail messages if the user is required to e-mail the author, screen prints of the status of freeware or public domain software, etc.) It is recognized that the extent of documentation needed for freeware or public domain software will not be as extensive as for other types of software. These proofs of purchase/ownership must cover all copies in use or accessible by users in the department. Software License Registration Registration with the author(s) or vendor(s) of computer software purchased by, or received from, 31 Patent Policy UAB for installation on a U AB computer in connection with one's role at UAB must include UAB or one's department/unit as the licensee. Applicability This policy applies to all staff, faculty, students, contractors of services to UAB, and visitors. Disciplinary Action A violation of this policy by employees, including faculty, shall result in disciplinary action according to established UAB disciplinary procedures up to, and including, discharge for nonfaculty employees and termination for cause for faculty employees. A violation of this policy by a student constitutes nonacademic misconduct and the student will be subject to established disciplinary action. Implementation The Vice President for Information Technology is responsible for overall procedures to implement this policy . The executive Director of the UAB University Hospital is responsible for specific procedures to cover implementation in Hospital departments/units. June 19, 2009 Purpose In view of the far -reaching research on the various campuses of The Board of Trustees of The University of Alabama (hereinafter referred to as University), it is inevitable that new discoveries and inventions will be made. The members of the Board of Trust ees (hereinafter referred to as the Board) recognize the importance of obtaining the greatest public benefit and usefulness from the products of the University's scientific research and inventiveness, and that the protection and control provided under patent laws or other legal means for the protection of property rights may be necessary to obtain this goal. It is further recognized that employees of the University need assistance in determining and evaluating patentability and in prosecuting patent applica tions for or otherwise protecting inventions made by them. Furthermore, many such inventions involve equities beyond those of the inventor since the use of University facilities, the assignment of duties as a condition of employment, and the use of research funds with contractual obligations regarding patent rights give rise to questions concerning the rights and equities of all concerned. The purpose of this patent policy is to establish a mechanism to serve the public benefit and interest, to determine an d apprise all concerned parties of relative rights and equities, to facilitate patent applications, the licensing of inventions, the equitable distribution of any royalties or other financial returns, to provide necessary uniformity in patent matters, and to provide for adequate reporting of patent activities. Policy and Procedure A. It shall be the policy of the Board to encourage the concept that patentable inventions produced at the University shall be used for the greatest possible public benefit and to provide every reasonable incentive to the faculty, students and staff for the disclosure, evaluation and dissemination of such inventions. When University support makes the research effort possible or when it provides support for the development of a pa tentable invention, it is reasonable for the University to participate in the fruits of such development, including reimbursement for its costs. To that end, the University encourages the procurement of patents for such inventions and the licensing or othe r commercialization thereof in the interest of the public, the inventor, and the University. B. The President of each campus shall appoint an officer or Patent Committee or designate a non -profit organization established for the benefit of the campus to administer this policy. Each campus President may promulgate additional regulations and guidelines pursuant to this Policy to administer this policy within his/her respective campus. C. This patent policy of the University, as amended from time to time, shall be deemed to be a condition of employment and contractual obligation, both while employed and thereafter, of every employee of each campus, including student employees, and a condition of enrollment and attendance and contractual obligation, both wh ile in attendance and thereafter, by every student at each campus. D. Any invention or discovery (1) which is the result of research carried on by or under the direction of an employee of a campus of the University and/or having the costs thereof paid f rom funds provided by, under the control of or administered by a campus of the University, or (2) which is made by an employee of a campus of the University and which relates to the employee's field of work, or (3) which has been developed in whole or in part by the utilization of resources or facilities belonging to a campus of the University, shall be the property of the applicable campus of the University. The applicability of the above stated criteria to any invention or discovery will be determined at the sole discretion of the President of the respective campus of the University or his/her designee. E. As a condition of their employment by or enrollment at a campus of the University, each faculty member, employee and student agrees that 32 Employee Falsification of UAB Records and Documents he/she shall be contractually bound by this patent policy as implemented by the respective campuses of the University and shall report to the officer or non - profit organization so designated by the President of the campus of the University to manage and commercialize such inventions and discoveries with respect to that campus, any invention or discovery which such faculty member, employee or student has conceived, discovered, developed and/or reduced to practice by them or under their direction at any time following their initial appointment by, employment by, or enrollment with that campus of the University. All inventions and discoveries that meet the criteria of II.D. shall be automatically assigned to the University for the benefit of the appropriate campus of the U niversity immediately upon creation or discovery or reduction to practice of the invention or discovery. The President of each campus of the University is authorized to further assign any invention or discovery it is deemed to own pursuant to this policy to a designated nonprofit organization established for the benefit of the respective campus of the University, which said assignment shall be conditioned on full compliance with this policy, regulations promulgated hereunder by the Board or by the President of the respective campus of the University, and appropriate state and federal law. F. If the invention or discovery is one which is determined to be owned by a campus of the University, the President of the applicable campus or his/her designee shall further evaluate the invention or discovery and determine if and how best to develop, commercialize and protect the invention as he/she deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, applying for patent protection, or requesting further development of the invention or discovery. In making this determination, the benefits that might accrue to both the campus of the University and the inventor(s) shall be considered. The designee shall act promptly in carrying out these duties so that the rights of the inventor(s) and the campus of the University may be protected. G. If it is determined that the invention or discovery is one which is owned by the University pursuant to this policy but is one in which a campus of the University has no interest in retaining ownership, a campus of the University (or the non- profit organization to which an invention may have been assigned in accordance with the terms of this policy) may, but is under no obligation to, release its ownership rights to the inventor(s) on terms and conditions determined by the President or his/her designee, subject to any third party rights. H. In consideration of the automatic assignment of ownership set forth in this policy, the Presidents or their designees are authorized to pay to the invent ors, their heirs or assigns, a percentage of the royalties, fees, or other financial returns received by the campus of the University (or the non- profit organization to which an invention may have been assigned in accordance with the terms of this policy) from such invention after a deduction of fifteen percent (15%) thereof for overhead costs, plus a deduction for costs of patenting and protection of intellectual property rights and any unusual expenses paid by the campus or its non- profit designee or the inventor (which have been approved by the campus or its non -profit designee). Each campus President shall be responsible for the development of a policy governing the percentage of royalties, fees, and other financial returns on an invention paid to the inventor and governing the internal distribution of the campus of the University's share of such financial returns. I. It is understood that many research contracts, grants, and consulting agreements from or with the United States Government or its agencies, corporations, or individuals contain ownership of intellectual property clauses that may be at variance with this policy but which, if agreed to, require compliance. Such documents which are at variance with this policy may be referred to the appropria te designated officer of the campus for recommendations prior to approval. J. Annual reports of patent matters will be made to the Chancellor for his/her information and that of the Board within thirty days (30) following the end of each fiscal year, to include as a minimum identification of each patent and patent applied for, the distribution of patent revenue including the share going to the inventor, and the expenses of obtaining and managing patents. The Chancellor may prescribe appropriate formats f or such reporting. April 20, 1998 NOTE: Falsification of documents and records by a student who is not functioning in a UAB employee capacity is considered nonacademic misconduct and is handled in a ccordance with regulations covering nonacademic misconduct. See Direction Student Handbook . Introduction As a health -care, research, and educational institution, the University of Alabama at Birmingham is acutely interested in issues relating to the integrity of its employees. For purposes of this policy, falsification of records exists when a UAB employee is discovered to have provided false information on the 33 UAB Student Records Policy employment application; to have failed to dis close requested information; knowingly to have falsified information; or knowingly to have recorded false information on any UAB document or record, regardless of format and includ ing electronic communications. The following is a partial list of infraction s which are specifically prohibited: falsifying information on an application for initial employment or for transfer; falsifying employee recruitment/credential records; falsifying employee expense account records or other reimbursement records; falsifying personnel/ payroll documents (including, but not limited to, pay records, time sheets, or other types of time records); clocking the time card/time record of another employee or completing and submitting for approval the time sheet/time record of another employee; falsifying health records or vacation/sick leave records; falsifying research records, medical records, or departmental administrative records; and falsifying student records (including, but not limited to, admissions application materials, trans cripts, grade sheets, registration documents, and student identification documents). Policy Statement Falsification of UAB records or documents is prohi bited. Any knowing or negligent misrepresentation of a material fact or any failure to make a complete disclosure of any requested information are causes for immediate discharge without notice or pay in lieu of notice for nonfaculty employees or termination for cause for faculty employees. Any exception to the immediate and automatic discharge of nonfacult y employees for these reasons must be approved in writing by the Chief Human Resources Officer. Any exception to the recommendation of termination for cause for faculty for these reasons must be approved in writing by the Provost and by the Chief Human Res ources Officer. Implementation The Office of the Vice President for Financial Affairs and Administration is responsible for procedures to implement this policy as it relates to employee or departmental administrative records. The Office of the Provost i s responsible for procedures to implement this policy as it relates to academic records, research records, or faculty recruitment/credential records. The General Education Provisions Act, Section 438, as amended, and the regulations promulgated for the enforcement of the act, found at 45 Federal Register 30911, as amended at 45 Federal Register 86296, provide that all students enrolled or previously enr olled at the University of Alabama at Birmingham have the following rights in relation to their educational records: I. General Policy No information from records, files, or other data directly related to a student, other than public information defined below, shall be disclosed to individuals or agencies outside the university without the written consent of the student, except those disclosures set forth in paragraph IX. II. Definition of Educational Record Student educational records are defined as those records, files, documents, and other material which contain information directly related to students and which are maintained by UAB or a party acting for UAB. Records of instructional, supervisory, and admi nistrative personnel which are in the sole possession of the maker and accessible only to the maker or a substitute are specifically excluded from this definition of educational record. Educational records of students are not available to UAB Police person nel, and records of the University Police, which, at UAB, are maintained separately from educational records, are maintained solely for purpose of law enforcement, and are not disclosed to individuals other than law enforcement personnel of the same jurisd iction, are not part of the educational record. Records which are made or maintained by physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, or other professionals or paraprofessionals and which are maintained in connection with treatment and are not available to anyone else are also excluded from a student's educational record, but such records are available to another physician or appropriate professional of the student's choice if requested. Records which only contain information relating to a person after that per son is no longer a student are not considered part of the student's educational record. III. Definition of Student For the purpose of this policy a student is defined as any individual currently or previously enrolled in any academic offering of UAB. It d oes not include prospective students. IV. Public Information The following is a list of public information which may be made available by the university without prior consent of the student and which is considered part of the public record of the student' s attendance: Name, telephone number, email address, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, and institution most recently previously attended. The information will not be made available if a student 34 directs a written instruction to the appropriate records official prior to the end of the registration period for any given term. V. Types and Location of Records Each school maintains a file on each student enrolled, containing applications, grade reports or other performance evaluations, and correspondence. Some departments or programs maintain similar files. The counseling service, career services, and financial aid offices maintain a file o n students who use those services. The university has designated the following officials as responsible for student records within their respective areas: University Registrar, Room 207, Hill University Center; Dean, Graduate School, Room 511, Hill University Center; Director of Student Affairs, School of Dentistry, Room 207, School of Dentistry Building; Assistant Director/Registrar,, School of Medicine, Room P100, Volker Hall; Director of Student Affairs, School of Optometry, Room 104, School of Optometry Building; The above shall hereinafter be referred to as \"records officials.\" Each of these records officials is responsible for maintaining a listing of student records within such records official's area of responsibility, indicating the location and gen eral content of the records. Any student request concerning records or files, including requests that public information not be disclosed, requests for disclosure to third parties, and requests for access by the student should be directed to this official. Forms for all such requests may be obtained from these officials. These persons will also act as hearing officers when the content of a record is challenged as provided below. VI. Disclosure of Student Records to the Student The student is accorded the r ight to inspect, in the presence of a university staff member, records, files, and data primarily and directly related to the student. To inspect a file a student should go to the office of the appropriate records official and initiate a request in writing . If a student desires to obtain copies of the items in the educational record rather than personally reviewing the record, the written request to the records official for copies must be signed and notarized to prevent disclosure to persons other than the student. A time for inspection shall be granted within forty -five days of the date of the request, and copies will be mailed within the same time period. Copies shall be made and provided to the student at a cost to the student equal to actual cost of reproduction and payable in advance. The right of inspection does not include financial statements of parents, confidential recommendations placed in the file prior to January 1,1975, provided that such recommendations were solicited with a written assurance o f confidentiality or sent or retained with a documented understanding of confidentiality and used only for the purpose solicited, and other confidential recommendations, access to which has been waived by the student in accordance with paragraph VIII. VII. Challenging the Contents of the Record UAB will respond to any reasonable request for an explanation or interpretation of any item in a student's file. Requests for such explanation or interpretation should be addressed in writing to the appropriate reco rds official. If, after inspecting a record, a student believes that information contained in the educational record is inaccurate or misleading or violates his or her privacy, the student may request that the record be amended by presenting such request i n writing to the appropriate records official. A request that the record be amended shall be answered by the records official within fifteen days of its receipt with information that the record has been amended as requested or that the record has not been amended and that the student has a right to a hearing on the matter. A written request for a hearing should be addressed to the appropriate records official as listed in V, who will set a date and time for hearing with reasonable notice of same to the student within forty- five days of receiving the request. The request for hearing should identify the item or items in the file to be challenged and state the grounds for the challenge, e.g., inaccuracy, misleading nature, inappropriateness. The records offic ial shall examine the contested item, shall hear the person responsible for placing the item in the file if appropriate, and shall examine any documents or hear any testimony the student wishes to present. A student may be assisted or represented by indivi duals of his or her choice, including an attorney, at his or her own expense. The records official may decide that the item should be retained or that it should be deleted or altered. The records official shall issue a written decision, based solely on the evidence presented at the hearing, within ten days of the conclusion of the hearing. If the decision is adverse to the student, the notice of decision shall include a statement that the student has the right to place a statement in the record commenting o n the information and/or setting forth reasons for disagreeing with the decision. VIII. Waiver of Access UAB may request that a student waive the student's right to inspect confidential recommendations respecting that student's application for admission, provided that the student be notified, upon request, of the names of all those providing the recommendations, the recommendations are used only for the purpose solicited, and the waiver is not a condition of admission or any other benefit. 35 Confidential recommendations respecting application for employment or the receipt of an honor or other recognition may also be waived. A waiver may be revoked with respect to actions occurring after revocation by so notifying the records official in writing. IX. Providi ng Records to Third Parties The general policy of UAB is to refuse access to or disclosure of information from student records to third parties without the written consent of the student. Should a student wish to have such records released, a signed and dated written request must be directed to the proper records official, specifying the records to be released, the reason for release, the party or class of parties to whom records are to be released, and a request for copies to the student, if desired. UAB w ill then transfer or grant access to the information. The transferred information shall contain a statement that the information may be used by the receiving party or, if an organization, by its officers, agents, and employees for the purpose requested, bu t that the party shall not transfer the information to any other party except with the written consent of the student. A charge not to exceed the actual cost of reproduction will be assessed against the student when copies are made for the party or the student. Student records are available to the following persons with the accompanying conditions without written consent of the student: 1. Instructional or administrative personnel whose duties include responsibilities to students which in the institution reas onably require access to student records. 2. Officials of other schools in which a student seeks to enroll. UAB will make a reasonable attempt to notify the student of the transfer, as well as the student's right to a copy, upon request, and the right to a h earing to challenge the contents if desired. 3. Certain representatives of federal departments or agencies or state educational authorities as provided by the law. In absence of consent or specific authorization by federal law of the collection of personally identifiable data, data collected by excepted officials shall be protected in a manner which will not permit personal identification of students and parents by other than those officials, and personally identifiable data shall be destroyed when no longer needed. 4. Financial aid officers or their assistants in connection with the application for or receipt of financial aid, provided that personally identifiable information may only be disclosed for the purpose of determining eligibility, amount, and conditio ns and to enforce terms and conditions. 5. Organizations conducting studies for administrative evaluation, tests, etc., provided that studies are not conducted in a manner which will permit personal identification of students or their parents by other than r epresentatives of the organization and that the information will be destroyed when no longer needed for the purposes collected. 6. Accrediting organizations. 7. Other appropriate persons in an emergency to protect health or safety of students or others. In det ermining appropriateness of disclosure, consideration will be given to the seriousness of the threat to health or safety of the student and others, the need for information to meet the emergency, whether the parties requesting information are in a position to deal with the emergency, and the extent to which time is of the essence. 8. In response to lawful subpoena or court order. UAB will keep a record, indicating the name and legitimate interest, of all disclosures except those made to a student, those made pursuant to written consent, those designated as public information, and those made to persons at UAB with a legitimate educational interest. This record of disclosure will become a part of the educational record, subject to inspection and review. X. The UAB Student Records Policy shall be published in the catalog of each school, and a copy shall be displayed prominently on a bulletin board in each school. In order to comply with the requirement that UAB give annual notice of this policy to enrolled stude nts, a short notice of the policy shall be included in the Class Schedule for each term. XI. Any student who believes that UAB has violated his or her right to access or privacy of educational records as established by the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the accompanying regulations published at 45 Federal Register 30911, as amended at 45 Federal Register 86296, and this policy may address a complaint to: The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Office Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W. Washington, D.C. 20202 36 UAB Residency Determination and Appeal Process Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy May 17 , 2012 UAB students are governed by the Board of Trustees' Non-Resident Tuition Policy , which addresses non -resident tuition, certification of residency status by campus officials, and establishment of campus procedures to administer an appeals process. The following guidelines implement certain provisions of the Board policy . Implementation Guidelines The Office of the Registrar, the Graduate School, and the admissions/registration offices of the professional schools, as appropriate, are designated as the offices empowered at UAB to determine and certify \"reside nt\" or \"non -resident\" student status. These offices are responsible for documenting each residency status evaluation and for maintaining th records used to substantiate that evaluation. As the provisions of Section II. 3 of the Board policy indicate, \"thou gh certification of an address and intent to remain in the state indefinitely are prerequisites to establishing status as a resident, ultimate determination of that status shall be made by the institution by its evaluation of the presence or absence of connections with the state of Alabama.\" However, meeting the specific criteria included in Section II of the Board policy may not in all circumstances result in certification as a \"resident student.\" All facts and circumstances surrounding a person's residenc y determination are considered, and no one fact is determinative. Also, according to the provisions of the Board policy, UAB has been given the authority to expand, and has by separate Board resolution expanded, the definition of \"resident student\" to enc ompass all the categories in Sections III. A and III. B of the Board policy. In general, international students who have not been issued a U.S. resident alien card may not be considered for residency status for tuition purposes, unless they hold a graduate assistantship or fellowship and meet certain criteria. Internationla students who have been issued a U.S. resident alien card will be considered for residency status for tuition purposes in the same manner as are U.S. citizens. Initial residency determin ations are made at the point of admission to UAB. This initial determination may be appealed in writing by the student to the appropriate residency officer by the posted deadline. Decisions made by the residency officer may be appealed in writing by the student to the University Registrar who may, at his or her discretion, convene a review committee composed of appropriate UAB officials. Students may appeal the Registrar's decision to the Vice Provost for Administration and Quality Improvement. November 8, 2011 Policy Statement The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) hereby reaffirms its policy of equal opportunity in education and employment . Equal Employment Opportunity The University of Alabama at Birmingham is expressly committed to maintaining and promoting nondiscrimination in all aspects of recruitment and employment of individuals at all levels throughout UAB. In accordance with applicable law, UAB prohibits, and will not tolerate, discrimination in any personnel actions, UAB programs, and UAB facilities on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability unrelated to job performance, veteran status, or genetic or family medical history. In addition, UAB prohibits, and will not tolerate, discrimination against individuals on the basis o f their sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. UAB also complies with the Age Discrimination in Employment Act which prohibits employment discrimination against persons 40 years of age or older. UAB will not tolerate any conduct by an administrator, supervisor, faculty, or staff member which constitutes any form of prohibited discrimination. All personnel actions, programs, and facilities are administered in accordance with UAB's equal opportunity commitment and affirmative action plan. UAB will state its position as an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer in all solicitations and advertisements for employment vacancies placed by, or on behalf of, UAB. UAB will broadly publish and circulate its policy of equal employment opportunity by including a statement in all media communication and printed matter for employment purposes. Further, UAB will consider, through appropriate established procedures, complaints of any individual who has reason to believe that he or she has been affected by prohibited discrimination. See also the \"Complaints\" section below. Equal Education Opportunity As an institution of higher education and in the spirit of its policies of equal employment opportunity, UAB hereby reaffirms its policy of equal educational opportunity. UAB prohibits, and will not tolerate, discrimination in admission, 37 educational programs, and other student matters on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, national origin, disability unrelated to program performance, veteran status, or genetic or family medical history. Complaints by any applicant or student who has reason to think he or she has been affected by discrimination will be considered through appropriate established procedures. See also the \"Complaints\" section below. This policy must be included in all student handbooks and catalogs. The following summary statement may be printed in other UAB publications: The University of Alabama at Birmingham prohibits discrimination in admission, educational programs, and other student matters on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, national origin, disability unrelated to program performance, veteran status or genetic or family medical history . Discriminatory Harassment Policy In keeping with its commitment to maintaining an environment that is free of unlawful discrimination and in keeping with its legal obligations, UAB prohibits unlawful harassment (and discouraging conduct that, while not unlawful, could reasonably be considered unwelcome). Discriminatory harassment of any kind is not appropriate at UAB, whether it is sexual harassment or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, national origin, disability unrelated to program performance, veteran status, genetic or family med ical history, or any factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law. At the same time, UAB recognizes the centrality of academic freedom and its determination to protect the full and frank discussion of ideas. Thus, discriminatory harassm ent does not refer to the use of materials about or discussion of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, national origin, disability unrelated to program performance, veteran status, or genetic or family me dical history for scholarly purposes appropriate to the academic context, such as class discussions, academic conferences, or meetings. A. Definitions and Description of Prohibited Conduct. 1. Sexual Harassment Harassment on the basis of s ex is a violation of Section 703 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when: Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment (or a student's status) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions (or academic decisions) affecting such individual or Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance (or a student's academic performance) or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work (or academic) environment. Under the law, sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments or conduct of a socially acceptable nature. Nor does it refer to the use of materials or discussion related to sex and/or gender for sc holarly purposes appropriate to the academic context. It does refer to non- academic remarks or actions of a sexual nature that are not welcome and are likely to be viewed as personally offensive. This can include but is not limited to any of the followin g activities that are unwelcome by the recipient: physical or verbal advances; sexual flirtations; propositions; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; vulgar talk or jokes; degrading graphic materials or verbal comments of a sexual nature about an individual or his or her appearance; the display of sexually suggestive objects outside a scholarly context and purpose; and physical contact of a sexual or particularly personal nature. Cartoons, pictures, or other graphic materials that create a hostile or offensive working environment may also be considered as harassment. In addition, no one should imply or threaten that an employee's, applicant's, or student's \"cooperation\" with unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors (or refusal thereof) will have any effect on the individual's employment, assignment, compensation, advancement, career development, grades, or any other condition of employment or status as a student. 2. Discriminatory Harassment of a Non -Sexual Nature The same principles related to sexual harassment also apply to harassment on the basis of any characteristic that is protected by law. Thus, UAB's policy prohibits discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature, which includes verbal, physical, or graphic conduct that denigrate s or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability unrelated to job performance, veteran status, genetic or family medical history, or other status protected by applicable law and that Has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive employment, educational, or living environment; or 38 Has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or a student's academ ic performance. UAB also adopts these principles with regard to discrimination or discriminatory harassment on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. Prohibited behavior may, for example, include conduct or material (ph ysical, oral, written, or graphic, including e -mail messages, text messaging or use of social media posted or circulated in the community) involving epithets, slurs, negative stereotyping, or threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts, that serves no schol arly purpose appropriate to the academic context and gratuitously denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, national origin, d isability unrelated to program performance, veteran status, genetic or family medical history, or any factor protected by applicable law. 3. Applicability of Policy In determining whether the conduct at issue is sufficient to constitute discriminato ry harassment in violation of this policy, the conduct will be analyzed from the objective standpoint of a \"reasonable person\" under similar circumstances. No violation of the policy should be found if the challenged conduct would not create a hostile env ironment (i.e., substantially affect the work environment of a \"reasonable person.\") See EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment at www.eeoc.gov . All harassing conduct prohibited by this policy, whether committed by faculty, staff, administrators, or students, is strictly prohibited and will bring prompt and appropriate disciplinary action, including possible termination of employment or permanent exclusion from UAB. This policy shall apply to any UAB -sponsored event or program, whether on or off campus, or other situations in which an individual is acting as a member of the UAB community. The level of discipline imposed will depend upon the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct, which may b e determined by the existence of prior incidents of harassment or discrimination. Depending upon the severity of the offense, however, a single violation of this policy may be sufficient for termination of employment or expulsion from an academic program. B. Prohibition Against Retaliation. Retaliation against an individual who, in good faith, complains about or participates in an investigation of an allegation of discrimination or harassment is prohibited. Any individual who feels he or she has been retaliated against, or has been threatened with retaliation, should report that allegation immediately to the Office of the Vice President for Equity and Diversity or to the Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer. C. False Accusations. Anyone who knowingly makes a false accusation of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation will be subject to appropriate sanctions. However, failure to prove a claim of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation does not, in and of itself, constitute proof of a knowing false accusation. Complaints For purposes of this policy, a \"complaint\" is a formal notification (usually in writing) of the belief that prohibited discrimination has occurred. Prior to filing a formal complaint, an individual is strongly encouraged to resolve a discrimination allegation through an informal process. UAB Staff, Faculty, and Students: The procedure for resolving allegations when both the individual making the complaint and the person against whom the complaint is made are employed or enrolled at UAB is described in the sections entitled \"Informal Resolution Procedure\" and \"Submitting a Formal Complaint.\" All Others: Situations that involve other individuals (for example, visitors, patients, alumni or former students, applicants for admission or employment, or former employees) who believe they have been discriminated against by someone either employed by, or enrolled at, UAB are to be addressed through the process entitled \"Informal Resolution Procedure\". Informal Resolution Procedure (NOTE: Procedures similar to the following informal process are also included in UAB's \"Problem Resolution Procedure for Nonfaculty Employees\" and in the UAB Faculty Handbook and Policies .) Although none of the actions set forth below is required before an individual is eligible to file a formal complaint, UAB encourages use of these mechanisms for informal resolution of the complaint. This list is not exhaustive. Actions taken using any of these mechanisms do not necessarily constitute a finding of discrimination. 1. One-on-one Meeting. The person making the complaint is encouraged to meet with the person whose behavior is considered discriminatory to discuss the situation and to seek resolution. 2. Intervention by Supervisor, Manager, or Department/Unit Head. The person making the complaint is encouraged to contact his/her supervisor to request assistance with resolving the allegation of discrimination. 3. Facilitated Conversation. If one -on-one meetings or intervention by departmental officials as indicated above do not resolve the discrimination allegation, the individual making the complaint may 39 Drug -Free Campus Policy for Students conta ct the appropriate office to request the assistance of a \"facilitator.\" Facilitated conversations allow the parties involved to discuss the relevant issues in order to seek mutually agreeable solutions. Individuals may contact the following for assistanc e with any aspect of the Informal Resolution Procedure: Employees may contact their assigned HR Consultant or Employee Relations. Faculty employees may contact the Office of the Provost or Employee Relations. Students may contact the Office of the Vice Provost for Student and Faculty Success. Disability Support Services is available for consultation in any instances involving disabilities. The Office of the Vice President for Equity and Diversity is also available for consultation. Should the above mechanisms fail to resolve the matter satisfactorily, a complaint may be filed by Staff, Faculty and Students through the formal complaint process. Potential Disciplinary Action A violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. Submitting a Formal Complaint Before filing a formal complaint of alleged discrimination, the relevant parties are encouraged to use one or more of the options outlined above for informal resolution of the allegation. If one chooses to proceed with a complaint, the complaint may be submitted in writing to one of the following, as appropriate: Staff and Faculty HR Consultant/Employee Relations Office of the Chief Human Resource s Officer Office of the Provost Office of the Vice President for Equity and Diversity Students Non-academic Conduct Officer Disability Support Services (for disability discrimination) Office of the Vice Provost for Student and Faculty Success To the extent possible, all complaints will be handled confidentially and addressed in accordance with UAB policy. The complaints will be referred to the appropriate area for review and investigations will be conducted in a timely manner. In instances where sta ff, faculty and student issues overlap, the areas listed above will confer and/or work collaboratively to resolve the issue. All individuals may use the procedures without penalty or fear of retaliation. Also, any inquiries or complaints concerning the application of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Executive Order 11246, as amended; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; or other legislation and its implementing regulations as they relate to the University of Alabama at Birmingham should be directed to one of the officials listed above. Overall Implementation T he Office of the Vice President for Financial Affairs and Administration and the Office of the Provost are responsible for submitting revisions to be considered for this policy . December 14, 1991 NOTE: See also the following related policies: Drug - free Workplace Policy; Drug Screening Policy for Student Athletes; and the \"Policy on Impairment and Chemical Substance Abuse\" as published by the School of Medicine, School of Dentistry , and School of Nursing. Policy Statement This policy is applicable to all students enrolled in credit course(s) or degree- granting programs at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and to all students receiving academic credit at UAB (other than for continuing education units) for study in a program in a foreign country conducted by UAB alone or in conjunction with a foreign university. Unlawful possession, use, manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of illicit drugs, controlled substances, or alcoholic beverages by any UAB student on UAB property or as part of any UAB - sponsored or UAB -sanctioned activity is prohibited. The legal possession, use, or distribution of alcoholic beverages on UAB property or at UAB -sponsored or UAB -sanctioned activities is governed by the UAB General Policy Rega rding the Use and Consumption of Alcoholic Beverages and applicable local, state, and federal laws. In certain situations, the university is required to report the activities prohibited by this policy to appropriate law enforcement authorities. In all cas es, the University may report activities prohibited by this policy to appropriate law enforcement authorities if it appears that the activity is a violation of law. 40 Disciplinary Actions Violations of this policy constitute nonacademic misconduct and will be subject to established disciplinary action for nonacademic misconduct in accordance with stipulations in the Direction Student Handbook or other applicable procedures. Violations of this policy by students should be reported to the appropriate student affairs office or other office handling student nonacademic misconduct in the same manner in which other instances of nonacademic misconduct are reported. In some cases of violation of this policy for unlawful use, a student may be given, at the discretion of the University, the option to participate satisfactorily in an approved drug or alcohol abuse assistance or rehabilitation program in lieu of dismissal. Participation in such an assistance or rehabilitation program is at the expense of the student. Drug -free Awareness Program At least annually, UAB shall inform students of the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse on campus, of the existence of this policy statement and its penalties for violations, and of ava ilable drug and alcohol counseling, rehabilitation, and assistance through the following activities: 1. publication, at least annually, of this policy in appropriate student publications and distribution to students in UAB's foreign programs and to students in programs conducted in conjunction with foreign universities; 2. inclusion of this policy in future editions of student class schedules and/or registration materials, student handbooks, and student catalogs; 3. dissemination of this policy and of information at student orientation and assistance programs regarding the dangers of drug and alcohol use and abuse and available rehabilitation programs; and 4. continuation, and expansion, of the UAB drug and alcohol awareness program which includes sponso rship of the \"Alcohol/Drug Awareness Week\" and publication of pamphlets and other materials. Applicability to Other Policies Other drug -free policies created to cover specific areas of the university may be more restrictive than this policy but may not be less restrictive. At a minimum, other such policies must include, or reference, the provisions of this policy. Violators will be subject to the provisions of the more stringent policy but will not be punished under more than one policy for the same offen se. This policy does not revoke or otherwise interfere with policies in the health professional schools designed to determine whether health care professionals are impaired and to offer rehabilitation, subject to the above provisions. The wording in the \"Non -academic Conduct\" section of the Direction Student Handbook which relates to causes of dismissal due to the use, possession, etc. of illicit drugs, controlled substances, or alcoholic beverages references only certain provisions of this more extensive policy. The entire policy is applicable in all cases even if the policy itself is not printed in full. Attachments The \"Applicable Legal Sanctions,\" \"Drug and Alcohol Use Health Risks,\" and \"Drug and Alcohol Counseling, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Programs\" attached to this policy are a part of the policy but may be revised from time to time without affecting the policy itself. Effective Date and Implementation This policy is effective immediately upon its being signed by t he President . The offices of the appropriate Vice Presidents are responsible for the development and maintenance of procedures to implement this policy within their areas of responsibility. In addition to being distributed to students o n the UAB campus, this policy will be distributed to students in UAB's foreign programs and to students in programs conducted in conjunction with foreign universities. The Vice President for Student Affairs is responsible for all distributions to students covered by this policy. Attachment A \"Applicable Legal Sanctions\" Federal Penalties and Sanctions for Illegal Possession of a Controlled Substance (55 Federal Register 33589) 21 U.S.C. 844(a) First conviction: Up to 1 year imprisonment and fined at least $1,000 but not more than $100,000, or both.

Additional State penalties and sanctions may apply. Summary of State Penalties and Sanctions Under Alabama law, the possession, purchase, or consumption of alcoholic beverages by a person under 21 years of age is punishable by a fine of up to $500 and by up to three months in jail. Also under Alabama law, for a first offense, unlawful possession of a controlled substance (that is, illegal drugs) may be punished by imprisonment up to 10 years and a $5,000 fine and unlawful distribution of controlled substances may be punished by imprisonment up to 20 years and a $10,000 fine. Subsequent offenses may carry more stringent sentences. Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act Illegal drug and alcohol u se, consumption, distribution, etc. on college and university campuses also are covered by the provisions of the United States Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act Amendment of 1989 (Public Law 101- 226). Legal Sanctions in Foreign Countries Students in a program in a foreign country conducted by UAB or in conjunction with a foreign university also may be subject to sanctions under foreign law or under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Although the legal sanctions described in this policy under United States law may not apply to students in a foreign country, UAB will nevertheless hold such students to the same standards as students within the United States and will take the disciplinary actions described in this policy for violations of these standard s. Attachment B \"Drug and Alcohol Use Health Risks\" General Although there has been recent change in American health habits and societal attitudes toward recreational drug and alcohol use, problems continue to exist and experimentation is starting at an earlier age. An important piece of informati on to surface in recent years is that even moderate, nonprescribed use of alcohol and nonprescribed use of drugs can have an adverse effect on overall health and well -being. Consider the following facts: 1. Drin king more than one or two alcoholic beverages a week promotes more visible signs of aging. 2. Consuming one and one -half or more alcoholic beverages per day increases the risk of breast cancer. 3. Drinking alcoholic beverages poisons the heart muscle, counteracts the benefits of exercise, increases male impotence, and depresses the body's immune system. 4. Tobacco use is a contributing factor in the development of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, circulatory problems, and coronary disease, as well as being the leading cause of lung cancer. 5. Cocaine use is responsible for kidney damage, stroke, lung and heart diseases, seizures, and intense psychological problems. 6. Many forms of narcotics are highly addictive to users. 7. Marijuana use creates certain dysfunction related to thinking, learning, and recall; aggravates asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema; contributes to fertility problems, and contributes to the development of lung cancer. 8. The nonprescribed use of tranquilizers, barbiturates, and amphet amines is dangerous and may cause major health problems, including death. 9. Extended drug and/or alcohol use may result in substance dependency and loss of control of an individual's life.

Attachment B.1 Alcohol \u2014Effects (55 Federal Register 33591) Alcohol consumption causes a number of marked changes in behavior. Even low doses significantly impair the judgment and coordination required to drive a care safely, increasing the likelihood that the driver will be involved in an accident. Low to moderate doses of alcohol also increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, including spouse and child abuse. Moderate to high doses of alcohol cause marked impairments in hi gher mental functions, severely altering a person's ability to learn and remember information. Very high doses cause respiratory depression and death. If combined with other depressants of the central nervous system, much lower doses of alcohol will produc e the effects just described. Repeated use of alcohol can lead to dependence. Sudden cessation of alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and convulsions. Alcohol withdrawal can be life -threatening. Long - term consumption of large quantities of alcohol, particularly when combined with poor nutrition, can also lead to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and the liver. Mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome. These infants have irreversible physical abnormalities and mental retardation. In addition, research indicates that children of alcoholic parents are at greater risk than other youngsters of becoming alcoholics. Attachment B.2 Uses and Effects of Controlled Substances See Attachment B.2 for additional information concerning health risks involved in drug use. Attachment C \"Drug and Alcohol Counseling, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Programs\" Student Services The Cam pus Assistance Program is designed to address the following issues: continued longitudinal needs assessments, campus community awareness, enlistment of support from all campus segments, identification of high -risk students, early intervention, development of peer counseling and support groups, and referral to on/off campus resources and treatment facilities when indicated. The following are on -campus programs available to students: Campus Assistance Program Counseling and Wellness Center 924 19th Street South Birmingham, AL 35294- 2100 934-5816 UAB Mental Health Services Center for Psychiatric Medicine 1713 Sixth Avenue, South Birmingham, Alabama 35294- 0018 ACCESS line 934 -7008 UAB Substance Abuse Program 401 Beacon Parkway West Birmingham, Alabama 35209 917-3733 Other non- UAB, off -campus services are available in the Birmingham area and in many of the foreign countries in which UAB conducts programs of study. Such counseling, treatment, and rehabilitation services are too numerous to list here, but anyon e needing assistance with locating such off - campus or foreign country services may contact one of the programs listed above or the UAB Center for International Programs, as appropriate. December 7 , 2011 Introduction To provide a safe and healthy environment for all students, faculty, and staff at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), and in accordance with the recommendations of the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) and American College Health Association (ACHA), UAB requires immunizations as set forth in this policy . First -time Entering UAB Students All first- time entering students who enroll at UAB must show proof of specified immunizations as outlined by the UAB Student Health Service on their website : ( http://www.uab.edu/studentimmunizations ). Enrolling students must show proof of the required immunizations with either an official certificate of immunization, a photocopy of an immunization certificate, or written documentation from their physician. International Students and International Scholars Because of the disparity of immunization requirements among many foreign countries, all UAB international students and international scholars are required to be immunized as outlined by the UAB Student Health Service on their website ( http://www.uab.edu/studentimmunizations ). In lieu of being re -immunized, such individuals may present proof of having had the required immunizations. If 43 Health Care Policy for International Students and Scholars they do not have such proof or have not been immunized, they must be immunized against the specified diseases prior to attending, enrolling, or participating in UAB academic, research, observing, or clinical programs and activities. Furthermore, all international students and international scholars must show proof of a non-reactive Tuberculin skin test or negative blood test or appropriate treatment if positive within three months prior to enrollment or visiting. Details of this requirement are provided by the UAB Student Health Service on their website ( http://www.uab.edu/studentimmunizations ). Students Enrolled in Health- related Schools Because of the nature of their work, stu dents engaged in health professional training programs could have a higher risk of contracting certain diseases. Therefore, all UAB students in the Joint Health Sciences programs and in the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Optometry, Public Health, Nursing, and Health Professions are required to be immunized as outlined by the UAB Student Health Service on their website ( http://www.uab.edu/studentimmunizations ). In lieu of being re -immunized, such individuals may present proof of having had the required immunizations. Proof must be either official medical documentation or certificates of immunization or positive titer. If students do not have such proof or have not been immunized, they must begin the immunization process against these diseases prior to being admitted, attending, enrolling, or participating in UAB academic, research, or clinical programs and activities. All students enrolled in health -related schools must have had a Tuberculin skin test with negative results or negative blood test or appropriate treatment if positive within three months prior to matriculation. Students participating in clinical environments with patients will be required to obtain a two -step Tuberculin skin test or blood test before starting clinical rotations and are mandated to renew their Tuberculin one -step skin test or blood test once per year. Details of this requirement are outlined by the UAB Student Health Service on their website ( http://www.uab.edu/studentimmunizations ). Short -term Clinical and International Students Students enrolled in clinical activities for three months or less and international students present at UAB for less than three months will b e considered short -term. These students must be screened to rule out active tuberculosis. Screening requirements are outlined by the UAB Student Health Service on their website (http://www.uab.edu/stu dentimmunizations ). General The UAB Student Health Service will provide such immunizations and titer testing on a fee -for-service basis for any student who needs to meet his or her UAB immunization or titer requirements. Students may choose to fulfill these requirements at the Jefferson County Health Department or with a private physician. Exceptions Exceptions to this policy will be made in limited circumstances for students who can document medical and/or other contraindications to the vaccine. Requests for exceptions must be submitted to UAB Student Health Service for consideration and approval . Students enrolled in online programs listed at http://www.uab.edu/studentimmunizations are exempt from this policy. Implementation The Provost is responsible for procedures to implement this policy . May 1, 2000 Introduction The purpose of this policy is to ensure that international students and scholars have appropriate health -care opportunities and health insurance coverage while they are enrolled as UAB students or are participating in UAB activities. Students and Scholars Covered by this Policy 1. All UAB degree -seeking international students, regardless of course load, school, or degree program, must participate in the UAB Student Health Service and must have adequate health insurance coverage. 2. All transient and temporary international students must have adequate health insurance coverage. Those students may use the services of the UAB Student Health Service on a fee- for-service basis. 3. International scholars who participate in activities at UAB for longer than four weeks should be encouraged to participate in the UAB Student Health Service and must have adequate health insurance coverage. International scholars here for four weeks or less who do not participate in the UAB Student Health Service may use the services of Student Health on a fee -for-service basis. The inviting UAB department will be offered the opportunity to accept responsibility for the fee -for- service charges incurred. If the department does not wish to pay the fee -for-service bills, the international scholar will be responsible for the bills. 44 Policy Concerning AIDS and HIV Infection Definitions For purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply: \"Transient international students\" are defined as international students who are in the United States under the authorization of another institution organization but who are taking cou rsework at UAB. \"Temporary international students\" are defined as international students who are taking less than a full-time course of study at UAB and who are not pursuing an official UAB degree or certificate. \"Adequate health insurance\" is defined as follows: a. Insurance provided through the UAB Student Health Service, OR b. Equivalent personal health insurance, the evidence for which must be shown to, and verified by, the UAB Student Health Service. Implementation The Vice Provost for Administration and Quality Improvement is responsible for procedures to implement this policy. April 24, 1998 Definitions The following are definitions or explanations of terminology used in this policy: AIDS \u2014Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome occurs in someone with HIV infection when one or more of certain disease or infections occurs or when a CD4 (also know as T4 helper) lymphocyte cell count is below 200. HIV \u2014Human immunodeficiency virus (the virus which causes AIDS). HIV antibody \u2014A protein in the body produced in response to infection with HIV. (There are tests which look for HIV antibody in a person infected with HIV.) HIV infection\u2014 A condition involving asymptomatic (without symptoms) or symptomatic (with symptoms) stages of infection. Introduction Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus which causes the disease, AIDS. Infection with that virus damages the human body's immune (defense) system and allows life -threatening infections to develop. HIV has no known cure or vaccine for prevention. Available medical knowledge indicates that transmission of HIV is primarily through sexual contact or sharing intravenous drug paraphernalia with someone who has an HIV infection. It also can be spread from an infected mother to her baby before, or during, delivery and through breast feeding. HIV cannot be transmitted through casual contact such as sharing food or drink, touching surfaces, shaking hands, dry kissing, or working together. HIV cannot be transmitted by mosquitoes or other insects. Even if there are no symptoms, an HIV -infected person can transmit HIV to a sexual partner or needle- sharing partner. Because of the seriousness of the HIV/AIDS issue, the University of Alabama at Birmingham ha s established this policy which focuses on prevention (through detailed education of students, faculty, and staff) and on the compassionate care of people with HIV infection or AIDS. A supervisor or anyone in the UAB community who becomes aware of an HIV/AIDS related situation involving an employee, student, or visitor shall follow the guidelines stated in this policy. Policy Statement 1. Admissions or Employment The University of Alabama at Birmingham accepts otherwise -qualified individuals presenting themselves for admission or employment, irrespective of their HIV status. 2. Handicapping Conditions Persons with AIDS (and, possibly, those with other manifestations of HIV infection) will be considered as having handicapping conditions as defined in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. In determining policy and in making related decisions, UAB officials shall properly attend to the legal rights of these individuals and shall make reasonable accommodations as are appropr iate for individuals with handicapping conditions. Decisions regarding the continuation of employment of faculty and staff with HIV infection or AIDS will be made on the basis of job- related criteria. Within current UAB policies and procedures, individual s may be reassigned to accommodate a disabling condition. Termination will be pursued only when the employee, even with reasonable reassignment of responsibilities, can no longer perform the duties and responsibilities of his or her position. Any such term ination action will be taken in accordance with established UAB procedures. 3. Student Attendance UAB students who have HIV infections, whether they are symptomatic or asymptomatic, will be allowed regular classroom attendance as long as they are physically and mentally able to attend classes as determined by current UAB academic standards. HIV- infected students enrolled in UAB health profession schools may have their educational program modified by their school to limit the risk of disease transmission, in accordance with the Alabama 45 Infected Health -care Worker Management Act. 4. Access to Facilities There will be no unreasonable restriction of access on the basis of HIV infection to student or employee facilities, theaters, restaurants, snack bars, gymnasiums, swimming pools, saunas, recreational facilities, or other common areas. 5. Student Housing Currently available medical information does not indicate that there exists a risk of transmission of infection by casual contact which would preclude sharing a residence with a person with AIDS or HIV infection. However, there may be reasonable concern for the health of students with immune deficiencies (of any origin) when those students might be exposed to certain contagious diseases (for example, measl es or chicken pox) in a close living situation. For these reasons, decisions regarding housing and private rooms for students with HIV infections will be made on a case- by-case basis by UAB Student Housing and Residential Life officials. It is the responsibility of the student to make his or her HIV status known to UAB in order for any accommodation request to be considered. It also is the responsibility of an HIV - infected student to take necessary precautions to avoid exposure of others to infection through known means of transmission. 6. Self -disclosure In general, students, student applicants, employees, and applicants for employment at UAB will not be asked to respond to questions concerning the existence of HIV infection. However, both students and em ployees with HIV infection are encouraged to inform campus health -care providers so that UAB may provide information about proper medical care, medical care availability, support, counseling, and education. This, like any other medical information, will be handled in a strictly confidential manner in accordance with established UAB policy and Alabama law. 7. Immunizations Incoming students known to have HIV infection need not be exempted from UAB requirements for non-live virus vaccinations. However, because of potentially serious consequences for HIV -infected persons' receiving live virus vaccines, persons who are recommended to receive such immunizations should consult the UAB Student Health Center or the Jefferson County Department of Health for current recommendations. 8. Information, Testing, and Counseling A. Testing. Students or employees requesting HIV antibody testing will be referred to the Jefferson County Department of Health. UAB University Hospital employees also may receive such testing through the Employee Health Services. B. Services. Counseling, information, and education are available through various UAB units including the Student Health Service, the Division of Student Affairs, the Hospital Employee Health Service, and the Office of Human Resource Management. These services currently are made available to the students or employees at no cost and in accordance with the guidelines in each unit. 9. Confidentiality of Information A. Standards. No information concerning HIV infect ion or AIDS or their diagnoses will be provided to any third party other than an employee's immediate supervisor without the expressed written consent of the infected person. Medical information cannot be released to any person, group, agency, insurer, emp loyer, or institution without specific written consent of the patient or legal guardian, except as required by law. All disclosures of diagnoses of HIV infection or AIDS to individuals functioning in supervisory roles must be treated as confidential inform ation. According to present law, UAB physicians and other health -care providers are mandated to protect the confidentiality of medical information with exceptions being made only if the need arises to protect others in very specific, life -threatening circumstances. Also, disclosure by persons other than health -care providers that an individual has HIV infection or AIDS may be considered an invasion of that individual's privacy. Situations in which disclosure will be made will be determined on a case - by-case basis in consultation with the chair of the AIDS Activities Coordinating Committee and the Office of Counsel, if needed. B. Public Health Reporting Requirements. UAB will observe the public health reporting requirements of the Alabama State Department of Public Health. Individuals known to have HIV infection will be reported to the State Department of Public Health according to prevailing statutes. C. \"Need to Know.\" According to the American College Health Association, current medical information con cerning HIV neither justifies nor requires warning others of the presence of someone with HIV infection or AIDS. Given the absence of any evidence of transmission of HIV by casual contact, there is no need or justification for warning individuals in the ac ademic workplace, administrative officers, or instructors of the presence of such an individual. Therefore, the number of people at UAB who will be aware of the existence and/or identity of students or employees who have HIV infection will be kept to an ab solute minimum, both to protect the confidentiality and the privacy of the infected persons and to avoid the generation of unnecessary fear and anxiety among faculty, staff, and students. 46 10. Education Training requirements for employees deemed at - risk by the AIDS Activities Coordinating Committee shall consist of sessions sufficient in number and depth to comply with prevailing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations and \"Bloodborne Pathogens Standards.\" In the absence of such guidelines, the AIDS Activities Coordinating Committee shall determine educational standards. Records of AIDS education training for at -risk employees shall be maintained in the appropriate UAB Human Resource Management Office. 11. Safety Precautions A. Person nel. Since many people with HIV infection are not identified in advance, universal precautions as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration will guide the procedures for the handling of blood and body fluids containing viable blood of any student, employee, or patient. Questions regarding these safety guidelines should be directed to the Department of Occupational Health and Safety, the Hospital Employee Health Service, the Office of Human Resource management, the Hospital Committee on Infections, or the UAB Biosafety Committee. Each unit has the responsibility for developing department -specific directives and procedures. Departments also have the responsibility for compliance monitori ng and staff education to prevent the transmission of HIV infection. B. Equipment. Manuals and procedures already in use at UAB cover the precautions which should be taken when handling infectious materials. Certain of those procedures are re- emphasized here especially as pertains to the transmission of HIV infection. UAB personnel will use disposable, single -use needles and other equipment whenever such equipment will puncture the skin or mucous membranes of patients, employees, or students. Extreme cau tion should be exercised when handling sharp objects, particularly in disposing of needles. All used needles should be placed in puncture -resistant containers designated for this purpose. Needles should never be bent or recapped after use. Any needles which are made to be re- used or other equipment that punctures skin or mucous membranes should be appropriately cleaned and sterilized before re-use. Blood- soaked articles should be placed in leak-proof bags with biohazard labels before being sent for reprocessing or disposal in accordance with establish UAB infection control guidelines. C. Teaching Laboratories. Laboratory courses require exposure to blood, such as biology courses in which blood is obtained by finger prick for typing or examination, should us e disposable equipment, and no lancets or other blood- letting devises should be re - used or shared, No students, except those in health - care professions, s hould be required to obtain or process the blood of others. 12. Job Performance Faculty, staff, stud ents, and all other persons affiliated with UAB shall perform the responsibilities of their positions irrespective of the HIV status of patients, students, or co -workers. Failure to comply with this policy will be considered a failure to adequately perform the responsibilities of one's position and may result in disciplinary action up to, and including, discharge. 13. Behavior Risk UAB students, faculty, and staff with HIV infection or AIDS who are aware of the potential danger of their condition to other s and who engage in behavior (while performing their employee -related or student -related activities) which threatens the safety and welfare of others may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with established UAB disciplinary procedures and/or ap plicable law. Applicability to Other UAB AIDS Policies More specific, written guidelines and procedures are the responsibility of individual departments and may be developed, as needed, by department/unit heads. All unit policies must be compatible with this UAB -wide policy and may not be in conflict with it. 47 48 49 Graduation Deadline Dates, 2012 - 2013 These dates are subject to change.
