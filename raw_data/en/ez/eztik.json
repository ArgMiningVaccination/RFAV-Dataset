Biographical Note [Return to Top](#top) Dr. Ewan Cameron was born in Glasgow, Scotland July 31, 1922. He received his medical degree from the University of Glasgow in 1944, and immediately joined the British Army, where he served as a medical officer in Burma for three years. A gifted surgeon, Cameron worked as a Consultant Surgeon at Vale of Leven Hospital in Dunbartonshire, Scotland, from 1956 to 1982, becoming the Senior Consultant Surgeon in 1973. He received the Queen's Coronation Medal in Britain in 1977, as well as fellowships from the Royal Colleges of Surgeons in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and the Royal Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow. In 1966, Cameron published his first book, Hyaluronidase and Cancer. In 1971, Cameron began corresponding with Dr. Linus Pauling of the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine. He completed many scientific studies in conjunction with the institute, and published Cancer and Vitamin C with Pauling in 1979. After retirement from Vale of Leven Hospital in 1982, Cameron was invited to become Medical Director and Senior Research Professor at the Linus Pauling Institute, where he worked closely with Pauling on many important research topics. Cameron had a son and a daughter with his first wife, Phemie. After her death in 1985, Cameron married Connie, who survived him after his death on March 21st, 1991.

The contents are divided into three subseries, organized according to experiment stage. Boxes 2.001 to 2.016 hold the raw data generated by the experiments, including patient records, case histories and other preliminary data. Boxes 2.017 to 2.020 move into the later stages of the trials, and include final analyses and consequent manuscripts. Boxes 2.021 to 2.023 focus upon the controversy surrounding one of these resulting manuscripts, \"Supplemental Ascorbate and Incurable Cancer,\" which was ultimately rejected for publication by The New England Journal of Medicine. This subseries also includes a manuscript of and correspondence regarding the book Vitamin C and Cancer: Medicine or Politics? by Evelleen Richards. |Container(s)||Description||Dates| |Box| |2.001|| | Human Cancer part 1 |1971; 1974-1981| |Folder| |1.1|| Correspondence: Human Unsupplemented Human 2/81) 12/79) |1976-1980| |1.8|| Cancer\" |undated| |1.10|| Graphs: \"Incurable |undated| |1.11|| \"All |1.13|| | Human Cancer vs. Time in Weeks Before Death\" |undated| |1.14|| Cancer Trials Chart: \"Cancer |undated| |1.15|| | Human Number of Days, Cancer\" |undated| |1.16|| | Human Cancer Trials Graphs: \"LAA Levels in Patients - Time vs. Concentration\" |undated| |1.17|| | Human Cancer Chromatography\" |1976-1977| |1.18|| | Photographs: Series of four scanning electron microscopy images of malignant cells and tissue cultures, including those exposed to increasing levels of sodium ascorbate. |1981| |2.002|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Assorted Patient Records, part 2 |1977| |Folder| Cancer Trial Patients\" |undated| |2.3|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Kidney Cancer Patients |undated| |2.4|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Prostate Cancer Patients |undated| |2.5|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Rectum Cancer Patients |undated| |2.6|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Carcinoma of Pancreas Patients |undated| |2.7|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Breast Cancer Patients |undated| |2.8|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Carcinoma of the Colon Patients |undated| |2.9|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Bladder Cancer Patients |undated| |2.10|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Stomach Cancer Patients (excluding Cardia Control Patients) |undated| |2.11|| Human Cancer Trial Records: |2.12|| | in Terminal Cancer Survey\" |undated| |2.13|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Assorted computer program printouts |undated| |2.14|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Life Table, empty graphs |undated| |2.003|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Cancer Patient Forms from the Dumbarton District Laboratory |1977-1978; 1980-1982| |Folder| |3.1|| | October 1977| |3.2|| | Dumbarton District Laboratory: December 1977| |3.3|| | Dumbarton District Laboratory: Cancer Forms - April 1978| |3.4|| Dumbarton | Dumbarton District Cancer - July 1978| |3.6|| | Dumbarton District Laboratory: Cancer Patient Forms - October 1980| |3.7|| | Dumbarton District Laboratory: Cancer Patient Forms - January 1982| |3.8|| Dumbarton Cancer Patient 1982| |2.004|| | Human Cancer Trial Records Notebook: Patient Responses to Nutritional Supplements [oversized box] |1981-1982| |2.005|| | Human Cancer Trial Records LAA/PAA Tables and Graphs [oversized box] |1977-1982| |2.006|| | Human Trial Records: Patient Printouts, part 1 |1978-1979; 1983-1984| |2.007|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Patient Printouts, part 2 |1978-1984| |2.008|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Patient Printouts, part 3 |1978-1979; 1984; 1987| |2.009|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Patient Printouts, part 4 |1970; 1979-1982| |2.010|| | Human Cancer Trial Records: Documents from [sorted |November 29, 1983| |10.3|| | 1984| | Form: Notes |March 24, 1983| |10.18|| | Sample Patient Form with Notes |January 15, 1983| |10.19|| | Peto, R. et al. \"Design and Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials Requiring Prolonged Observations of Each Patient: II.

The materials are further divided into five subseries, each containing articles of various types. Boxes 5.001 to 5.006 include only those articles written by Cameron, the majority of which pertain to Vitamin C. Box 5.007 holds articles both by and about Dr. Linus Pauling, Cameron's major collaborator. Boxes 5.008 to 5.016, which comprise the largest of the subseries, are devoted to scientific articles of all kinds, mainly dealing with Vitamin C and other medical topics, and organized alphabetically by author's last name, or by title in cases where no author is evident. Boxes 5.017 to 5.020 contain articles not published in scientific journals, organized by topic. Many of these topics are of a medical nature, and most of the topic names were derived directly from the organizational scheme of Cameron's own filing cabinets. Boxes 5.021 to 5.023 include periodicals that Cameron received, filed alphabetically by publication name. |Container(s)||Description||Dates| |Box| |5.001|| | Vitamin C Linus Pauling], Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 123, 2, April 1979 . |1.2|| | Materials re: \"Ascorbic Acid Linus Pauling and Brian Leibovitz], Cancer Research, 39, 663-681, March 1979 ; and Gary A.
