Through the lens of Traditional Chinese Medicine, your body's unique pattern of disharmony provides a roadmap to treating it as an entire system. Internal disorders we can address on a root level through Chinese Medicine: IBS DIARRHEA CONSTIPATION DIGESTIVE DISORDERS ACID REFLUX NAUSEA RESPIRATORY ISSUES IMMUNE SUPPORT ASTHMA CHRONIC COUGH SINUSITIS ALLERGIES POOR CIRCULATION CARDIOVASCULAR SUPPORT AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER SUPPORT VERTIGO MIGRAINES FATIGUE ACNE + SKIN CONDITIONS BELL'S PALSY HYPO/HYPER THYROIDISM HYPOGLYCEMIA CHEMOTHERAPY SUPPORT ACUPUNCTURE AND HERBS FOR INTERNAL CONDITIONS Acupuncture is well known for providing pain relief and heightening fertility, but it is also effective for a variety of internal disorders. We treat many patients that fall in the gray areas where traditional medicine might not provide answers or the side effects are too great. Many common conditions such as allergies, sinus congestion, and asthma can be successfully treated with acupuncture and herbal formulas. Eastern nutritional recommendations may also be made to help support your healing. We also collaborate with MDs in other cases where an integrative approach is the optimal path for long term wellness and quality of life. There is a reason why this over 2,000 year old medicine continues to be practiced and has an even greater relevance in today's fast paced lifestyle. ACUPUNCTURE ENCOURAGES YOUR BODY TO NATURALLY HEAL ITSELF Studies have shown acupuncture affects the nervous system by stimulating the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands (the HPA axis), which releases neurotransmitters such as endorphins and serotonin, the body's natural painkillers and \"feel-good\" chemicals. It also preserves nerve function and moderates adenosine levels, changing how our body perceives pain. Other measurable physiological responses include enhanced blood circulation, decreased inflammation, and increased production of T-cells supporting immunity. "}
