With the chaos of the pandemic this year, it's easy to forget there's anything else to worry about other than [COVID-19](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/coronavirus-articles-on-cleaning-supplies-and-work-from-home-tech). But just like every winter, cold and flu season is here and it brings with it a unique situation: That all three [viruses have similar symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/coldflu.htm) \u2014 coughing, sneezing, congestion and sinus pressure (with a stuffy or runny nose), headache, general fatigue, aches and pains, and if it's the flu, [a fever](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-thermometer). These viruses ( [the common cold, influenza,](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-products-remedies-to-cure-cold-fast) and COVID-19) can all range in intensities, from mild sniffles to the need for a respirator in the ICU. A number of factors determine whether or not you'll get sick, as well as how sick you might get \u2014 and one of those, which we often overlook, is the state of your immune system. \"We don't fully understand why some individuals are more susceptible to infections and the various complications from viruses like COVID-19, influenza, or the common cold,\" said [Sina Firouzi, MD](https://www.onemedical.com/providers/sina-firouzi/), a board-certified physician with a background in Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), based at [One Medical](https://www.onemedical.com/) in Orange County, CA. \"However, supporting one's immune system may be one of the most beneficial ways to protect oneself if exposed.\" Any of these highly contagious winter viruses can significantly disrupt your day-to-day, so it's crucial to think ahead. Treating a viral infection isn't just about symptom relief but also about balancing your immune system so you can heal quickly and efficiently \u2014 and natural remedies can help. Anyone who grew up in America is likely well acquainted with over-the-counter (OTC) [pharmaceutical treatments](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-over-the-counter-medicine-for-mild-covid-symptoms) for the common cold and flu symptoms, like Dayquil, Mucinex, and Zicam. And let's be clear: [Western medicine](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-products-remedies-to-cure-cold-fast) certainly has its benefit and place in symptom relief. But more people now turn to natural medications to [avoid unwanted side effects](https://journals.lww.com/ajg/fulltext/2009/03000/guidelines_for_prevention_of_nsaid_related_ulcer.35.aspx) and leverage the power of herbs and vitamins to support their immune system while providing symptom relief. More importantly, natural medications do indeed work for easing the aches, pains, coughs, and running noses of cold and flu season. It should be said that because signs and symptoms of the common cold, influenza, and COVID-19 overlap so much, it's imperative you [speak to your doctor](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-telemedicine-services) if you're feeling \"fluish\" this season. While you can get OTC medications and supplements without a prescription or doctor's appointment, it's a good idea to be extremely cautious and confirm your symptoms aren't that of COVID-19 (and to confirm that [natural medications won't interact](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine#medications-to-talk-to-your-doctor-about-7) with anything in your medical history). Dr. [Pooja Amy Shah](https://www.drpoojaamyshah.com/about), the medical reviewer for this piece, said this is especially true right now as trustworthy researchers at the University of Arizona [found that anyone with the COVID-19 virus](https://uahs.arizona.edu/news/integrative-medicine-approaches-may-combat-covid-19) may want to avoid certain supplements due to their potential to stimulate an inflammatory response. Nothing on our list here includes ingredients researchers are concerned about (i.e. Elderberry, certain medicinal mushrooms, Echinacea Angustifolia, [and others](https://uahs.arizona.edu/news/integrative-medicine-approaches-may-combat-covid-19)), but it's still important to talk with your doctor before taking any medication if you feel sick. At the end of this guide, I go deeper into [why you should consider natural](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine#why-opt-for-natural-medication-8) cold and flu treatments, the [debate over the effectiveness](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine#why-opt-for-natural-medication-8) of natural medication, [why immune support is important](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine#immune-support-is-important-9), [what to look for](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine#how-to-shop-for-natural-cold-and-flu-products-10) in a natural cold and flu medication, and [how I chose these](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/best-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine#how-i-chose-these-products-11) natural cold and flu products.

A 2018 [study out of Nigeria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6513626/) found that honey is likely just as effective at soothing a cough in children as dextromethorphan, with a 2017 study in [Chest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6026258/) supporting the remedy specifically for an acute cough for the common cold. Honey works to coat and soothe the back of the throat for longer than artificial cough syrup, and offers \"its long-established antioxidant and antiviral effects,\" Habib Sadeghi, DO, founder of the integrative medical center, [Be Hive of Healing](https://behiveofhealing.com/), in Agoura Hills, CA, told Insider. Pharmacist Maria Gil-Flores, PharmD, district leader at CVS added, \"Honey contains many important antioxidants that may help [protect the body from cell damage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28901255/), and is often praised for its [antibacterial and antiviral properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941901/).\" Honey has been [used as medicine for thousands of years](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758027/), but be sure to check in with your doctor if you plan on using this in large amounts and for long periods of time. It also should not be given to children 12 months old or younger (it may contain a bacteria called clostridium that causes infant botulism). Dr. Sadeghi suggests [organic, local honey](https://www.insider.com/fake-honey-problems-how-it-works-2020-9) (i.e., something specific to your region), because the bees have infused it with local pollen, which may help your immune system's response to local allergens (there's not a body of clinical evidence supporting this yet, but this theory behind trace-exposure to allergens is starting to get more attention). Additionally, [raw, local honey is unprocessed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609166/), which means it retains essential nutrients that may help your body heal.

We also ran this particular product by naturopathic doctor Megen McBride, Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (NMD), told Insider \u2014 verbatim \u2014 \"Compared to dextromethorphan, Cons: Improper use can increase the risk of infection (this includes using tap water) [Stuffy congestion](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/treatments/best-medicine-for-sinus-congestion) and inability to breathe out of your nose is one of the primary symptoms of both the common cold and influenza. Luckily, there's a very simple solution: sinus wash. Using saltwater to treating allergies and sinus issues has long been used in ancient [India](https://www.netipot.com/site/why-nasal-wash/) to help remove mucus and reduce chronic inflammation, explained Dr. Sadeghi. A [2018 study review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6513421/) out of the United Kingdom found that saline irrigation can help reduce congestion for folks with allergic rhinitis. Dr. Sadeghi also pointed to a study from the [University of Michigan Health System](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/484888), which shows that people who used nasal irrigation for sinus relief saw a 50% reduction in the frequency of symptoms compared to those who used a nasal spray. As for cold and flu specifically, an older study from 2008, published in [JAMA Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/221846), looked at 400 children with a cold or the flu and found that a saltwater nasal flush not only improved their cold and flu symptoms, but also the kids needed fewer medications and missed less school compared to children who used medication alone. Although the original neti pots (used with water and basic kosher salt) are definitely a viable option, Dr. Sadeghi recommended this more affordable alternative in the $10 range. Dr. Hana's Nasopure Kit is a well-reviewed choice, thanks to its ease-of-use, solid construction considering the price, and itch-and-burn-free rinse experience.

The mineral may help respiratory viruses from latching on and multiplying, he added. There's also an evolving theory that zinc may help limit the degree of an inflammatory response your body has to an infection, he added. Inflammation, whether general or part of an immune response, [can cause achiness, fatigue](https://www.scripps.org/news_items/4232-six-keys-to-reducing-inflammation#:~:text=You%2520may%2520just%2520feel%2520slightly,Alzheimer's%2520disease%2520and%2520other%2520conditions.), and certain other [symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279298/) that [vary depending](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493173/) on your [circumstances](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-acute-and-chronic-inflammation). Limiting inflammation could mean fewer aches and pains and more energy. The scientific and [clinical evidence around zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6483791/) is [mixed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5490603/), but [studies on zinc lozenges](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5418896/), in particular, have shown potential promise for [treating the common cold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4359576/) (both for shortening the duration of symptoms and alleviating pharyngeal symptoms). Generally, adults [need 8 to 11mg](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-zinc/art-20366112) for optimal health. But when it comes to being sick, the jury is still out on [how much zinc you need to support your immune system.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6835436/) However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [states](https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/micronutrient-malnutrition/micronutrients/index.html), \"Zinc promotes immune functions and helps people resist infectious diseases.\" The upper limit for dosage (currently) is [40mg for adults](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-Consumer/). Too much zinc can result in vomiting, diarrhea, and headaches \u2014 so be mindful of how much you consume. McBride agreed, adding that she uses this mineral as an immunity balance for her patients. Gil-Flores recommended it as well: \"Zinc is a vital mineral for the body that can help with immune system function,\" she said, and though she noted you [can obtain zinc](https://www.insider.com/what-is-zinc-good-for) via your diet (in meat, legumes, shellfish, and dairy), if you don't eat these foods often, you can also get it in supplement form. Zinc is also quite common in lozenge-form, which can be soothing when you have a sore throat. Life Extension Enhanced Zinc Lozenges have zinc acetate in a heftier dose than most other lozenges (18.75mg), which is nice for relief from a single lozenge, but you want to make sure to cap your daily intake at two, maybe three if okayed by your doctor. For reference, [clinical trials that are currently underway](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04342728) (looking at zinc's role in COVID-19 prevention) are using 50mg of zinc daily, which is above the National Institute of Health's upper limit of 40mg. The other ingredients in Life Extension's lozenges include peppermint flavor and dextrose. Some consumers might not like the idea of corn-derived sugar and added flavor, but compared to other options on the market, we considered it a fair trade for a stronger dose of zinc. For instance, Zicam is another super popular zinc supplement in lozenge form but has some [controversial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22176942/) food [coloring](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2957945/), plus corn syrup, sucralose, and sucrose. (I also looked at Nature's Way, which looked quite promising, but the ingredient list included [sorbitol](https://www.rxlist.com/consumer_sorbitol/drugs-condition.htm) and mannitol, sugar reliever, be used as a preventative during flu season Cons: Expensive, lack of substantial clinical evidence as of now [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808895/) is a flavonoid found in [fruit and vegetables (even wine)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18417116/) that has been studied more recently for its potential medical benefits, specifically on [inflammation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20943792/). When it comes to colds and the flu, inflammation is the immune system's way of fighting off viral pathogens \u2014 but it's also the [culprit behind aches, pains, congestion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185637/), and more. Quercetin has the [potential to modulate cytokines](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27294919/) (a small protein that helps cells communicate), so it's become a [hot topic in COVID conversations](https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/87373) (you may have heard the term \" [cytokine storm](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7527296/)\" in articles about COVID-19, and how it [contributes to mortality](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2026131)). There is still a need for [clinical trials on quercetin](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04377789) to test the bonafide efficacy within a medical context, and some are already in progress thanks to its promising anti-inflammatory, immunity-strengthening properties. \" [Quercetin](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321014123_Safety_Aspects_of_the_Use_of_Quercetin_as_a_Dietary_Supplement) is powerful yet often unknown,\" McBride said. She explained that she began prescribing it preventatively as an antihistamine during seasonal shifts, and then with [ current research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29903008/) showing quercetin's potential ability to fight the influenza virus mid-infection, McBride now recommends it as an anti-cough, cold-and-flu treatment. She likens it to taking a non-drowsy Benadryl combined with ibuprofen \u2014 part antihistamine, part anti-pain, part anti-inflammatory. When it comes to a cold or the flu, this means fewer aches, pain, inflammation, and congestion. \"Keep in mind, high doses of over 1,000 mg a day are not recommended unless under the care of a healthcare professional,\" McBride added. Instead, you'll want to stay at a 250 to 500mg dosage. Her top recommendation for this supplement comes from Pure Encapsulations. This particular 250mg capsule is hypoallergenic \u2014 no additives, flavorings, sweeteners, colors or dyes. It's a non-GMO, vegan, gluten-free, and sugar-free supplement to both boost your immune system, reduce inflammation and pain, and relieve symptoms. Multi-symptom relief Fresh ginger tea Pros: inexpensive, effective, tasty, multiple benefits Cons: None unless you don't like ginger [Ginger](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/ginger-benefits) tea has been used for centuries, and for good reason \u2014 it's a tasty, multifaceted, multi-symptom reliever that [typically has few side effects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ginger). This ancient home-remedy is high on Dr. Firouzi's must-use list. \"In Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, there is a concept of 'opposing qualities' \u2014 hot and cold, dry and moist, [and so on]. This paradigm structures our approach to treating many conditions,\" he explained. This is where ginger tea comes in \u2014 he noted that green and black tea do not have the same properties nor effects. The ayurvedic lens on the common cold is that the body has \"excess cold and moisture in the respiratory system.\" From there, he said, \"The obvious remedy would then be to warm and dry out that area.\" Dr. Firouzi also explains that from this perspective, \"ginger reduces the Kapha dosha in the Pranavaha Srotas, according to Ayurveda. In other words, it can help clear phlegm in the sinuses and lungs.\" But making tea with fresh ginger is more ideal than a dried tea bag. A [2013 study from Taiwan researchers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23123794/) found that fresh, but not dried, ginger is effective for treating respiratory disease. \"In certain situations, the fresh herbs have certain compounds that are more intact than the dried herbs, such as volatile oils,\" Dr. Firouzi says. \"This may be one of many factors contributing to the variable effects of fresh versus dried ginger. For ginger tea, fresh ginger is most helpful for upper respiratory infections and flu \u2014 however, for nausea, there is research supporting the use of dry ginger.\" Peel and slice half an inch to an inch of fresh ginger and [add it to soft boiling water ](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/ginger-benefits)for 10 minutes. Strain out the ginger (you can also put the sliced herb in a [tea infuser](https://www.insider.com/guides/home/best-tea-infuser) to skip the need for straining). Add healing honey if you want it a little sweeter. What else we considered The experts and I discussed several products (including some products I've used myself) \u2014 here are some other options that were good, but didn't make the top spots: [Original Neti Pot](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biauto-59908-20&h=03f507d43400cff5cb9d2504d28627717965f4bf7ecfa28298d32d05fd862b31&postID=6398ccd638646715a0268d24&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ftreatments%2Fbest-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB000WJKE1Y%2Fref%3Das_li_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26creativeASIN%3DB000WJKE1Y%26linkCode%3Das2%26tag%3Dbiipg_121020_best-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine-20%26linkId%3D0a0130ed198eff9d01925d4d276b9f7c&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) ($27): The original Neti Pot is awesome (for all the aforementioned sinus relief reasons), but its price point could make it less accessible \u2014 thus, it was edged out by an inexpensive, equally effective option. [Zarbee's Elderberry Lozenges](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biauto-59908-20&h=ea84a193cb3ffb5530a7d9f4c42b0b16292000b2e3088a7c867bb004b87794fb&postID=6398ccd638646715a0268d24&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ftreatments%2Fbest-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB01GJS8M74%2Fref%3Das_li_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26creativeASIN%3DB01GJS8M74%26linkCode%3Das2%26tag%3Dbiipg_121020_best-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine-20%26linkId%3Da473f0950590e80d54d3b64befc720ef&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) ($7): These are tasty, honey-based (we love honey for a cold and flu!), but only had 2mg of zinc (compared to the minimum daily 8-11mg, top range of 40mg) so it lost to stronger zinc contenders. [Zicam Cherry Lozenges ](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biauto-59908-20&h=942aaca543a3728353b8796182873b7a18b98897e1fd4d52a9a7837cce79a09f&postID=6398ccd638646715a0268d24&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ftreatments%2Fbest-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F6415797%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.cvs.com%2Fshop%2Fzicam-cherry-lozenge-shortens-colds-soothes-sore-throats-cough-prodid-449945&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false)($11): A crowd favorite, these use two types of zinc, but also red dye number 40 to achieve that cherry flavor (the only flavor option), which is a [controversial dye](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/red-dye-40) (with potential adverse health implications). [Live Better Sterile Saline Nasal Mist](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biauto-59908-20&h=7cd79e0df621b914f535792c8c7a3fbab97621ae3eecaf827ac0efb8004b91a5&postID=6398ccd638646715a0268d24&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ftreatments%2Fbest-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F6415797%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.cvs.com%2Fshop%2Flive-better-sterile-saline-nasal-mist-7-5-oz-prodid-559441&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) ($12): Some people like to use nasal mists in lieu of a Neti Pot \u2014 and while this seemed to be a solid option, the nasal rinsing pots appear to have more positive clinical data in their favor. Medications to talk to your doctor about Vitamin D supplements There's plenty of talk around how helpful or necessary vitamin D supplementation is in all viral illnesses, including the cold and flu. McBride adamantly recommends vitamin D3 (something Dr. Sadeghi spoke about as well), adding that it's \"been shown to be a powerful and [significant immune modulator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480856/) within the body.\" And she's certainly right that sufficient levels of vitamin D are important in helping our immune system mount an appropriate response to bacterial and viral exposure. But if you already have sufficient levels of the vitamin, over-supplementation [can cause](https://www.businessinsider.com/wellness-influencers-say-near-lethal-vitamin-doses-prevent-coronavirus-2020-2) stomach distress, vomiting, and too-high blood levels of calcium which can cause confusion, heart rhythm problems, and kidney damage. This is the main reason we didn't include this supplement in our main list of cold and flu remedies. As McBride noted, it's crucial to get your vitamin D levels checked before taking high doses of it. Many people are indeed deficient in the vitamin such as those who live far from the equator, anyone who gets less sun exposure, those with a darker skin tone with more melanin, or anyone who follows a vegan diet. But it's not practical or a priority for most people to get that kind of blood work done when we're limiting in-person doctor's visits \u2014 and we don't want people taking the supplement without confirmation of their baseline levels. And while McBride likes [DaVinci Laboratories Vitamin D3 2,000 IU + K2 200 mcg](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biauto-59908-20&h=8062a4e97d5195b31f0f8332c4f02a5be3f35a939e33ca51ef1bee00b5f6ab13&postID=6398ccd638646715a0268d24&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Ftreatments%2Fbest-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB078K517T4%2Fref%3Das_li_tl%3Fots%3D1%26slotNum%3D11%26imprToken%3Deabb4643-c883-dfad-ae3%26ie%3DUTF8%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26creativeASIN%3DB078K517T4%26linkCode%3Das2%26tag%3Dbiipg_121020_best-all-natural-cold-and-flu-medicine-20%26linkId%3Da5e0bb59bfde602171bdff94da9c96c5&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) formula because it's a high-quality and third-party-tested clean formula, it's incredibly expensive for most people. Formulas with elderberry, polysaccharide extracts from medicinal mushrooms, echinacea angustifolia and Larch arabinogalactan Dr. [Pooja Amy Shah](https://www.drpoojaamyshah.com/about), the medical reviewer for this piece, pointed out that there's a fine line between herbs and minerals that can balance and support your immune system like those we've listed here, and those that truly boost it to the point where it can become over-activated. She's referring to the fact that researchers at the University of Arizona [have warned](https://uahs.arizona.edu/news/integrative-medicine-approaches-may-combat-covid-19) that certain supplements can cause your immune system to become highly active, which, if you have the COVID-19 virus, might stimulate an inflammatory response. The catch is a few of the herbs on this list are favorites for cold and flu (especially elderberry). These are perfectly safe to take if you actually just have a cold or the flu, but you should have a confirmed negative COVID-19 test and talk with your doctor before turning to any of these five natural medications: - Sambucus nigra (Elderberry) - Polysaccharide extracts from angustifolia and E. purpurea - Larch arabinogalactan - Vitamin D Why opt for natural medication? \"Natural\" is a vague term, and one thrown around without much thought. A common reminder of this fact is that arsenic is technically natural. In this instance, natural medicine refers to non-pharmacological interventions and treatments (i.e. honey in lieu of dextromethorphan). There are two reasons you might want to go this route. First, some common pharmacological treatments may have side effects or trigger a reaction (read: people with sensitivities or allergies might not tolerate traditional OTC medication that well). As a naturopathic doctor, Megen McBride told Insider that many of her patients come to her \"looking for healthy alternatives to the common pharmacy drug-shelf choices of cold and flu medicines, NSAIDs, and antihistamines [that are] available without a prescription.\" She noted that the primary reason for opting for gentler treatment is the fear of side-effects from pharmacological interventions. \"The sheer number of scientific [articles](https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(00)79554-6/pdf) cautioning Advil and ibuprofen, synthetic [antihistamines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5895478/#:~:text=Adverse%2520effects%2520and%2520overdose&text=Cetirizine%2520is%2520the%2520one%2520most,%252C%2520drowsiness%252C%2520insomnia%2520and%2520rash), painkillers seem too innumerable to count,\" McBride said. \"While these products are not a cure for colds or the flu, natural options may help soothe the symptoms of a virus and many people choose them because they better align with their personal health ideologies than conventional medicine,\" said pharmacist, Maria Gil-Flores. It's important to remember that, as with all dietary supplements, statements made about natural remedies, including these recommendations, have not been evaluated by the FDA. But even those that do have FDA-approval aren't without drawbacks and consequences to one's health: Some common cold and flu medications can be risky, especially if you get sick frequently and are using them throughout the winter. For instance, taking NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) for an extended period can cause [damage to kidneys](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1894754/) ( [renal and heart-related death](https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/pain-relief-taking-nsaids-safely). And antihistamines may cause [sedation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5895478) (including with and cognition](https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(00)79554-6/pdf), [delirium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6467166/), [increased dementia risk](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/common-anticholinergic-drugs-like-benadryl-linked-increased-dementia-risk-201501287667), and more. \"Those most susceptible to the adverse effects are the most vulnerable among us, including small children and the elderly,\" McBride added. While these aren't the only groups who could consider natural remedies, they're perhaps more likely to notice the bad effects of the pharmaceuticals. The other reason many people turn to natural medications: These treatments don't just help with symptom management \u2014 they also work to support your overall health and immune support. How effective is natural medication? \"Natural therapies are generally therapies that work within the natural biological systems and processes of the body,\" said McBride. \"They're used for supporting, tonifying, and balancing the body so that our immune responses to infections are more appropriate, and better tolerated to our whole being.\" The efficacy of natural medications is a highly contentious, ongoing debate. This is because we judge efficacy by two standards: Peer-reviewed studies and scientific trials, and anecdotal evidence. And we don't have nearly as many scientific studies or trials showing herbs, vitamins, and other natural treatments to be unquestionably effective like we do for pharmaceuticals. However, there's something important to consider: Many studies and trials are [funded by the pharmaceutical industry itself](https://www.drugwatch.com/featured/clinical-trials-and-hidden-data/). These studies are needed for FDA approval of a product but they're expensive, and many companies often [can't get the necessary funding](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50972/) without the kind of [backing the industry offers](https://uofuhealth.utah.edu/innovation/blog/2014/05/marciaangell.php). Thus, natural medications don't always have equal footing, nor as much opportunity to showcase their power. Framing of the data is important, too. For instance, while vitamin D may not directly fight the influenza virus, [it's been clinically shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166406/) to be a crucial element in immune function, despite arguments against its effectiveness from Western doctors. McBride pointed out that the National Institute of Health (NIH) states that no complementary interventions have been shown to be helpful for the flu \u2014 and that this is rather misleading. \"Natural therapies have shown through research to have effects on the immune system, nervous system, sleep cycles, and more.\" She points out that while these remedies may not have been shown to directly target the influenza virus in clinical trials, they have been shown to support the immune system \u2014 which not only helps protect you from infections but can help you heal more quickly if you are already ill and prevent your illness from escalating. McBride also noted that the only flu protection option the NIH and CDC recommend is the flu shot, which reduces the risk of flu by [40 to 60%](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm) (which is a far cry from being 100% effective). Dr. Firouzi takes both a natural (via Ayurveda) and Western-medical approach to treatment, but he admits, as the NIH notes, that there's a lack of scientific support for most natural remedies. However, he adds that there's a solid amount of anecdotal evidence in favor of these treatments; many patients continue to use natural supplements, like herbs and plant-based supplements, and (at the very least) they help people feel like they're getting relief. As always, with anything medical, please consult your medical provider before implementing any medical advice you read on the internet. Immune support is important In general, all doctors and medical professionals say it's important to focus on supporting your immune system \u2014 particularly in natural ways \u2014 to ensure you're staying healthy all season long, especially with COVID-19 cases surging. That's because [research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3899649/) a stronger immune system lowers your chances of coming down with a cold or flu. Dr. Firouzi practices not just modern Western medicine (think: modern medicine, pharmacological interventions) but also the ancient Indian holistic branch of medicine called Ayurveda. This was created thousands of years ago, centered on a preventative approach to health and wellness that balances the mind, body, and spirit to minimize the need for treatment down the line. \"We are often searching for something to take for our specific health issues; fundamentally, though, from the Ayurvedic standpoint, is the need to prevent the infection (or at least reduce the severity of its impact), which can in part be achieved through the strengthening of our immune system,\" he said. Megen McBride echoed this, emphasizing that preparation is paramount for preventing illness in times of high contagion (i.e., cold and flu season, or, you know, during a pandemic). There are a number of natural ways to balance your immune system both preventatively and once a virus has taken hold. Dr. Firouzi's Ayurvedic recommendations are lifestyle-based and include sleep, meditation, yoga, and a healthy diet (the basics you hear from many a medical practitioner that always bears repeating). These \"can improve the immune system's response [to pathogens like viruses and bacteria],\" he said. If you do get sick despite taking all the right precautions, it's still important to fortify your immune system. \"Boosting our immune system [can help] to fight invaders and get them subdued and out of the body,\" McBride added. How to shop for natural cold and flu products Even though you can buy homeopathic and natural products freely without a prescription, the experts I talked to all emphasized the importance of conferring with a medical professional before trying something new. \"Because herbs are powerful and should be respected as the wonders they are, it's important to seek out knowledgeable professionals,\" said McBride. \"High dosing herbs can change your body's biochemistry and alter your microbiome, or the flora and organisms living within your gut.\" While everything on this list is safe, gentle, and available over-the-counter, if you're taking anything for more than seven to 10 days, check-in with your doctor. When shopping, the approach isn't just to mute your symptoms, but more so to manage them and help support your immune system in order to minimize infections in the future. With any natural remedy, consider the following: A formula's active ingredients: Active ingredients are the herbs, minerals, and chemicals included in the formula and at a dose high enough to where they'll be effective. You want to ingest active ingredients that have been studied in clinical trials (on humans) and are proven to be effective against the common cold, influenza, or their symptoms. They also need to be deemed safe \u2014 by either your doctor, the World Health Organization, the FDA, or the CDC \u2014 and with minimal side effects. Honey, zinc, vitamin D, quercetin, and ginger were all called out specifically by our doctors and experts as pros to any natural product. These ingredients are part of the formulation for numerous cold and flu treatments but some are used on their own (like honey, for instance). If any of these are listed as the active ingredient, it's a bonus for that product, though efficacy is still not ensured. A formula's additional ingredients: Aside from active ingredients, there's often a second list (sometimes labeled as \"inactive ingredients\") that comprises the rest of the supplement. Here, you want to look for (and stay away from) dyes, fillers, and sweeteners, as well as any ingredients you might have an allergy to. You'll also want to verify, for both active and inactive ingredients, if anything is contraindicated with your current medications or conditions. Consider age, underlying conditions, pregnancy, etc.; these are all things to verify with your doctor. Opt for reputable brands and check Consumer Labs: Because all \"natural agents\" are not regulated by any governing body, such as the FDA, there's no confirmation that what they list as included in the product is actually included \u2014 or that it's all that's in the formula. In fact, these products often don't actually contain what they say is in them, Dr. Shah pointed out during medical review. She added that finding a reputable brand is key, and advised using a database like [Consumer Labs](https://www.consumerlab.com/), which independently tests supplements to verify a formula is indeed trustworthy. How I chose these products In addition to personally testing dozens of natural cold and flu remedies in my five-plus years as a health and wellness reporter, I called on doctors and pharmacists from different backgrounds to give their expert take. I got suggestions from a board-certified MD who has a background in Ayurveda and TCM, a pharmacist, a naturopathic doctor, and a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. Fortunately for me (though not for the sake of journalism), I didn't have a cold or flu during the process of investigating this story. I do already have a selection of tried-and-true remedies I go to when I'm sick, and I also ran these by the panel of experts who were quoted often in this piece. Those experts include: [Dr. Habib Sadeghi, DO](https://behiveofhealing.com/team-view/dr-habib-sadeghi-d-o/)is an osteopathic doctor and founder of the integrative medical center Be Hive of Healing in Agoura Hills, CA.
