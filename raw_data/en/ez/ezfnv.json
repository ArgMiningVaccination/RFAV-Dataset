Here, we longitudinally profile innate and adaptive [immune responses]in 102 [adults]after the first, second, and third doses of [mRNA]or [adenovirus]-vectored [COVID-19 vaccines]. Using a [multi-omics]approach, we identify [immune responses]induced by ChAdOx1-S and [BNT162b2]that correlate with [antigen]-specific antibody [cell]responses or [vaccine]reactogenicity. Unexpectedly, we observe that [vaccination]with ChAdOx1-S, but not [BNT162b2], induces an adenoviral vector-specific [memory]response after the first [dose], which correlates with the expression of [proteins]with [roles]in [thrombosis]with potential implications for [thrombosis]with represents a major [resource]that can be used to understand the immunogenicity "}
