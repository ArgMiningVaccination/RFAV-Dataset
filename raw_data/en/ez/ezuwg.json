Naturopathy considers all dimensions of the life of a person linked to the process of disease. The disease is also seen as an expression of the body eliminating excess toxins that have accumulated due to insufficient nutrition and lifestyle, hence presenting itself as the body attempting to heal itself. Naturopathy attempts to harmonize the equilibrium of both biochemical and energetic balance through individualized treatments seeking to restore and maintain optimal health. Naturopathy prohibits the use, even in the case of an emergency, of major surgery or synthetic prescription drugs. Naturopathy medicines can help to treat both acute and chronic conditions and some of the conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, infertility, and cancer.
