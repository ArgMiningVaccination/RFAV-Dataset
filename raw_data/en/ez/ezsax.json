Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 1 Section I: Introduction Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 2 Introduction Surveillance has been defined by the US Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention (CDC) as \"the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health da ta essential to the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practice, closely integr ated with the timely dissemination of these data to those who need to know.\"1 In Canada, surveillance of communicable diseases is supported by provincia l legislation that mandates the reporting or notifying of diseases by laboratories and physicians. The list of such di seases differs by province/territory. The Public Health Agency of Canada through the Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control provides disease-specific case defi nitions for those diseases under national surveillance. This facilitates comparability across jurisdictions. 2 In Nova Scotia, the Health Protection Act and th e Regulations under the Act govern the reporting of communicable diseases. Notifiabl e communicable diseases are list ed and the responsibilities of physicians and laboratories in th e timely reporting of these diseases are delineated. The method of reporting is determined by the ur gency of reporting the disease. 3 This report reviews the communicable disease data collected over a 10-year pe riod in Nova Scotia through a series of charts and ta bles. For diseases that have been more recently designated as reportable, data are summarized for the period 1997-2005 only. Diseases are grouped according to the national surveillance categories: Enteric, Food and Waterborne Diseases; Diseases Transmitted by Direct Contact and Respiratory Routes; Sexually Transmitted and Bloodborne Pathogens; Vectorborne and Other Zoonotic Diseases; Diseases Preventable by Routine Vaccination; and Other Diseases. It should be emphasized that the numbers cited in this report reflect only those diseases that are reported to Public Health Services and may under represent the true number of cases in the population. Methodology Unless otherwise indicated, all incidences are cr ude rates based on the census population of Nova Scotia in 2001 (census data s upplied by the Information Analysis and Reporting Section of the Office of the Chief Information Officer, NS Departme nt of Health). Please note that rates for the previously published 2001-2002 annual report were calculated based on the 1991 census population. The rates in the subsequent re ports (2003-2004 and 2005) therefore ar e not directly comparable. Currently, Nova Scotia is composed of nine Di strict Health Authorities (DHAs). Many of the DHAs have shared service agreements resulting in four groupings of distri cts that Public Health Services refer to as the Western, Capital, Northe rn and Eastern regions. Geographic comparisons are made on this regional basis. Rates calculat ed for selected enteric, sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections for these re gions in 2005 have been age-stan dardized to the age distribution of the 2001 census population for Canada. Cases for which age was not specified were not included in this calculation and these numbers have been note d. For selected diseases, age-specific incidence and distribution of cases by mont h of diagnosis are also presented. Ages have been grouped by five-year intervals for those 0 to 29 years of age, by ten-year intervals for those 30 to 59 years of age, and a single grouping has been designa ted for those 60 years of age and older. Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 3 Limitations Crude Rates: The scales on charts used to depict incidences in this report vary with the disease presented. Although trends may appear to show great variab ility, often very low rates of disease have been graphically presented and should be noted as such. Out-of-Province Testing: Individuals who may reside in Nova Scotia but have previously tested positive outside of the province will not be reported here and therefore do not appear in Nova Scotia provincial statistics. Cases are usually attributed to the province where the in itial positive diagnosis was made. HIV and Hepatitis C Virus Testing: The number of positive HIV test reports describe s those who have been tested and given a diagnosis of HIV infection but is not represen tative of the total number of persons living with HIV (i.e., prevalence) or the number of newly infected individua ls (i.e., incidence).4 Similarly, the number of hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive reports describes those who have been tested and diagnosed as HCV positive but is not representative of all those living with HCV (prevalence) or those who are newly inf ected (incidence). The peak noted in 1997 is probably a reflection of increased testing thr ough the provincial targeted programs and the resultant diagnosis of an increased number of new cases from the pool of prevalent cases. Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 4 Section II: Enteric, Food and Waterborne Diseases Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 5 Campylobacteriosis Campylobacteriosis is an acute zoono tic bacterial disease that affects the gastrointestinal tract. The disease varies in severity and is characterized by diarrhea (frequently with blood in the stool), abdominal pain, malaise, fever, nausea and vomiti ng. Infection occurs through the consumption of undercooked chicken or pork, contaminated food, wa ter or raw milk and may also be acquired through close contact with infected infants. Infected puppies, kittens or farm animals may also be a source of the disease.5 The crude incidence of campylobacteriosis in Nova Scotia has shown a decr easing trend over the last decade, from 22.5 cases per 100,000 populat ion in 1996 to 13.3 cases per 100,000 population in 2005 (Figure 1). Approximately 65% of all campylob acteriosis cases in Nova Scotia in 2005 were reported in individuals 30 years of age or older (Figure 2). The age-specific incidence for these groups ranged from 11.8 to 16.7 cases per 100,000 (Figure 2). Figure 1: Incidence of Campyl obacteriosis, Nova Scotia, 1996-2005 051015202530 YearRate per 100,000 Number of Cases 212 213 214 163 173 171 201 140 149 125 Rate 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 6 Figure 2: Age specific incidence of Campyl obacterosis by age groups, Nova Scotia, 2005 0510152025303540 Age GroupRate per 100,000 Total Nu mb er of C as es 4 5 2 91 761 7 3 6 2 8 Rate 8.30 8.80 3.20 14.00 2005 7 Cryptosporidiosis Cryptosporidiosis is a parasitic infection affec ting humans and more than 45 vertebrate species including poultry, birds, fish, re ptiles and small and large mammals. Cryptosporidium parvum is associated with human infection, affecting the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal, biliary and respiratory tracts. The infection can be sympto matic or asymptomatic. Diarrhea is the main manifestation of the disease but other less freque nt symptoms can occur including pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. The disease is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and may be waterborne, foodborne, passed from person-to-per son or from animal-to-person.5 The incidence of cryptosporidiosis infection in N ova Scotia has remained very low over the last seven years with an average annual incidence of less than two cases per 100,000 population (Figure 3). The apparent increase in rates post-1998 may re flect changes in laboratory testing that would have detected cases of cryptosporid iosis in addition to those for wh ich testing for cryptosporidiosis was specifically requested. Figure 3: Incidence of Cryptosp oridiosis, Nova Scotia, 1997-2005 00.511.52 YearRate per 100,000 Number of Cases 0086 1.06 0.85 0.64 0.95 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 8 Cyclosporiasis Cyclospora cayetanensis is a coccidian protozoan responsible for diarrheal disease. Food and water are the main vehicles of transmission. The di sease is endemic in many developing countries. International outbreaks have been traced back to raspberries; basil and lettuce have also been implicated. It has also been associated with travel to an endemic area (e.g., Caribbean islands, Mexico, and Asia).5 The incidence of cyclosporiasis has been consistent ly low in Nova Scotia over the past six years with less than one case per 100,000 population reported annually. There were no reported cases of cyclosporiasis in 2005 (Figure 4). As with cryptosporidiosis, the a pparent increase in rates post- 1998 may reflect changes in laboratory testing. Figure 4: Incidence of Cyclos poriasis, Nova Scotia, 1997-2005 00.51 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 9 Giardiasis Giardiasis is a protozoan infecti on, primarily of the upper small inte stine. Transmission is person- to-person with the primary mode of spread related to hand-to-mouth transfer of cysts from the feces of infected persons (particularly in institutions and daycare centres). Ingestion of cysts in fecally contaminated water and, more rarely, food may lead to lo calized outbreaks. 5 The incidence of giardiasis has decreased slightly over the last decade, with the exception of 1996 when incidence peaked at 15.8 cases per 100,000 population (Figure 5). In 2005, 59% of cases were reported in males. Approximately 55% of all reported cases were di agnosed in individuals 40 years of age or older and the highest age-specifi c incidence was reported in individuals 25-29 years of age (Figure 6). The greatest proportion of cases (16.7%) was reported in September.

Infection can be asymptomatic or symptomatic. Symptoms, which range from mild to severe, include fever, loss of appetite, nausea, stomach pain, dark urine, and ja undice. Transmission is pe rson-to-person via the fecal-oral route. Common source outbreaks have been associated with water and food contaminated by infected food handlers and with contaminated molluscs and produce.5 The incidence of HAV in Nova Scotia has decrea sed since 1997 and has remained below one case per 100,000 population since 1999 (Figure 7). In 2005, 80% of all cases were reported between April and July.

Saxitoxins are produced by the Alexandrium species as well as other dinoflagellates. The onset of symptoms occurs minutes to hours following the consumption of bivalve molluscs. The toxins become concentrated especially during algae blooms that are termed \"red tides\" but al so occur in the absence of such blooms. Once shellfish become toxic and the bloom subsides, they maintain their toxicity for a number of weeks. In some species, the toxicity is ongoing. While PSP commonly occurs in shellfish harvested from colder waters, it may also occur in tropical waters. 5 Cases are reported sporadically in Nova Scotia a nd since 1997, have only been reported in 3 years (1998, 2001, and 2005) (Figure 8). Figure 8: Incidence of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP), Nova Scotia, 1997-2005 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 13 Salmonellosis Salmonellosis is an enteric infection of b acterial origin. Numerous serotypes of Salmonella are pathogenic for animals and humans and vary in pr evalence from country to country. In most areas, only a few serotypes account for most of the conf irmed cases. The disease is transmitted by the ingestion of food derived from infected animals or through the fecal contamination of food from an animal or person with th e disease. Potential sources of in fection include raw and undercooked eggs and egg products, raw milk and raw milk products , contaminated water, meat and meat products, poultry and poultry products as well as reptiles and chicks. Raw fruits and vegetables may also be implicated if contamination occurs when the produce is sliced.5 The incidence of salmonellosis in Nova Sco tia has varied between 10-20 cases per 100,000 population since 1996 and has shown an apparent de creasing trend since 2001 (F igure 9). Fifty-one percent of cases were reported be tween July and October 2005, and 56% of cases occurred in those 30 years of age or older. Age-specific incidence was highest in the 0-4 year old age group (29 cases per 100,00 population) followed by those in the 25- 29 year old age group (24.1 cases per 100,00 population) (Figure 10). It is of note that many of the reported cases of salmonellosis are travel- related.

Transmission is direct or indirect from a symptomatic individual or from a short-term asymptomatic carrier via the fecal oral route. Transmission may also occur through direct fecal contamination of water and milk and th rough flies that contaminate uncovered food.5 The incidence of shigellosis in Nova Scotia has re mained consistently low over the past ten years at less than one case per 100,000 popul ation with the excep tion of 2002 and 2005 when the incidence reached 1.6 and 2.0 cases per 100,000 population respectiv ely (Figure 11). In 2005, all cases were reported between January and July. The age specifi c incidence was highest for those 20-24 years of age at 4.8 cases per 100,000 population.

A common serotype in North America is E. coli O157:H7. Transmi ssion may be through water but commonly the infection is transmitted through contaminated food. Inadequately cooked beef, particularly ground beef, raw milk and fruits or vegetables th at have been contaminated with feces from ruminants are commonly responsible. Th e bacteria may also be passed person-to-person through direct contact in families, childcare centres, and institutions. 5 The incidence of verotoxigenic E. coli infection in Nova Scotia peaked at 7.9 cases per 100,000 population in 1998 followed by an apparent decrease to 1.3 and 1.5 cases per 100,000 population in 2004 and 2005 respectively (Figure 12). Reported cases in 2005 occurred e qually in females and males. Half of the reported cases in 2005 were in individuals less than 20 years of age. The highest age-specific incidence occurred in those 15-19 years of ag e at 6.2 cases per 100,000 population (Figure 13).

Y ersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis both cause clinical illness but Y. enterocolitica is responsible for most of the reported cases. Transmission is via the fecal-oral route through consumption of contaminated food and water or by contact with infected hum ans and animals. Pathogenic strains of Y. enterocolitica have been most commonly isolat ed from raw pork or pork products.5 The incidence of yersiniosis in N ova Scotia has been ve ry low over the past nine years at less than one case per 100,000 population (Figure 14).

Approximately 6,812 individuals were affected and f our deaths occurred. The majority (76.9%) of outbreaks occurred in resi dential (i.e., long-term car e) facilities, affecting a total of 5,666 people. Private functions and non-reside ntial facilities accounted for 29 (17.6%) of the outbreaks and seven (4.2%) involved food services establishments. During this period of time, 70 ( 42.4%) of the enteric outb reaks were attributed to viral agents, 20 (12.1%) were attributed to bacterial agents and in 75 (45%) of the reported outbreaks, the agent was unknown. Of the 59 (35.8%) outbreaks where the etiological agent was conf irmed, the isolated organisms included: Norwalk-like vi rus (34), Rotavirus (10), Salmonella species (5), E. coli O157 (4), Bacillus cereus (3), Clostridium difficile (1), and Staphylococcus aureus (1). Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 20 Section III: Diseases Transmitted by Direct Contact and Respiratory Routes Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 21 Group A Streptococcal Disease - Invasive There are approximately 80 sero logically distinct types of Streptococcus pyogenes , group A streptococci. A variety of diseases are caused by these bacteria but strept ococcal sore throat and skin infections are most commonly encountered. Other diseases include scarlet fever, puerperal fever, septicemia, erysipelas, cellulitis, mastoid itis, otitis media, pneumonia, peritonsillitis and wound infections. Rarely, infection may lead to necrotizing fasciitis, rheumatic fever and a toxic shock-like syndrome. Transmission is through larg e respiratory droplets or direct contact with patients or individuals who ar e carriers of the bacteria.5 The incidence of invasive group A streptococcal disease in N ova Scotia between 1997 and 2001 was very low with an average annual rate of less than one case (0.32) per 100,000 population (Figure 15). The incidence showed an appare nt increase to 1.8 cases per 100,000 between 2002 and 2004. In 2005, the rate (2.65 cases per 100,000 popula tion) was eight-fold higher than the 2001 rate. This apparent increase in incidence may reflect better repor ting. The highest incidence rates were noted in children aged 5-9 years and adults 30-39 years with 72 % of cases reported in adults 30 years of age or older (Figure 16).

Early onset (one to seven days) group B streptococcal disease is acquired in utero or during delivery, is characterized by se psis, respiratory dist ress, apnea, shock, pneumonia and meningitis, and often occurs in low-birt h weight infants. Late onset (seven days to several months) disease is characterized by sepsis and meningitis, is acquired by person-to-person contact and occurs in full-term infants. The cas e fatality is approximately 50% and 25% for early onset and late onset di sease, respectively. 5 There were no cases of group B streptococcal dise ase of the newborn repor ted in Nova Scotia between 1998 and 2000 and between 2002 and 2005. This may reflect underreporting. The incidence in 2001 was less than one case per 100,000 population. Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 24 Influenza This section reports activity during the influenza season (November to April) rather than the 2005 calendar year. Laboratory-confirmed influenza: As of the week ending June 24, 2006 (Week 25 of the year), 115 laborato ry-confirmed cases of influenza were reported in Nova Scotia: 29 (25.2%) infl uenza A and 86 (74.8%) influenza B. This represents a significant decrease from the number of confirmed cases reported in 2004-05 (n=513) and 2003-04 (n=357) but was consistent with the number of cases reported in 2002-03 and 2001-02 (n=67 and n=98, respectively). Figure 17 presents the total numbe r of laboratory-confirmed cases by report week for the 2005-2006 influenza season. The first confirmed case was not reported until the week ending February 4, 2006 (Week 5). This was considerably later than in each of the past few influenza seasons which began as early as November. Influen za activity peaked around the end of March (Week 12) and the last confirmed case was reported during the week ending May 20, 2006 (Week 20). Figure 17: Number of lab-confirmed Influenz a cases by report week, Nova Scotia, 2005-2006 The specific number of cases reported by each of the province's nine District Health Authorities (DHAs) is presented in Table 1. The highest proportion (n=51, 44.3%) of lab-confirmed influenza cases in 2005-06 were reported in Capital Distri ct, followed by Cape Br eton District Health Authority. The highest rate of influenza, how ever, was reported in South Shore Health Influenza B Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 25 reported an incidence of 24.8 cases per 100,000 population, followed by Guysborough Antigonish Strait Health Authority (incid ence: 18.4 cases per 100,000 persons). Of the 115 influenza cases reported in 2005-2006, 64 (55.7%) were females and 51 (44.3%) were males. Unlike previous influenza seasons where th e majority of cases have been reported in those 65 years of age or older, in 2005-06 the majority (63.2%) of influenza cas es were reported among persons under 25 years of age. Additionally, 47 (41.2%) of the lab-confirmed cases this season were in youth under 15 years of age.

In each of the past three influenza seasons, the ILI rate peaked twice, once around the beginning of January and with a second peak occu rring in early March. Th e rate (per 100 patient visits) of ILI activ ity reported by sentinel phys icians in 2005-2006 is comp ared with each of the previous three seasons (2002/ 03 to 2004/05) in Figure 18. Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 26 Figure 18: Percent of patient visits due to ILI reported by sentinel physicians (2002/03, 2003/04, 2004/05 and 2005/06 seasons) Outbreaks During the 2005-2006 season, 25 outbreaks of influenz a-like illness (ILI) were reported by long- term care facilities in the province. This is less than half the number of outbreaks reported last season (n=63). Of the 25 reported ILI outbreaks, an etiologic agent could be confirmed for only 10 (40.0%). Of these 10, six were confirmed as infl uenza A, three were confirmed as parainfluenza virus and one was confirmed as respiratory syncytial virus. Influenza Immunization Children 6 to 23 Months of Age The 2005-2006 influenza season marked the second year that children aged 6 to 23 months were eligible to receive publicly-funded influenza vacci ne. A total of 4959 children in this age group were reported to have received the influenza vacc ine in 2005-2006, for a provincial coverage rate of 39.2% (Table 2). This is slightly lower th an the rate reported in 2004- 2005 (42.7%); however, since this is only the second y ear that this group wa s eligible to receiv e influenza vaccine, it is too soon to indicate a trend.

Water is probably the prim ary reservoir and epidemiologically, hot water systems (showers), cooling towers for air conditioning systems, evaporative condensers, humidifiers, whirlpool spas, equi pment used in respiratory thera py, and decorative fountains have been implicated. Airborne transmission has been supported by epidemiologic evidence but the bacteria may also be transmitted by aspiration of water. 5 The incidence of legionellosis in Nova Scotia has been extremely low with less than one new case per 100,000 population reported annually between 1998 and 2005 (Figure 20). No cases were reported in 2003 and 2004. Figure 20: Incidence of Legion ellosis, Nova Scotia, 1997-2005 00.20.40.60.81 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 32 Meningococcal Disease - Invasive Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is an acute bacterial disease caused by the meningococcus, Neisseria meningitidis . The disease is spread by direct c ontact and droplet infection from the nose and throat of infected individuals. The prevalence of those who carry the bact eria in the absence of meningitis or invasive disease may be 25% or more but the invasion of bacteria sufficient to cause systemic disease is uncommon. Se rogroups A, B, C and Y are respons ible for most cases of disease but groups W-135, X and Z have also been recognized as pathogens.5 Following an outbreak in 1992, the overall incide nce of IMD in Nova Scotia has remained consistently low (Figure 21). The highest incidence was reported in children and youth less than 20 years of age, with a mean rate of 2 cases per 100,000 annually since 1998. A total of 53 laboratory-confirmed and clinical cases of IMD were reported between 1996 and 2005 in Nova Scotia, including 5 deaths (Table 10). The incidence has been shown to be highest among young children and to declin e with increasing age. Immunizat ion programs generally focus on those less than 20 years of age. Tables 10 and 11 summarize the reported cases of laboratory- confirmed IMD from 1996 to 2005 with confirme d serogroups (B, C, Y, W-135 and unknown) by age group.

Between 1995 and 2003, the rates of MRSA increased in CNISP hospitals from 0.46 cases per 1,000 admissions to 5.10 per 1,000 admissions (P = 0.002). Increases were noted across the country but most occurred in Ontario and Quebec. Although the rate of MRSA remains low in the Atlantic provinces, they recently appear to have increased significantly. Much of the observed increase in the detection of MRSA ma y be attributed to screening programs. 7 The incidence of MRSA in Nova Scotia has been st eadily increasing from a rate of 3.6 cases per 100,000 in 1997 to 80.5 cases per 100,000 in 2005 (Figure 22). The highest age standardized rate of MRSA was reported in Cap ital District Health Authority (Figure 23). It should be noted that accompanying this increase in incidence was a marked increase in testing; positive tests may reflect patients who are not only infected with MRSA but also those who are colonized with MRSA.

Invasive disease is most commonly diagnosed in the very young, the elderl y and those groups at high risk of disease (functional or anatomic asplenia and congenita l or acquired immune deficiencies, including AIDS).8 The infection is transmitted by droplet spread, direct oral contact or through indirect contact with articles freshly contaminated with respiratory discharges. Pneumococcal vaccine is available for infants and the elderly. Between 1996 and 2003, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in Nova Scotia remained low with an annual rate of less than one case per 100,000 population. Although there was an apparent increase in in cidence in 2004 and 2005, th e rate remained lo w at 2.9 cases per 100,000 population (Figure 24).

Although tuberculosis may affect any orga n or tissue, pulmonary tuberculosis is the most common form of the disease. Tubercul e bacilli are transmitted in airborne droplet nuclei through coughing and sneezing by individuals with pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis. Exposure to tuberculous cattle can result in bovine tuberculosis. 5 The incidence of new active and relapsed cases of tuberculosis in Nova Scotia has declined in recent years (Figure 25). Between 2000 and 2005, the incidence was less than one case per 100,000 population.

It is comparatively common but seldom with se rious consequences, with more than 50% of cases having no demonstrable etio logy. In the United States, enteroviruses (picornaviruses) are responsible for the majority of cases of known etiology. Certai n types of Coxsackievirus group B and echoviruses cause one-third and one-hal f of cases, respectively. The mode of transmission varies with the infectious agent.5 Since 1996, the incidence of viral meningitis in Nova Scotia has remained very low at less than one case per 100,000 population, with the excepti on of 2001 when the rate was 1.4 cases per 100,000 population (Figure 26). This may under repr esent the true number of cases in the population.

In the past 20 years, the emergence of enterococci is, in many ways, attributable to their resistance to a number of commonly the first report of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) was ma de in the United States, almost 30 years following the clinical introduction of vancomycin. This occurrence of VRE was probably prompted by the use of orally administered vancomycin in hospitals in the treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Of all vancomyc in-resistant enterococci recovered in the United States, more than 95% are E. faecium and all show resistance to high levels of ampicillin. 11 The incidence of VRE in Nova Scotia was c onsistently low between 1997 and 2001 at less than one case per 100,000 population (Figure 27). Recent apparent increases may reflect increased testing.

These attack the brain, kil ling cells and creating gaps in the tissue. The disease is always fatal. The main two types of CJD are classical and variant. Variant CJD is a new disease in humans linked to eating beef products from cattle infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). Tran smission to humans has not been established, but the favoured theory attribut es the transmission to consump tion of food contaminated with the agent. 5 The mean onset age is 28 years. Other prion diseases include scrapie in sheep and Chronic Wasting Disease in deer and elk. Classical CJD is a human prion disease which occu rs naturally in the population at a rate of approximately one person in a million people per year . The mean age of onset is 60 years. It is not linked to eating beef and is seen sporadical ly in populations around the world. Iatrogenic cases have been reported due to medical or surgical treatment. Classical CJD is very rare in Nova Scotia . The annual rate between 1996 and 2005 was less than one case per 100,000 population (Figure 28). Ei ght out of 10 cases were 60 years of age or older. Age was unknown in two cases.

Between 1985 and 2005, there were 690 new HIV-posi tive tests reported in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island (Figure 29). 4 Figure 29: Number of HIV positi ve test reports, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, 1985-2005 0100200300400500600Number of HIV Pos Test Reports YearHIV Pos T est Reports 575 16 15 16 19 33 161985- 19992000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 44Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) AIDS is a disease syndrome representing the late clinical stage of infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Between 1979 and 2005, there were 326 reported cases of AIDS in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. There has been a continuous dec line since 1995 (Figure 30). The most common risk group identified over this time period was MS M (men who have sex with men) (Figure 31). 4 Figure 30: Number of reported cases of AIDS , Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, 1979-2005 050100150200250Number of Reported AIDS Cases YearAIDS 2 3 4 1 9 1 1 1 2 1 1 9467851979- 19951996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 45Figure 31: Percentage of distribution of repor ted cases of AIDS by most common exposure categories, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, 1979 to 2005 72%3%5%6%14% MS M MS M/IDU IDU Blood/Blood Products Heterosexual Contact Percentages based on total reports minus reports with no identified risk (3 reports).

Genital chlamydial infection is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis , manifested in males mainly as urethritis and in females prim arily as mucopurulent cervicitis.5 Recent increasing incidence rates of chlamydial infection probabl y reflect to a large degree changes in testing methodology. The number of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in Capital District Health Authority showed a marked increase in 2001 coinci dental with the replacement of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method of testi ng with a more sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method at the Microbiology Laboratory of the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre. Therefore, wh ile rates may have increased (Fi gure 32), much of this increase can be attributed to more sensitive testing. 12 In 2005, the incidence of reported ne w cases of genital chlamydial infection in females exceeded the rates in males for those 15-39 years age (F igure 33): 72% of all reported new cases were diagnosed in females. This may be reflective of more females than males undergoing testing. The greatest proportion of cases in 2005 (71%) we re reported in the 15 to 24 year age group. DHA 9 (Capital) reported the hi ghest age-standard ized incidence of 247.7 cases per 100,000 population. Females in Capital had an ag e-standardized inci dence of 340.5 per 100,000 population (Figure 34).

It causes genital infections in males and fema les and can cause conjunctivitis in newborns, potentially leading to blindness if not quickly and adequately treated.5 In 2002, the incidence of gonorrhea in Nova Scotia peaked at 21 cases per 100,000 population, and has declined to 11 cases per 100,000 population si nce that year (Figure 35). This sharp peak in incidence may reflect, to some degree, the cons olidation of testing in Capital District Health Authority to one site in Halifax that permitted extended hours of testing. In 2005, 62.5% of reported cases were individuals 15 to 29 years of age and approximately 66% of cases were reported in female s. Age-specific incidence was hi ghest in the 20-24 year old age group in 2005. Females 20-24 years of age had an age specific incide nce of 67 cases per 100,000 population. The incidence among females 30 years of age or younger was higher than in males of the same age. Conversely, the ag e-specific incidence among males 30 years of age or older was higher than in females of the same age (Figure 36). DHA9 (Capital) had the highest age-standardized incidence of 21 cases pe r 100,000 population. Males in DHA9 had an age- standardized incidence of 22.4 cases per 100,000 (Figure 37).

Chronic infection is found in 0.5% of North American adults.5 The risk of developing chronic infection varies inversely with age following acute infection; risk is also increased in immunocompromised individuals.8 HBV may be transmitted sexually, through household contact with an infected indivi dual, perinatally from mother to infant, through injection drug use, and through nosocomial exposure.5 The incidence of acute HBV has declined since 1996 to less th an one case pe r 100,000 in 2005 (Figure 38). All cases in 2005 we re diagnosed in individuals 25 y ears of age or older. Chronic HBV peaked at 5.4 cases per 100,000 in 1999 and d eclined to a rate of 2.2 cases per 100,000 by 2005 (Figure 39). In some populations (e.g., health care workers) , the risk of infection may be reduced by providing HBV vaccine. Publicly funded v accine programs are now offered in all provinces/territories to provide universal immunization against HB V. The age at which children and adolescents are offered the vaccine varies between jurisdictions (Nova Scotia has a school- based program for Grade 4 students). 8 Figure 38: Incidence of Acute He patitis B, Nova Scotia, 1996-2005 0123456 YearRate per 100,000 Number of cases 47 28 41 21 13 16 9 14 10 8 Acu te Hepatitis B Rate 4.99 2.97 4.35 2.23 1.38 1.70 0.95 1.49 1.06 0.851996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 51 Figure 39: Incidence of Chroni c Hepatitis B, Nova Scotia, 1997-2005 0123456 YearRate per 100,000 Number of Cases 0 5 51 28 13 21 20 22 21 Chronic Hepatitis B Rate 0.00 0.50 5.40 2.97 1. 38 2.23 2.12 2.33 2.231997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 52 Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is a viral infection caused by the He patitis C Virus (HCV). Transmission of HCV is commonly parenteral but sexual transmission has been documented; however, it is far less efficient than the parenteral route.5 Between 1996 and 2005, 3105 cases of HCV were repor ted in Nova Scotia. As with testing for HIV, the number of reported cases represents th e number of positive test reports of those who have come forward for testing. As such, these nu mbers are not a reflection of the true incidence in the population. The rapid incr ease in rates in the mid-1990' s may reflect the outcome of increased testing through program s implemented in Nova Scotia to identify, contact and advise the recipients of blood and blood products of th eir potential risk for disease. Since 1997, the number of positive test reports has continued to s how an apparent decline to 255 cases reported in 2005 (Figure 40). Sixty-nine percent of cases reported ove r this 10-year period were diagnosed in males (females 30% and unidentifie d gender in 1%). The greatest number of positive tests (90) was reported for males 40-59 years of age in 2005 (Figure 41). District Health Authorities 7 and 8 (Eastern) had the highest age-standardized rate of positive test reports in 2005 at 47.5 per 100,000 population (Figure 42). Sixty four percent of reported cases during 1996-2005 had follow-up risk factor information provided. Of these 1989 cases, inj ection drug use (IDU) was identifie d as a risk factor in 60%, receipt of tattoos in 38%, blood transfusion in 24% and sharing needles was reported as a risk factor in 34% of cases. Sexual ri sk factors were not included in this analysis. Risk factors are not mutually exclusive with many cases reporting more than one risk factor.

It is characterized by a pr imary lesion, a secondary erupti on that involves the skin and mucous membranes, lengthy periods of latency a nd late lesions of the skin, bone, viscera and central nervous and cardiovascular systems. S yphilis is transmitted sexually, vertically to the fetus through the placenta from an infect ed pregnant woman and possibly through blood transfusion if the donor is in the early stages of infection.5 The incidence of early syphilis (primary and secondary syphilis) between 1996 and 2005 in Nova Scotia was relatively stable at less than one case per 100,000 population, with the exception of 2003 and 2004. Other parts of Canada were experi encing similar trends. Most outbreaks have been related to the sex trade and in men who ha ve sex with men. The decline in 2005 may be due in part to the extensive efforts put forward by public health with key partners.19 The incidence of \"other\" syphilis was low at less than one case pe r 100,000 between 1996 and 2004 (Figure 44). In 2005, the rate was 1.2 cases per 100,000 population (Figure 44).

Mala ria is a major cause of illness in many tropical and sub-tropical areas and is transmitted by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. Areas of high transmission are found on the edges of forests in South America (e.g., Brazil), southeast Asia (e.g., Thailand and Indonesia) and throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Transfusion of blood from those infected or the use of contamin ated needles or syringes (injection drug users) may also transmit the infection. Although congenital transmission is rare, stillbirth from mothers who have been infected is common.5 Incidence of malaria in Nova Scotia has b een exceedingly low with less than one case per 100,000 population between 1996 and 2005. These cases were travel-related (Figure 45).

It is often characterized by a distinctive skin lesion called erythema migrans and systemic symptoms. Neur ologic, rheumatologic and cardiac involvement may also be present in varying combinations from months to years.5 There have been four cases of Lyme disease in Nova Scotia th a t w e r e l i k e l y acquired in the province. Two of these cases were reported in 2002, the third in 2004, a nd the fourth in 2005, all from Lunenburg County. Cases have also been re ported that were acquire d during travel. There were five such reported cases in 200 4, acquired in Europe or New England. West Nile Virus The West Nile Virus (WNv) is transmitted by mos quitoes that become infected by feeding on the blood of birds carrying the virus. The virus was initially isol ated in 1937 in the West Nile province of Uganda and outbreaks ha ve occurred in areas such as Egypt, Israel, South Africa and parts of Asia and Europe. The first North Am erican outbreak occurred in the summer of 1999 in New York City and the surroundi ng area. In Canada, the pres ence of the virus was first confirmed in September 2001 in birds in Ontario. The first human case was also confirmed in Ontario in September 2002.13 Surveillance activities first dete cted WNV in Nova Scotia in 2002 with four positive dead birds. In 2003, the virus was detected in 17 dead birds and one horse. Two travel-related human cases were also diagnosed that summer. In 2004, altho ugh surveillance activities were similar to those conducted in 2003, no WNv was detected in the provi nce (testing of humans, dead birds, horses and mosquitoes). In 2005, all dead birds, mo squito pools, and horses tested for WNv were negative. Four human specimens were confirmed to be WNv positive but only one was a resident of Nova Scotia and wa s believed to have acquired the infection as a result of travel outside of the province. The other three posi tives were not Nova Scotians and were likely exposed in their home provinces/states. Rabies Rabies is a neurotropic disease of viral origin that is vaccine-preventable. It presents clinically in humans as furious (agitated) and paralytic (dumb) rabies and is al most invariably fatal. Furious rabies is most common and is associated with hydrophobia and/or aerophobia and usually results in death within a few days of onset of symptoms. The clinical course for paralytic rabies is more protracted and is associated with local pa resthesia and progressi ve flaccid paralysis.15 Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 59There has been a steady increase in the number of cas es of animal rabies in Canada over the last few years with the majority of cases reported from Ontario and Manitoba. Bats, skunks and foxes are the most commonly infected animals. There were no positive reports of rabies in animals in Nova Scotia (laboratory and clini cal) reported to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in 2005, however a cat positive for rabies was reported in 2003.16 Despite the large numbers of cases of animal rabies , human rabies is rare in Canada. There have been 22 human deaths due to rabies since reporting was initiated in 1925.8 No human cases were reported after 1985 until a nine-year old boy fr om Montreal, Quebec, died from rabies encephalitis in October 200017 and a 52-year-old man from th e greater Vancouver region died from undiagnosed rabies encephalitis in January 2003.18 Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 60 Section VI: Diseases Preventa ble by Routine Vaccination Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 61Haemophilus influenzae Type b (Hib) Disease - Invasive Prior to the introduction of Hib vaccines, Haemophilus influenzae b was not only the most common cause of bacterial meningitis, but was also an important cause of other serious invasive infections in young children. Ap proximately 55% to 65% of t hose children affected had meningitis while the remainder had epiglottitis, bacteremia, cellulitis, pneumonia or septic arthritis. Otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis and other respiratory tract disorders also are closely associated with Hib disease. An estimated 2000 cases of Hib disease occurred annually in Canada prior to the introduction of the Hib c onjugate vaccine in 1988. Since that time, the overall incidence of the disease has declined by more than 99%. Most cases now occur in those children who are too old to have undergone primary immunization. 8 Since 1996, the rate of Haemophilus influenzae b has been extremely low at less than one case per 100,000 population (Figure 46).

Since the introduction of the vaccine, the incidence of measles has shown a marked decline in Canada and the two-dose schedule of immunization is fu rther decreasing the proportion of children who are susceptible. Prior to the introduction of the vaccine, an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 cases occurred annually. The occurrence was cyclical with the inciden ce increasing every two to three years. Immunization for measles in Canada will continue to be necessary until the disease has been eliminated globally. 8 The incidence of measles in Nova Scotia since 1996 has been very low with less than one case per 100,000 population reported (Figur e 47). No cases were repor ted in 1998 and between 2001 and 2005. Figure 47: Incidence of Measles, Nova Scoti a, 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 63 Mumps Mumps or infectious parotitis is an acute vi ral disease transmitted through the air, by droplet spread or direct contact with the saliva of an infected individual.5 Mumps was a major cause of viral meningitis prior to the extensive use of mu mps vaccine. Since the vaccine was licensed in 1969, there has been a greater than 99% decreas e in the reported number of cases of mumps.8 Less than one case of mumps per 100,000 populat ion was reported between 1996 and 2004 with no cases reported between 1999 and 2001 (Figure 48). In 2005, there was a rapid increase in the incidence of mumps to a rate of 3.2 cases per 100,000 population. This was the result of two mumps outbreaks reported in the Capital Distri ct Health Authority (H alifax, Nova Scotia) between May 2005 and January 2006. The first re ported outbreak occurr ed between May and August 2005. A total of 13 cases of mumps were linked to the outbreak e ither epidemiologically or by laboratory confirmation. The median age wa s 14 years (range: 13 to 19 years). Nine had received two doses of MMR while four had received only one dose. The second reported outbreak occurred between September 2005 and January 2006. A total of 19 confirmed cases of mumps were reported am ong the staff and student population of a local university. The median age was 23 years (rang e: 20 - 27 years). In the second outbreak, one case reported receiving two doses of MMR; the re maining 18 cases had received only one dose of MMR in childhood. No epidemiological links were identified betwee n the two outbreaks.

Transmission is commonly by airborne droplet infection usually by direct contact with discharges from respiratory mucous membrane s of infected individuals.5,8 Although any age may be affected, it is most severe am ong young infants. The reduction of incidence and morbidity of the infection among young children, therefore, is important. Although the incidence has declined by more than 90% in Canada, outbreaks still occur. 8 Following a peak in incidence in 1995 (43 cases per 100,000), the ra te of newly diagnosed cases of pertussis in NS has declined dramatically (F igure 49). In 2005, 80% pe rcent of reported cases were in children 14 years of age and less and th e highest age-specific incidence was in children 0-4 and 10-14 years of age (Figure 50). The highe st age-standardized in cidence occurred in Capital District Health Au thority (DHA 9) (Figure 51).

Transm ission is through contact with nasopharyngeal secretions, direct contact with infected patient s and by droplet spread. An immunization program for measles, mumps a nd rubella (MMR) directed at infants was introduced in Canada in April 1983. The main goal of rubella im munization is the prevention of infection in pregnancy and thus, the preven tion of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).5,8 The incidence of rubella in Nova Scotia since 1996 has remained below one case per 100,000 population. No new cases were report ed between 2003 and 2005 (Figure 52). Figure 52: Incidence of R ubella, Nova Scotia, 1996-2005 00.10.20.30.40.5 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Notifiable Diseases in Nova Scotia Surveillance Report 2005 67 Tetanus Tetanus is an acute disease caused by an exotoxin produced by the tetanus bacillus, Clostridium tetani , that grows at the si te of injury in the absence of oxygen. Although it is worldwide in occurrence, it is sporadic and usually uncommon in industrialized countries. The disease is transmitted by spores produced by the bacillus that are introduced into the body commonly through a contaminated puncture wound (e.g., from so il, street dust, animal or human feces), lacerations, burns, seemingly mino r wounds or by injection of co ntaminated street drugs. Growth of the pathogen is favoured by necrotic tissue and/or foreign bodies.5 No cases of tetanus have been reported in Nova Sc otia since 1997 (Figure 53).

In the United States, Haemophilus influenzae b was one of the most common causes of bacterial meningitis but has been essentially eliminated following the introduction of Hi b vaccine. Other less common bacteria (staphylococci, enteric bacteria , group B streptococci and liste ria) may lead to bacterial meningitis in individuals with particular susceptibilities. 5 The incidence of bacterial meningitis (caused by other than N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae b) has remained cons istently low in Nova Scotia since 1996 at less than one case per 1 00,000 population (Figure 54).

Transmission is through direct contact with in fected material or through neonatal infection where the infection may be passed to the fetus in utero or during delivery through the birth canal. Outbreaks have been reported associated with consumption of raw or contaminated milk, soft cheeses, vegetables and p\u00e2t\u00e9. 5 The incidence of listeriosis in Nova Scotia ha s remained consistently low since 1997 at less than one case per 100,000 population (Figure 55).
