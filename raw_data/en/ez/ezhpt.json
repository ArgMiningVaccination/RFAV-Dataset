This will be effective from Sunday (June 12) at 12.01 EDT (9.31 pm IST). The requirement of showing proof of Covid vaccination for non-citizens who are nonimmigrants is still in effect, said [CDC](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/cdc) . It has recommended Covid vaccines, including boosters, for everyone aged five years and above. Both Covaxin and Covishield are among the vaccines listed for emergency use by WHO that are accepted by the US. \"Primary series\" completion will be when both doses of these vaccines have been taken, stated CDC, which, like India, does not recommend mixing of jabs. \"People vaccinated outside of the US who completed the primary series should receive all recommended boosters when eligible. People who received all recommended boosters with an accepted vaccine outside the United States are up to date with their Covid-19 vaccines,\" the CDC stated on its website. India now allows booster doses for most eligible people. As CDC rescinded the requirement for pre-departure Covid-19 tests, airlines began reflecting this change. Air Canada statement read: \"Starting June 12, customers no longer need to show proof of a pre-departure Covid-19 test result for air travel to the US from Canada. There are no other changes to requirements, including the requirement to be fully vaccinated.\" This long overdue relaxation by the US is expected to lead to a spurt in demand for travel that could further push up existing sky-high airfares as the rush of students to join varsities there this fall will soon begin. Despite huge demand, Air India will add nonstops when it inducts more aircraft. "}
