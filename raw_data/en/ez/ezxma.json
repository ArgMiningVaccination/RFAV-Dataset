As a result, many of these toxins accumulate in our bodies over time, causing health problems such as headaches, chronic pain, and digestive issues. Fortunately, chiropractic adjustments are a safe and effective way to eliminate toxins from your body while minimizing side effects. Chiropractic care is a non-invasive, natural, and effective treatment that offers numerous benefits. However, for those who are new to chiropractic treatment, there is sometimes an adjustment period that occurs after an appointment known as toxic release. Whether you are new to chiropractic care or on the fence about scheduling an appointment, this article will discuss some of the effects of chiropractic adjustments, what toxins are released, and what you can expect after receiving an adjustment. Continue reading below to learn more about how a chiropractic session can benefit your health and how Harlan Chiropractic can help you achieve long-term pain relief. What Toxins Are Released During a Chiropractic Adjustment? One of the various benefits of chiropractic adjustments is that they can help in the removal of toxins from your body through a variety of techniques. One method is through spinal manipulations, which help release toxins from the spine and nerve roots, where toxins tend to accumulate in the body over time. Toxins are substances that are either produced naturally by the body or are ingested from the various foods we consume. Toxins affect our bodies in different ways depending on their type and how much we've been exposed to them. Over time, toxin accumulation can cause headaches, fatigue, mood swings, muscle pain (including cramps or spasms), appetite changes, and weight gain. While toxic release can cause slight discomfort for some patients, it signals that your body is positively reacting to the chiropractic adjustment and returning your system to homeostasis. Although many patients do not feel symptoms of toxic release symptoms, if you do, they typically do not last long. Will I Experience Large Bowel Movements After a Chiropractic Adjustment? During a chiropractic adjustment, the position of your spine and large intestine, which is responsible for converting food into waste, can be altered. As a result, some chiropractic patients experience having large bowel movements after receiving a chiropractic adjustment. The large bowel is made up of muscles and nerves that are linked to your central nervous system. One of the consequences of a misaligned spine is a disruption in the function of these nerves and the messages your brain sends through them. Upon receiving a chiropractic adjustment, this connection is restored, oftentimes resulting in significant bowel movement. Although this might seem unsettling for many patients, this process is entirely normal.
