We collaborate with individuals and their prescribing providers to enhance their current treatment program. If you are searching for proven, same-day procedures that can help alleviate the symptoms of chronic depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder as well as other psychiatric conditions, ask your doctor to refer you for a consultation at UT Health San Antonio. Our specialists will schedule an evaluation to determine if your symptoms and unique medical history make you a good candidate for ECT (electroconvulsive treatment), esketamine treatment using Spravato\u00ae, or rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation). Our specialists use ECT to potentially activate brain cells, improve blood flow in the brain, and decrease neural inflammation. ECT has been used to effectively treat psychiatric symptoms for nearly 100 years. It is a safe, and highly effective treatment for severe, treatment-resistant depression. It can also treat symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. ECT is performed by our specialists while patients are comfortably asleep under general anesthesia in our outpatient procedure suite. During and after the procedure, they are closely monitored by their care team until they are ready to leave - which is usually within 2-3 hours after the procedure. Intranasal esketamine treatment using Spravato\u00ae treats depression by being inhaled through the nose. It targets specific receptors in the brain and may help balance chemical interactions to alleviate depression symptoms. Patients administer their own Spavato\u00ae treatment inside our office and are monitored for two hours following this administration for potential side effects until leaving. Since 2013, TMS has been FDA-approved for treating depression. Studies show that most people who use TMS get at least 50 percent better and 30 percent see their depression symptoms resolve. TMS is a non-invasive, safe procedure done in our office which uses magnetic impulses to painlessly activate important areas of your brain that are involved in regulating mood. "}
