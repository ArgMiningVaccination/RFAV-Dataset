Youssouf Mr. Jim Martell, Lead Engagement Partner KPMG introduced the inform ation item regarding the Fiscal Year 2012 Audit Plan. Mr. Ma rtell joined the meeting via teleconference along with Maria Tiso, the Client Share Partner. Mr. Martell then stated that he would go through the highlights of this year's audit plan. He said that this year they met with the Audit Chairwoman being Emily Youssouf to get her views and concerns. They also met with Chief Inte rnal Auditor Chris Telano, and also with Corporate Comptroller Jay Weinman and his grou p to get a flavor as to what's been on their radar screen and barometer in terms of audit issues. Mr. Martell stated that the audit plan is a plan, this is not something carved in stone, that it does take perhaps a turn here and there and if other things do occur whereby they need t o change the plan they will. They will let the committee know that there has been a change in the actual plan itself. Mr. Martell stated t hat Ms. Fremont and Ms. Murray will do the bulk of the presentation. Ms. Youssouf asked the KPMG team to introduce themselves: Camille Fremont, Senior Manager ; Erin Murray, Engagement Manager; Benny Hadnott, Partner, Watson and Rice LLP. Mr. Hadnott stated that he has worked with Jim Martell on audits for a number of years and that he has a staff that participates in aspects of the audit, es pecially in the inventory accounts and they also come back and review audits and work on various areas, including assets, w hatever Ms. Fremont asks them to do. He is very pleased to be with the team and he feels that he and his staff have been treated very well during the period they have been engaged with KPMG. Ms. Fremont began her presentation by directing the committee to slide 2 where they have laid out the engagement team which con sists of KPMG, minority business and women business enterprises firms. Ms. Fremont then directed them to slide 3 where they have laid o ut the deliverables that they issue in addition to the Corporation's financial statement audits. They also include various cost repor ts as well as the bond covenant compliance letter. They issue standalone audited financ ial statements for both of the insurance companies which have a December 31 st year end as opposed to the Corporation's June 30th and they will issue a management letter at the end of the audit. Ms. Fremont directed them to slide 5 where they laid out the responsibilities for the audit as it pertains to management, KPMG and the Audit Committee. She stated the Audit Committee's role is one of oversight and monitoring. Management's responsibilities include es tablishing and maintaining effective internal control as well as preparing the financial statements in conformity with general accepted ac counting principles. KPMG's role is to express an opinion about whether the financial statements are presented fairly in all material r espects in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles and that KPMG has a requirement to communicate all required inform ation to both management and Audit Committee throughout the audit. Ms. Fremont continued on slide 6 where they laid out the financia l statement audit timetable and as Mr. Martell indicated, they have met with various members of management in coming up with this timetable. For the first time in January and February they actually did s ome interim site visits to test internal controls throughout the year and then in April through June they've been holding various planning meetings. They reviewed the December 31st internal financial statements and are here to present t he audit plan. Continuing into June and July, they will test the operating effectiveness of controls through additional site visits. They will also review the third parties as of Mar ch 31st and patient accounts receivable valuation process where t hey will utilize their computer assisted auditing tool to help them. Then in Augu st and September they will start the final phase of the audit. Then they will be attending the Audit Committee meeting and reviewing the draft financial statement along with a draft management letter and performi ng all the required communications. Then they will once a gain be back in November to present the final management letter. Ms. Fremont stated that the due date of the financial statements has b een accelerated by two weeks by the City to September 14th which will necessitate the audit moving up two weeks. Mr. Martell stated that by pushing up the delivery date to the Ci ty by two weeks creates some additional work from management t o supply them with the required work papers and the detailed financial statem ents in order to meet the deadline. Mr. Martell also stated that the New York City Audit Committee is looking to push up the presentation from NYCHHC to an earlier month. Ms. Marlene Zurack, Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Office r stated that this has nothing to do with HHC; the City Audit Committee actually scheduled HHC for April and then was pus hed to May. Ms. Zurack said that she offe red to come in in December as soon a s the Corporation had completed the national letter of review with this committee. She does not think this is a problem. Ms. Youssouf asked KPMG to discuss the surprise visits that we re discussed last year. Ms. Fremont responded that that was the interim site visits that they did in February. Those were surprise visits where two facilities were picked, they went out and looked t o see if things such as cash disbursement controls were operating appropriately and some controls regarding accounts receivable - through that process they did not have any findings at that point in time so they were operating the way they would expect them to. Mr. Martell add ed that they were surprised they were not told at all that KPMG was coming. KPMG showed up on the doorstep on Monday telling them they were ii looking at such and such and gave those samples and they provi ded the information. It does appear that the facilities have the process under control as it relates to procedures that are documented. Ms. Youssouf stated that she was pleased to hear that. Ms. Fremont continued with slide 7 where they have laid out what they consider some of the critical audit areas which include t he valuation of third-party payers, receivables and liabilities. Also laid out are some significant areas of the audit which include the po st-employment benefit obligations other than pension for the OPEB liability. They also looked at non routine transactions throughout the aud it; there are no new accounting pronouncements for the current year. HHC entered into a transaction with North General that management is curre ntly working through the accounting treatment for and the presentation with the financial statements. Management is also reviewing the Physician Affiliate Group of New York (PAGNY) agreement that was entered into to determine whether or not consolidation will be necessary within the Corporation's financial statements. Ms. Youssouf asked that if it wouldn't normally be. Mr. Martell responded by stating that typically when you don't have owners hip it's not, but under the accounting rules for variable interest entities it goes into a little more detail as it relates to control and so forth. There's some additional literature that will be required. Ms. Youssouf stated that she did not think they controlled it but she's sure Finance will be able to sort it out with KPMG. Continuing with her presentation Ms. Fremont stated that they al so reviewed the information technology environment; they looked at such things as access controls and used their internal specialist to look over control over change management within the system. Ms. Fremont continued with slide 8 where they laid out what they call their key map by audit area. This shows the risk that KP MG goes through during the audit by the level of risk. The highest ones are red and it shows how management, KPMG and Internal Audit w ork together in order to address the risks for the audit. Ms. Youssouf asked to briefly explain timing cut off. Ms. Fremont stated that what that pertains to is to make sure revenue is recognized in the proper period. In terms of the accounts receivable and thir d-party payers and liabilities, to make sure it's being recogni zed in the proper period and what expenses were incurred in all. Dr. Michael Stocker, Board Chairman asked if this refers to end of year. Mr. Fremont responded that this would be June 30 th. Ms. Youssouf asked that if in fact there was another area t he board thought should be moved up, they would just have a discussi on with management and KPMG. Ms. Fremont responded correct. Ms. Zurack stated that in terms of this HHC is on a very aggressive timetable due to the weeks early for the City. She's asking KPMG to let her know what would be the last date HHC can reshuffle the prio rities. Mr. Martell responded that KPMG has revised the calenda r and they will share with HHC in terms of timing. Basically KPMG will star t doing a lot of the third-party work now in the month of June , but July and August is going to be a lot more work. KPMG used to come in late July, now it will be in early July, but he expects draft fina ncial statements by August 13 th. Ms. Zurack asked if the board wanted to escalate or elevate one of the green items or blue items, when KPMG would need to know so that KPMG does not go out and start the audit with the plan they have and have to do rework given the timetable. Mr. Martell responded that most of the stuff whether it's green and there is a concern at the board level, KPMG would just be adding additional work. The most time they would ask is a week's notice to revamp the audit approach. Ms. Zurack asked that if it's a week from today or a week before the end of the audit. To which Mr. Martell responded that pro bably a week before they actually start their interim test work, their year-end test work, which would be in July. If they go in July 9 th they would have to know by the end of June. Dr. Boufford asked whether construction management might be mov ed up into the red zone that there may be certain vulnerable pro jects than others that could be targeted. Ms. Zurack stated that she thinks KPMG should define what they mean by construction manage ment. Ms. Fremont stated that there are significant construction proj ects that are ongoing in the Corporation and KPMG will look at c onstructions in progress. They will look to make sure HHC is following proper procedure -- that it's signed off by the appropriate people a nd categorized in the right bucket; for example, tools and equipment and buildings and improvement. For KPMG, construction projects are somewhat routine. It is something that is purchased and continued to build, so it is elevated to a red in terms of the audit. Ms. Zurack stated it is looked at how the dollars are spent and being recorded in the books, and whether or not the projects ar e managed well within the budget. iii Mr. Martell stated that that it's correct. That they are not looking at the operational aspects of the project, they're lookin g at the change orders, making sure they're appr oved appropriately, the cash disbursements are approved appropriately, the bid process was comp leted appropriately, how the construction in pr ogress being recorded, is there capitalized interest associated with it. Ms. Youssouf asked if KPMG has an internal team who could look at construction projects. Mr. Martell responded absolutely. Ms. Youssouf stated that that is something the Audit Committee me mbers would like to discuss with KPMG and that she had a brief discussion with Ms. Zurack about this. Ms. Zurack stated that they're talking about a separate engagement on the consulting si de. Dr. Stocker asked if KPMG is actually looking at the management of the building, how to go through the process of construction. To which Mr. Martell responded absolutely, that he knows exactly what Dr. Stocker is talking about. Dr. Stocker asked if KPMG does that. Mr. Martell responded yes t hey do that. They have a huge advisory practice in the real e state practice that does all that. Ms. Youssouf stated that the committee will be discussing this with Ms. Zurack and will get back to them on that. Ms. Fremont continued her presentation with slide 9 where they laid out for the committee how they utilize both the minority bu siness enterprise, the women business enterprise and a member of the corporation's Internal Audit staff. Ms. Fremont turned to slide 10 through 12 where they talked ab out some of their responsibilities throughout the audit as it per tains to fraud. They have a responsibility to conduct the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and plan to perform th e audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether caused by fraud o r error. In order to do that, KPMG will identify certain progress that the Co rporation is subject to and then will identify or respond. So me of those include testing the effectiveness of controls, making sure risk of management override of controls is minimal or not there. Th ey will also look at and address revenue recognition back to the point of cutoff in the appropriate period. Then another key component to the fr aud approach are the SAS 99 fraud interviews illustrated on slide 12. Ms. Youssouf asked if the fraud risk states anywhere if the Corporation is spending large capital dollars. Ms. Fremont respond ed that the spending of money is not necessarily a fraud risk. It's about the Corporation not following the procedures and protocols. Tho se large spends would be caught in the cash disbursement. Ms. Youssouf stated that the board has recently approved a number of capital spends and just wants to make sure that they are r eviewed. To wish Ms. Fremont responded that there will be awareness with that throughout the audit. Ms. Fremont continued by stating that on slide 12 there are the individuals within the Corporation that they plan to schedule S AS Fraud 99 interviews with. They include Madam Chairwoman, the Chairman of the Board Dr. Stocker, Marlene Zurack, Wayne McNulty, Chief In ternal Auditor Chris Telano and others as they go through the process as well. Ms. Fremont then stated that another thing that they have to consider throughout the audit on slide 13 is liquidity. That come s to KPMG through the Statement of Auditing Standards 59. The auditor has a responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doub t about the entity's ability to continue as a growing concern for a reasonable per iod of time. They have to look at certain key indicators , for instance the December 31, 2011 internal financial statements. Laid out are the five indicators that were looked at. The Corporation has a net asset deficiency and a loss from operation, as a result of that KPMG will perform certain audit procedures laid out on slide 14. KPM G will look at the 2013 budget and cash flow projections. KPMG will read the board and finance committee's meetings minutes, reports that have been issued if there are any restructuring repor ts then they will also look at the 2012 budget and compare that to the actual report s. Ms. Youssouf asked what they meant by restructuring reports. Ms. Fremont responded that about one or two years ago the Corpora tion had a restructuring. Ms. Zurack added that Ms. Fremont is referri ng to the Road Ahead or any kind of cost containment or futur e plan to create savings or increase revenue. Ms. Fremont continued and stat ed that they will also look at t he working capital, days in account payable and the continued sup port from the City of New York which is an integral component for the preparation. Ms. Zurack stated that she wants to make sure the committee is r eally clear on what's going here. On certain indicators relate d to the loss from operation and the net asset deficiency that would raise concern. She presents to this board and its various committees wh ere the Corporation is currently as it relates to the current net asset deficiency and loss from operations. In HHC's favor, HHC tends to have decent cash and decent liquidity relative to HHC's peers in the health ca re industry in New York. But because of the loss from operat ions and the trend of the loss from operations, which is going up not down, ther e is this sort of secondary review that is being done. They are confirming that in fact HHC is taking action. iv Committee member, Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford asked that how do thos e two categories relate to the issue of the uninsured and underins ured. How do you take into account that certain people would not be able to pay. Ms. Zurack asked if Dr. Boufford meant if they're c omparing HHC to others. Dr. Boufford stated that if you look at the i ssue of net asset deficiency, lo ss from operation and you are seei ng X number of patients, you play out the scenario, and you are collecting X mi nus whatever funding because of the nature of the patients. Th at's a characteristic of this kind built into the organization that ought to be flagged in a way other than from operations. Mr. Martell stated that Ms. Zurack statement is correct. The realit y is as they look at liquidity they look at the reasons why . The real question is how management is going to stay cash positive. The pur pose of their report is to state to the readers of the repor t that you will be here next year. It does not go into the reasons why you won't be or the reasons why you will be. It goes into the reasons whether or not KPMG believes HHC has the financial strength to be in existence 367 days from the date of the year end. Ms. Youssouf asked if they review management in respect of the people who are running various areas are competent and qualified . Mr. Martell responded that they review management's assumption as it relates to the financial reporting. They evaluate based on job function and obviously if it has an impact on the reporting they would inform the committee. Ms. Fremont stated that KPMG has to get comfortable with the process that management goes through to come up the budget and als o what the actual results will be. That's why a key component is looking at the 2012 budget and how it performed against that budget, which gives KPMG comfort that the appropriate assumptions are being utili zed. So as KPMG goes through the third-party reviews as well as looked at what are the changing regulations, those reimbursement-t ype issues are caught up in the third-party receivables and l iabilities. Ms. Fremont continued to slide 15 where they point out the tw o new government accounting standards pronouncements that will be effective for the Corporation for fiscal year 2013. The firs t one is the codification of accounting and financial reporting gu idance. This is basically what all the other not-for-profit organizations went through when the FASB codified all their accounting pronouncements. This will bring in all the authoritative literature in one spot in GASB so that HHC does not have to decide on adopting it or not; it will be all in one place. There is no change on how the corporatio n currently applies their accounting pronouncements. Mr. Martell added that these two items don't affect 2012; they're there for information purpose only. This will be discussed n ext year in the planning budget. Ms. Youssouf asked that although GASB 63 does not take effect until 2013 that she thought it had to be reported this year. Mr. Martell responded that he was not aware of it, but he will do some research and get back to her. Ms. Zurack stated that her understanding was all we had to change was some of the wording on the presentation of the income sta tement. Her understanding is that GASB 62 did not affect the corporation at all. She asked Mr. Martell to confirm that. Mr. Martell r esponded that they will see if there are any changes. Mr. Frement continued to slide 16 and 17 stating that these ar e included for information purposes and slide 18 lists the resour ces that are available to the Corporation. Mr. Martell stated those are the details of the plan. As stated earlier they moved everything up two weeks so they will be vis iting HHC earlier than normal. He envisions KPMG presenting to this committee somewhere in mid-September so that the New York City time frame can be met. Dr. Boufford asked who management in this audit is, is there a mechanism for facilities engagement in sort of designing in the engagement of the auditors. KPMG mentioned that they do spot visits una nnounced at facilities, but is there a kind of advisory group or g roup of executive directors involved or some group other than Central Of fice? Ms. Zurack responded that this is just an overview; this is a financial statement audit and that maybe at some other Audit Committee meet ing we can present a flow chart and how the financial statemen ts are prepared. The actual preparing of estima tes and putting together financial statements ar e done exclusively by Central Office. However, they are done by data and transactions that are recorded at the hospital and diagnostic treatment centers and the nursing homes . That's why ther e is this field testing; the data being used is coming from the system. Mr. Martell added that Ms. Zurack is correct, that what they c onsider the senior management team are the people at Central Office. The people out in the field at the facilities are there to assist us with reviewing the data which Central Office utilizes to come up with the estimates and the financial statement presentation. Ms. Youssouf asked if there were any questions for the KPMG team and asked Mr. Martell if he had anything else to say. Mr. Mar tell responded no, he apologized he could not be present in person. v Ms. Youssouf asked Ms. Fremont if she had anything to say. She responded no, thanked the committee for the opportunity to be p resent again. Mrs. Bolus thanked them for being present. Ms. Youssouf moved onto the next information item: Chris Telano's internal audit update. Mr. Telano saluted everyone and thanked Ms. Youssouf. Mr. Telano stated that today he had five reports to discuss. Regarding the first review, at the request of the Audit Committee, internal audit performs follow-up audits of reviews done by external agencies. This review was done at Sea View Hospital by the Social Security Administrati on; this was of the Representative Payee Program. This is sim ply bank accounts that are opened for the residents in which the Corporation controls as it was determined that the residents are not co mpetent to handle their funds. Social Security found three issues - one rela tes to the funds being given to the proper parties when a res ident expires, two is about the titling of the bank accounts and three relates to the receipts of expenses when petty cash is given to the res ident to spend. Our review found that overall the same issues exist. Sea View continues to release the conserve funds to the family of the ben eficiary or uses it to pay for the funeral. They believe that they are following Medicaid and a lower court ruling that is in contradictio n with Social Security guidelines and Sea View management has been in touch with So cial Security to resolve this issue. The accounts of the residents also were not titled properly, especially those who received physical checks; Sea View is working to correct that. Receipts for expenses incurred by the residents are not documented by proper support. Mr. Telano asked if the committee wants the Sea View representativ es to come up to the table. Ms. Youssouf responded by asking the other members of the committee if they had any questions about this particular audit. Dr. Boufford responded by suggesting that it would be useful to know who the responsible person is and what the timetable is fo r corrective action in the report. In some instances the report says managem ent will, in others it says the facilities will but it doesn't really say who's doing it and by when. She thinks it would be useful as an Audi t Committee to record that a high level person or an executive i s involved. Ms. Youssouf thought that Dr. Boufford suggestion was a good one. Mr. Telano continued by stating that the second audit performed was about patient revenue at Queens Hospital. Basically we fou nd that there are no written procedures in the cashier's office and outpat ient billing department pertaini ng to the time frame self-pay cash payments are posted. This issue will be resolved in a short period of ti me; perhaps three to six months because of the implementation o f auto posting within the cashier's area. The second finding has to do with patients that are denied insuranc e, usually Medicaid, and they ar e referred to as self-pay. The system has a glitch in it which it does not send billings out to them; as a result, the facility does not alw ays collect the monies. We found that the facility does not have a work around the system. Ms. Youssouf asked for the representatives from Queens Hospital to come up to the table and introduce themselves. They introdu ced themselves as follows: Mr. Lekram Singh, Store Manager; Mr. Brian Stacey, Queens Network Chief Financial Officer; Ms. Nancy Mo scoso, Operations Assistant Director and Mr. Robe rt Malone, Deputy Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Telano continued by stating that the last issue is suppos ed to be resolved in April 2013 via the upgrading of the Siemens' financial system. Both of these issues that I'm discussing will be resolved as a result of systematic issues. Ms. Youssouf asked if there is any way to do anything about this prior to April 2013 - it seems rather far away. Mr. Stacey stated that the cash posting issue being addressed is al ready in terms of tightening up that time frame. As Mr. Tel ano said, there were a number over 30 days, which actually has been tight ened up already. We have implemented some things from when cash is received to cash control to then actually post payment. We already started implementing that approach. Mr. Telano stated that on the other issue, they did request a report for self-paid write-offs. Ms . Moscoso stated that she has audited March and April, did a samp le of the patients and she has audited it to make sure all those patients are recorded. Dr. Stocker asked if they are being billed. To which Ms. Moscoso responded yes. Dr. Stocker asked to give him some idea of th e size of that when they went back two months. Mr. Stacey answered by stating that is probably seven hundred. Dr . Stocker asked if it was per month and Mr. Stacey said yes. Dr. Stocker asked what kind of revenue he would expect to get out of it. Mr. Stacey said that on the self-pay side not very mu ch. Most of the self-pay patients wind up in the fee scale because they ar e not Medicaid eligible; if it's self-pay they pay $15. Ms. Youssouf asked that out of the few hundreds, are they all self-paying. Mr. Malone responded by stating that in this findin g yes. The finding related to self-pay operation, which represent s about two percent of our total outpatient payments. vi Ms. Youssouf stated that the corporate bad debt policy is 100 perc ent self-pay that that was her question. Mr. Malone responded no. Ms. Youssouf asked that since they are doing something manually prior to getting the system up, how much revenue you anticipate getting out of those few hundred a month. Mr. Malone answered by saying that on the self-pay population probably will get some patient s that could come in on the fee scale, do fee scale application and will enable them to become part of our fee scale population. So t hat will secure the future visits that they pay the $15 a month or whatever amount. Dr. Stocker asked that across the Corporation what do you raise on self-pay. Ms. Zurack responded that the entire self-pay collections, all services, are approximately $40 million a year. However, approximately $10 million of that is in the nursing homes for the net - their share of the social security check. Then she said she would say o ff the top of her head $13 million which is sort of in the category and the rest is on the inpatient side. This is for patients that came in and were not identified as self-pay initially which you have to go ma nually change the classification and there was a delay in changing the financial cla ssifications on these patients. It's not the majority of sel f-pay patients just the ones that came in and they were not identified as self-pay. They might have been identified as something else, Medicaid sa y for example, erroneously, and after some investigation they find out they're self-pay going in and change each account. That's the standard work of the hospitals. Ms. Moscoso added that it's not that they're behind, in some inst ances they were unaware that the patient came in Medicaid, was pending or something like that. Sometimes it was retroactively enrolled, in that instance once the Medicaid was put in the system with an effective date; the visits prior to the effective date will go to the self -pay side. In those instances, it's not all the time, there's a current statement balanced generated. Ms. Youssouf asked if the bad debt number was on a monthly basis or on average. Mr. Stacey said that he did not know off hand. Ms. Zurack added that she will translate what Mr. Malone was saying. If we were to look in the accounting system they would go at full charges, but the truth is 99 percent of t hese patients are eligible to be in the HHC option programs. Whereas, the patient has $400 in charges, once all the paperwork is done the real bad debt number is going to be $15. So the answer to what is in the bad debt file is going to be the number of charges. Dr. Stocker asked that if this was done across all the facilities what it would be. Ms. Zurack asked if he meant the sum of th e bad debts. Mr. Stocker said just what we would find, same practices, and different practices. Ms. Zurack stated that she did not know and Mr. Telano stated that he had not done anything. Ms. Zurack stated that whether or not they're not changing the financial class that she would have to get back to him. Ms. Youssouf stated that it's probably something that we need to try to find out and have a best practice. Ms. Zurack stated that Maxine Katz could not come to this meet ing and she's the expert on all this practice. Ms. Zurack said t hat she will make sure that she does her due diligence and get back to the committee. Ms. Youssouf said thank you and asked if there were more questions for Queens. Mr. Telano stated that he will skip around since the Queens people are on the table. He will discuss the surprise count at the warehouse. He started off by saying that Mr. Singh and his staff should be commended for the controls that they have at the warehouse. We did a surprise count, we counted 90 items and 88 were correct and the total difference was approximately $140. Ms. Youssouf said that was great. Mr. Telano said that he just wanted to point out what an excellent job Mr. Singh and his staff did. Dr. Stocker stated that they looked at a number of these items and he thinks they are the corporate champions. Mr. Telano continued by stating that there are just two small issues, the lack of securi ty cameras and also access to the syste m. There are a couple of individuals that should not have full access to the system. Ms. Youssouf asked if those two items have been corrected. Mr. Singh responded that the cameras are in the process of bei ng installed and the two individuals came off the system. Mr. Telano continued with the audit at Kings County - this was the start of the affiliation audits. The first one was Kings Co unty Downstate. vii Ms. Youssouf asked the representatives to come up to the table and introduce themselves. They introduced themselves as follows : Leo Johnson, Affiliate Administrator, Julian John, Chief Financial Offi cer, Ross Clinchy, Associate Dean for Administration at SUNY and Anthony Saul, Controller. Mr. Telano stated that during our test work we wanted to confirm the accuracy of salaries by trac ing this information to docume ntation. We found 9 out 31 in which we could not do that. Personnel forms, wh ich indicate this information, were not current indicating th e salaries that were on the books. In addition, we feel that the individual who is responsible for the payroll record keeping task is the only person that has intimate knowledge of the process and since the process is not written in a policy and procedure manual, we recommended that they create a manual in lieu of hiring a backup. Ms. Youssouf asked that someone from the facility discuss the i ssue and is a manual in the process of being created and what ar e you doing in between. Mr. Johnson said that on the issue of the forms being outdated, the way the SUNY system is set up is when an employee is hired there's a form and if there's no transaction, which could be a year or ten years, there's no automatic update. The in dividual's salary would change over the years based on Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) or discretionary. We have 3,000 employees and we don't h ave the resources every time we use COLA to actually put in paperwo rk to increase salaries like that. We do have salary history th at we just started recently and we insured the audit team that would make pay ment accordingly. In the future that would be part of the do cuments that will be presented. Even if they had a form, say 10 years ago, it would be a lot easier to trace salaries today. Ms. Youssouf asked if it's not automated at all and if they have this on a computer system. Mr. Johnson said that they just re cently started. Mr. Saul added that this was through the state payroll system. W hen there's a cost of living increase through the collective b argaining agreement, it is applied by the Office of the Comptroller to ever ybody's paychecks across the system. We don't process pieces of paper on the campus to get those COLAs and so what we are saying is if we equate someone to say $50,000 a year nothing else happens to t hem except COLAs the salary history that's in the computer will show the changes year by year reflecting the collective bargaining agreement. There won't be a piece of paper changing that salary unless there's some other kind of transaction, changing FTE, in which case there will be a piece of paper processed reflecting that change. Ms. Youssouf asked if our internal auditors have the ability to look at the system. Mr. Johnson responded yes, and just to add one thing. Out of fairness to Chris Telano and his team, some of our forms do have cross outs used by different areas. Sometimes the numb ers will change and that is something we have gone out our way to correct. In the future, the form should be pretty clear. We are tryi ng to eliminate cross outs. Mr. Saul added that they have several PDFs instead so they are easier, but the transactions are all in the records in the payro ll system in the State Comptroller's Office. Mrs. Bolus asked if there was a backup should the system ever go down. To which Mr. Saul responded that the State Comptroller does. We don't manage the system on the campus; this is a state-wide system management. Ms. Youssouf asked what about the policy and procedural manual that was mentioned. Mr. Johnson said that they were in the proc ess and they agree with Chris' findings. They ar e going to write a policy and procedure manual. Ms. Youssouf thanked them and directed Mr. Telano to discuss the next audit which is Coler-Goldwater. Mr. Telano stated that in light of the follow-up audit done at Sea View regarding the records of the Payee Representative Progr am, we decided to roll that audit out at the skilled nursing facilities and we started with Coler. We just completed our audits of Mc Kinney and Gouverneur. This is the result of the audit from Coler. Ms. Youssouf asked for the representatives of Coler to come up to the table and introduce themselves. They introduced themselv es as follows: Mercia Franklin, Chief Contracting O ffice; Gloria Ranghelli, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Telano stated that basically we came up with the same issues that came up at Sea View. The bank accounts with titles not i n adherence to Social Security requirements. The conserve funds were not being sent back to Social Security when the residents a re being sent over to Goldwater. The only unique finding was regardi ng the bank account s. We found a $1,200 unresolved deposit that ex isted and a levy of $4,000 that the IRS applied, but the beneficiary had died and the account was closed but the money was given out of a primary account so the IRS owes us money. Ms. Franklin said that they actually did not give them the money ; they automatically took it not realizing that the account was not just for that one resident that it was a group account so we are trying to get it back. Ms. Youssouf stated that seems to be a problem at the nursing hom es in general and asked Chris Telano if there's a way to make it easier. Mr. Telano said that they wanted to do the review first, comp lete the reviews at McKinney and Gouverneur and come up with best practices. viii He thinks that we have a lot of similar issues, when we're done with those audits we'll present a document indicating what shou ld be done. One thing noteworthy is that Coler-Goldwater and Gouverneur and McKinney all have their bank accounts with Amalgamated. He thi nks we should have some leverage with them because he understands there will be some push back in the title of some of these accounts. He's not sure we used that leverage in the past but now that everyone knows it. Ms. Youssouf asked Ms. Zurack to respond to that. Ms. Zurack stated that we opened those accounts in Amalgamated as part of a program with the City Department of Finance because it's the only bank that has a branch on Roosevelt Island. So the City was asking t o shore up that branch, otherwise there might have been no branch on Roosevelt Island and this was done a couple of years ago. Ms. Youssouf asked if it's possible for Ms. Zurack to make a call. Ms. Zurack said yes that she would call. Mr. Telano continued on with the briefing - the audits in progress. A quick summary of the New York City Office of the Comptro ller overtime report that finally was issued in final on May 7th and on page 10 is a list of the follow-up audits and their progress. Dr. Boufford asked if there were any title patterns on their ov ertime usage that could be subject to managerial issues. Mr. Telano responded that there did not seem to be in their review, and stated that that concludes his presentation. Ms. Youssouf thanked Mr. Telano and directed Mr. McNulty to begin the Compliance Update. Mr. McNulty saluted everybody and began his presentation by discu ssing compliance training. He noted that the Audit Committee (\"Committee\") was previously informed that, with regard to compliance training of HHC staff, the Office of Corporate Compliance (\"OCC\") was moving from the use of an outside vendor to an internally developed computer-based training program. He informed the Commi ttee that at the present time all physicians, nurses and group 11 employees, as well as individuals designated by group 11 employees , receive compliance training. He further informed the Committee that th e OCC was going to expand training to include all health profess ionals licensed under the Department of Education, as well as any individual who documents in the medical record and such documentatio n is used to support a claim submitted to Medicaid, Medicare or to a private payor. He told the Committee that the OCC developed a computer- based training (\"CBT\") module for physicians, noting that the modul e was in its final draft stage. He commented that the physi cian CBT module was disseminated to the members of the Executive Comp liance Work Group (\"ECW\") as well as the members of the ECW Subcommittee on Compliance and Quality (\"ECW Subcommittee\"). Mr . McNulty stated that he anticipated this module would go live at some point in the following week. He added that the OCC looked forward to getting responses back from the ECW and the ECW Subcommittee, stressing that changes to the module would be made as necessary. He described the physicians' module by noting t hat it was about an hour long. He continued by discussing the content of the module, noting that it covered fraud and abuse, child ab use reporting, and professional responsibility. He informed the Commi ttee that moving forward, training modules for the Board of D irectors, health professionals and nurses, and for HHC managers, would be developed. Ms. Youssouf asked how often everyone will be required to go through this training online. Mr. McNulty answered by stating tha t training was an annual requirement. He added that all new empl oyees would also be required to undergo training. Mr. McNulty continued with item number two of the compliance r eport agenda, the Corporate Compliance Work Plan. He stated that the OCC had initiated the assessment cycle review of each calendar year (\"CY\") 2011 Corporate Complianc e Work Plan item. He explai ned that corresponding risk assessment and audit tools were completed and sent out to the subject matter and process experts. He e xpected to have the results back by June 20 th. Mr. McNulty stated that the corresponding results would be reviewed and vulnerabilities and risks would be identified. He further stated that based on said results, t he OCC would then determine whether or not an item would move to the mitigation stage, where a plan of correction would then be developed. Mr. McNulty provided that if a determination is made tha t an item poses either a low risk or no risk, said item would subsequently be closed and removed from the work plan. Mr. McNulty asked the Committee if there were any questi ons with regard to OCC's review and assessment cycle. Ms. Youssouf responded no, but she asked if Mr. McNulty if he would report back to the Committee on the final risk determinatio n with regard to each item. Mr. McNulty replied that he would report back to the Committee as to the status of each item, including t he details of any implemented mitigation plan. Mr. McNulty continued on with the next item. He stated that each year the Federal Office of th e Inspector General (\"OIG\") issues a work plan. He continued by stating that the OCC reviewed and assessed the OIG's fiscal year (\"FY\") 2012 Work Plan. He commented th at OIG's FY 2012 Work Plan could basically be divided into seven (7) main categories. He explained that the OCC particularly focused on the Medicare Part A and Part B category, noting that this category was applicable to HHC. He added that the remaining six (6) cate gories in OIG's FY 2012 Work Plan were not directly related to HHC's oper ations. He further added that the OCC initiated an assessment o f the Medicare Part A and B category of OIG's Work Plan and subsequent ly developed questions sets, which were disseminated to the rel evant process and expert owners. He anticipated responses to these ques tion sets by the end of June. He stated that, based on the ix vulnerabilities and risks present with each item, the OCC would determine the scope of the HHC calendar year 2012 work plan. H e added that the final assessment findings would be reported to the Committee in September. Mr. McNulty continued with page five. He started by stating that the Office of the Medicaid Ins pector General (\"OMIG\") released their fiscal year 2012 and 2013 work plan in May. He informed the Committee that the OCC was going to initiate an assessment of that work p lan similar to the assessment currently under implementation for the OI G Work Plan. He stated that the OCC would report back to the Committee in September with an update up this matter. Mr. McNulty continued with by discussing the OCC's staffing stat us. He announced that effective June 25, 2012 the OCC would be fully staffed. He informed the Committee that the vacant position in the South Brooklyn/Staten Island Health Care Network was filled , noting that the successful candidate was MetroPlus' current Chief Compliance O fficer. He also informed the Committee that the OCC received staff training in May at the Health Care Compliance Association's r egional annual conference in New York City. He told the Committee that the conference focused on compliance topics such as data mining, OMIG activities and their areas of focus, internal investigations, and anti- kickback and Stark Law. Mr. McNulty explained that training and education were essential to OCC staff, commenting that the OCC would explore other training opportunities. He fu rther explained that information obtained by OCC staff during training would be sha red with the ECW and the facility compliance committees. Mr. McNulty continued to item number 7 - the development of dat a mining compliance activities. He informed the Committee that, as part of the OCC's strategic plan, it was investigating data mining tools and activities to identify areas of noncompliance and corporat e vulnerability. He explained to the Committee that a large portion of HHC's current work plan was assembled by looking at OIG's Work Plan and O MIG's Work Plan. Mr. McNulty stressed that the OCC wanted to be more proactive by looking at HHC's financial system. He told the Co mmittee that he had discussed data mining with Chief Financial Officer Marlene Zurack. He stated that Ms. Zurack recommended that the OCC staff undergo GPS training, which is Siemen's data warehouse. He inform ed the Committee that said training was scheduled to take pla ce in July. He further commented that the use of this available info rmation could be used to look at certain outliers and determine if HHC has risks and vulnerabilities. Mr. McNulty continued to item number 8 on the compliance report agenda by informing the Committee that May 7 through May 12 was Corporate Compliance Week. He stated that this year's theme wa s \"Think Compliance First.\" He informed the Committee that HHC president and Chief Executive Mr. Aviles sent out an informati onal email to the entire HHC work force encouraging workforce memb ers to report potential compliance issues and stressing HHC's prohibition of retaliation with regard to whistleblowers. He further in formed the Committee that the OCC set up tables at HHC's various facilities and encouraged HHC staff members to report compliance issues t hrough the OCC's confidential hotline. He told the Committee that HHC st aff members were informed that HHC fully protects whistleblow ers. Mr. McNulty continued on with the last item, which was the Monitoring of Excluded Providers. He stated that there were no self -disclosures to report since the last time the Committee convened in April. He reminded the Committee that it was informed back in February about the OCC's discovery of a staff nurse at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center who was on the O MIG list of excluded individuals. He commented that the subject nurse was placed on OMIG's exclu ded list in early February and was discovered by HHC towards the end of February. He stated that the nurse was separated from services two days later after discovery. He reported that the governmen t was made aware of the discovery and that the issue was resolved. Mr. McNulty explained that although HHC will not have to return any fu nds back to the Government, HHC will have to adjust its cost report. Ms. Youssouf thanked Mr. McNulty. Mr. McNulty stated that that was the end of his report. Ms. Youssouf then indicated that the Committee was going into Executive Session. (Executive session was then held). After returning to public session Ms. Youssouf asked for a mo tion to approve the Internal Audits Plan. It was seconded and app roved. Capital Committee - June 7, 2012 As reported by Ms. Emily A. Youssouf Alfonso Pistone, Assistant Vice President, Office of Facilitie s Development, informed the Committee that there would be five (5 ) action items on the agenda; including, a resolution to rename the Department of Dentistry at Harlem Hospital Center, a license agreement wit h the New York Legal Assistance Group for services to be provided at Coler-Goldwater, a license agreement with the Department of Educati on for space on the Goldwater campus to operate a Licensed Practical Nu rse Program, a license agreement with GVS/Cohen Fashion Optical for space to operate an optical shop at Jacobi Medical Center (J acobi), and a request for approval on a change order to complete work at Jacobi. Mr. Pistone noted that in addition to these action items would be tw o information items; a status report on the major moderniza tion at Gouveneur Healthcare Services, and a delay report regarding the Emergency Room Renovati on project at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center. x This concluded his report. Action Items Authorizing the President of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (the \"Corporation\") to rename the Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery at Harlem Hospital Center (the \"facility\") the \"D r. James E. McIntosh Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery . Denise Soares, Executive Director, Harlem Hospital Center, r ead the resolution into the record on behalf of Iris Jimenez-Hernan dez, Senior Vice President, Generations+/Northern Manhattan Health Network. Ms. Soares was joined by James King, MD, and Sylvia White, Chi ef of Staff, Harlem Hospital Center. Dr. King advised that Dr. McIntosh served the Corporation for forty (40) years, beginning in 1969 at Sydenham Hospital. Mr. McI ntosh then went on to become the Director of Dentistry at Sydenham and then se rved for two (2) terms as Medical Board President at the fac ility, including during the time that the Sydenham facility was closed, which he worked tirelessly to prevent. Mr. McIntosh helped est ablish the Renaissance Healthcare Network before moving to Harlem Hospit al Center, where he helped bring dent istry services to a departmen tal level. Under Dr. McIntosh's supervision, the Department of Dentistry increased visits from 6,000 to 27,000 annually. Dr. McInto sh created the Minority Specialty Program where over 30 African Americans were trained in dental sp ecialties to provide services in unders erved communities. Ms. Youssouf thanked Dr. King for his impressive presentation and expressed pleasure in moving the item forward. There being no questions or comments, the Committee Chair offered the matter for a Committee vote. On motion by the Chair, the Committee approved the resolution for the full Board's consideration. Authorizing the President of the New York City Health and Hospit als Corporation (the \"Corporation\" or \"Licensor\") to execute a license agreement with the New York Legal Assistan ce Group (the \"Licensee\" or \"NYLAG\") for us e and occupancy of s pace at Coler-Goldwate r Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility (the \"Facility\") to provide pro bono legal services to patients and training to Corpora tion staff. Robert Hughes, Executive Director, Coler-Goldw ater Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility, read the resolution into the record on behalf of Lynda Curtis, Senior Vice President, South Manhattan Health Network. Mr. Hughes was joined by Dion Wilson, Assistant Director, Office of Facilities Development, later joined by Randye Retkin, New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG). Mr. Hughes explained that NYLAG would provide assistance in the decanting of Goldwater Hospital, with issues relating to immigr ation, entitlements, family law, etc. He noted that their services w ould also allow for NYLAG staff to train Coler-Goldwater staff to identify which residents may need legal services. He advised that a NYLAG atto rney would be on-site for one half day, once a week and would occupy approximately 150 square-feet of space, for six months . The organization would be paid $36,000 for their services. Mrs. Bolus asked how many pat ients have been helped by NYLAG. Mr. Hughes advised that the relationship between Coler-Goldwater and NYLAG originated after the earthquake in Haiti, when NYLAG provided assistance to patients and residents who were Haitian, in e fforts to gain them temporary protective status (TPS), they successfully filed 13 applications and received TPS for five (5) or six (6) i ndividuals. Alan Aviles, President, noting that Ms. Retkin was present, invite d her to provide an overview of the relationship NYLAG has wi th other HHC facilities. Ms. Retkin advised that the organization's relationshi p with Coler-Goldwater had historically been related to immigration issues more than anything else, but moving forward they will be providing assistance having to do with patients being reintegrated int o the community. She stated that NYLAG's relationship with other fac ilities has ranged from advanced planning, assistance with benefi ts, immigration, housing, and/or a wide variety of other services. Ms. Youssouf noted that this relationship will be specifically related to the decantin g of the facilit y, and Ms. Retkin confirm ed. Ms. Youssouf asked if the $36,000 was a flat rate or if it was re lated to a specific number of cases or some other factors. Ms. Retkin advised that the payment amount covers any and all services being that the organization can only handle so many cases. She noted that i f something requiring additional help came up, staff from another facility would assist. There being no questions or comments, the Committee Chair offered the matter for a Committee vote. On motion by the Chair, the Committee approved the resolution for the full Board's consideration. xi Authorizing the President of the New York City Health and Hosp itals Corporation (\"the Corporation\" or \"Licensor\") to execute a revocable license agreement with the New York City Department of Educat ion (the \"Licensee\") for its continued use and occupancy of space to operate a Licensed Practical Nurse (\"LPN\") tr aining program at Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility, Goldwat er campus (the \"Facility\"). Robert Hughes, Executive Director, Coler-Goldw ater Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility, read the resolution into the record on behalf of Lynda Curtis, Senior Vice President, South Manhattan Health Network. Mr. Hughes was jo ined by Nancy Doyle, Assistant Vice Pres ident, Workforce Development. Mr. Hughes advised that the Goldwater campus had served as a site to the Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) program since its incep tion in 2007. Since that time, four classes have graduated, with a fi fth scheduled to graduate in June 2012. He noted that HHC hired 1 03 of 157 students that completed the program, 39 of whom were hired by Coler-Goldwater. Mr. Hughes explained that the program would occu py 7,100 square-feet of space at no fee, with the benefit of havi ng the first opportunity to hire graduating LPNs. The term should not exceed one year, and the licensee was noted as being aware that the space will not be available when the facility is closed. Mrs. Bolus inquired as to why graduates from the East New York LPN program are being hired as Pa tient Care Assistants (PCAs) an d not LPNs. She said not only is that embarrassing for an individual w ho completed this program, but the individuals are functioning out of title. Ms. Doyle advised that when the program began, there was robust funding from the State for training HHC staff. The current prog ram is very different from that initial program. Funding for employee training has been stopped, but the Department of Education (DOE) has expressed significant support of the progra m, and desires to keep it running for as long as the facility is open at that locati on. Ms. Doyle advised that at this time employment is not promised to graduat es due to changing circumstances but staff works with employees and graduates to help find them employment. Ms. Doyle advised that she would follow-up regarding Mrs. Bolus's concern regarding wor king out of title and would advise the Committee of her findings. Ms. Youssouf asked where the program would be relocated to after the facility closes in 2013. Mr. Hughes advised that they have expressed a desire to remain on Roosevelt Island, possibly at the Coler campus but it has not yet been determined. Ms. Youssouf asked that the Committee be kept abreast of any decisions being that the partnership and program are benef icial to the Corporation. M rs. Bolus agreed, and added that there may be space available at other HHC facilities. There being no questions or comments, the Committee Chair offered the matter for a Committee vote. On motion by the Chair, the Committee approved the resolution for the full Board's consideration. Authorizing the President of the New York City Health and Hosp itals Corporation (the \"Corporation\" or \"Licensor\") to execute a revocable license agreement with General Vision Services/Cohen Fashion Opti cal (the \"Licensee\") for use and occupancy of space to operate an optical store on the campus of Jacobi Medical Center (the \"Facility\"). Diane Carr, Deputy Executive Director, North Bronx Health Netw ork, read the resolution into the record on behalf of William Wal sh, Senior Vice President, North Bronx Health Network. Ms. Carr was joined by Edward Baron, MD, Chief of Ophthalmology, North Bronx Healt h Network, Dion Wilson, Assistant Director, Office of Facilities Development, Miles Louis, Chief Ex ecutive Officer, General Visio n Services and Karen Miller, Vice President, Cohen Fashion Optical. Dr. Baron advised that the optical shop is capable of providing ne cessary services that are not currently available at the faci lity. He noted that these increased services may allow for the department to focus more on eye disease and would likely decrease appointment w ait time. He explained that the facility, on a daily basis, has patients t hat ask what to do with the prescription they have received for glasses, and he believes that this optical store would make it easier for patient s to fill prescriptions, and could also serve as a referral so urce for the facility. Mrs. Bolus asked if there is a reporting system in place to not e whether prescriptions have been f illed. Dr. Baron said there is not a system in place, but the idea that there would be an on-site location to t ake care of that would undoubtedly increase the number of pr escriptions filled. There being no questions or comments, the Committee Chair offered the matter for a Committee vote. On motion by the Chair, the Committee approved the resolution for the full Board's consideration. Request for approval from the Capital Committee for changes exceeding the $200,000 threshold for construction changes, in order to accomplish work needed to complete the following; Campus Site Improvements, Transportation Intermodal Facility at Jacobi Medica l Center. xii Diane Carr, Deputy Executive Director, North Bronx Health Netw ork, read the change order into the record on behalf of William W alsh, Senior Vice President, North Bronx Health Network. Ms. Carr was joined by Beau Scelza, Direct or, and Christopher Gowrie, Assoc iate Executive Director, North Bronx Health Network. Ms. Carr provided before and after project photos to assist in describing the work being performed, and what the additional fun ding would be utilized for. She advised that the first change order request in the amount of $475,000 would be used to complete lobby renovat ions. She explained that funding for the work was derived from surplus funds from a Fire Alarm System project at the facility. The second proposed change order for $777,000 would allow for the completion of a pe destrian plaza and site improvements around the campus. Ms. Youssouf asked if the projects had already been completed. Ms . Carr stated no, parts of the projects have been completed, b ut not those portions that requests are being made fo r. Ms. Carr explained that contracts that are already in place which provided ext erior and interior work, but exterior work was all that was completed because of time constraints and therefore interior work needed to b e completed. She noted that the project had received favorable bids at the time of award, and had benefited greatly from aggressive negotiat ions by the Construction Management firm, TDX, which allowed for holding pric es firm for the proposed change order work as the base project was continuing. The savings from favorable bid results from the Fi re Alarm System project and the firm price structure for the addi tional site work would allow the facility to incorporate these additional site im provements, which will provide for the installation of new ligh ts, sidewalk repairs, and emergency telephones. Ms. Youssouf asked if the facility was concerned about going over budget. Ms. Carr said no. Mr. Pistone added that cost was bei ng held firm, and that TDX has confirmed the validity of that cost. Mrs. Bolus asked whether lighting in the unmentioned lots was sufficient. Ms. Carr said either work had already been completed in those locations or would be part of a future project. There being no questions or comments, the Committee Chair offered the matter for a Committee vote. On motion by the Chair, the Committee approved the Construction Change Order. Information Items: Gouverneur Healthcare Services - Major Modernization Mendel Hagler, Executive Director, Gouverneur Healthcare Services provided the status report. Mr. Hagler was joined by James Pa lace, Hunter Roberts Construction Group, and Steve Curro, Dormitory Authority of the State of New York. Mr. Hagler noted that the Board had been informed of recent proj ect delays and budget overruns and apologized for this news. H e stated that construction at the facility is ongoing on floors two (2), th ree (3), four (4), five (5), six (6), seven (7), and eight (8 ), and the existing campus now includes the Ambulatory Care Pavilion and the 13 th floor Sub Acute Care units. He advis ed that floors nine (9), ten (10), eleven (11), and twelve (12) would be tu rned over in the coming months, and finally on the first floor. Work would extend until late 2 013 or early 2014, with forecasted completion expected for late 2014. Mr. Hagler accepted responsibility for the issues associated with the project and again apologized to the Board, noting that he, along with the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (DASNY), RMJM Hillier Architects, HHC Central Office, and the South Manhattan Network are all part of the project team. Mr. Pistone added that as part of the team, he as well took partial responsibility for the project and advised that the Board w ould receive, from the Office of Facilities Development, a complete analysis on causes of the overrun and recommendations for the project moving forward. Ms. Youssouf kindly noted both apologies but asked where the f unding would be coming from for the $36 million variance. She ask ed whether funding had been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Mr. Pistone said funding had not been secured b ut he has been in ongoing discussions with OMB and they are clearly s upportive of the project. He advised that they were notified that there were anticipated over-runs and they have been cont inually kept abreast of the situation. Ms. Youssouf expressed disappointment, on behalf of the Committee, in respect to where the project currently stands, and advise d that the Committee looks forward to having detailed recommendations on how to change the procedure with regards to outside program and construction mangers so that these types of issues won't continuously happen. Michael Stocker, MD, Chairman of the Board asked why previous reports had advised that the project was on budget, including tim es he had specifically asked whether the project was on budget. xiii Mr. Hagler advised that when status reports were given in 2010, after work on the Ambulatory Care Pavilion had begun, everythin g was still on target and the project team was still comfortable with progre ss. He stated that he provided the Board with any and all infor mation that he had at the time he was presenting and when it was initially ant icipated that there would be some delays and some budget difficu lties the Board was informed. He said that every time he presented to the Board he gave them all the information that he had at the time, as current and accurate as he had. Ms. Youssouf said that the team that he mentioned, includi ng DASNY and outside construction groups, should be meeting and havin g serious discussions, including asking why the information provi ded to Mr. Hagler informed the Committee that the project was on time and on budget when that was not the case. Mr. Hagler said that wh en the project was presented as on time and on budget, that was th e case, and it was not until work on the existing building began and the latent conditions started to appear that the team really start ed to see changes in the project cost and schedule. Mr. Palace explained that in 2010, the project was at a stage when construction on the Ambulatory Care Pavilion was well underw ay and it was then, when renovation of the existing building began that things really started to change. There were failing risers, the existing fa\u00e7ade couldn't support planned work, there was an unexpected amount of asbes tos, there was a steam pipe explosion. He noted that dest ructive surveys are quite difficult in an occupied building so some of these issues and conditions were unforeseen. Ms. Youssouf advised that she felt that surveys and even research on buildings built around the time of Gouverneur's existing f acility should have provided significant information on what would be encountered. Mr. Palace noted that there was a thorough survey done but some assumptions were not made. It was determined that there was asbestos but not to the extent seen once the walls were opened up. Dr. Stocker said that this information does not seem credible. If the building is inspected properly and we (HHC) know the age of the facility and have had possession of it for such a long time, there is no excuse why there would be so many unknown factors. Mr. Curro advised that resources were not made available at the onset of the project to complete as thorough an investigation a s necessary. He said the existing conditions survey that was performed was not completed as in depth as it should have been. Ms. Youssouf asked what was meant by insufficient funding for preliminary investigations. Mr. Curro said that HHC leadership ha d not given enough money to perform a more thorough investigation. Mrs. Bolu s asked if HHC leadership had been told that there was not enou gh money and Mr. Curro said that DASNY was given a budget to work with and that is what they used. Mrs. Bolus said that is not acc eptable, if there was not enough money to do proper investigation, as needed, then somebody should have been told. Dr. Stocker said that one of the most disturbing factors to him was that as the project budget was increased the contingency re mained the same. He asked how that happened. Mr. Curro explained that the project started at $80 million and after schematic design it was increased to $159 million, at that time with a $14.5 million contingency. The next increase, to $182 million, was when HHC asked DASNY to take over construction of existing floors of the facility (initially pl anned to be completed by HHC). He noted that along with those incr eases funding was provided. He stated that at the time he believes HHC leadership was aware that there was no additional contingency but DASNY ha d a budget to work with and they were doing so. When it went from $182 million to $207 million DASNY was told that $14 million was for furniture, fixtures and equipment (FF&E) and $5 million was for a budget overrun, the remainder was for program changes. He noted that the budget now does contain an additional 10% contingency. Ms. Youssouf stated that the project had gone from $81 million to $246 million and noted that all participants should be seriou sly concerned with what went wrong. She said it is mind boggling, and she was shocked and appalled that the project is so out of hand. She a dded that Dr. Stocker, OMB, and Sr. Management was not at a ll aware of how significant the problem was. Dr. Stocker said this is a very bad time to have these cost ov erruns and that money could have been spent on a number of other important issues and services. Dr. Stocker asked if there were any way t hat the project could be downsized or if there were something th at would be cut out of the scope. Mr. Hagle r said that the bulk of the cost went to infrastructu re work, and that is complete. He said that cutting out a floor o r two would not make a significant difference at this point. It is very difficult at this point to take anything out of the project. Ms. Youssouf said she disagreed that infrastructure work at $50 million was the bulk of a $246 million project. Mr. Hagler apol ogized. Dr. Stocker asked whether the Ambulatory Sur gery Center was necessary and whether the original reasoning in constructing the Center was to decant Bellevue. Mr. Hagler advised that at the time that the project was pl anned it was thought that services would increasingly be handled in an outpatient capacity and less in an inpatient capacity and it was thought that services provided by the Ambulat ory Surgery Center would gre atly support xiv Primary Care services. It was anticipated that Gouverneur would as sist in decanting Bellevue since many Gouverneur patients wer e heading up to Bellevue, at that time Metropolitan Hospital was not a part of the South Manhattan Network. He noted that 85% of community hospital procedures are done in an outpatient capacit y and therefore this service would be relevant. Dr. Stocker advised that there is an Ambulat ory Surgery Center at Metropolitan, which is currently part of the South Manhattan Health Network that has capacity, and asked why Bellevue would not send patients there. He suggested that it be reviewed whether or no t the Ambulatory Surgery Center shoul d still be part of the project. Mr. Hagler stated that it is an integral part of the project and advised that all staf fing of the unit would come from existing Gouverneur staff. Dr. Stocker asked that a study be performed that convinces the Board that there will be adequate utilization for the site. Ms. Youssouf acknowledged that HHC is a lar ge family, with multiple facilities thr oughout New York City and recommended that se rvices not be duplicated unnecessarily. She advised that the Capital Committ ee would be looking at how to revamp what is going on with these major projects. Mr. Hagler explained that when the projec t originated around 2005 the world was a different place, hospitals and operating room s were primarily full, there was no breakthrough pr ocess to streamline decision making, thi ngs have changed greatly since the projects inception. Ms. Youssouf noted that there were some disagreements and expl anations that would not be solved by this debate and thanked Mr. Hagler. Project Status Reports Central/North Brooklyn Health Network Generations+/Northern Manhattan Health Network* Queens Health Network* * Network contains project(s) that require a delay report Generations+/Northern Manhattan Health Network Peter Lynch, Office of Facilities Development, provided a brie f delay report on the Lincoln Emergency Room Renovation project. Mr. Lynch was joined by Liny Liu, Senior Project Manager, Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center Mr. Lynch advised that the project original ly fell behind schedule early on due to delays in receiving Certificate of Need (CON ) and funding approvals but work is now in progress. The project commenced in 2011, this being the first of five phases, with an anticipated completion date of July 2013. He advised that the job was moving along well. Mr. Pistone added that there would be a need for additional funding and he would provide a written update for the committee. Ms. Youssouf a sked what that mean. Mr. Pistone said that the project is ov er budget. Dr. Stocker asked whether this was an in house project. Mr. Pistone said yes. Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Committee - June 12, 2012 As reported by Rev. Diane Lacey Assistant Vice President's Report Manasses C.

Finance Committee - June 12, 2012 As reported by Mr. Bernard Rosen Senior Vice President's Report Ms. Marlene Zurack began her report by informing the Committee of the Corporation's cash on hand which is currently at 35 days compared to 43 days last month. The decrease is primarily due to a delay in the receipt of supplemental Medicaid payments that will la g until next fiscal year. As previously reported to the Committee, the days of having outstanding retroactive payments are changing signifi cantly. Mr. Jay Weinman, Corporate Comptroller and his staff have done preliminary cash forecasts for next year that reflects a significant change in the cash flow than in recent year and will require extremely cl ose monitoring of this issue and reporting the status of this si tuation to the Committee. The large surpluses that were rolled in previous years will no longer be available which was included in the reporting of the Financial Plan to the Committee. Ms. Youssouf asked how significant is the decrease in cash expec ted to be. Ms. Zurack stated that the calculation has not been done in terms of the days; however, based on preliminary calculations , there will be instances whereby HHC will fall below $100 million which would translate to approximately eight days of cash on hand that would result in controlling vendor payments; aggressively pursuing r eceivables and keeping all parties informed of the status. Finance is planning to meet with the City and State on this issue. The Corpor ation will continue its efforts to increase revenues and reduce cost which fr om a budget perspective would impact the cash in a positive w ay. Dr. Michael Stocker, Board Chairman asked if it is a timing issue. Ms. Zurack stated that for now it is a timing issue in that the COH has decreased from 43 days to 35 days and is expected to remain at that level by year-end due to a delay in the receipt of suppleme ntal Medicaid that was projected to come in by year end but will be delayed until next FY. In light of that delay, it is important to inform the Committee of the anticipated change in the COH going forward given the magnitude of the change. Mr. Rosen asked when was the last time HHC did seasonal borrowing. Mr. Larry Migdal, Deputy Chief Financial Officer stated tha t it was March 15, 1994. Ms. Zurack stated that the seasonal borrowing issue would not be a viable alternative to resolving this issue. The solution has to be that the budget has to be aligned. Mr. Migdal stated that in terms of seasonal borrowing, the Presid ent of the Corporation had to sign a promissory note to the City. Mr. Rosen stated that seasonal borrowing has to be repaid by the end of the year. However, it is a temporary solution that could be cons idered in terms of addressing timing issues. Ms. Zurack stated that it is an option; however, in the past, H HC has worked with the City on advancing payments to HHC and HHC delaying payment to the City which has al lowed HHC to balance as a result of thos e advancements and delays during tight cash ti me. However, it is important to reiterate that the solution is to align the budget; otherwise, there is no way to achieve a balance d budget without aligning expenses to revenues. Mr. Rosen stated that during the fiscal crisis, the budget was balanced on an accrued basis but without federal guarantees meet ing the payroll was unachievable. Mr. Migdal responding to Dr. Stocker's comment, stated that in terms of the eight days of cash on hand at this time, it is diff icult to project; however, those are seasonal trends whereby ther e are significant swings in cash which usually occurs in February and March due to the flow of funds from the City and State. However, over t he years, throughout those flows, HHC has managed to get through by inst ituting various controls such as vendors' payables. Mr. Weinman stated that HHC is averaging sixt y days in its vendor payment s. Some facilities are less some are more but general ly those payments when necessary can be delayed. Mr. Rosen st ated that there are measures that can be taken. Ms. Andrea Cohen asked what have been the average days of cash-on- hand (COH) for the year and what the projected average is for next year. Ms. Zurack stated that on average it has been thirty or more days and the projected is in the teens. Mr. Migdal stated that in terms of dollars, HHC's cash flow has been from $450 million to $650 million on any given day which a re healthy levels. xvi Ms. Zurack stated that it does not include any relief from the State and Federal governments. Ms. Youssouf asked what the thirty five days would translate to in terms of total cash. Ms. Zurack stated that it would be $573 million. Dr. Stocker asked how much uncertainty is there. Ms. Zurack stated that a fairly conservative cash flow has been done and HHC is cautiously hopefully that there might be some improvement. Dr. Stocker stated that if there are dela ys in payments from the Federal and State gov ernments does HHC know how much leeway HH C has in terms of delaying payments and going to the City. Ms. Zurack stated that HHC would know. Dr. Stocker stated that this issue comes as a surprise and is the first time this type of discussion has taken place since his appointment as Chairman of the Board. Ms. Zurack stated that it is not the first time but rather t he second time this type of issue has been reported to the Committe e. The first time that HHC was faced with this type of situation, the supplemental Medicaid payments were late and HHC was very close to those le vels at that time. Ms. Youssouf stated that the situation then compared to now is that it was due to late supplemental payments compared to the cu rrent issue that relates to the budget and would require major reductions as opposed to delayed payments. Ms. Zurack stated that this issue has been reported as part of the Financial Plan that was presented to the Committee. Mr. Migdal stated that the key going forward is to engage the City and State as quickly as pos sible regarding this issue. Ms. Zurack stated that the plan is to meet with the City's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the State Department of He alth (SDOH) to review HHC's projected cash flow for next year which is expected to get them to move on certain items that are often not acted on. Three years ago, the status of HHC's cash flow became a part of the monthly reporting to the Committee and later began rep orted as cash on hand as opposed to the cash flow and was at the point when the supplemental Medicaid payments were significantly delaye d. At which time, Finance in conjunction with Ms. Brown, Senior Vi ce President, Corporate Planning/HIV Services, Intergovernmental Re lations and Community Health put forth an effort to get CMS to act on t hose payments. HHC's cash flow was sent to Albany and Washingto n on a regular basis. It was a period whereby pension and City payments were delayed. Ms. Youssouf asked what type of emergency or catastr ophic event could possibly eradicate HHC's cash balance. Ms. Zurack stated that there was a time when the State took back $50 million from Woodhull for a retroactive rate decrease from capital reimbursement that created a major cash flow issue. Mr. Migdal added that in the late 80's and 90's when the State was faced with a major financial crisis, the Medicaid checks wer e delayed which significantly impacted the cash flow. Mr. Rosen stated that there will always be revenue issue, seasonal borrowing; however, what is important is that the funding ag encies understand and respect what is being done to address the issue. Ms. Zurack stated that it is important to be transparent in these types of situations which at this time the Committee is being informed as a forewarning of the anticipated decline in HHC's cash flow in February 2013. Ms. Youssouf asked whether it is calendar or fiscal year. Ms. Zurack stated that it is FY 2013 cash flow issue. The average b alances are significantly lower than the previous year. As Mr. Migdal mentioned historically, t here are some extremely low days in Februar y and March of each year that are alarming. Ms. Youssouf asked if HHC is planning to have initial discussions with the City and State soon. Ms. Zurack stated that the pla n is to meet with each entity as quickly as possible. Dr. Stocker asked if there is a fundamental disconnect between expenses and revenues that might impact the cash flow. Ms. Zurack stated that it raises the importance of revenue optimization that consists of two parts and timing is also important . For example, if it takes an extra twenty days to collect on a particular ca se due to staffing shortages, the Corporation knows when that mon ey will be collected. Similarly with the processing of Medicaid applicati ons by HRA, regardless of the time involved in the process, HHC know that it will eventually get the money. xvii Ms. Youssouf asked if there is an active internal team or committee that is actively reviewing long range planning to address t his issue. Ms. Zurack stated that there are two parts t hat are in parallel. First, there is a ve ry active leadership team that is respons ible for the restructuring that is designed to save HHC money on the expense side. It is a senior group lead by Mr. Aviles that meets regularly and there are some very active projects that have yielded savings wh ich Mr. Aviles can address. The second part relates to inte rnal control around the authorization of individual expenses which is headed by Mr . Martin, Corporate COO and is being addressed at a very m icro level on the operating side. There are controls on OTPS, hiring, and a ffiliation contracts and are also expected to result in signif icant savings. Mr. Aviles stated that this does highlight that there is a need to execute the restructuring plan elements that remain ahead, p articularly this coming FY. There is a significant amount remaining totaling $155 million as targeted reductions for essentially cost containme nt. Ms. Zurack asked Mr. Covino what the cumulative amount is for all of the cost containment projects to-date. Mr. Covino stated that the total is $1 billion. Ms. Youssouf stated that from a financial perspective it is important to understand the level of the cash reduction and whether there would be a point whereby HHC would be at risk of having the State or the Federal governments take over due to a cash shortage given t hat in some city agencies that type of circumstance has occurred. Ms. Zurack stated that there are two issues. At the recent Audit Committee, KPMG, HHC's i ndependent auditing firm, presented t he audit plan and the metric that would be used for establishing growing concerns. What is shown on an accrual basis is the significant loss from operations that has been trending in a negative direction over the past years. That trend triggers the accounting industry doi ng a growing concern review. HHC's liquidity has been ve ry stable and not counter balances to th e losses and accordingly, HHC passed the go ing concern review. If HHC's liquidity were to become problematic, it would affect HHC' s credit rating and would trigger some majo r consequences. On the other side, in the State health law, the SDOH has the mechanism to step-in when hospitals hit major finan cial problems. It is not a specific trigger as previously menti oned; however, both of those circumstances would not happen and the C ity would not want that to happen. There is a layer of assistance that would occur before an outside entity steps in. Mr. Aviles added that it is fairly unlikely that this type of acti on will occur given that it is apparent to the City that HHC is managing the problem in light of the reduction in FTES, $500 million reduction in expenses, and the plan going forward calls for further reductions. The State would be taking on the accountability for that execution if there were a mismanagement issue which is not the case in thi s instance. Ms. Youssouf stated that the questions were being raised given that in some industries, there is an automatic trigger for those instances. Mr. Rosen asked about the status of the adoption of the City's budget. Ms. Zurack stated that on June 4, 2012, HHC had its City Council hearing. The Council was very supportive and HHC is requestin g the restoration of $8.9 million in City funds which translates to $12.7 million in total funds for the restoration of child health clinics, rapid HIV testing and mental retardation and developmental disabilities (M RDD). In addition, in the past the council has restored HHC's subsidy reductions last year which totals $4.2 million for FY 12. Mr. Rosen asked when the adoption will take place. Ms. Zurack stated that it is scheduled for the end of June 2012. Key Indicators/Cash Receipts & Disbursements Reports Mr. Larry Migdal reported that the Key Indica tors report as of April 2012, utilization for acute discharges is down by 4.6% compared to last year for the same period. There is a s light improvement since January 2012 which was at 5%. The D&TC visits are down by 6.5%; skilled nursing facilities (SNF) days are down by 6.2% which has been trending downward during the year due to the transitioning underw ay at Coler/Goldwater hospital. The ALOS, all of the facilities are wi thin the corporate average by .3 day with the exception of Con ey Island and Lincoln, .4 day greater than the expected and .5 day less than the ALOS, respectively. The CMI is up slightly from last year a nd has reached a milestone of having a value greater than 1. FTEs are down by 297 compared to June 2011 but are 225 FTEs under the ta rget. Over the past twelve months from April 2011 to April 2012 FTEs are down by 515. Receipts are $44 million better than budget a nd disbursements are $38 million under spent resulting in a positive net surplus of $82 million year to date. A comparison of the current actuals to the prior year for the same period, receipts are $352 million worse than last year due to the timing of DSH and UPL payments which are down by $225 million. Pools are down of which $90 million is due to timing whereas last year HHC received a quarterly supplemen tary payment in April compared to this year the payment was rece ived in May 2012. Appeals and settlements are down by $31 million d ue to the FY 09 rate take back by the State. However, an additional UPL payment is expected of $434 million this month which will enable HHC to end the year with a projected cash balance of $465 million. Di sbursements are $132 million worse than last year for the same period of which $67 million is due to the timing of City payments and $53 million due to an increase in fringes, health insurance and pen sion. Actuals versus budget YTD, inpatients receipts are down by $13 million while outpatient receipts are up by $28 million; all other reven ues are up by $28 million. Disbursements personal services (PS) are $7.4 million over budget of which $3.8 million is due to overtime expens es and the xviii lag in the reduction of FTEs by 225. Other Than Personal Serv ices (OTPS) expenses are under budget by $40 million due to the r oll of Networks' surpluses from last year and also the lag in the start-up of IT projects. Mr. Rosen asked Ms. Zurack if she had an announcement. Ms. Zurack stated that while it is traditional for HHC to honor it s retirees who move on to big and better things, that day mar ks a significant milestone for Mr. Migdal who is retiring after 34 years at HHC. Un der his stewardship the Corporation in terms of financial sys tems, financial management, and financial reporting have move light years from a poi nt and time in which HHC would get a qualified opinion from its independent auditing firm to the point where HHC had no material weakne sses. This is largely due to his leadership in his role as Corporate Controller and for those of us who know him are very familiar wi th the elegance and grace with which he conducts all business i n the Corporation. His work papers are stellar and the only thing s harper than his pencil is his \"wit.\" He applies the same standard to a schedule of a sentence in the English language which is very unusual for those in Finance. His editorial touch will be deeply missed in our financial statements. On a very personal note, this is a tremendous loss. He has been a true colleague, a mentor and a friend and certa inly better days are ahead and he will be truly missed. Mr. Aviles presenting Mr. Migdal with a plaque stated that it has been evidenced from some of Mr. Midgal's pithy comments, he is one of HHC's financial historians and the Corporation will be losing a lot of institutional know ledge with his departure. Mr. Midgal has been indispensable in terms of his judgm ent and wealth of knowledge. From knowing and working with Mr. Midgal over the years, he is a profoundly descent individual. It is a pleasure to honor Mr. Migdal with this plaque that reads: \"In recognition of Larry Migdal for thirty four years of dedication, service and leadership to the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporati on, to new beginnings and happy memories.\" Mr. Rosen added that it has been a pleasure working and knowing Mr. Midgal for a number of years and that the Committee would l ike to extend it thanks to Mr. Midgal for his years of dedication and service and to a long and health retirement. Statement of Revenues and Expenses For The Period Ended 3/31/2012 And 2011 Mr. Jay Weinman stated that the reporting would highlight some of the major changes in the Statement of Revenue & Expenses for the period ended March 31, 2012. Bringing to the attention of the Committee, bottom line, the Corporation's loss for FY 12 YTD is $ 596 million compared to $349 million last year. The major components of the decrease also related to cash are three items, $163 million de crease in DSH maximization, the $605 million allocation decreased to $307 million State fiscal year (SFY); $79 million decrease in supple mental Medicaid funds and $44 million additional rese rve for HMO/GME. Appropr iations decreased $26 million due to the increase in debt service. Premium revenue increased by $395 million due to several fact ors; $42 million for IGT; $229 million for pharmacy carve-in begin ning in October 2012; $66 million and $55 million premium rate increases due to an increase in enrollment. Operating expenses, PS incr eased by $134 million, due to a shortfall in the reduction of FTEs and prio r year labor settlements. OTPS increased by $294 million rel ated entirely to MetroPlus pharmacy carve-in resulting in additional expenses and increase membership and rate in creases. Benefits increased by $47 million or 6.1% related to an increase in health insurance. Po st-employment benefits increased by $95 million. As previously reported expenses were increased to approximately $700 million from $630 m illion last year. Affiliation expense increased by $27 millio n or 4.3% a slight decrease from the previous quarter. Interest expense increased by $8 million due to an increase in interest on the debt service funding. Ms. Youssouf asked for clarification of the increase in interest expense as part of the debt service funding. Mr. Weinman stated that HHC is paying the debt service interest earned on the debt that was borrowed, the increase in TFA and G O debt. Ms. Youssouf stated that the City has been doing a lot of refunding which would reduce the cost. Mr. Weinman stated that there were some re-estimates at t he beginning of the year on the interest and HHC reports those charges. Ms. Zurack stated that Finance would research that issue and repor t back to the Committee; however, it could be that there were savings that were front loaded last year. Ms. Youssouf stated that it would be helpful to understanding what those charges include given that the City recently did appro ximately $2 billion in refunding. Ms. Zurack stated that the general sense is that it also relate s to new projects so the principle increased for HHC and the Cit y does cash flow borrowing. HHC is actively in the City's capital program. So if HHC draws a lo t of cash it increases the debt service in addition to the interest rates there is also a principle amount. xix Ms. Youssouf asked if HHC has increased the borrowing for some of its capital projects and whether there is more outstanding de bt even with the steep decline in interest rates that would actually help HHC. Ms. Zurack introducing Ms. Nini Mar, Assistant Director, Corpor ate Debt Financing stated that based on Ms. Mar's expertise she would address that question. Ms. Mar stated that the charges are compiled by OMB and report by HHC; however, there are several modernization projects in the ir final stages, Harlem, Gouverneur and Goldwater north and ot her small reconstruction projects funded by TFA. Ms. Zurack stated that Finance would prepare the specific data re lative to Ms. Youssouf question but it appears that the princi ple is going up and the interest going down. Medicaid Eligibility I npatient Processing Report Status of Converting Self-Pay Patients to Medicaid Ms. Maxine Katz stated that the Medicaid eligibility report as April 2012 corporate-wide there c ontinues to be a lag in applica tion submitted compare to last year for the same period. Eligible decisions are slightly lower but the facilities have made significant progr ess in reducing the gap. The approval rate of applications submitted to Medicaid decisions is at 89% which is slightly better than last year fo r the same period at 87%. Although there are fewer applications submitted more of those applications are being approved. The decrease in applications submitted is primarily due to a decrease in discharges and a shift in payor mix, from Medicaid to Medicaid managed care. There are more patients with insurances coming to HHC facilitie s which decrease the pool of patients to pursue for eligibility. However, the Corporation is continuing its improvement efforts and a second pa ss on the value stream is scheduled to review all of the impro vements activities that have been done to date to determine if the goal s were achieved and the next step. The two models have shown improvements in terms of days to submit the application and getting a response to those submissions. Ms. Youssouf asked when will it be decided which model will be used as best practice throughout the Corporation. Ms. Katz stated that the plan is to make that determination by September 2012. There will be an event to determine which is be st. Some of the facilities have implemented one of the models or some of the components of those models. Mr. Rosen asked if steps are being taken to address the PCAP iss ue which has decreased compared to being close to 100% in prior years. Ms. Katz stated that PCAP is down and is under review and some of the issues are related to timing. Those factors in conjuncti on with the decrease in discharges and managed care companies including these women into managed care plans Dr. Stocker stated that HHC has put a lot of effort in addressing this process that have resulted in some changes over the year s; however, the question is whether it is beneficial to have the facilities pr esent to the Committee the status of those processing efforts . In reviewing the Medicaid Eligibility report, Be llevue stands out so perhaps the facility can present their status to the Committee. Mr. Aaron Cohen, Chief Financial Officer, South Manhattan Networ k stated that the facility is prepared to present to the Commit tee in September 2012. Dr. Stocker confirming that Bellevue will pr esent in September 2012 the facility's status of the Medicaid eligibility processin g. Mr. Rosen again extended well wishes to Mr. Midgal on his retirement. Medical & Professional Affairs /Info rmation Technology Committee May 24, 2012 - As reported by Dr. Michael Stocker Chief Medical Officer Report: Ross Wilson, MD, Senior Vice President/Corporate Chief Medical Officer reported on the following initiatives: Institute for Medical Simulation and Advanced Learning (IMSAL) IMSAL hosted another very successful facilit ator training program with the CMS group from the Harvard system. HHC was able to support this advanced training for another six members of our staff, to c ontinue the expansion of expertise across more of our sites and hasten the facility based work of the IMSAL. In addition, the first meeting of the re-vamped IMSAL Advisory Committee was convened this month, with the responsibility to ad vise on overall strategic direction for simulation training across our whole system, as well as new curriculum priorities. xx Research As part of the HHC-NYU partnership in the Clinical & Translational Science Institute (CTSI), we were pleased to announce the su ccessful recipients of funding for HHC research projects after a competitive process. The recipients are: L. Paladino MD (Kings County Hospital Center): The Rapidly Improving Stroke Symptoms (RISS) Study: A Pilot Observational study . H. Valsamis MD (Kings County Hospital Center): The Brooklyn Health and Hospitals Corporation TraumaticBrain Injury Network (BHHC TBraIN). Third Annual John Corser Symposium The third Annual John Corser Bioethics Symposium \"An Ethics Journey from Global to Specific: Health Care Reform and Mediation at HHC\" was held on May 9, 2012 at Harlem Hospital Center with over 200 HHC leaders including physicians , nurses, chaplains and senior managers in attendance. Keynote speaker Bruce Vladeck, PhD, l ed the day with \"The Ethics of the Affordable Care Act.\" The symposium provided participants with an understanding of the new legislation dealing with health care reform affecting impo rtant end- of-life decision making, and ethical issues surrounding withdrawal of life sustaining treatments. Formal policy changes relatin g to the application of the Family Health Care Decisions Act, and the determination of brain death are being released following these di scussions Corporate-wide for implementation, to align with the recent c hange in NYS policy from two assessments to one assessment to dete rmine brain death. HHC Walks to Raise Funds for the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill On Saturday, May 12, 2012 HHC's Departments of Psychiatry and Centra l Office of Behavioral Health participated in a City-wide w alk to raise funds for the National Alliance For the Mentally Ill, (NA MI) NYC Metro Chapter. NAMI is a national advocacy organization began by family members to create a voice for improved research and care for those suffering from mental ill ness. HHC had six facilities and central office participate (Met ropolitan Hospital Center, Harlem Hospital Center, Bellevue Hospital Cent er, Coney Island Hospital, Kings County Hospital Center, and Lin coln Medical and Mental Health Center). There were a total of 97 walkers raising over $15,000. 2012 Annual Behavioral Health Planning Session - June 7 at Draper Hall The 2012 Annual Behavioral Health Planning Session will be held on June 7 th at Draper Hall. This important meeting is the forum for the HHC discussion on the journey towards Behavioral Health managed ca re, with our experience to date with the BHO (Behavioral Heal th Organization), as well as our preparation for the next steps. Dr David Cutler, Otto Eckstein Professor of Applied Economics, Ha rvard University Department of Economics will be one of the keynote speakers. HHC's Center for Teen Health Improvement HHC has received grant funding from the Mayor's Young Men's Initia tive (YMI) to improve services for teens and young adults, with an emphasis on improving sexual and reproductive health service qualit y and access for young men. This funding, which extends thr ough fiscal year 2014, has enabled HHC to launch a system-wide improvement initiative focused on the health and development of young people in the populations that we serve. This work will be coordinated by the newly formed Center for Teen Health Improvement within the Office of Healthcare Improvement. The goal of this Center is to improve the physical, psycholog ical, and social well-being of young people. The aims are: 1) qual ity healthcare services for young people within HHC: a) \"Teen Friendly\" cust omer service practices to encourage young patients to openly commu nicate their needs, return for follow up care, and refer their peers; b) exce llence in clinical service provision, in accordance with best practices in adolescent health care; 2) support for HHC's young patients in learning to make choice s that promote long-term health; and 3) seamless partnerships with City-wide agencies that complement HHC in promoting youth development. Strategies include: 1) Staff Training - a ll clinical staff will be trained on clinical guidelines and skills, customer service, and issues in adolescent care; 2) Systems Improvement - a needs assessment will guide improvements to make HHC's services more appealing and accessible to young people. This may includ e updating clinic spaces, hours, equipment, and operating procedures; and 3) Youth Engagement - young people will be recruited and trained to help improve HHC's services for their peers. They will participate in provider training as model patients, educate their pe ers and communities about healthy behaviors and care-seeking, and promote HH C's services via outreach and technology. This work will i mprove participants' life and job skills, and build their self-esteem as they serve as important partners in healthcare improvement. An announcement will go out the HHC facilities informing them of this new initiative and state how HHC staff can support and be nefit from the Center for Teen Health Improvement such as: by joining our HHC professionals interested in care for young people - send us your xxi contact information and tell us where you work and what you do; we will inform you about relevant news, events, resources, oppo rtunities; tell us what needs to be done - respond to our surveys, talk to us... we need your insights and ideas!; and take action - start or join workgroups to address specif ic improvement needs. Make a difference, be a leader, connect with your colleagues f rom around HHC! Staff contacts are: Shoshanna Handel, MPH, Director, Center for Teen Health Improvement. Elet Howe, Assistant Director, Center for Teen Health Improvement. David Stevens MD, Senior Director of Healthcare Improvement. MetroPlus Health Plan, Inc. Dr. Van H. Dunn, Chief Medical Officer, MetroPlus Health Plan, Inc. presented to the Committee. Dr. Dunn informed the Committee that the total plan enrollment as of April 24, 2012 was 427,245. The break down of plan enrollment by line of business is as follows: Medicaid 359,414 Child Health Plus 17,131 Family Health Plus 36,295 MetroPlus Gold 3,084 Partnership in Care (HIV/SNP) 5,733 Medicare 5,588 For the first time in many months, MetroPlus had a decline in enrollment. From March to April MetroPlus dropped 675 members overall, 230 in Medicaid, 391 in Child Health Plus and 117 in Medicare. The reduction in Medicaid was due to a lower rate of applications, w hile the reduction in Child Health Plus was due to loss of eligibility. For Medicare, MetroPlus had 250 members disenrolled for failing to pay their premiums since January after a 90 day grace period. Dr. Dunn provi ded the Committee with reports of members disenrolled from Me troPlus due to transfer to other health plans, as well as a report of new members transferred to MetroPlus from other plans. Each month, data is shared with the Committee that reflects members that have disenrolled from MetroPlus and have transferred t o Health First. In collaboration with HHC Finance, thes e transfers were studied, and 80% of those who transferred were no longer receivi ng care at HHC. A sample survey was done on those individuals who transfe rred. Eight hundred and fifty one members with valid phone number s received outreach. Two hundred and forty two or 28% of those were reached. The two main reasons fo r members leaving MetroPlus a nd HHC were desire to receive care from providers not in our plan, and problems with accessing care. 76.6% reported leaving to go to a non- network provider. 17.9% left due to difficulties accessing care. MetroPlus also conducted a survey of Medicare members that vo luntarily disenrolled in January and February 2012. Of the members disenrolled, approximately 12% were reached and a disenrollment su rvey was completed. The main reason given for disenrolling was dissatisfaction with benefits offered by the Plan. MetroPlus is currently finalizing a renegotiation of provider contracts that should allow them some flexibility in offering enhanced value added benefits. Prelimi nary results for May show that MetroPlus will gain between 1 ,500 to 2,000 members. On the other hand, MetroPlus will continue to face challenges in their ability to offer additional services to their Medicare p opulation. Based on current federal legislation there will be a projected 19.28% ba se premium reduction in MetroPlus' Medicare Advantage rates o ver the next five years. The Affordable Care Act requires that counties such as those within New York City that are above the national fee-for- service (FFS) average reduces costs to 95% of FFS. Re-evaluated annually, county rates will be reduced over a maximum of six ye ars to achieve these rate reductions. The New York State Department of Health (SDOH) will be providing 2012-2013 rates in tw o phases. In Phase I (early May), plans can expect the April 1 st base Medicaid and FHP medical rates. Regional trends are about 5% vs. 7% last year. This is before SDOH applies the legislative cuts from last year (it was a 2 year deal for managed ca re plans). These include a 1.7% trend reduction and a 2% overall reduction, leaving an approximately 1.3% trend. Separately, pharmacy rate s are being reduced from the October carve-in to reflect an increase in the expected generic dispensing rate (from 72% to 77%) and an elimination of the funded carve-in transition period. An analysis of these new pharmacy rates reveals that MetroPlus will recei ve approximately 36 million dollars less in pharmacy revenue over t he next year. In Phase II, MRT adjustments will be funded and include the carve-in of new populations and expenses, including low weight and disabled (SSI) babies, homeless recipients, and dental. All of these will come with incremental revenue and cost. SDOH is still developing those rates and those will probably not be available until mid -year. Chronic mediations that someone has been on for three months, look at prescriptions per member per month for those with chronic disease and monitor whether there has been a decrease in those being fill ed. Filled rates are monitored since formulary change to ensu re all patients are receiving their appropriate medications - one of the major issues is that providers are not filling the 'prior aut horization' required for non-formulary medications which we are addressing by outreach to both patients and providers. xxii On April 12, 2012, Governor Cuomo issued an Executive Order to establish a State-wide Health Exchange, an online marketplace wh ere individuals and small businesses can choose among competing health insurance plans. The Governor stated that this will reduce cost of coverage for individuals, small businesses and local governments. Chief Information Officer Report Bert Robles, Chief Information Officer provided the Committee with updates on the following initiatives: Meaningful Use (MU) Stage II On February 23rd, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making for Eligible H ospitals and Eligible Providers to meet Meaningful Use (MU) in the program's second stage. As presented to the Board previously, the Co rporation has made steady progress towards Stage I MU for the HHC hospitals and HHC is currently meeting thresholds for all Stage I measu res. Stage II introduces the following significant changes to the program: Hospitals will have 16 core items and can pick two of four menu items were previously they had 14 and could choose five out of ten. Eligible providers will have 17 core and can pick three of five menu items. Most thresholds for MU will be increased. For example, patient demographics must be recorded for 80% of patients, where previously it was for 50%. The threshold for assessing smok ing status is also up to 80% from 50% and the requirements for decision support rules are increased to five from one. Almost all Stage I menu requirements will be core including the requirement for Summary of care at transitions, syndromic surveillance, R\\reportable lab results for public health, medi cation reconciliation, and providing educational resources to patients. The Summary of Care Document must be provided for at least 65% percent of transitions and referrals and would have to be electronically exchanged between the hospital and a provider that is not affiliated with the hospital and is using a different EHR vendor product. This proposed requirement may present particular difficulties for in tegrated delivery systems, where a large majority of referrals are within the system and using the same EHR. Professional Organizations such as the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), National Association of Public Hospitals (NAPH), the American Hospital Association (AHA) and the Hospital Association of New York State (HANYS) have ident ified this as an unreasonable request for their constituents. HHC concurs with their position. CMS proposes that at least ten percent of a hospital's patient s would need to view or download information about their hospital stay, or electronically transmit their information to a third party. This requirem ent would make providers accountable for pat ients using computer technology. While GNYHA, NAPH, AHA and HANYS encourage electronic interaction with patients through the use of computer technology, they have found this require ment to be untenable. HHC concurs with their opinion. A new menu objective for Hospitals is to generate and transmit permissible discharge prescriptions electronically (eRx) for mor e than 10% of patients. This requirement could cost HHC an addi tional two million dollars annually for fees related to eRx and accelerate the planned implementation of eRx in the inpatient setting. A new objective for eligible providers w ould mandate that secure electronic messaging be used to communicate with more than 10 % of unique patients seen during the EHR reporting period. Alth ough the requirement does not require the patient to respond, a requirement to electronically communicate with one out of ten patients may not be appropriate in many cases. In addition to the new measures and thresholds, all hospitals will be required to submit qualit y metrics electronically in 2014 . The Notice of Proposed Rule Making also articulates the timet able where penalties will begin to be levied on providers who are not meaningful users. A one percent reduction in Medicare rates will commence in 2015 for Hospitals who have not attested to meani ngful use by July 1 of 2014. Unexpectedly, eligible providers who elec t to attest under the Medicaid Program will nevertheless be subjec t to Medicare Part B penalties if they have not attested by October 1, 2014. This is despite the fact that the Medicaid Program allows eligi ble providers to begin meaningful use as late as 2016, without reduction in inc entive funding. Thus the program, on one hand recognizes that Me dicaid eligible professionals may need more time to reach meaningful use and gives them until 2016 to start, but on the other hand pen alizes what limited Medicare revenue they receive if they don't start by 2014. Enterprise Business Intelligence (BI) Initiative EITS is embarking on one of the most critical initiatives for HHC- establishing an Ente rprise Business Intelligence (BI) strategy. BI is widely viewed as a key strategic imperative for the success of in formation driven organizations. With the explosion of informat ion technology in healthcare and the accelerated pace of health care reform, we are grappling with enormous amounts of data and an incredible pace of change that requires new and sophisticated ways to allow us to timely and effectively analyze and model. At its core, BI is about decision making. BI converts enormous volumes of data into meaningful analytics and metrics about HHC 's current business and clinical operations. It identifies evolving patterns th at allow us to be more responsive to changing conditions an d therefore, make more informed decisions. Some of the key objectives of the BI initiative will be to: Strengthen data and information governance xxiii Integrate data from diverse systems to enable advanced, comprehensive analytics to drive clinical, financial and operational improvement Streamline the data reporting process flow and improve efficiency and service levels Deploy meaningful reporting, dashboards and alerts for various us er levels that track and monitor key performance indicators Provide both retrospective and predictive forecasting capabilities to answer not only what happened but why did it happen. Enable self-service reporting analytics and the ability to drill down into key performance indicators for better evidence-based decision-making. Our goal in deploying this Business Intelligence and Analytics strategy is to greatly enhance our ability to execute on our cor porate objectives and mission. Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) EITS is working in partnership with Medical and Professional Affairs on another of HHC's most cr itical strategic initiatives- the implementation of Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH). Pr esently, HHC has a primary care population of more than 477,000 adul t and pediatric patients. The primary goal of the PCMH initiative is to improve pati ent outcomes through improved care management and care coordination. All of our acute care facilities and diagnostic and treatment centers, 17 separate sites in all, have received designation as Patient -Centered Medical Homes (PCMH) by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and awarded each the highest, Level 3, PCMH Recognition. HHC is in the process of PCMH designation for 22 co mmunity health centers and extension clinics. If all of our pri mary care sites ultimately receive Level 3 NCQA Recognition status, HHC w ill ultimately qualify for at least $15 million annually in enha nced Medicaid reimbursement rate increases. IT Asset Management EITS' Service Management Office is in the process of devel oping and implementing IT Asset Management for the division. IT Asset Management is a set of business practices that lever age financial, contractual and inventory functions to support life cycle management and decision making for the IT environment. This is es pecially critical for EITS as budget dollars shrink and demand for IT services increases. There are multiple benefits of implementing this type of program for EITS. They include but are not limited to: accurate budgeting, cost and risk reduction and increased asset utilization. Presently, the Service Management Office team is implement ing Asset Management at the Jacobi Data Center with implementation at both Queens and South Manhattan Networks targeted for the end of th is Fiscal Year. The remaining networks (North Bronx, Generations+, North &Central Brook lyn and South Brooklyn Networks) will be co mpleted by the end of this calendar year. Successfully implemented, IT Asset Management will enable EITS to support user demands quickly while rationalizing the cost of services. Action Items: Resolution authorizing the President of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (\"the Corporation\") to negotiate and execute an amendment to the Affiliation Agreement with New York University School of Medicine (\"NYUSOM\") for the provision of Health Services at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center and Cumberland Diagnosti c and Treatment Center which terminates on June 30, 2014, to include the provision of General Care Health Services at Cole r-Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility (\"Coler-Goldwa ter\"), consistent with the general terms and conditions and for the amounts indicated in Attachment A; AND Further authorizing the President to make adjustments to the contra ct amounts, providing such adjustments are consistent with t he Corporation's financial plan, professional standards of care and equal employment opportunity policy except that the President will seek approval from the Corporation's Board of Directors for any increases in costs in an y fiscal year exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) of the amounts set forth in Attachment A.

AND Further authorizing the President to make adjustments to the contra ct amounts, providing such adjustments are consistent with t he Corporation's financial plan, professional standards of care and equal employment opportunity policy. The resolution was moved for the full Board of Directors approval. xxiv Information Items : Readmissions Presenting to the Committee was Dr. Ross Wilson, Senior Vice President, Corporate Chief Medical Officer. Readmissions are an ea sy target as a reflection of waste in health care systems in t hat percentages of readmissions are regarded as preventable. Certain payer groups such as Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS ) and others have latched on to this as readmission is a reflecti on of poor care. Dr. Wilson put on the table that no real readmissions are preventable, some of them actually reflect the deterioration th e chronic status of a patient or that they have other socio or other needs that need to be met. Dr. Wilson further added that of the preventable readmissions we need to do better. CMS has introduced the readmissions reduction program which is basically a financial penalty starting in 2013 for patients who are readmitted within 30 days of discharge with heart failure (HF), pneumonia and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) - any site of r eadmission, any cause for readmission. CMS has been reporting this data for so me time but now the penalty has started to be introduced whi ch amounts to around 3% of our Medicare revenue in a financial year associated with these readmission cases. The 30 day readmissio n maker is not a very good marker it just happens to be the one we have. Early readmissions in the first seven days often reflect the f act that what was cared for in the hospital could have been improved, either the medication stabilization or the discharge plan etc. Readmiss ions after 14 days up to 30 days can be due to any number of reasons that may or may not be preventable. CMS will base the financial penalty on a three year rolling average of performance of July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2011 and compare this rolling average against our 2012 pe rformance. Dr. Wilson provided the Committee with a slide that drives CMS and all payers. The horizontal axis displays the readmission rat es by State for Medicare patients and the vertical axis is the Medicare re imbursement per enrollee. The s lide demonstrates that the readmis sion rates and cost per enrollee increases (linear rela tionship) with some outliers. CMS's view is if you can drive down the readmission r ate you can predominately project a reduction in the payment per enr ollee which is how they financially determine the penalty. Dr. Wilson then provided the Committee with HHC specific data for Calendar Year 2011. The total percentage of readmissions acr oss the entire HHC system has fallen with some variations for which ther e are conjecture seasonal components operating in February as n oted by the high increase but the overall direction is declining. In order to try to understand our probl em better we are focusing on d ifferent groups of readmissions: psych readmissions slightly declines towards the e nd of CY 2011. Dr. Wilson noted that each month, HHC facilities receive a readmission report for HF, AMI, and pneumonia. In addition we repor t on total readmissions and readmissions in psychiatry. Behi nd the reports the medical record number for each one of the readmissions is provided so that each clinical department can actually review the records and see what the learning points are behind the readmission. In response to Dr. Stocker's question regarding benchmarks, Dr. Wi lson noted that the only real case-mix or risk adjusted bench mark is the one provided by CMS. They correct for age, some social-dem ographics and the corrected diagnoses within the Medicare population of our facilities. So it is not Medicare diagnosis or the co-morbidities per patient it is actually more about the complexity of the w hole Medicare population that each facility treats. There is a lot of argument about whether this is in fact a valid risk adjustment or not, however, it is the one we have to use. So when Medicare readjusts these raw figures we have to wait 24 to 30 months to get the Medicare figures as they use the rolling three year data. Separately we are going to start to look at what the risk adjustment algorithm looks like for our populations because when we risk adjust Coney Island Hospital it looks differ ent when we risk adjust Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Cent er - the impact on raw figures changes quite a bit between the two sites. The next slide t hat Dr. Wilson p resented to the Committee demonstr ated heart failure (HF) readmissions in CY 2011 for Jacobi Medical Center and Coney Island Hospital and looks at two subsets of patients. The slide illustrates that in CY 2011 Jacobi managed to continue a significant reduction in HF readmissions, wh ile it bounces around but the overall trajectory is significant over the 12 month p eriod. At Coney Island there is a mirror image of deterioration of HF readmission s, due to the fact that the Coney Island population is bigger, older and has different co-morbidities and when we risk adjust the Coney Island figure it may not look as quite bad as this. However, it is i mportant to note that many of HHC sites have made substantial improvements in HF and pneumonia readmissions. Dr. Wilson then provided the Committee with several slides in hi s presentation that demonstrates how CMS sees readmissions (whi ch are public domain information) based on Medicare data from July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2010. In comparing the rate of readmission for HF between Bellevue Hospital Center, Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center and New York University on the basis that they shar e some the same medical staff, the first thing one sees on this slide is that the National benchmark or National average is 24.8% whic h is the risk adjustment figure. Figures of 20% are good performance. The number of Medicare patients tracked for Bellevue was 171 patients, Woodhull 150 patient versus 973 patients at NYU which shows that in terms of the Medicare population we treat relatively few compared to the Medicaid population particularly related to the voluntary sector. There is a big consequence of this because if you look at Bel levue's rate of 29.8% and Woodhull's rate of 32.1%, both are worse than the US National rate versus NYU at 22.9% which is no different than the US National rate - the fewer patients you have the broader the 'bar ' will be as illustrated on the chart and yield a higher rate t han the US National rate. A larger number of patients reduce the scale of th e rates. Statistically there is a better performance at NYU than Bellevue for xxv Medicare patients with heart failure readmission. Current preliminar y figures show that there is significant improvement at Bel levue. Since readmissions rates are both a financial and c linical problem, it is an indicator in the Affiliation agreements so there is a bo nus for reducing to a level that gets us into the black. Data on the death rate for heart failure patients are for the same time period and same population of patients. The US National 30-day death rate for heart failure patients is 11.3%. Both Bellevue (10.5%) and Woodhull (9.8%) are no different than the US National aver age, while NYU at 6.9% is better than the National rate. While we have a higher readmission rate, based on mortality data we are no differ ent from the National average. One can speculate as to why that is the case - is it that our care of these patients are fine but they have m ore social needs and are harder to discharge, or NYU pati ents are less sick than ours, or treat t hem better - but we don't know the answer to these speculations. What we do know is that in terms of mortality ra te for heart failure our performance is consistent with the National rate. Dr. Wilson then provided the Committee with the other HHC hospital's data on readmissions rates as follows: Jacobi at 28.1%, Me tropolitan at 27.9% - both different than National rate; Lincoln at 30.3% , Coney Island at 31.0%, Elmhurst at 29.5% and Kings County at 30.8% - all slightly worse than the National rate. The last slide in Dr. W ilson's presentation illustrates t he causes of readmissions using Harlem's data as an example, for all payers, all causes and unadjusted. The blue bars on the graph are for diabetic patients and the red bar' s non-diabetic patients. For heart rate failure the diabetic population has tw o and one half times the readmission rate than the non-diabetic population. For chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COP D) the diabetic population's readmission rate is double that of the non-diabetic popu lation. The table below provides the rates for other top diagnoses. Dr. Wilson notes that this level of granular data illustrates that we n eed to evaluate the diabetic population and see what we might have to do differently or separately. Mr. Aviles inquired as to how transparent is CMS about the algorithm they use for risk adjustment. Dr. Wilson responded that no , CMS doesn't share their algorithm, only the information on the principl es they have taken into account and the statistical referenc e of the external agency that is doing this for them to give us the confidence that it is a credible process. We cannot replicate the data so I c annot tell you how is diabetes weighted, but I can tell you that homelessness is not weighted, nor ethnicity. Dr. Wilson believes that the alg orithm that CMS uses is not particularly sensitive to the population we serv e, but generalizations that have to pertain to the whole countr y. xxvi ED Dash Board Presenting to the Committee was Dr. Ross Wilson, Senior Vice President, Corporate Chief Medical Officer. The Clinical Information Systems division led the design, build and implementation of documentation screens and whiteboard func tionality in the Emergency Departments (EDs) of ten acute care hospitals across HHC as part of pre-ICIS work and to help resolve disparate u se of data in the EDs. The Clinical Information Systems team engaged numerous stakeholders within central office and within each acute care hospital across HHC in 2011 to comp lete the ICIS: ED project. The project transformed hospitals that relied on a patient flow driven by paper charts to one where patients can be electronica lly tracked via real-time updates triggered by electronic clinical documentation. There are currently three ED Dashboards that are live in 10 a cute care hospitals and one dashboard that is not yet live with all users. The Dashboard includes the following components. Volume and Throughput Metrics Dashboard: disp lays monthly volume & throughput performance Operational Dashboard: displays overall status of the ED in near-real time ED Trends Dashboard: displays historical trending information on the volume and throughput metrics Corporate Overview Dashboard: disp lays a snapshot of all HHC hospitals specific to wait times The benefits of the Dashboard include: Value to Patients: Patients can be tracked electronically via r eal-time updates to electronic clinical documentation to ensure the appropriate level of care is provided at the appropriate time. Value to Clinicians: Clinicians can assess the patient care demands placed on care teams in near-real time and assign new patie nts to the most available team. Value to Administration: Hospital administrators are able to use concrete data to identify bottlenecks in patient flow and base decisions such as modifying staffing levels to reduce long wait-times. Medical & Professional Affairs/Info rmation Technology Committee June 14, 2012 - As reported by Dr. Michael Stocker Chief Medical Officer Report: Ross Wilson, MD, Senior Vice President/Corporate Chief Medical Officer reported on the following initiatives: Annual Behavioral Health Planning Event On Thursday June 7, 2012 The Office of Behavioral Health held its Annual Planning Event entitled Innovate and Collaborate: Planning for Managed Behavioral Healthcare. During the program three Facility performance awards were given to Harlem Hospital Center for their improvement in HHC Behavioral Health (BH) key indicators, Nort h Central Bronx Hospital for their performing the highest in a set of psychiatric inpatient core measures and Queens Hospital Center fo r best in overall performance with the BH key indicators. The event had over 185 participants including executive, adm inistrative, and clinical staff and leaders. President Aviles set the stage for the need to plan for the changing healthcare environment which will include enrolling t hose with mental and substance use conditions into managed ca re. The range of speakers began from a macro level with drilling down into the provider and c onsumer changes in the care delivery syste m needed. The afternoon included an interactive discussion using the audience participation system so that all participants voices could be heard in designing our strategy in addressing managed care readiness. Written proceedings are available and all the presentations are on the Office of Behavioral Health website through the Intranet. Radiology Following discussions at the Quality Assurance Committee of the B oard, the Chiefs of Radiology have been working together with Central Office staff to implement a policy to provide attending level, final read (interpretation) of CT scans for all patients within 30 min, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. In addition, the attending that reads the study must be available for consultation with the treating phy sician should further discussion of the study be necessary. This will spr ead to include non-routine CXR and MRI. Coverage on nights, weekend s and holidays may be provided by the active members of the department currently on the medical staff or through the contracted services of an outside vendor, or re-rostering of current Affiliate staff. Current ly 8 hospitals have available real time, final reads and the remaining expect to have real time interpretations in the next two to three months. Clinical Council Chairs xxvii On Monday, June 4th the Chairmen and Chairwomen of the clinical councils met to review the strategic directions of HHC and discuss how their councils could contribute. Mr. Aviles opened the meeting wi th a summary of current challenges and opportunities. The resp onse was a very positive one, with agreement to help lead the quality and cost improvements of the triple aim. NYS Department of Health (NYSDOH) Award The Patient Safety Center of the NYSDOH awarded to HHC a grant covering the services of the internationally recognized experts in medication safety - The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (I SMP). That award will cover a conference to take place July 10th at Metropolitan hospital and will be attended by Directors of Pharmacy, Medical Directors and Chief Nursing Officers, Directors of Quality and Risk Managers. The speakers from ISMP will share their experience and expertise based on their national database of events wi th attendees, focusing on some of the most common medications associated with errors and adverse outcomes such as anticoagulants a nd narcotic analgesics. In addition, they will return on 3 additional days to each HHC Network for an on-site discussion of issue s of greatest interest to the attendees. One area of particular focus of the ISMP faculty will be to review and comment on the Root Cause An alysis process for medication errors at each network. NYS Hospital-Medical Home (H-MH) Demonstration Program Award HHC will be submitting an enterprise-wide application for the New York State Department of Health Hospital-Medical Home (H-MH) Demonstration Program . The H-MH Demonstration Program will make up to $250 million available over the next three years to NYS teaching hospitals to support transition of their outpatient trai ning sites to Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH). An initial July 2, 2012 application submission is followed by award notifications in August 2012. Successful applicants will then be required to submit a work-plan describing selected residency training enhancements, care integration initiatives, inpatient safety projects and performance me asures. If successful, HHC is estimated to receive approximately $28 million of the $102 million to be disbursed in the first year of the demonstration, based on a formula derived from Medicaid volume and number of prim ary care residents receiving training at our facilities. Cont inued funding will be dependent upon meeting certain milestones, including achieving Level 2 or 3 NCQA PCMH re-certification by Decem ber 2013. MetroPlus Health Plan, Inc. Dr. Arnold Saperstein, Executive Director, MetroPlu s Health Plan, Inc. presented to the Committee. Dr. Saperstein informed the Committee that the total plan enro llment as of May 25, 2012 was 433,003. Breakdown of plan enrollme nt by line of business is as follows: Medicaid 364,979 Child Health Plus 16,704 Family Health Plus 36,792 MetroPlus Gold 3,096 Partnership in Care (HIV/SNP) 5,778 Medicare 5,654 Dr. Saperstein informed the Committee that 5,788 members were added to the plan this month. This gain represents MetroPlus' lar gest addition of members for a one month period in 2012. Their largest growth was in Medicaid. Dr. Saperstein also provided the Committee with reports of member s disenrolled from MetroPlus due to transfer to other health plans, as well as a report of new members transferred to MetroPlus from other plans. This month, MetroPlus added 224 new enrollees in Medicare, with the largest growth in our Advantage (Dual- Eligible) product. The New York State Department of Health (SDOH) released utilization data for the Managed Care Pharmacy Carve-In that became effective on October 1, 2011. The data, a comparison of the three months before the carve-in and the most current three months post implementation, reveal that statewide, utilization is up and cost s are down. MetroPlus' cost in the three months prior to the i mplementation was $76.80 per member per month (PMPM). MetroPlus' costs for t he first three months of 2012 were $59.75 PMPM. Due to these decl ines in cost, seen also by other plans, the state's actuary, Merc er, has recommended significant decreases to the Pharmacy capitatio n. Essentially, the MRT cost savings has been realized for this benefit. The SDOH has provided a draft of the Phase 1 pharmacy rate change analysis. The total rate change for Medicaid in NYC was -7.1% . The total rate change for FHP in NYC was -11.5%. The release of th is data solidifies our initial analysis which found that MetroPlu s will receive approximately 3 million dollars less in pharmacy revenue per month, retroactive to April 1 st, 2012. xxviii The 2013 Medicare bids were due to CMS on June 4, 2012. Cost savings allowed us to add benefits in our Medicare Advantage (Dual ), Select (Dual) and Platinum (Straight Medicare) lines of busine ss. We were able to reduce co-payments and deductibles and includ e some value added benefits such as an over-the-counter non-prescription benef it card and a gym membership at NYC Parks & Recreation s ites. Unfortunately, MetroPlus' historical utiliz ation especially in pharmaceuticals was very high in our Medicare HIV/PIC Special Ne eds Plan (SNP). In addition, CMS reduced their risk intensity and their rates were dramatically reduced. Changes to the HIV SNP product were made to account for this reduction and include an increase in co-payments and reduction in some benefits. These changes affect the 3 00 members in their HIV/PIC SNP and may make this product more difficult to market and add membership in 2013. As Dr. Saperstein reported earlier this year , as of July 2, 2012, all Medicaid managed care plans will be required to cover den tal services for their enrollees. The MetroPlus dental implementation is going well. MetroPlus has contracted with Healthplex to administer dent al benefits for all their MetroPlus Medicaid and Medicaid SNP members. Also as of July 2, 2012, MetroPlus Family Health Plus, Child Health Plus, and Medicare Advantage members will have management of their dent al benefits transition from DentaQuest to Healthplex. Also part of Dr. Saperstein's report earlier this year, mandatory enrollment for Managed Long Term Care begins on July 2, 2012. The MetroPlus application is complete and they are eagerly awaiting the SDOH's response. MetroPlus has learned that the SDOH is mo ving slowly in awarding these new licenses but they are prepared to offer services as soon as their license is effective. MetroPlus is also in the process of meet ing with all network and facility leadership in regards to their strategic initiatives to grow the Medicare product. Dr. Saperstein will continue to keep the Committee updated on their progress.

The resolution was moved for the full Board of Directors considera tion. Inf ormation Item: Presenting to the Committee was Michael Keil, Director, IT Serv ice Management Office and Glenn Manjorin, IT Disaster Recovery/B usiness Continuity. They informed the Committee that the foundation for a Business Continuity program is comprised of several component s as outlined below: Establishing a Disaster Recovery (DR) testing methodology to apply repeatable procedures thr oughout all IT infrastructure. Identifying and preparing for the threats and vulnerabilities at our facilities. Availability Risk Analysis (ARA). Understanding the Operationally Critical Bu siness processes and the IT resources required. Business Impact Analysis (BIA). xxix Establishing a DR recovery prioritization chart with Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) & Recovery Point Objectives (RPO). Conducting periodic tests to ensure the quality of the program meets the needs of the organization. Availability Risk Assessment (ARA) reviews were completed HHC's 11 acute care facilities and its two data centers in October 20 11. ARAs are an on-site physical review of each facility with a focus of determining potential points of failure, identifying external threats due to forces of nature, mankind, etc, and identifying local Infrastructure th reats, highways, rail etc. Resu lts of the ARAs identified 248 r isks at the 11 hospitals and two data centers: seven (7) risks required capital investment - work is in progress to quantify the costs and pri oritization of projects will follow; of the 241 remaining risks, 56% are \\completed to date (134), 36% are to be completed by the end of calen dar year 2012 (87), and 8% are to be completed by the end of calendar year 2013 (20). All mitigation plans in place have been identified. A business impact analysis (BIA) was conduct ed of HHC's various business process flow (s). The BIA utiliz ed industry standards and SunGard comparative value model in which we identified and surv eyed SMEs from each process. A sampling approach representative and diverse to represent HHC process environment was used with a 41 % participation rate. The survey was developed and reviewed with in a workshop approach jointly by HHC and SunGard. The \"return to operat ions\" (RTO) was determined by several factors including fina ncial impact and current mitigation factors resulting in a minimized expos ure. The goals of the BIA process shows impacts over time o n HHC clinical and administrative processes, process recovery priorities, and technology recovery needs. They provided the Committee with a slide that demonstrated the businesses processes and the related hospital functions that were analyzed. The distribution of time-critical applications shows 30.5% of t he applications with an under 24 hour RTO; Original preliminary findings stated 44% which was higher than the norm. These final findings are more in line with industry standards . Tier One applications that need to RTO in less than four hours include: Bed Tracking - Teletrac; Whiteboar d; Allscripts Sunrise Record Manager / Telephone Systems; Ensemble; Openlink; Unity Patient Management & Scheduling; and Webterm. The Tier Two applications that need to RTO between four hours and 24 hours include examples such as: ACU Manager; Picis (Ingenix); - AGFA IMPAX; PACS - SECTRA; and OPUS ISM Pharmacy Management System. The findings of the BIA were: seventeen key business processes we re identified for sampling; received a survey response rate of 41%; over 100 Interviews held with multiple individuals/groups; 49 hospit al departments were represented; 131 systems/applications clearl y identified for RTO/RPO; and 80 applications were discovered that were not in the EITS management purview. Next steps for the Business Continuity Program's Disaster Recovery (DR) Program includes: solicitation has been awarded to AVAL UTION for the Enterprise Wide IT/BCP Program which is a consulting firm that will analyze data from the ARA and BIA projects; present to ARA prioritized plan to the HHC Capital Committee; Business Impact Anal ysis (BIA) - complete the recovery prioritization chart and validate recovery time & recovery point objectives through testing and make changes; continued testing on QuadraMed expanding to more interfaces, multiple domains, etc.; and continued DR planning with iCIS planning team for new EMR. SUBSIDIARY BOARD REPORT HHC Capital Corporation - May 24, 2012 As reported by Dr. Michael Stocker Summary of HHC Bond Issuances, Low Interest Rate Environment and HHC's Variable Rate vs. Fixed Rate Bond Allocation Ms. Linda DeHart, Assistant Vice President of the Debt Finance and Corporate Reimbursement indicated that the current par amoun t of bonds outstanding as of April 30, 2012 is $1.002 billion, the majority of which are fixed rate bonds. 17% of HHC's outstanding bonds are variable rate with a weekly re-set. HHC's Bond Counsel and Financial Advisor recommend that no more than 20% of HHC's portfoli o be variable rate. This has benefitted the Corporation as rates on the variable rate bonds have been at historic lows. 2010 HHC Health System Bond Construction Fund and Disbursement History Paulene Lok reported that of the approximate $200 million construction fund for the 2010 series bonds, $143.5 million remains u nspent as of May 1, 2012. Disbursements are at a slower pace when compared to previous bond issuances . Ms. Youssouf asked if the Board can see a list of projects and equipment which are to be funded with the bonds and a spending schedule. Mr. Pistone indicated that his o ffice would provide these items. xxx Financing Source of HHC's Capital Program and Average Debt Service Nini Mar presented a slide which showed that only 32% of HHC's capital program is financed with health systems bonds issued by the Corporation. Of the total par outstanding of $3.2 billion, $2. 2 billion represents bonds issued by the City of New York and the NYS Dormitory Authority. The average annual debt service, which includes principal and interest, is $250 million. New Business Ms. Zurack indicated that a new Operating Procedure (\"OP\") concerning the Corporation's Banking activities will be distributed to the Board for its review and welcomes any suggestions. One of the advantages of the new OP will allow the HHC Capital Corporation more f lexibility to finance its capital program on a \"just-in-time\" basis rat her than issuing bonds several years in advance of spend down; whic h incurs negative arbitrage, whereby bond interest expenses exc eeds interest earnings on construction funds. Ms. Zurack also informed the Board of the fact that Finance ha s been meeting with its senior underwriting banking firms to disc uss bond refunding opportunities given the current low interest rate envir onment. Preliminary analysis show potential present value sav ings of up to $17 million. The optimal time for the re-financing activity to occur is in late December to early January given that the HHC b onds targeted for refunding have a call date of February 15th. Based on recent di scussions with Mr. Bert Robles, Senior Vice President & CIO and Dr. Lou Capponi, Chief Medical Informatics Officer, HHC is likely to issu e new money bonds to fund the preliminary cost of acquiring a new medical records system concurrent with the re-financing. * * * * * End of Reports * * * * * ALAN D. AVILES HHC PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS JUNE 28,2012 SUPREME COURT DECISION ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE ACA This morning, the Supreme Court of the United States issued its long anticipated decision about the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Court -by a 5 to 4 margin --ruled that the ACA was constitutional. The liberal wing of the court --Associate Justices Elena Kagan, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen G. Breyer-- were joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. in upholding the law, including the individual mandate provision that virtually all Americans buy health insurance. Importantly, the majority ruled that the provision was constitutional under the taxing power granted to Congress. They reasoned that the financial penalty for an individual not procuring health insurance was considered a tax. Notably, there were not enough votes--only 4-to validate the individual mandate under the constitution's commerce clause, which has historically been the preferred vehicle for expanding federal power. It should be noted that the court did narrow the reach of an ACA provision that required states to comply with new eligibility requirements for Medicaid or risk losing their Medicaid federal funding. The Court held that the provision is constitutional as long as states would only lose new Medicaid funds if they didn't comply with the new requirements, rather than lose the funding for their existing programs. To quote Chief Justice Roberts: \"What Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.\" It should be highlighted that Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who is often the swing vote on the Court, sided with the conservative wing of Associate Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Anthony Alita, Jr. in voting to invalidate the entire ACA. In New York State, an estimated 90,000 people-- childless adults with incomes between 100% and 133% of federal poverty level--will be eligible for Medicaid as a result of the ACA mandated Medicaid expansion starting in 2014. In addition, an estimated 160,000 young adults in the state already have insurance as a result of the ACA requirement that Health plans allow parents to keep their children under age 26 without job-based coverage on their family coverage. An estimated total of 1.2 million New Yorkers will gain health insurance coverage as a result of the ACA, when fully implemented. HHC MEETS GAP-CLOSING TARGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012 In Fiscal Year 2012, HHC's Restructuring and Cost Containment initiatives achieved a total annual savings of over $480 million from our baseline, which exceeded our target for the current fiscal year. In fact, these programs have netted HHC over one billion dollars in 1 savings over the last three years. In Fiscal Year 2013, we are projecting another $294 million in gap-closing activities through a combination of Restructuring, Cost Containment and State and Federal Actions. Although achieving this coming fiscal year's gap-closing targets will be extremely challenging, our senior leadership team is committed to keeping HHC's financial plan on course. HHC HOSPITALS MEET STAGE 1 CRITERIA FOR 90 DAY PERIOD TO QUALIFY FOR ENHANCED FEDERAL FUNDING At this time HHC has hit a major milestone in our ongoing use of Health Information Technology to improve patient care and outcomes. All HHC hospitals have now successfully completed the attestation process for Meaningful Use of Electronic Health Records by meeting the Stage 1 criteria for 90 consecutive days. As a result, HHC has already begun to receive enhanced federal funding and will eventually receive approximately $120 million in incentive monies under the hospital program and another $70 million under the Eligible Provider Category. When the meaningful use regulations were released, HHC facilities were already positioning themselves to meet the mandates of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Meaningful Use program. However, there were many additional steps to be completed, including 24 major software upgrades and significant changes in clinical documentation and workflow. Successful achievement of Stage 1 is a significant milestone. It represents the outstanding collaboration between our clinical staffs, Finance, and Enterprise Information Technology Services who have worked together to make this a reality. HHC's success in achieving meaningful use further emphasizes the importance of a close working relationship between information technology and the business units of our healthcare organization. The designation of Meaningful Use reflects HHC's continued commitment to enhance patient safety and the quality of care. HHC will maintain meaningful use measures under Stage 1 for the next 18 months and is actively looking ahead to meet the Stage 2 requirements in the latter part of 2013. $8.8 MILLION STATE HEAL GRANTS WILL SUPPORT EXPANSION OF AMBULATORY CARE SERVICES FOR THREE HHC FACILITIES On June 15th, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced that HHC will receive $8.8 million in healthcare grants from New York State to expand ambulatory care services in dentistry, geriatrics, psychiatry and ophthalmology at three hospitals. The grants will fund projects to renovate and expand dental and oral surgery clinics at Harlem Hospital in Manhattan; geriatric and psychiatric clinics at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx: and ophthalmology and dental practices at Woodhull Hospital in Brooklyn, including the addition of a pediatric dentistry service. The funding is part of $301.1 million in grants made available through New York State's Health Care Efficiency and Affordability Law (HEAL NY). The HEAL NY grants will help 40 2 hospitals and nursing homes across the state improve primary and community-based care, eliminate excess bed capacity, and reduce over-reliance on inpatient care in hospitals and nursing homes. HHC COLLABORATES WITH ORASURE TO OPEN TRADING AT NASDAQ IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL AIDS TESTING DAY As part of National HIV Testing Day on yesterday morning, June 27, HHC Senior Vice President LaRay Brown joined Douglas A. Michels, President and CEO of OraSure, maker of the rapid HIV test used most often in our facilities, and Frank J. Oldham Jr., President and CEO of the National Association of People with AIDS at the opening bell of the NASDAQ Marketsite in Times Square. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those who do not know they are HIV positive are unknowingly responsible for up to 70 percent of the 50,000 new HIV infections that occur each year. HIV Testing Day is a national campaign to encourage testing for HIV and promote the benefits of knowing one's HIV status. HHC has tested more than 1.12 million New Yorkers for HIV since 2005, the year the public hospitals and health centers began offering HIV screening as a routine part of medical care for patients ages 13 to 64. In seven years, HHC has diagnosed 11,490 HIV positive individuals. Ninety percent of those who test positive are linked to care within 90 days, improving their health and the health of the community. LEADER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM LAUNCHED TO SUPPORT AND ENHANCE HHC'S INVALUABLE WORKFORCE On June 13th, the kick-off to the 2012 Corporate-Wide Leader Development Program was held at Metropolitan Hospital in Draper Hall. Over 160 senior HHC leaders participated in the half-day workshop where the Program was introduced. The Leader Development Program is a primary component of our multi-year Workforce Development Strategic Plan. The Program will bring 125 high-potential middle managers through five full-day learning intensives conducted by the Advisory Board Company. Thirty-six senior managers have been trained to coach the program participants between workshops and will also attend the five intensives. Managers were nominated for the program by their facility senior executives. As you know, this year, under the leadership of Senior Vice President Caroline Jacobs, we have begun to implement a comprehensive workforce development plan to better support our employees who want to acquire more skills relevant to a fast-changing healthcare environment and to help build leadership skills at every level of our organization. Through this and other programs, we will foster and support continuous learning, reward innovation and promote and sustain a culture of teamwork, mutual respect, and accountability. 3 The leader development learning intensives begin on July 10 and end in March 2013. Each intensive will focus on a different aspect of leadership. Topics include: Management Intensive, Instilling Accountability, Facilitating Effective Teamwork, Problem Solving and Critical Thinking, and Impact Through Influence. Workshops on Breakthrough, HHC's performance improvement system, and BudgeVFinance for Managers will also be required. The coaches will help the participants apply the principles they've learned between sessions. A second cohort of 125 managers will be enrolled into the program in spring 2013. CIRISEIU AND 1199 SEIU COLLABORATES WITH HHC IN MEDICATION SAFETY GRAND ROUNDS On June 5th, the HHC Labor-Management Patient Safety Committee comprised of HHC, CIRISEIU, and 1199 SEIU, held the first of six Medication Safety Multi-Disciplinary Grand Rounds at Jacobi Medical Center. The Grand Rounds Improving Medication Safety Through Effective Teamwork and Communication was supported by a Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) grant. Presenters included Mei Kong, RN, AVP for Patient and Employee Safety; Dr. Abdul Mondul, Associate Medical Director and Patient Safety Officer, Lincoln Hospital; Dr. Nelly Pakh, member of 1199; and Dr. Marian Irizarry, second year pharmacy Resident and member of CIRISEIU. Program objectives included: understanding the impact of medication errors, particularly those involving opioids for the effective management of pain; learning tools for empowering all members of the team to become actively involved in preventing medication errors; identifying ways to engage patients and families in medication management and safety; and integrating teamwork concepts, knowledge, skills and attitudes, as taught in the TeamSTEPPS program, to improve patient safety. Over 120 participants, including attending physicians, residents, nurses, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, and administrators attended the session. Every participant received and learned how to use, our new Pain Management Guide. The Grand Rounds will be replicated at Bellevue, Coney Island, Harlem, Lincoln, and Metropolitan hospitals over the next three months. ANNUAL HHC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONFERENCE HELD On Thursday June 7th, the Office of Behavioral Health held its annual event entitled Innovate and Collaborate: Planning for Managed Behavioral Hea/thcare. During the program Facility Performance awards were given to Harlem Hospital for improvement in HHC Behavioral Health Key Indicators, North Central Bronx Hospital for performing the highest in a set of Psychiatric Inpatient Core Measures and Queens Hospital Center for best in overall performance with the Key Indicators. The event had over 185 participants including executive, administrative, and clinical staff and leaders. 4 Our speakers, including Harvard Professor David Cutler--a healthcare advisor to Presidents Clinton and Obama --addressed the need to plan for the changing healthcare environment which will include enrolling those with mental and substance use conditions into a patient-centered comprehensive managed care model of service delivery. The afternoon discussion about addressing managed care readiness included audience participation, allowing many voices to be heard as we design our strategy. All the presentations are a~ailable to HHC staff on the Office of Behavioral Health website through the Intranet. PATIENT-CENTERED MEDICAL HOME LEARNING SESSION On May 30, the Office of Ambulatory Care Transformation sponsored HHC's PCMH Implementation Journey Year 1 -A Learning Session at Jacobi's Conference Center. More than 175 participants across the Corporation who are actively involved in enhancing primary care services and transforming facility practices into medical homes attended the session. I welcomed the audience and outlined HHC's strategic goals, including the redesign of ambulatory care with the implementation of Patient Centered Medical Homes and Health Home Programs as building blocks towards establishing and achieving designation for an HHC Accountable Care Organization. Dr. Ross Wilson, Senior Vice President for Quality, gave the key note address, anchoring the platform for ambulatory care transformation to the triple aim: better care for our patients, better health outcomes for our communities, and both at lower costs. A comprehensive plan for communicating the PCMH initiative at HHC was launched at the session by Joe Schick, Executive Director of the Office of Special Projects, who introduced a short video reflecting some of the innovative strategies being developed to engage our workforce and spread the excitement about the PCMH program's benefits for our patients. The session also featured HHC best practices. Dr. Debra Brennessel, Ambulatory Care Director, presented Queens Hospital Center's approach to collaborative care plan development and Theresa Watson, Assistant Director Ambulatory Care, presented Harlem Hospital's approach to performance improvement at the PCMH team level. Workshops and table top exercises followed to spread some of the best practices shared through these presentations. The session was capped off by an overview of HHC's application development strategy for meeting the new and more stringent NCQA standards in order to sustain HHC's PCMH Level 3 certification going forward. HHC HEALTH HOME PROGRAM PLANNING SOFT -LAUNCH HHC's Health Home program will commence with a soft launch in Brooklyn and Bronx in mid-July. HHC has selected a group of 200 patients with complex healthcare needs to whom we will reach out, with the goal of enrolling as many as possible within a month. These patients were selected for a variety of characteristics, including existing connections 5 to HHC physicians or departments, risk scores, and managed care affiliations. The goals of the launch are to: Test the Health Home care pathways that have been developed across the sites Test the forms and paperwork processes that have been designed for the program Gain insight into the requirements of patients with various risk scores Set baseline goals for outreach and enrollment targets Analyze and refine processes based on front-line staff and managerial feedback Outreach and engagement will initially be conducted by staff at Woodhull, Kings County and Lincoln, who are currently working on COBRA programs as community follow-up workers. These staff members will receive training at the beginning of July to orient them to the new forms and outreach processes. MetroPius will begin the outreach by mailing out initial welcome letters to the 200 patients. A toll-free line, operated by MetroPius, has been set up to be used by Health Home patients 24/7, to reach a care coordinator at all times. This line will allow staff to potentially divert unnecessary hospitalizations and ED visits, and redirect patients to more appropriate forms of care. The Manhattan/Queens Health Homes are scheduled to have a soft launch beginning in August, which will follow a similar timeline. Existing COBRA, ClOP and TCM patients are expected to transition to the Health Home beginning in mid-September, with all patients being converted by December. Contracts have not yet been signed with our prospective community-based organizations partners, so all patients who are engaged and enrolled during the soft launch will receive their care coordination services at an HHC Health Home, starting with those sites where COBRA and ClOP staff are already based. NOTICE OF INTENT FILED TO SEEK ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION CERTIFICATION FOR HHC HHC has submitted a letter of intent to CMS to participate in the Medicare Shared Savings Plan for accountable care. The final application is due by the end of August, with a proposed start date of January 1, 2013, if successful. The first meeting of the Board of Directors of HHC ACO Inc, a newly formed subsidiary of HHC, occurred on June 26 at which time the Board passed a series of resolutions to facilitate the implementation of our ACO, including proceeding with the application to CMS. RHIO POISED TO ENTER NEW AGREEMENT WITH NYeC Several NYS regional health information organizations (RHIOs ), including the lnterboro RHIO of which HHC is a member, are collaborating with the New York eHealth Collaborative (NYeC) and New York State Department of Health on the development and implementation of statewide health information exchange (HIE) services. To facilitate this development, NYeC has provided the opportunity for RHIOs to transfer their existing HIE software infrastructure to NYeC which will absorb the cost of further standardized development of the software applications. 6 The standardization and consolidation of the technical infrastructure for the existing downstate RHIOs offers an opportunity to eliminate redundant technology and reduce the total cost of supporting a common HIE infrastructure. The health information exchange goals of the lnterboro RHIO and NYeC are well aligned with HHC's goals of building robust care management/care coordination capabilities across care settings both within the HHC network and with external partners. Currently, the lnterboro RHIO and NYeC are in the final stages of completing a Transition Services Agreement, which will initiate the first phase of lnterboro's shift to the shared technology model. Both parties expect the agreement to be signed shortly. FEDERAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT On Tuesday, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation that would extend for five years authority for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to assess user fees on prescription drugs and medical devices. Last week, the House passed the bill by a voice vote. President Obama is expected to sign the bill. Importantly for HHC and the nation's hospitals, the package includes provisions aimed at mitigating prescription drug shortages. The bill will require drug manufacturers to provide FDA with early notification of discontinuations or other situations that could lead to potential shortages, and will expedite FDA approval of manufacturing changes that would help prevent or mitigate shortages. It also includes improved public record keeping of drug shortage lists and requires the FDA to issue updated guidance on repackaging, which could modify current practices to allow hospital systems to share shortage drugs among facilities. The pharmaceutical industry backed the legislation which includes accelerated approval provisions. The bill also includes a provision to extend market exclusivity on some new antibiotics by an extra five years. Manufacturers had sought preferred status for antibiotics to help spur new research and development efforts. ACTION NOT TAKEN BY NY STATE LEGISLATURE ON INDIGENT CARE FUNDING REFORM The State Legislature concluded their session last week without taking action to change how New York State distributes Indigent Care funds to hospitals. In order to conform with Federal changes made in the Affordable Care Act, New York must remove bad debt from the equation and direct more of these funds to high Medicaid hospitals when calculating a hospital's indigent care funding, or the State risks larger than estimated cuts to Disproportionate Share Hospital funding. Draft legislation was shared with the Legislature in the waning days of the session but it was deemed that there was not adequate time to review the proposal before the scheduled close of session. We estimate that HHC could lose approximately $2.3 billion between FFY 2104 and FFY 2021 due to reductions in DSH funding. These cuts could be substantially larger if New York State does not act to change the formula before the cuts are scheduled to begin in October 2013. 7 NURSE MIDWIFE AT GOUVERNEUR PLAYS LEADING ROLE IN UN MISSION TO IMPROVE MATERNITY CARE IN CHINA Dewan Duan, a Certified Midwife at Gouverneur Healthcare, is now in China as part of a United Nations program to reduce maternal death and disability rates through increased use of certified midwives. Ms. Duan has devoted her career to improving the maternal health of low-income women in China and those who are recent immigrants seen at Gouverneur in Lower Manhattan. Dewan Duan, a Certified Midwife with a Master of Public Health degree from Columbia University, also earned her medical degree and Ph.D. in China and has been working with the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) H4+ program to improve maternal health in countries with high maternal mortality. The UNFPA China and Chinese Maternal and Child Health Association have launched a pilot program in Hunan province that incorporates the formal inclusion of a midwifery curriculum and certification in medical education systems that Ms. Duan recommended. At the same time, the program will promote natural delivery in selected hospitals by working with health providers and clients. Ms. Duan is helping to develop a midwifery education curriculum for China to strengthen China's capacity to train skilled healthcare professionals. TWENTY HHC DOCTORS RECOGNIZED IN NEW YORK MAGAZINE'S BEST DOCTORS ISSUE The Best Doctors 2012 edition of New York Magazine this month includes twenty doctors from HHC Hospitals including Bellevue, Elmhurst, Harlem, Jacobi, Kings County and Queens Hospital. These outstanding physicians practice everything from cardiac and pediatric surgery to child and adolescent psychiatry. It's really terrific to have some of our physicians receive this kind of recognition. We also recognize that they are just a small sample of the many, many more talented and outstanding physicians at HHC who are leading change, and working to provide quality and compassionate care to our patients every day. I know the Board joins me in congratulating all those recognized on this list.

Margaret Kemeny, Surgery, Queens Hospital Center RESOLUTION TO NAME NEW HHC FACILITY AFTER HENRY 11HANK\" CARTER On today's agenda, you will hear a resolution, which I will ask Lynda Curtis to read as Senior Vice President of the South Manhattan network, regarding the naming of the HHC facility that will rise on the site of the former North General Hospital in Harlem in honor of HHC's good friend and longtime benefactor Hank Carter. Pending the board's approval, the new HHC facility will be named the Henry J. Carter Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility. The new facility, about which this board has often heard, will become home for many current residents of Goldwater Memorial Hospital, which itself is part of the city's economic development master plan and will be reconceived as a Cornell University-led high-tech research center. Relocating Goldwater to the modernized new site in Harlem will bring several distinct benefits, but none will be more positive for residents than the ongoing involvement and support provided by Hank Carter, whose gifts and donations to Coler-Goldwater over the past 39 years have resulted in a computer lab, a rehabilitation gymnasium, assistive and mobility equipment, specially outfitted buses and thousands of state-of-the-art wheelchairs, all of which have provided our residents with greater independence, greater comfort, and the opportunity to learn and grow. The value of Hank's generosity exceeds $25 million, but for residents and staff the greater gifts are the constant and unwavering devotion of Mr. Carter and the opportunity afforded to Jive life more fully, and those, of course, are priceless. HHC has no greater friend than Hank Carter and Wheelchair Charities, Inc., Hank's philanthropic organization, which will celebrate its 40th birthday next May. As we plan our move to the new facility, the Community Advisory Board, the Medical Board of Corer\u00ad Goldwater, and the facility's staff have all fully endorsed the naming. We could not honor a more fitting and a more beloved individual than Hank Carter, and I ask the Board to join me in recognizing his contributions through approval of this resolution. 9 HHC IN NEWS HIGHLIGHTS Broadcast C-sections and Infante, Gouverneur, 6/20/12 Hospital, WCBS -TV, 6/21/12 Heatwave, 41-TV, 6/20/12 Nurse Jacobi and Kings County, News 12 Brooklyn -TV, 6/21/12 Patient says thank you to EMS and Lincoln Hospital, Jose Polanco, RN, News 12 Bronx\u00ad TV, 6/13/12 Palliative Care Certification, Dr. Abdul Mondul, Lincoln Hospital, News 12 Bronx -TV, 5/30/12 Teaching Patients to Speak Up For Themselves, Mei Kong, HHC, Hospitals & Health Networks (Video), 5/30/12 Print and Online Gouverneur midwife going to China as part of U.N. program From Chinatown to China, Dewan Duan, CNM, Gouverneur and Bellevue, Crain's Health Pulse, OB/GYN service, Dewan CNM, Gouverneur and Bellevue, The Epoch Times, 6/8/12 Gouverneur Health Executive Director promoting OB/GYN service, Dewan Duan, CNM, Gouverneur and Bellevue, Sing Tao Daily, 6/8/12 (Also covered in Sino Television, NTD Television, World Journal, China Press, Ming Pao Daily, and in a dozen Chinese media including Sina News and Sohu.)

Executive Summary Proposed Contract with Atlantic Dialysis Management Services, LLC We are proposing to enter into a contract with Atlantic Dialysis Management Services, LLC (ADMS) to provide all nursing services, supplies, equipment and maintenance of equipment required for the provision of dialysis services in the following facilities: Coney Island Hospital, Harlem Hospital Center, Jacobi Medical Center, Kings County Hospital Center, Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, Metropolitan Hospital Center, North Central Bronx Hospital, Queens Hospital Center, and Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center. Currently Bellevue Hospital Center and Elmhurst Hospital Center have active dialysis contracts. Upon expiration a thorough review will be conducted which may lead to them being added to the contract A Negotiated Acquisition (''NA\") was issued on October 3, 2011, in accordance with the Corporation's operating procedures and the submitted proposal was evaluated by a selection committee and rated using criteria specified in the NA. The selection committee recommended that Atlantic Dialysis Management Services, LLC be awarded the contract. ADMS wilJ assign the proposed contract to an entity or entities licensed under Article 28 of the New York Public Health Law or another entity legally entitled to engage doctors, nurses and other medical professionals provided that such entity(ies) are affiliates of ADMS and that the Corporation receives satisfactory assurances that the financial strength of ADMS will continue to stand behind the assigned entity(ies). The contract shall be for a period of five years with one, four-year option to renew exercisable solely by the Corporation, in an amount not to exceed $83 million for the entire term of nine years. In addition, the resolution requests authorization for the President to make adjustments to the contract amounts, providing such adjustments are consistent with the Corporation's financial plan, professional standards of care and equal employment opportunity policy. These funds will be utilized to provide payment to the vendor for the acute dialysis treatments and for those HHC patients requiring chronic dialysis who are not eligible for any form of insurance. New patients requiring dialysis will be accepted to ADMS' program upon discharge from acute care, regardless of their ability to pay. HHC will reimburse the vendor for those patients who are found to not be eligible for any insurance after all efforts have been exhausted. The vendor will assume all costs of the provision of dialysis services. The vendor will purchase existing capital equipment at its current depreciated value and will provide and maintain all equipment needed for patient care. The savings over the life of the contract, inclusive of the costs listed above, are projected to exceed $146 million. When a facility's medical staff determines that urgent or emergency treatment is required, ADMS will provide such treatment within agreed upon response parameters. The vendor will be responsible for all regulatory and quality standards as required by CMS and will provide data regularly to the Corporation for quality and performance improvement. Currently Newtown Dialysis d/b/a/ Broadway Dialysis (owned by principals of ADMS) has a license agreement with Elmhurst Hospital Center and provides chronic dialysis services. This agreement was originally signed in 2005 and most recently renewed in 2010. Elmhurst Hospital Center and Newtown Dialysis are satisfied with their arrangement. Dialysis Outsourcing Financial Analysis Conclusion: Over a nine year period, the corporation would incur costs of up to $83 million to provide contracted dialysis services to chronic and acute patients at Coney Island, Harlem, Jacobi, Kings County, Lincoln, Metropolitan, North Central Bronx, Queens and Woodhull Hospitals. Over the same period, the Corporation would realize combined cost savings and rental income of $230 million for total net savings of $147 million. In addition to contracting out existing services, the proposal includes the creation of a new chronic service at North Central Bronx Hospital to serve referrals from the North Bronx Network. Assumptions A cost-benefit analysis for contracting out dialysis services at nine HHC hospitals was conducted using Institutional Cost Report (ICR) data for HHC Fiscal Year 2010, which is the most recently completed ICR. Total costs at the nine facilities were $47.9 million, of which $14.4 million are fixed costs that the facilities would continue to bear. The facilities' FY 2010 revenue for outpatient dialysis, adjusted to reflect a recent increase in Medicaid rates, was $9.6 million, resulting in a Total Net Cost of $38.3 million, and Net Variable Costs of $23.9 million, without considering revenue associated with inpatient treatments. Payment for inpatient dialysis treatments is included in the per case DRG reimbursement rates; therefore in this analysis there is no revenue loss associated with contracting out inpatient dialysis services. There is however, an additional cost to pay a vendor to provide the inpatient treatments. Contract costs for inpatient treatments are estimated using rates negotiated with the vendor. Acute Treatment Type Routine Bedside Off Hours Average Blended Rate Year 1 Rate $412.50 $434.50 $467.50 $421.96 Est. Percentage of Workload 72% 18% 10% In addition, in order to ensure continuing access to care for all patients, the analysis assumes that HHC will pay the vendor to provide outpatient treatments to patients who cannot be enrolled in any insurance program. As a worst case scenario, the outpatient \"uninsurable\" population is estimated at 15 percent of patients. Vendor payments for outpatient treatments are estimated using a flat rate of $235.00 negotiated with the vendor. Projected Vendor Payments (current dollars) Service Inpatient Total Outpatient Current Chronic Services Projected North Bronx Total Outpatient Outpatient Uninsured (15%) Total Treatments 16,335 43,267 million $1.9 million $8.8 million Rates will be inflated annually by the inflation trend factor applied to NYS Medicaid rates. For this analysis the trend factor is very conservatively assumed to be 3% per year. HHC savings will be offset by retaining staff currently employed to provide dialysis services at the nine facilities until they attrit out or are redeployed to existing vacancies. The nine facilities employ a total of 146 FTES. Approximately 20 percent are in Tech titles-the titles primarily used by most vendors- and the balance are predominately nurses. The vendor is projected to hire SO percent of the Techs and 5 percent of the nurses and other staff during each implementation phase. Those staff not hired by the vendor are assumed to attrit out over the three years following implementation at their facility. Projected Attrition/ Title Current FTEs Vendor Hires RedeQio~ment Tech 31.5 14.0 17.5 Nurse 96.0 5.0 91.0 Other 18.5 0.0 18.5 Total 146.0 19.0 127.0 It is anticipated that the vendor will lease space for outpatient dialysis services at each of the four facilities currently offering chronic dialysis and at NCB for the new North Bronx Chronic Service. Projected rental income is based on a market rate appraisal and negotiations with the vendor. (current dollars) Square Market Total Rental Facilit~ Footage Rate Rent Income Metropolitan 5,015 $50.00 million Total $1.7 million * All costs and revenues, excluding rental income, are assumed to inflate by 3% per year. ** This analysis does not include any income associated with the potential lease or sale of existing HHC dialysis equipment to the vendor or any other party.

Dialysis Outsourcing Financial Analysis Conclusion: Over a nine year period, the corporation would incur costs of up to $83 million to provide contracted dialysis services to chronic and acute patients at Coney Island, Harlem, Jacobi, Kings County, lincoln, Metropolitan, North Central Bronx, Queens and Woodhull Hospitals. Over the same period, the Corporation would realize combined cost savings and rental income of $230 million for total net savings of $147 million. In addition to contracting out existing services, the proposal includes the creation of a new chronic service at North Central Bronx Hospital to serve referrals from the North Bronx Network. Assumptions A cost-benefit analysis for contracting out dialysis services at nine HHC hospitals was conducted using Institutional Cost Report (ICR) data for HHC Fiscal Year 2010, which is the most recently completed ICR. Total costs at the nine facilities were $47.9 million, of which $14.4 million are fixed costs that the facilities would continue to bear. The facilities' FY 2010 revenue for outpatient dialysis, adjusted to reflect a recent increase in Medicaid rates, was $9.6 million, resulting in a Total Net Cost of $38.3 million, and Net Variable Costs of $23.9 million, without considering revenue associated with inpatient treatments. Payment for inpatient dialysis treatments is included in the per case ORG reimbursement rates; therefore in this analysis there is no revenue loss associated with contracting out inpatient dialysis services. There is however, an additional cost to pay a vendor to provide the inpatient treatments. Contract costs for inpatient treatments are estimated using rates negotiated with the vendor. Acute Treatment Type Routine Bedside Off Hours Average Blended Rate Year 1 Rate $412.50 $434.50 $467.50 $421.96 Est. Percentage of Workload 72% 18% 10% In addition, in order to ensure continuing access to care for all patients, the analysis assumes that HHC will pay the vendor to provide outpatient treatments to patients who cannot be enrolled in any insurance program. As a worst case scenario, the outpatient \"uninsurable\" population is estimated at 15 percent of patients. Vendor payments for outpatient treatments are estimated using a flat rate of $235.00 negotiated with the vendor. Projected Vendor Payments (current dollars) Service Inpatient Total Outpatient Current Chronic Services Projected North Bronx Total Outpatient Outpatient Uninsured (15%) Total Treatments 16,335 43,267 7,488 $6.9 million $1.9 million $8.8 million Rates will be inflated annually by the inflation trend factor applied to NYS Medicaid rates. For this analysis the trend factor is very conservatively assumed to be 3% per year. HHC savings will be offset by retaining staff currently employed to provide dialysis services at the nine facilities until they attrit out or are redeployed to existing vacancies. The nine facilities employ a total of 146 FTES. Approximately 20 percent are in Tech titles -the titles primarily used by most vendors -and the balance are predominately nurses. The vendor is projected to hire SO percent of the Techs and 5 percent of the nurses and other staff during each implementation phase. Those staff not hired by the vendor are assumed to attrit out over the three years following implementation at their facility. Projected Attrition/ Title Current FTEs Vendor Hires RedeQioyment Tech 31.5 14.0 17.5 Nurse 96.0 5.0 91.0 Other 18.5 0.0 18.5 Total 146.0 19.0 127.0 It is anticipated that the vendor will lease space for outpatient dialysis services at each of the four facilities currently offering chronic dialysis and at NCB for the new North Bronx Chronic Service. Projected rental income is based on a market rate appraisal and negotiations with the vendor. (current dollars) Square Market Total Rental Facilit:ll Footage Rate Rent Income Metropolitan 5,015 $51.50 so.3 million Total $1.5 million * All costs and revenues, excluding rental income, are assumed to inflate by 3% per year. ** This analysis does not include any income associated with the potential lease or sale of existing HHC dialysis equipment to the vendor or any other party.

The evaluation is subject to the following assumptions: The hospital will soon open a 25 chair outpatient Renal Dialysis unit The square footage of the unit is approximately 9,260 Gross Internal (net useable) General office/retail space in the surrounding East Harlem community leases at a rent of approximately $55 per square foot through the Madison A venue retail corridor. The Renal Dialysis unit currently in the finishing stages of construction, is located within the Harlem Hospital complex, specifically within the hospital's new building. It will occupy space on the 41h floor. The Harlem Hospital complex is readily accessible by the number 2 and 3 subway lines at 1351h Street and Lenox Avenue and by bus routes running East/West and North/South through that intersection. There is no building parking but there are 2 public parking facilities nearby, as well as street parking. The proposed Renal Dialysis unit which will be completed summer/fall of2012 with occupancy 3rd to 4th quarter of2012 represents what we believe is a dialysis unit designed and built in accordance with all regulatory agency requirements and to a building standard consistent with new construction and within an institutional location. The unit will have the ability to treat and monitor up to 25 dialysis patients, on an outpatient basis, at a given time and will be further capable of accommodating the lengthy time periods required for each patient's care. While treating patients, the unit will also provide staff with opportunities to carry out administrative tasks. The unit will take advantage of the efficiencies of the hospital's electric, common areas, cleaning services, IT and telephone services etc. The unit as previously mentioned comprises 9,260 internal useable square feet. There is no common area mark up typical of commercial space leased outside of an institutional setting. It consists of 25 Renal Dialysis stations to receive patients on an outpatient basis inclusive of 2 isolation areas of a larger than typical size. There will be ample storage for both dry and wet Savitt Partners llC 530 Seventh Avenue. Hew York. Hew YoriiD018 Savitt Partners 2 supplies needed to operate the unit. However, storage will be housed in the main MLK building and not in the unit. The space is divided into 2 separate and distinct treatment modules. The 2 isolation areas are in one of the modules. There is a common reception and waiting area serving the entire space. The unit, while brand new, has not yet been equipped with furnishings, equipment, supplies, communication system, dialysis machines, tanks, etc, so its setup and to some degree its efficiency cannot yet be determined. The method of measurement used to calculate the available square footage within the institution gives us an accurate reading, leading to a truer measure of the useable square footage than in a traditional office space. A traditional office space generally suffers a Joss factor of 30% or greater, meaning that a 1 2,000 sf requirement necessitates approximately 1 7, 143 sf to achieve the same net square footage result. Space in medical offices found in this area typically is in or competes with retail/commercial space in residential buildings. Rents range from approximately $30 RSF for office locations to upwards of $60 RSF for spaces considered and used as retail. There is average to above average retail in the area, benefitting from the hospital's location and its population, keeping the retail pricing firm. The low end spectrum of the market should typically be in the older, un-renovated or minimally renovated office or residential buildings. They would typically not be built for medical but for general office use and not provide full building services. Such offices would generally be found on side street locations. However, the size of the unit being evaluated for this report is typically not found in these buildings due to size limitations. The high end spectrum of the market would be in the larger and recently renovated buildings providing full service amenities such as concierge service with 7 day, 24 hour access. Alternately, the spaces would be retail spaces leased to either retail users or non-retail users taking advantage of retail street presence and increased visibility. Medical offices in these buildings would be to code, be in good to excellent condition, with enhanced plumbing, electric and HV AC systems, and in many instances would also have substantial fixture improvements within the space (miJJwork, plumbing fixtures and cabinetry). These building spaces, while used for medical offices, would also be quite suitable for general office and specificaJJy retail purposes but for the specific build-out needed for medical. Most medical offices, in general, unless built within the last 6-7 years or recently renovated, will not meet current ADA or other municipal code requirements, and unless nothing but a cosmetic face lift is contemplated, would require structural changes, permits, filings, etc. to meet code. These proposed Renal Dialysis unit, however, is specific to the hospital's use as an outpatient dialysis unit, which makes it somewhat more difficult to compare to spaces found within the general community. In addition, there is little or no value placed on common areas so our evaluation only considers the space within the demised premises. Accordingly, we value the space at approx $35/sfnet of any services and any additional physical space add, to account for common area within the premises or common area needed for access to the premises. 530 SEVENTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10018 Sav111 Partners 3 Jn addition to the base rent of$35, which we previously described as net, you would add in approximately $3.50/sf for utility services but would credit $2.25/sf for cleaning services, since the tenant will be responsible for this, and as much as $5/sf for IT and telephone services depending on the level of sophistication provided. In addition to these services, the tenants occupying the spaces do not have to maintain service contracts or maintenance of AC, communica tions or office equipment etc. That can be value-added into the cost of the space as well. Accordingly, we value the space at a gross rent of approx $44sf with services provided, which would be consistent with general office tenants. It has been our experience that a build out of a Renal Dialysis unit, complete with the extensive plumbing, technical equipment, maintenance and regulatory agency compliance required to provide dialysis services equates to $350 per square foot. This figure would be broken down to approximately $250/sf for unit build out and approximately S 1 00/sf for FF&E (furniture, fixtures, and equipment). While this sum describes the build out costs for the intended usc, it also includes base building work perfonned to include, but not be limited to HV AC installation and equipment, electrical, plumbing and other building conditions that would be required and calculated in the total fit-out costs. On a I 0 year lease, fully amor1ized and with an interest rate factor on the money used for the build out, this comes to $40 per square foot. Coupled with a market rent of approximately $40 per square foot for the area, the result would be a rent of $80 per square foot for a built dialysis space that is operational and current to code. However, while the unit is new and has an anticipated occupancy several months away. it must be noted that significant design flaws exist that contribute to a less than ideal flow for this space as used for a dialysis unit. More importantly, the attraction to the space by an opermor is limited because of the inability to tre<ll the proper number of patients without a significant reworking of the space and the time lost to do so. Specifically, the unit has been built as two (2) separate operating sections and the unit's ultimate function requires add it ion a I construction costs to streamline its use. Alternately, the build out in its current configuration requires some duplicity in staffing. thereby increasing the unit\"s operating costs. The isolation room will be reduced to one and the extra space. we assume, will be reconfigured for additional chairs. We estimate the construction costs to reconfigure and/or complete the spaces to be at $30/sf FF&E will be provided for an paid for by the operator. Additionally, it has been detcm1ined that the prospective tenant will be responsible for the cost to complete the unit's construction and fully equip and furnish the unit. Accordingly , we believe the rent for this newly built outpatient dialysis unit is approximately $50 per square foot.

The evaluation is subject to the following assumptions: The hospital operates a 24 chair outpatient Renal Dialysis unit The square footage of the unit is approximately 8,970 Gross Internal (net useable) RSF General medical space in the surrounding Wingate/Crown Heights community leases at a rent of approximately $21 per square foot on average. The Renal Dialysis unit is located within the Kings County Hospital Center, which is readily accessible by the number 2 subway line at Winthrop Street and by bus routes running along Clarkson, New York, and Nostrand A venues. Building parking is limited and there is surface street parking available. The Renal Dialysis unit is located on the hospital's 6th floor. It consists of 17,940 gross useable square feet. It is divided equally between inpatient and outpatient services. For the purpose of this report only the outpatient portion and any common areas used for outpatient treatment are described. The outpatient portion of the unit comprises approximately 8,970 gross useable square feet. The central corridor that accesses the entire Renal Dialysis unit houses the entrance to both spaces and shares a common waiting room. There are staff lockers, an office, and phone alcove in the common area here but it could not be detennined who the users are. The outpatient portion consists of 24 dialysis stations (chairs), I private exam room, 1 staff locker room with toilet, 2 additional toilets, 3 doctor's offices, I private exam room and reception. There are also storage rooms. The outpatient unit is set up as 3 open units; 2 with six chairs each and the third with twelve chairs. The large unit has 2 nurse's stations with a smaller nurses/staff monitoring station in each of the others. This space was built with a proper design for outpatient dialysis services and is of the correct size to maximize a unit's efficiency. Suritl Porlners UC 530 Seoenlh Avenue. New Yorl. New YoriiDOIB Savill Partners 2 The adjacent but connected inpatient portion has larger storage areas and the water treatment room, pump room, and other private offices. It is assumed that some storage, the water treatment and pump rooms service both portions of the premises. The square footage for the space, therefore, must be adjusted to account for this by an estimated I ,000 square feet. HV AC appears to be provided by the main building systems. The method of measurement used to calculate the available square footage within the institution gives us an accurate reading, leading to a truer measure of the useable square footage than in a traditional office space. A traditional office space generally suffers a loss factor of 30% or greater, meaning that a 9,000 sf requirement necessitates approximately 12,800 sf to achieve the same net square footage result. Space in medical offices found in this area typically is in or competes with retail/commercial space in residential buildings. Rents range from approximately $19 RSF -$26 RSF. The low end spectrum of the market should typically be in the older, un-renovated or minimally renovated offices or residential buildings. They would typically have been converted to small spaces found on the ground floor of residential buildings and would not provide full building services. Such offices would generally be found on side street locations. However, the size of the unit being evaluated for this report is typically not found in these buildings due to size limitations and use. Renal Dialysis is considered invasive to building systems and accordingly is not always welcomed as a tenant. Tenants may also pay a premium to Landlord for the use. The high end spectrum of the market would be in the larger and recently renovated buildings providing more services. These spaces are more limited in this location. More commonly, the spaces would be retail spaces leased to either retail users or non-retail users taking advantage of retail street presence and increased visibility.

The added population and street traffic is a financial benefit most tenants of the space are willing to pay for. This dialysis unit, however, was developed and is specific to the hospital's use, as an outpatient facility which makes it somewhat more difficult to compare to spaces found within the general community. In addition, there is little or no value placed on common areas so our evaluation only considers the space within the demised premises. Accordingly, we value the space at approx $22/sf net of any services and any additional physical space add, to account for common area within the premises or common area needed for access to the premises. 530 SEVENTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10018 Savitt Partners 3 In addition to the base rent of $22, which we previously described as net, you would add in approximately $3.50/sffor utility services, as much as $5/sffor IT and telephone services depending on the level of sophistication provided, but would credit $2.25/sf for cleaning services since the tenant will be responsible for this.

Accordingly, we value the space at a gross rent of approx $27 /sf with services provided, which would be consistent with general office tenants found within the general community. It must be noted that the unit is I 0 years old and presents in an above average in condition. The infrastructure and equipment must be evaluated when determining this build out and FF&E component to establish an ultimate rental value. It has been our experience that a build out of a dialysis unit, complete with the extensive plumbing, technical equipment, maintenance and regulatory agency compliance required to provide dialysis services equates to $350 per square foot. This figure would be broken down to approximately $250/sf for the unit build out and approximately $1 00/sf for FF &E (furniture, fixtures, and equipment).

On a I 0 year lease, fully amortized and with an interest rate factor on the money used for the build out, this comes to $40 per square foot for a newly constructed and equipped space. Coupled with a market rent of approximately $50 per square foot for the area with services and utilities, the result would be a rent of$70 per square foot for a built dialysis space that is operational and current to code. It is important to note, however, that while this is a well functioning dialysis unit for outpatient use, it is also a I 0 year old installation with equipment of the same age. As such, the useful life of the installation has been significantly amortized and the equipment is in need ofupgrades, repair or replacement. Accounting for this, therefore, it would be proper to recognize that the value of this unit would be reduced by as much as $20 per square foot for any potential tenant or licensee, which would be charged with the obligation to upgrade, repair, replace and modernize both the space, equipment and infrastructure. Accordingly, we place the value of this unit at approximately $54 per square foot for the built dialysis unit in its current condition and configuration.

Michael Dubin Partner Savitt Partners LLC 530 SEVENTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10018 June 19,2012 Dion Wilson Director SAVITT PARTNERS Office of Facilities Development Real Estate NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation 346 Broadway, 12 West New York, NY 10013 Re: Appraisal of dialysis unit at Metropolitan Hospital Dear Dion, Pursuant to your request, on Wednesday, March 28, 2012, I visited the referenced property to evaluate the fair market value (FMV) rent of the newly built dialysis unit, based on the information that you provided to me, knowledge of area rental values and the condition of the premises. The evaluation is subject to the following assumptions: The hospital will soon open a 12 chair Renal Dialysis unit The square footage of the unit is approximately 5,015 Gross Internal (net useable) RSF General office/retail space in the surrounding community leases at a rent of approximately $70 per square foot through the Upper East Side corridor ofYork Avenue through Lexington A venue to 96th Street. The Renal Dialysis unit is located within the Metropolitan Hospital complex, which is readily accessible by the number 6 subway lines at 96th Street and Lexington A venue and by bus routes running East/West along 96th Street and North/South along First through Lexington Avenue. There is no building parking but there are public parking facilities nearby, as well as on street surface parking. The proposed dialysis unit represents what we believe is a dialysis unit efficiently designed and built in accordance with all regulatory agency requirements and to a building standard consistent with an institutional location. The unit will have the ability to treat and monitor up to 12 dialysis patients, on an outpatient basis, at a given time and will be further capable of accommodating the lengthy time periods required for each patient's care. While treating patients, the unit will also provide staff with opportunities to carry out administrative tasks. The unit will take advantage of the efficiencies of the hospital's electric, common areas, cleaning services, IT and telephone services etc provided. The 14th floor Renal Dialysis unit consists of 5,015 internal useable square feet. There is no common area mark up typical of commercial space which would be leased outside of an institutional setting. Savitt Partners ll[ 530 Seventh Avenue. Ntw Vorl. New York 10018 Savill Partners 2 The newly constructed unit consists of 12 dialysis stations, including one ( 1) isolation space. There are 3 restrooms -one staff, one patient, and one for the isolation room. Outside of the unit there is a family waiting area large enough to accommodate 8 visitors, that also contains a restroom for the visitors. The unit has a private exam room and one nurse's station currently set up with 7 chairs in this working area to monitor the patients. The unit is fully built, equipped with the new dialysis equipment in place, general equipment, furniture and phones. It has never been operational and is ready to receive its first outpatients. The unit benefits from its own, designated HV AC unit exclusive to the dialysis unit. The ceilings are finished to 8ft. There are floor drains throughout the space fitted into concrete floors that have been painted and textured. Besides the family waiting area there is an RO (reverse osmosis) water treatment room, a storage room of approximating I Ox 18 and an administrative office area, all located outside of the Renal Dialysis unit but included within the square footage measurements for this evaluation. The method of measurement used to calculate the available square footage within the institution gives us an accurate reading, leading to a truer measure of the useable square footage than in a traditional office space. A traditional office space generally suffers a loss factor of 30% or greater, meaning that a 5,000 sf requirement necessitates approximately 7,200 sf to achieve the same net square footage result. Space in medical offices found in this area typically is in or competes with retail/commercial space in residential buildings. Rents range from approximately $40 RSF for office locations to upwards of $90 RSF for spaces considered retail. The low end spectrum of the market should typically be in the older, un-renovated or minimally renovated office or residential buildings. They would typically not be built for medical but for general office use and not provide full building services. Such offices would generally be found on side street locations. However, the size of the unit being evaluated for this report is typically not found in these buildings due to size limitations and use. Renal Dialysis is considered invasive to building systems and accordingly are not always welcomed as Tenants. Tenants may also pay a premium to Landlord for the use. The high end spectrum of the market would be in the larger and recently renovated buildings providing full service amenities such as concierge service with 7 day, 24 hour access. Alternately, the spaces would be retail spaces leased to either retail users or non-retail users taking advantage of retail street presence and increased visibility. Medical offices in these buildings would be to code, be in good to excellent condition, with enhanced plumbing, electric and HV AC systems, and in many instances would also have substantial fixture improvements within the space (millwork, plumbing fixtures and cabinetry). These building spaces, while used for medical offices, would also be quite suitable for general office and specifically retail purposes but for the specific build-out needed for medical. Retail will garner higher rents. Most medical offices, in general, unless built within the last 6-7 years or recently renovated, will not meet current ADA or other municipal code requirements, and unless nothing but a cosmetic face lift is contemplated, would require structural changes, permits, filings, etc. to meet code. 530 SEVENTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10018 Savitt Partners 3 There is an interesting real estate dynamic, however for this location. Commercial spaces south out of 96th street along the First and Second A venue corridors benefit from the higher end of the described rental rates. Spaces north of 96th Street, in the same north-south corridor do not have the same concentration of retail or office space and have disproportionately lower rents due in part to the lack of foot traffic. Rents would fall by as much as 20% ($30-$70 respectively) This proposed dialysis unit, however, is specific to the hospital's use, as an outpatient facility which makes it somewhat more difficult to compare to spaces found within the general community. In addition, there is little or no value placed on common areas so our evaluation only considers the space within the demised premises. Accordingly, we value the space at approx $38/sf net of any services and any additional physical space add, to account for common area within the premises or common area needed for access to the premises. In addition to the base rent of$37.75, which we previously described as net, you would add in approximately $3 .50/sf for utility services, but would credit $2.25/sf for cleaning services since the tenant will be responsible for this, and as much as $5/sf for IT and telephone services depending on the level of sophistication provided. In addition to these services, the tenants occupying the spaces do not have to maintain service contracts or maintenance of AC, communications or office equipment etc. That can be value-added into the cost of the space as well. Accordingly, we value the space at a gross rent of approximately $44/sfwith services provided, which would be consistent with general office tenants found within the general community. It has been our experience that a build out of a dialysis unit, complete with the extensive plumbing, technical equipment, maintenance and regulatory agency compliance required to provide dialysis services equates to $350 per square foot. This figure would be broken down to approximately $250/sffor the unit build out and approximately $100/sffor FF&E (furniture, fixtures, and equipment). While this sum describes the build out costs for the intended use, it also includes base building work performed to include, but not be limited to HV AC installation and equipment, electrical, plumbing and other building conditions that would be required and calculated in the total fit-out costs. On a I 0 year lease, fully amortized and with an interest rate factor on the money used for the build out, this comes to $40 per square foot. Coupled with a market rent of approximately $44 per square foot for the area, the result would be a rent of $84 per square foot for a built dialysis space that is operational and current to code. However, while the unit is new, plumbed and equipped, it appears to have been designed improperly for its most efficient dialysis use. There are areas of the unit's build out and design that will cause the ultimate tenant or licensee to undertake additional construction costs or other overhead or operating costs that would not otherwise exist had the unit been built according to that user's plans. Specifically, most users expect an outpatient unit to house approximately 25 chairs for optimum efficiency. The limited size of this unit causes an operator to spread its costs over a smaller operation even though the staffing requirements remain fairly constant. Further, this unit is built without a central distribution for the acid and base materials, resulting in either additional construction retrofit or an additional personnel function. Finally, these deficiencies in size and design will have an impact on a prospective tenant's or licensee's interest in operating the unit. Accordingly, we will reduce the rental value by $30 per square foot, bringing the rental 530 SEVENTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10018 Savitt Partners 4 value to approximately $54 per square foot for a built dialysis unit equipped and current to code but with these shortcomings. It should be noted that if the prospective operator chose to reimburse HHC for the FF&E component, the rental value can be further reduced on a straight dollar per dollar basis. Further, we have been advised that the FF&E will be addressed separately. As such, the original cost of approximately $200,000.00 as amortized will be paid for by the prospective tenant and the rent shall be reduced accordingly. Therefore, on a 10 year amortization with 10% of the term for this equipment having been used, the cost of $180,000.00 divided by the square footage of 5,015 gross square feet further reduces the actual rental value by $4, bringing it to $50/sf.

The evaluation is subject to the following assumptions: The hospital will house a soon to be built outpatient Renal Dialysis unit The square footage of the unit is approximately 6,825 Gross Internal (net useable) RSF General medical space in the surrounding community leases at a rent of approximately $25 per square foot on average. Retail along Jerome A venue and East Gun Hill Road rents at approximately $60 per square foot on average. The proposed unit will be built and financed by the designated tenant/vendor. The Renal Dialysis unit is slated to be located on the 6th Floor within NCB. NCB is located ofT of East Gun Hill Road at 21 Olh Street. It is readily accessible by the number 4 and D subway lines. Building parking is limited and surface street parking is available. The size of the space should be able to treat and monitor up to 20 dialysis patients at a given time and is further capable of accommodating the lengthy time periods required for each patient's care. The actual number of chairs is still to be determined. While treating patients, the unit will also provide staff with opportunities to carry out administrative tasks. The unit will take advantage ofthe efficiencies of the hospital's electric, common areas, cleaning services, IT and telephone services etc. The method of measurement used to calculate the available square footage within the institution gives us an accurate reading, leading to a truer measure of the useable square footage than in a traditional office space.

New Yarl10018 Sifji\u00ab Partners 2 offices or residential buildings. They would typically have been converted to small spaces found on the ground floor of residential buildings and would not provide full building services. Such offices would generally be found on side street locations. However, the size of the unit being evaluated for this report is typically not found in these buildings due to size limitations and use. Renal Dialysis is considered invasive to building systems and accordingly is not always welcomed as a Tenant. Tenants may also pay a premium to Landlord for the use. The high end spectrum of the market would be in the larger and recently renovated buildings providing more services. These spaces are more limited in this location. More commonly, the spaces would be retail spaces leased to either retail users or non-retail users taking advantage of retail street presence and increased visibility. Medical offices in these buildings would be to code, be in good to excellent condition, with enhanced plumbing, electric and HV AC systems, and in many instances would also have substantial fixture improvements within the space (millwork, plumbing fixtures and cabinetry). These building spaces, while used for medical offices, would also be quite suitable for general office and specifically retail purposes but for the specific build-out needed for medical. Retail will gamer higher rents. Most medical offices, in general, unless built within the last 6-7 years or recently renovated, will not meet current ADA or other municipal code requirements, and unless nothing but a cosmetic face lift is contemplated, would require structural changes, permits, filings, etc. to meet code. Retail Space in a hospital zone typically garners a rent premium based on its proximity to a hospital. The added population and street traffic is a financial benefit most tenants of the space are willing to pay for. The hospital competes with Montefiore Medical Center with one of its campuses located on an adjacent street. Much of the campus medical spaces are connected and leased to that institution or private practices that benefit from the later. Accordingly, there is little available office space. The area seems to be dotted with medical offices in ground floor spaces of local apartment buildings and ground floor units in private homes. In addition, there is little or no value placed on common areas so our evaluation only considers the space within the demised premises. Accordingly, we value the space at approx $28/sf net of any services and any additional physical space to account for common area within the premises or common area needed for access to the premises. In addition to the base rent of $28, which we previously described as net, you would add in approximately $3 .50/sf for utility services, $2.25/sf for cleaning services and as much as $5/sf for IT and telephone services depending on the level of sophistication provided. In addition to these services, the tenants occupying the spaces do not have to maintain service contracts or maintenance of AC, communications or office equipment etc. That can be value-added into the cost of the space as well. Accordingly, we value the space at a gross rent of approx $40/sfwith services provided, which would be consistent with general office tenants found within the general community. These additional costs can be adjusted based on actual services provided. For example, cleaning costs can be deducted if provided by tenant/vendor, as well as electric costs if metered or submetered directly. It has been our experience that a build out of a dialysis unit, complete with the extensive plumbing, technical equipment, maintenance and regulatory agency compliance required to provide dialysis services equates to $350 per square foot. This figure would be broken down to 530 SEVENTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10018 Sill ill Partners 3 approximately $250/sf for the unit build out and approximately $1 00/sf for FF&E (furniture, fixtures, and equipment).

May 23,2012 Mr. Dion Wilson Director SAVITT PARTNERS Office of Facilities Development, Real Estate NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation 346 Broadway, 12 West New York, NY 10013 Re: Fair Market Value/appraisal of Eyes & Optics within Gouverneur Healthcare Services Facility located at 227 Madison Street, New York, NY 10002 On behalf of NYC Health & Hospitals Corporation DeBl' Dion: Pursuant to your request, on Tuesday, May 22,2012, the referenced location was inspected in order to assess the Fair Market Value (FMV) of the designated retail space. This assessment is inclusive of the value of the tenant improvements and specified operating expenses such as utilities, housekeeping, security, service contracts, repairs and maintenance, etc. As the owner is designated as a not for profit (501C3) real estate taxes may not be applicable, however this expense will also be considered when evaluating the value of the space in order to provide a comprehensive FMV. This appraisal will assess the estimated value of the base rent inclusive of the tenant improvements and opet\u00b7ating expenses. This evaluation is subject to the following: The Eyes and Optics space is appropriately zoned for the use (retail) within the space. The premises Bl'e located within the medical facility on the ground floor. This evaluation is for the purpose of establishing the FMV to lease/license the referenced property and considers numerous factors including but not limited to location, market conditions, market area comparables, lease terms and conditions, as well as tenant improvements. There are two variables that must be considered in this evaluation which are in fact weighted greater than other variables. These unique factors are location and use. The location of the space provides the tenant with an immediate and \"captured' client base according to the facility operator. Eye wear prescriptions generated by the non-affiliated ophthalmology and optometry physicians within the medical facility generate 90% of the client base for this tenant. The community medical center also benefits by providing this amenity to the patients; the convenience of access to a retailer that can fill the prescription immediately. The proposed retail operation compliments the physician practices with an optical modality. The balance of the Eyes and Optics patient base comes from the existing customer referral and not walk-in street traffic. Sa~ll Plrtnara Parllters 2 It would be inappropriate and unjustifiable to evaluate the value of the referenced space as retail. Despite the obvious benefit of the readily available retail client base the space does not have the one most imp01tant value to be considered retail, street presence. Therefore the space must be assessed as commercial pt'Operty with a retail build out and operation. Our assessment of the value of the tenant improvement for an optical, retail operation within the hospital at this specific location would be that it is dramatically less than the cost for a typical store front optical store. The space is open (minimal walls or partitions) with extensive space for display cases, both free standing and mounted on the unit's walls. Another important factor is the value of the space for medical use. It is our experience that space within built medical facilities is valued at a premium simply due to the fact that it is a finite resource which is in demand. Allocation of medical space for ancillary use is a primary cause for concern for medical facility administrators. This is the case even when the organization can gamer a higher rent for the space. This assessment takes into consideration the value of this space for medical facility operations. It is apparent that proximity within the medical facility complex is attractive to this tenant and benefits the facility's patients as well. The pt\u00b7ovision of tenant services that are uncommon for retail facilities, i.e., 24-7 access, even if not utilized and the provision of full time services such as HV AC, repairs and maintenance, security, etc. must also be factored in this evaluation. However, when assessing the value the fact that the client base is limited to foot traffic within the medical facility impacts the success of the tenant. The tenant has no opportunity to promote their presence and the average pedestrian walking by the building would not be aware of this retail operation. The referenced medical space is located on the ground floor away from the main entrance of the medical center. When assessing the FMV for this space we took into consideration the referenced factors and used comparables for medical space, hospital space and retail space within the immediate mm\u00b7ket where available to establish benchmarks for market re11ts. The proposal offers the licensee a full service building with amenities typically provided only by hospitals and full service medical office buildings and not retail properties. Typical retail operations are triple net, with the tenant absorbing all of the related opet\u00b7ational expenses. However, this opportunity provides the tenant with comprehensive services which will be reflected in our evaluation. Market conditions for each use were established for comparison. Medical space, specifically physician, private offices garners rents at $35-$55 per RSF. Retail rents are $75-$100 per RSF. Asking rents in this market remained flat in 2011 but landlord concessions are still negligible. Although these areas have medical offices, the lack of product, i.e., rental opportunities has maintained a stable rental market. CONCLUSION The ability to access the space and the provision of services without intetTUption is an amenity that benefits this retail tenant. This retail tenant, however, remains viable only as long as an eye care practice remains present at the premises. The minimal expense for tenant improvements was a variable that was evaluated as well. 630 SEVENTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10018 ~Htl Partnarr 3 Not all of the locations that were inspected for this report were handicapped accessible. To reiterate 24~ 7 security is a valuable and an attractive amenity provided by the landlord. All of the lavatories throughout the facility are ADA compliant. The corridors are also wheelchair accessible. For the purpose of this appraisal, we shall assume that all operating expenses, i.e., security, refuse removal, utilities, repairs and maintenance, service contracts, etc. are provided by the landlord In conclusion this analysis finds that the FMV for this space is essentially a hybrid due to the location of the space, proposed use and lack of opportunity to promote a true retail operation. However, it also provides the retailer with an immediate client base. It is our professional opinion that the value of the referenced space is $40 -$45 per RSF. It would not be appropriate to provide a tenant with a consb\u00b7uction concession of rent abatement given the size of the unit. It would be appropriate for the tenant to negotiate an escalation provision to the base rent/fee of 2.75% to 3% commencing in the second year of the license agreement. These would be commercially fair and reasonable terms based on the data and information assessed in this report. In the event I can be of any ftu1her assistance to you, please do not besitate to call me. Very truly yours, /fJIIJ.. Michael Dubin Pat1ner 630 SEVENTH "}
