Stop Using Animals to Teach Human Medicine \" That was the message the Physicians Committee had for Augusta University's Medical College of Georgia on mobile and stationary billboards that went up in October As soon as local TV stations reported on the billboards, the university announced it would stop using live pigs for surgery training The decision also followed a federal complaint and a letter signed by Physicians Committee doctor members in Georgia Instead of animals, human-based medical simulators and human cadavers are widely used by the vast majority of surgery training programs The simulators, many of which the university owns, accurately replicate human anatomy and physiology and can include layers of lifelike skin, fat, and muscle Thanks to efforts including letters, complaints, member emails, and billboards, the Medical College of Georgia was one of several surgery training victories in 2020 The first came in September when the University of Virginia announced that it ended the use of live animals following a 2019 federal complaint filed by the Physicians Committee and subsequent media coverage The Cleveland Clinic also stopped using live pigs, following correspondence from John Pippin, MD, FACC, Physicians Committee director of academic affairs The hospital's surgery program director agreed to reassess animal use and soon determined that nonanimal training methods were best In another development, the joint Spectrum Health and Michigan State University surgery program in Grand Rapids has also decided to stop using animals to train its surgeons Today, three-fourths of surveyed U S and Canadian surgery programs train residents without using animals The Physicians Committee continues to push the remaining surgery programs that still use animals to switch to simulation, and we have no doubt we will succeed In November, the Physicians Committee placed billboards in Charleston, S C , urging the Medical University of South Carolina to end animal use in its program The University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and the University of Washington in Seattle are among the other programs the Physicians Committee targeted in 2020 Saving Animals From Surgery Training \"There are just so many things that you have to learn all over again when you're taking care of patients, because you learn them on an animal species that is totally wrong.\" \u2014 John Pippin, MD, Physicians Committee director of academic affairs, in CU Anschutz accused of violating animal welfare laws with surgical training on live pigs, Aug 25, 2020 5 | 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 2020 ANNUAL REPORT | 6In addition to surgery training, the Physicians Committee continues to work to end animal use in areas of advanced medical training including Advanced Trauma Life Support, combat trauma training, paramedic training, and emergency medicine training In January 2020, billboards and a doctor-led demonstration urged the University of Missouri-Columbia to end the use of live animals in its emergency medicine residency program Kerry Foley, MD, a Physicians Committee member, and area residents held a banner and signs that read, \"Modernize Medical Training\" and \"End Animal Use \" Dr Foley, along with Physicians Committee member Al Puerini, MD, FAAFP , also joined Rep Joseph Solomon and Sen Bridget Valverde at the Rhode Island State House in February in support of bills that would stop the use of live animals in medical training in the state and make it more human-relevant The bills would stop the ongoing, lethal animal use in Brown University's emergency medicine residency, which takes place at Rhode Island Hospital This past Veterans Day, a group of 19 current and former military doctors and nurses asked Naval Medical Center Portsmouth in Virginia to stop using live animals in its emergency medicine residency program In conjunction with the veterans' letter, the Physicians Committee installed billboards in the city of Portsmouth that read, \"Pigs Make Lousy Sailors TroopsDeserveBetter org \" Making Advanced Medical Training Human-Relevant Sen. Bridget Valverde, Rep. Joseph Solomon, Al Puerini, MD, FAAFP , and Kerry Foley, MD, support legislative efforts to replace use of live animals. \"This is actually a very outdated practice.\" - Kerry Foley, MD, a Physicians Committee member and retired emergency physician , in Demonstrators gather to protest live animal use at MU, Feb 6, 2020\"You wouldn't send a modern-day soldier or sailor to Iraq or Afghanistan carrying the same equipment or tactics their grandfathers used in World War II. \" - retired Army Lt.

A plant-based diet can help prevent and manage asthma, while dairy products and high-fat foods raise the risk, according to a Physicians Committee review published in Nutrition Reviews. Heart Disease Disparities. In the Journal of the American Heart Association, Dr Barnard, Physicians Committee member Kim Williams, MD, FACC, and others summarized research behind diet\u2014one of the top modifiable risk factors for heart disease\u2014and the disproportionate effects of racial, economic, and social disparities on diet quality Aging. In an editorial in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, Physicians Committee researchers found that, while aging increases the risk for many diseases, plant-based diets can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, cancer, and heart disease by almost 50% and could similarly cut cardiometabolic-related deaths Type 1 Diabetes. Case studies by Dr Kahleova in the Journal of Diabetes and Metabolis m followed individuals with type 1 diabetes who adopted plant-based diets and improved glycemic control, reduced insulin needs, and boosted overall health \"I have been a member of the Physicians Committee for over 20 years. This groundbreaking, highly impactful organization is changing the way America eats for the better\u2014one provocative campaign, one enlightening webinar, one medical conference, one healthier person at a time. I'm so proud and honored to support the Physicians Committee.\" - Mindy Kursban, Esq., chair, Physicians Committee board of directors Improving Health and Policy Through Nutrition Research Sam T. lost 34 pounds and improved his metabolism in a Physicians Committee clinical research study. 2020 ANNUAL REPORT | 10 9 | 2020 ANNUAL REPORTIn December, the Food and Drug Administration launched Innovative Science and Technology Approaches for New Drugs (ISTAND), a pilot program that will help reduce and replace animal testing as part of drug development Elizabeth Baker, Esq , Physicians Committee pharmaceutical policy program director, co-authored a manuscript with FDA scientists that described the need for this program The Physicians Committee has worked with the FDA toward this goal for several years, meeting with FDA officials and members of Congress and providing expert input, hosting congressional briefings, and leading drug development stakeholders in advocating for a pathway for the approval of nonanimal drug testing methods based on human biology Earlier in 2020, Kristie Sullivan, MPH, Physicians Committee vice president of research policy, led FDA scientists through a training session on the importance of replacing animal tests with human-relevant methods that could be used to assess the safety of drugs and chemicals that may cause cancer or reproductive harm Sparing Animals From Chemical and Drug Testing More than 750 rabbits a year will be spared from lethal dose 50 (LD50) tests for new pesticides and cleaning products thanks to the Physicians Committee's work with the Environmental Protection Agency In LD50 tests, animals are forced to inhale chemicals, ingest chemicals, or have chemicals applied to their skin, until half of them die from the chemicals' effects The others are killed at the end of the test This new policy is the latest in a recent series of EPA policies that reduce or replace animals with more human-relevant tests in toxicology testing In 2019, the EPA committed to eliminating tests on mammals, following years of pressure from the Physicians Committee and other groups Elizabeth Baker, Esq., Physicians Committee pharmaceutical policy program director 2020 ANNUAL REPORT | 12 11 | 2020 ANNUAL REPORTA single live animal market in China\u2014where an infectious coronavirus appears to have passed from a bat to animals at the market before being passed to humans\u2014set off a pandemic that has sickened millions, killed hundreds of thousands, and wreaked economic havoc not seen since the Great Depression But it's not the first time animal agriculture has led to a pandemic, and\u2014without taking action\u2014it is unlikely to be the last In April, Dr Barnard sent a letter urging New York Gov Andrew Cuomo to prohibit the state's live animal markets New York was the initial epicenter of the pandemic in the United States Following Dr Barnard's letter, New York State Assemblymember Linda B Rosenthal and Sen Luis Sep\u00falveda introduced legislation, supported by the Physicians Committee, to ban live animal markets in the state \"In a matter of weeks, COVID-19 has ravaged New York and changed life for millions of New Yorkers,\" said Assemblymember Rosenthal \"As policymakers, we have a responsibility to respond to this crisis by doing everything in our power to prevent the next pandemic Closing New York's live animal markets, which operate in residential neighborhoods and do not adhere to even the most basic sanitary standards, until we determine whether they can be made safe, is a vital first step \" In Philadelphia, the Physicians Committee put up a billboard reading, \"Live Bird Markets in Philly? Shut Them Down!\" just feet from S&L Poultry Market and filed an emergency action complaint with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health arguing that live bird markets should be shut down to prevent disease outbreaks At the federal level, the Physicians Committee filed a legal petition signed by more than 20 doctor members asking Surgeon General Jerome M Adams, MD, MPH, to \"prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases\" by prohibiting the operation of live animal markets in the United States and working with international bodies to harmonize this policy worldwide Banning Live Animal Markets \"The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine also weighed in and requested the U.S. Surgeon General to request the closure of live animal markets.\" - Coronavirus news: mounting calls to close live animal markets amid COVID-19, April 15, 2020 2020 ANNUAL REPORT | 14 13 | 2020 ANNUAL REPORTEarly in the pandemic, research found that people catching the virus were much more likely to succumb to it if they had an underlying health condition, such as diabetes, obesity, or hypertension Disproportionate rates of these conditions in communities of color added to disparities in COVID-19 infections and deaths The Physicians Committee targeted policymakers and worked with health care professionals across the country to address the important role of a plant-based diet in preventing and reversing these underlying conditions, a topic that was largely absent from virus mitigation discussions Member doctors sent letters to their mayors and governors, urging them to include plant-based diets in their COVID-19 guidance Among them were Nick Borja, MD, in Florida; Robert Breakey, MD, in Michigan; Richard Bruno, MD, in Maryland; Bandana Chawla, MD, Munish Chawla, MD, and Baxter Montgomery, MD, in Texas; Christie Cobb, MD, in Arkansas; Donald Forrester, MD, in California; Ashwani Garg, MD, and Steven Lome, DO, in Illinois; and Jonathan Sheline, MD, in North Carolina In April, the Physicians Committee launched the Food for Life: Cooking to Combat COVID-19 campaign, an online nutrition and cooking course The campaign activated an international network of more than 284 instructors who have taught 956 classes since April The Physicians Committee partnered with Native American communities in May to host an educational immersion program titled Cooking and More to Combat COVID-19 The event helped empower Native Americans who have been hard-hit by the pandemic Fight COVID-19 With Food, a free eight-week virtual class targeted to reach U S communities hard-hit by the pandemic, launched in June and was repeated in August, reaching more than 5,000 people Each class was led by Physicians Committee nutrition experts and included guest presenters and guidance on starting a plant-based diet Following the inaugural class series, 67% of attendees reported weight loss, 53% of those with diabetes reported improvements, and 54% with high blood pressure reported improvements Fighting COVID-19 With Food \"I love supporting the Physicians Committee's extraordinary leading-edge work in the fields of dietary, nutritional, and lifestyle science, including their valuable, life-changing educational programs that are helping people of all types and ages create better health, vitality, joy, and longevity.\" - Alicia Sirkin, BFRP, member of the Physicians Committee's President's CouncilPivoting to Telemedicine at the Barnard Medical Center The Barnard Medical Center's doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered dietitians continued to offer comprehensive medical care\u2014with special expertise in helping patients optimize their health through nutrition and lifestyle changes\u2014as they pivoted to seeing patients virtually when the COVID-19 pandemic limited in- person visits Health care providers are now available for telemedicine appointments Monday through Friday, 8:30 a m until 4 p m ET for residents of California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Washington, D C , with additional states being added regularly Vanita Rahman, MD, and Jasmol Sardana, DO, both physicians at the Barnard Medical Center, also began teaching online nutrition courses during the pandemic 15 | 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 2020 ANNUAL REPORT | 16\"We have no numbers for what's landing on the meat because we're not testing at all. It wouldn't be too hard to just check.\" \u2014 Mark Kennedy, Esq., Physicians Committee vice president of legal affairs, in Lawsuit: COVID-19-contaminated meat carcasses are packaged, carried to consumers, Aug 12, 2020 By April, slaughterhouses had become hotbeds for the coronavirus in communities throughout the United States Workers in these facilities reported a lack of protective gear and social distancing, inadequate sick leave policies, and insufficient testing But the federal government pushed meat and poultry processing plants to remain open By the end of 2020, more than 50,000 workers had tested positive for COVID-19, and at least 250 had died In a letter to the White House Coronavirus Task Force, the Physicians Committee wrote, \"We urge you to prioritize life and health over pork chops and bacon Reopening meat processing facilities is ill- advised, and we ask you to cancel this order \" Physicians Committee members also led socially distanced demonstrations outside of the Smithfield headquarters in Virginia and the Great Lakes Packing Co in Chicago, and at the Colorado, Delaware, North Carolina, and Utah state capitol buildings In a letter to governors, Dr Barnard wrote, \"Because these workers directly handle meat and poultry products, and because the virus is easily airborne, transmission of the virus to the products they handle is likely \" To help protect consumers, the Physicians Committee filed an emergency petition with the U S Department of Agriculture requiring that slaughterhouses test meat for the coronavirus prior to making it available for sale and requiring groceries to warn consumers of the potential presence of the virus on meat products Billboards and complaints also urged the governors of Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota to shut down slaughterhouses and promote plant protein \"The current public health emergency highlights the need to transition the food production system away from animal agriculture,\" said Nebraska member Amanda McKinney, MD, in a complaint \"This is especially urgent since meat products increase the risk of chronic diseases, including those that have helped make COVID-19 so deadly \" Dr McKinney told the Lincoln Journal Star that the number of practitioners incorporating plant-based nutrition into their practices is growing Protesting Slaughterhouses Spreading Coronavirus \"The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine ... says the pandemic highlights problems with meat production: The coronavirus has spread throughout meatpacking plants in Iowa and the U.S., where workers stand shoulder-to-shoulder to process pigs, cattle, and chickens.\" \u2014 Doctors posting billboards urging Reynolds to embrace alternatives to coronavirus-plagued meatpacking industry, June 23, 2020 17 | 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 2020 ANNUAL REPORT | 18A congressional briefing in October, co- organized by the Physicians Committee, urged legislators to take action against the common use of horseshoe crab blood to test the safety of vaccines Recombinant Factor C (rFC), a synthetic alternative approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is available, but regulatory policies have created roadblocks to its use \"The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to lead to major increases in the use of horseshoe crab blood, as the nearly 200 vaccines and over 60 injectable therapies in development for COVID-19 will all need to be tested multiple times for fever-inducing contaminants,\" Elizabeth Baker, Esq , Physicians Committee pharmaceutical policy program director, told the Philadelphia Inquirer \"As is often the case, policy is lagging behind the science We must act now to remove unnecessary barriers to industry use of rFC \" Joining Coalition to Protect Octopuses in Labs The Physicians Committee joined a coalition that includes Harvard's Animal Law & Policy Clinic to petition the NIH to include cephalopods among the animals entitled to humane treatment by those involved in federally funded research Experiments on cephalopods\u2014octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish\u2014often involve electric shocks, invasive procedures, and inappropriate housing and care COVID-19 also led to a disturbing trend in federally funded laboratories conducting animal experiments Due to shortages of laboratory workers as staff stayed home in response to the pandemic, universities were found to be neglecting, and in some cases killing, animals deemed \"unnecessary\" or \"extraneous \" On April 16, the Physicians Committee filed a petition with the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the National Institutes of Health The petition argued that NIH, which gives more than $15 billion each year to studies involving animals, must take a series of short-term steps to hold labs accountable and other long-term steps to favor human-relevant research and reduce the number of animals in labs Johns Hopkins University received $763 million from the NIH in FY 2019 Yet the university's recent COVID-19 contingency plan states that experimenters \"should ... euthanize extraneous animals \" Meanwhile, an experimenter at the University of Pennsylvania, which received $582 million from NIH in FY 2019, told a reporter that she euthanized 200 mice \"as quickly as possible \" \"Vaccines for SARS and MERS never came to fruition. The challenge of using animals to model coronavirus infection in humans contributed to this failure.\" - Catharine E. Krebs, PhD, Physicians Committee medical research specialist, in Animal testing isn't our only option\u2014NIH needs to invest in alternatives, Sept 4, 2020 Protecting Animals in Laboratories Calling for Animal-Free Alternative to Test Vaccine Safety Restoring Federal Animal Welfare Documents A group of organizations including the Physicians Committee ended a lawsuit against the U S Department of Agriculture in July after the agency announced policies for disclosing animal welfare records The change comes after years of court battles stemming from the USDA's abrupt shutdown of its online animal welfare database in February 2017 The online documents have been essential to the Physicians Committee's work to end cruel experiments, including the federal government's decision to end chimpanzee experiments 19 | 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 2020 ANNUAL REPORT | 20Mary Steenburgen, Ted Danson, Alicia Silverstone, renowned breast cancer surgeon Kristi Funk, MD, and Jasmine C Leyva, director of the documentary The Invisible Vegan , teamed up in October for a new public service announcement for the Physicians Committee's Let's Beat Breast Cancer campaign In the video, which aired throughout Breast Cancer Awareness Month in Times Square, they let viewers know that only 10% of breast cancer risk is related to genetics That means you can take steps to protect your health and reduce your risk by following Let's Beat Breast Cancer's simple four-pronged approach: 1. Choose plant-based foods. 2. Exercise regularly. 3. Limit alcohol. 4. Maintain a healthy weight. Dr Funk\u2014who discussed the campaign on Good Morning America , The Dr. Oz Show , and dozens of other news and media outlets\u2014co-founded the Pink Lotus Breast Center in Los Angeles and has helped thousands of women through breast cancer treatment, including celebrities like Angelina Jolie and Sheryl Crow While Dr Funk was writing the national bestseller BREASTS: The Owners Manual , her research led her entire family to become 100% plant-based Controversial mobile billboards featuring a woman looking with disgust at a glass of milk traveled through Washington, D C , during Breast Cancer Awareness Month to urge the U S Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services to clearly indicate that dairy products\u2014which increase breast cancer risk\u2014are unnecessary in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans Research shows that women who consume 2-3 cups of cow's milk per day have an 80% increased chance of breast cancer In September, the Physicians Committee filed a lawsuit against the Food and Drug Administration for failing to respond to a petition that asks the agency to require cheese manufacturers to add the following warning label on all dairy cheese products: \"Dairy cheese contains reproductive hormones that may increase breast cancer mortality risk \" A 2017 study found that women who consumed the most American, cheddar, and cream cheeses had a 53% higher risk for breast cancer \"'Cheese is addictive and involves the same brain receptors as opiates,' said Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and author of the book The Cheese Trap .

Wayne State University was not mentioned by name during the poll. Up to 300 dogs have died in hypertension and heart failure experiments at Wayne State University in Michigan since 1991 The Physicians Committee has been working to end these experiments for a decade and in 2020 supported legislation that would make it illegal for public institutions in Michigan to use dogs in painful experiments Senate Bill 971, introduced in June by Michigan State Sen Michael MacDonald, is a companion to House Bill 5090, which was introduced by Michigan State Rep Sara Cambensy in October 2019 In December, the Physicians Committee awarded the lawmakers the Legislative Leadership Award \"Man's best friend deserves man's best protection against abuse,\" said Sen MacDonald \"The majority of Michigan families oppose invasive experiments on dogs We wouldn't allow harm to come to our family dogs, and we shouldn't allow it at our public institutions using taxpayer funding \" 23 | 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 2020 ANNUAL REPORT | 24The Physicians Committee provided legal counsel and is sponsoring litigation by KING Charter Schools, in Florida, which is challenging in court National School Lunch Program (NSLP) regulations that require schools to offer dairy milk Long-term milk ingestion is linked to prostate and breast cancer The school argues that they result in discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin, in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 The NSLP requires schools to offer dairy milk even though many students\u2014especially students of color\u2014are unable to digest milk due to lactose intolerance, and Black men and women have the highest mortality of prostate and breast cancer, respectively The litigation also argues that the agency's order violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by unlawfully limiting the school's speech, violating students' right to receive information, and imposing unconstitutional conditions on a government benefit KING requested permission from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which administers the NSLP , to offer milk as the last meal item in the lunch line, to allow students to decline milk under the program's \"offer versus serve\" policy, and to provide, as part of its curriculum outside the lunch line, educational material about the negative effects of dairy consumption The Florida agency denied the request due to a program requirement that schools not \"directly or indirectly restrict the sale or marketing of fluid milk products \" Four-time NBA champion John Salley testified on behalf of the Physicians Committee in August to urge the federal government to clearly indicate in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans that dairy products are unnecessary and take a disproportionate health toll on people of color Dairy consumption is linked to prostate and breast cancer, among other conditions While Salley testified, doctors and health care providers from the Physicians Committee took part in a socially distanced demonstration outside of U S Department of Agriculture headquarters in Washington, D C The USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services develop the guidelines The Physicians Committee also submitted a letter signed by nearly 500 health care professionals, including 300 physicians The letter said that the federal government \"preserves antiquated, racially biased dairy-promoting guidelines, despite clear contributions to health problems that take a disproportionate toll in Black Americans and other demographic groups \" Challenging Discriminatory School Lunch Milk Regulations Removing Racial Bias From Dietary Guidelines \"There isn't scientific evidence to suggest somehow infants would be better off consuming meat, seafood, eggs, and dairy.\" - Susan Levin, MS, RD, Physicians Committee director of nutrition education, in Do babies need to eat meat?, Oct 12, 2020\"They need to be pulled back and redrafted. The guidelines maintain a racially tinged promotion of dairy products, which are far less healthful than other calcium sources and have been shown to increase the risk of prostate and breast cancer, both of which are particularly deadly in the Black community, as well as an inappropriate emphasis on meat, rather than healthier foods.\" - Susan Levin, MS, RD, director of nutrition education for the Physicians Committee, in Experts have told Americans to consume less sugar, alcohol, but new dietary guidelines don't reflect that, Dec 29, 2020 Dairy and Cancer PSA Actor Mark McKinnon warned against the link between dairy products and prostate cancer in a Physicians Committee public service announcement in November 25 | 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 2020 ANNUAL REPORT | 26\"The most dangerous phrase in science is: 'We've always done it that way ' Critical thinking is one of the key components to overcoming the continued use of animals \" That was the advice Warren Casey, PhD, of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, had this summer in his keynote address for more than 600 students and early-career scientists from across the globe who attended Innovative Science Without Animals, a five-day online conference on New Approach Methodologies (NAMs)\u2014nonanimal methods such as organs-on- chips and computer modeling\u2014that can help reduce and replace animal tests in toxicology and medical research The conference, jointly hosted by the Physicians Committee, Johns Hopkins University Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT), and the European Commission Joint Research Centre, included four days of lectures from 45 experts at institutions including Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, the National Institutes of Health, the Environmental Protection Agency, and more; interactive sessions; e-poster presentations; laboratory and software demonstrations; and virtual engagement with speakers and attendees In October, the American Society for Cellular and Computational Toxicology\u2014a scientific society co-founded by the Physicians Committee\u2014held its ninth annual meeting, which included lectures and discussions about developing and using NAMs The meeting, which was attended by more than 200 regulators, academics, students, and industry scientists from around the world, included speakers from Dow Chemical, the Environmental Protection Agency, and Roche, and 22 oral and 70 poster presenters, all presenting their work on nonanimal methods for assessing chemicals, drugs, and other products Physicians Committee Toxicologist Esther Haugabrooks, PhD, also organized and hosted a successful full-day training with EPA method developers in October, where more than 200 scientists learned how to assess chemical safety with the EPA's computational tools In November, Dr Haugabrooks hosted two trainings at the Association for the Advancement of Alternatives Assessment's annual symposium More than 200 participants learned about nonanimal toxicology assessment from experts from L 'Or\u00e9al, Unilever, Cosmetics Europe, and several test method developers The Physicians Committee also provides NAMs training to industry, government, and academic scientists through the New Approach Methodology (NAM) Use for Regulatory Application (NURA) continuing education program Training Scientists on Methods to Replace Animal Tests Publishing Recommendations for Human-Relevant Research A report co-authored by Janine McCarthy, MPH, Physicians Committee research policy specialist, published in the journal ALTEX identified the challenges scientists sometimes face accessing high-quality human cells and tissues\u2014which are more predictive than animal use for studying disease and developing safe and effective medical treatments\u2014and presented a strategy to increase access and availability In the same journal, an article co- authored by Elizabeth Baker, Esq , Physicians Committee pharmaceutical policy program director, called for increased adoption of microphysiological systems\u2014technologies such as organs- on-chips and 3D organoids that use human cells to model organs\u2014that could help advance pharmaceutical development by providing more predictive information about human safety and efficacy while reducing animal testing Esther Haugabrooks, PhD 27 | 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 2020 ANNUAL REPORT | 28Processed meat\u2014such as hot dogs, bacon, and deli meat\u2014increases the risk of colorectal cancer, which killed an estimated 53,000 people in the United States in 2020 In March, the Physicians Committee filed a lawsuit against the state of California for failing to include processed meat on the state's list of substances known to cause cancer, as required by Proposition 65 In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organization, classified consumption of processed meat as \"'carcinogenic to humans' (Group 1) on the basis of sufficient evidence for colorectal cancer \" This classification requires California to add processed meat to its list of carcinogens, which it has failed to do Plaintiffs included Physicians Committee members Donald D Forrester, MD, and Anna Herby, RD, CDE, who both reside in California The Physicians Committee's popular Exam Room podcast, hosted by Chuck Carroll, added a live Facebook and YouTube broadcast Mondays through Fridays beginning in April to address the latest news regarding COVID-19 These daily briefings have become a trusted source of information and can reach tens of thousands of people with each episode Virtual reach also expanded in Spanish-, Mandarin-, and Hindi-speaking communities around the globe In August, more than 750 people attended M\u00e1s plantas, immersion program filled with lectures, cooking demonstrations, and success stories It was hosted by Physicians Committee member Ana Negr\u00f3n, MD, with a special introduction from Mexican TV host Marco Regil In January, Vanita Rahman, MD, a physician with the Barnard Medical Center, and Zeeshan Ali, PhD, who manages the Physicians Committee's programs in India, visited medical schools in Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Pune to teach hundreds of medical students and physicians across the country how to help patients fight heart disease and type 2 diabetes with a traditional plant-based Indian diet that avoids dairy products The Physicians Committee also teamed up with the Chinese Society for Lifestyle Medicine in December to host the first online International Conference for Nutrition and Lifestyle Medicine in China The event\u2014which reached nearly 100,000 people\u2014highlighted the power of a plant-based diet and healthy lifestyle to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes Jia Xu, PhD, who manages the Physicians Committee's efforts in China, has traveled throughout the country to spread the power of a plant-based diet by giving lectures at medical schools, hospitals, businesses, and other venues Eliminating Processed Meat Reaching Worldwide Audiences Ban Processed Meat, Say Hospital Patients Most patients in hospitals favor eliminating processed meats\u2014including bacon, deli meat, and sausage\u2014from hospital menus to reduce cancer risk, according to a new Physicians Committee survey published in the Journal of Hospital Management and Health Policy Researchers surveyed 200 patients in two Washington, D C , hospitals and found that 83% of patients are in favor of hospitals eliminating processed meat in order to reduce cancer risk
