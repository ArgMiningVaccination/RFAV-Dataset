It is a way of living a satisfying, hopeful, and con- tributing life, even with limitations caused by mental illness. Recovery involves the development of new meaning and purpose in one 's life as one grows be- yond the catastrophic effects of mental illness. Our goal is to help patients real- ize that they can recover from mental illness and have a meaningful life. A \"meaningful life \" describes a person's satisfaction with life and feelings of pur- pose. A \"meaningful life \" is about engaging in activities, and with people who the person loves and who matter to him or her. We strive to help our patients to identify and pursue personal meaning in their life (for example: working a part-time job, having the energy to play with grandchildren, or managing medi- cations independently). For more information, explore resources on the APNA website: apna.org . Putting Recovery at the Heart of All We Do : Based on research by the Devon Partnership National Health Service Trust, this pro- vides guidelines mental health professionals can use to support people's goals, strengths, and available resources, whether or not they opt for medication during treatment. Enhancing the Effectiveness of Psychiatric Care and Other Services and Sup- ports: Guidelines for Promoting Recovery Through Choice and Alternatives The National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery, a national coalition of statewide consumer/survivor organizations and others, released these guidelines to educate people about the values -based needs of individuals with mental health challenges. The guidelines were developed by a diverse group of people with the lived experi- ence of mental health recovery from across the United States. Policy Statement All policies that are referenced throughout this Clinical Orien- tation Manual are subject to change at any time. The poli- cies that are included in this manual are abbreviated and not in their entirety, therefore, this manual cannot be the sole independent source when referring to a policy. Complete policies can be found online. Go to vumc.org Click Resources Directory Then search for policy. According to SAMHSA 's concept of a trauma -informed approach, a program, organization, or system that is trauma -informed: Realizes the widespread impact of trauma and understands poten- tial paths for recovery Recognizes the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients, families, staff, and others involved with the system Responds by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into poli- cies, procedures, and practices Seeks to actively resist re -traumatization A trauma -informed approach can be implemented in any type of ser- vice setting or organization and is distinct trauma specific services or trauma systems. A trauma informed approach is inclusive of trauma - specific interventions (whether assessment, treatment or recovery supports) yet it also incorporates key trauma principles into the organ- izational culture. We strive to operate within the Recovery Principles as outlined by SAMHSA SAMHSA's Guiding Principles of Recovery Trauma Informed Care The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) states that the recovery from mental disorders and substance use disorders is a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self - directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. The guiding principles are: Recovery emerges from hope Recovery is person -driven Recovery occurs via many path- ways Recovery is holistic Recovery is supported by peers and allies Recovery is supported through relationship and social networks Recovery is culturally based and influenced Recovery is supported by ad- dressing trauma Recovery involves individual, fam- ily, and community strengths and responsibility Recovery is based on respect Click here for more details on each of the guiding principles of recovery. 2 SAMHSA's Six Key Principles of a Trauma - Informed Approach A trauma -informed approach reflects adherence to six key principles rather than a pre- scribed set of practices or pro- cedures. Safety Trustworthiness & Transparency Peer Support Collaboration & Mutuality Empowerment, Voice, & Choice Cultural, Historical, & Gender Issues It is critical to promote the linkage to recovery and resili- ence for those individuals and families impacted by trauma. Consistent with SAMHSA 's definition of recovery, services and supports that are trauma - informed build on the best evidence available, patient and family engagement, empower- ment, and collaboration. Trauma Specific Interventions Trauma specific intervention programs generally recognize the follow- ing: The patient 's need to be respected, informed, connected, and hopeful regarding their own recovery The interrelation between trauma and symptoms of trauma such as substance use disorder, eating disor- ders, depression, and anxi- ety The need to work in a col- laborative way with pa- tients, family, and friends of the patient in a manner that will be empowering. 3 At VPH, we utilize Person First Language. Person First Language is an objective and respectful way to speak which puts a person before a diagnosis, describing what a person \"has\" rather than asserting what a person \"is\". In putting the person before the disability or condition, Person First Language highlights a person 's value, indi- viduality, and capabilities. When words alone define a person, the result is a la- bel\u2014a label that often reinforces barriers created by negative and stereotypical attitudes. Every individual deserves to be treated with dignity and respect \u2014regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orienta- tion, disability, or medical/mental health condition. When referring to individuals, be considerate when choosing your words. Focus on the person, and never use terms that label, generalize, stereotype, devalue, or discriminate. Unless it is relevant to the conversation, you don 't need to refer to or mention the disability, con- dition, or diagnosis. Person First Language Say This Not This People with disabilities The handicapped, the disabled People without disabilities Normal, healthy, whole or typical people Person who has a congenital disability Person with a birth defect Person who has (or has been diagnosed with) ... Person afflicted with, suffers from, a victim of ... Person who has Downs Syndrome Downs person, mongoloid, mongol Person who has (or has been diagnosed with) autism The autistic Person with quadriplegia, person with paraplegia A quadriplegic, a paraplegic Person with a physical disability A cripple Person of short stature, little person A dwarf, a midget Person who is unable to speak, person who uses a com- munication device Dumb, mute Person who is blind, person who is visually impaired The blind Person with a learning disability Learning disabled Person diagnosed with a mental health condition Crazy, insane, psycho, mentally ill, emotionally disturbed, demented Person diagnosed with a cognitive disability or with an Mentally retarded, retarded, slow, idiot, moron Student who receives special education services Special education student, special ed student Person who uses a wheelchair, accessible parking, bath- rooms, etc. Confined to a wheelchair, wheelchair bound, handi- capped parking, handicapped bathrooms, etc. 4 VPH addresses the applicable National Patient Safety Goals as follows: Identify Patients: Prior to medication administration, col- lecting labs, or proce- dures, two patient identifiers are used. We do NOT give blood at VPH. Communication: Lab results are report- ed to the nurse who notifies the appropri- ate physician immedi- ately. Medicine safety: All medications are labeled, care is taken with patient on blood thinners, and medica- tion reconciliation is performed every ad- mission. Alarm safety: Alarms are responded to promptly. Infection Prevention: Includes handwashing, wearing appropriate PPE, and aseptic technique with IVs and lab draws. Safety risks: Suicide risk assessments are performed on every patient on admission and at least twice daily. Surgery Mistakes: A time out is performed before all ECT and TMS procedures. The Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals 5 Magnet Recognition Program MISSION : The Magnet Recognition Program will continually elevate patient care around the world in an envi- ronment where nurses, in collab- oration with the interprofessional team flourish by setting the standard for excellence through leadership, scientific discovery and dissemination and implemen- tation of new knowledge. VISION : The Magnet Recognition Program will transform healthcare globally by bringing knowledge, skill, inno- vation, leadership and compas- sion to every person, family, and community. 6 Magnet Vanderbilt Behavioral Health is a Magnet recognized organization. A Magnet or- ganization is one that signifies excellence - an excellent working environment in which to deliver excellent patient care. As the word \"Magnet \" implies, top notch nurses, physicians, scientists, and other healthcare professionals are \"attracted \" to a Magnet culture. High quality and satisfaction supports continued excellence and improved patient outcomes. There is a participatory management style through Shared Governance, which supports unit/clinic based decision -making and representation at all levels of the organization. Shared Governance VPH has a dynamic shared governance model that is founded on the cornerstone principles of partnership, accountability, and ownership. The Shared Governance structure at VPH allows for clinical staff to lend their voice to a structured, dynamic, multi -disciplinary, and collaborative decision making process regarding important issues that directly affect practice. Examples of Shared Governance at VPH are Unit Boards, Nursing Professional Practice Board, and Nursing Staff Council, as well as multiple task forces and committees with spe- cific focuses. The various opportunities for staff involvement exist in an effort to create an envi- ronment that delivers exceptional patient care based on accountable decision making by nursing staff. In the shared governance model at VPH the word \"nursing \" includes Nurses and Behavioral Health Specialists. Searches Our goal is to provide a safe environment for the delivery of quality patient care that is respectful of our patient 's rights, dignity, and privacy. All patients at VPH require a Level 1 search. A Level 1 search can also be performed any time there is a question of patient or unit safety. If the patient refuses the search (for any level of search) he or she will be placed on con- stant observation until they cooperate with the search. A Level 1 search is conducted in PAS and then again at transfer to a unit. Please refer to the Patient Belongings section for the different procedures and responsibilities for cataloging belongings. Level 2 and 3 searches are only conducted after physician and unit staff collaborate to determine the necessity. Policy: Patient Search at Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital #06 -616 Level of Search Characteristics of Search Level 1 Requires patient cooperation Only includes removal of shoes and outerwear (jacket, scarf, etc.) Pockets are emptied and turned out. Waistband is visualized. Handheld metal detector / wand is used Two staff members are present (one may be CSO) Includes search of patient belongings Level 2 Requires physician order Two staff members are present and escort patient to an area affording privacy Patient removes all clothing except undergarments Visualize patient to determine if contraband is attached to skin \u2014patient turns 360 degrees. Scrubs are provided if needed In presence of patient, search all clothing and jewelry carefully including pockets, hems, seams, cuffs, collars, and shoes Return clothing to patient Level 3 Requires physician order and presence during the search Includes all aspects of a Level 2 search Search is conducted including body cavities by physician Remember to respect the patient 's dignity and provide as much privacy as allowable by the level of the search. 7 Patient Belonging Policies Search of Patient Care Areas, Indi- viduals, and/or Belongings # OP 20 -10.07 Handling of Patient Property \u2014 Valuables, Belongings, and Contra- band # OP 10 -50.07 Patient Valuables, Vanderbilt Psy- chiatric Hospital and Psychiatric Assessment Service # 04 -615 Contraband Procedures \u2014SOP Conducting a Search It is imperative that we keep track of patient belongings throughout their stay at VPH; including during transfers between units. Property loss is very stress- ful for patients and costly to the hospital. Patient Property Records assist with monitoring and accurately recording patient property. PAS begins the process by initiating the property record and searching the patient for contraband. If contraband is found, it is se- cured until the patient 's discharge (or given to VUPD if indicated per policy). All valuables including wallets, money, cell phones, jewelry, etc. must go in a tamper -proof bag. It is preferable that patient valuables are either kept safe at home or in the care of a family member. All patient belongings with insignificant monetary value can be placed in a standard patient property bag. Patients should be educated regarding limited access to personal belongings and valuables during their stay. All staff in contact with patient belongings must print their name on the form. When inventorying valuable items, use terms such as \"yellow metal \" instead of \"gold \" and \"red stone \" instead of \"ruby \". Patient must initial next to each item recorded and sign the valuables bag and the property belonging record. Review items with the patient during discharge. Remember our patients are admitted during times of crisis. The search procedure may induce anxiety or other uncomfortable feelings and cause added stress. Explaining the process will help alleviate anxiety. Reassure the patient that this is a routine part of the admissions process to ensure the safety of all our patients. Searches are preferably performed by staff members of the same sex as the patient. Two staff members are always present for the duration of the search. Document the search and any findings. 8 Patient Belongings Patient rights are very important at VPH. Our Patient and Family Promise is our dedication to serving the needs of our patients and families, and partner- ing for the best outcomes. As a part of this partnership, we want to ensure that every choice we make for care is in the best interest of the patient and family. The goal for all patients is to function well with the least support necessary in the least restrictive environment necessary. Below is a continuum of Most Restrictive to Least Restrictive environments. Admissions \u2014Voluntary vs. Involuntary Voluntary \u2014Patient has agreed to their admission to VPH. Most of the patients at VPH may leave after the following occur: Receive discharge orders from the team Submit a request in writing to leave the hospital AMA The physician has 12 hours to see the patient and determine If the patient is safe to leave If the patient should stay on an involuntary status Involuntary \u2014Patient is required to stay in the hospital against their wishes Initial commitment is for 72 business hours (not including weekends or court holidays) Patient may attend mental health court where the judge reviews the case and determines if the patient stays hospitalized or may go home. Treatment Review Committee A Treatment Review Committee meets when necessary to discuss whether some patient rights can be temporarily suspended due to deterioration of the patient 's mental health status that places the patient at risk. They review if treatment can be provided without psychotropic medications or if the pa- tient 's lack of capacity is likely transitory and can be remedied by medication. Policy: Treatment Review Committee # 05 -046 9 Legal and Ethical Concerns Emergency Response Algorithm Patient Care during Emergencies Airway: Assess airway for patency. Any BLS trained staff member can reposition patient to maintain an open airway. Breathing: Assess for breathing. Use Bag -valve mask (located on crash carts) if patient is not breathing, or breaths are slow and shallow. (Do not hold BVM over mouth without giving breaths.) If patient is breathing, but dusky, apply O2 mask. Connect O2 mask or BVM to O2 tank on crash cart. Circulation: Assess for a pulse. Provide chest compressions if patient has no pulse, or pulse is very slow and patient is unresponsive. Per- form chest compressions at a rate of 100 -120 beats per minute, and compress to an adequate depth. Defibrillation: Place defib pads in positions shown on the pads. Set defibrillator to AED mode. If a shock is administered, immediately resume compressions for 2 minutes. Documentation: This skill must be performed by a RN. Complete all fields on the paper form and write legibly. If medications are given, write the dose. Place completed form to be scanned into patient 's EMR. VPH is a BLS facility. All clinical employees are required to main- tain the BLS Healthcare Provider level of certification through the American Heart Association. BLS is required upon hire and must be recertified every two years. Free BLS classes are available through the Vanderbilt Resuscita- tion Program. For more infor- mation, click here . ECT RNs are additionally required to obtain and maintain ACLS. 10 Falls Policies Falls Prevention \u2014Adult # CL 30 -02.09 Falls Prevention \u2014Pediatrics # CL 30 -19.26 11 Falls Risk Assessment We utilize the Edmonson Falls Risk Assessment tool at VPH. A Falls Risk Assessment should be performed: Within 8 hours of admission and every 24 hours thereafter With any change in patient condi- tion With any change in level of care Following an actual fall Following a near fall Risk interventions are initiated based on the Edmonson Falls Risk Assess- ment Score. All patients at VPH have Standard Risk Interventions. These interventions include bed in lowest position with the brakes locked, ori-enting patient to room and unit, edu- cating on safety. Patients with a high risk score have High Risk Interventions in addition to the Standard Risk Interventions. These interventions include maintain- ing standard risk precautions, wearing yellow footwear and yellow armband to indicate the higher risk. Staff members who identify unsafe conditions take immediate action to correct it. If there is a patient fall, utilize the Post Fall Huddle Sheet. Safe Patient Handling All patient handling equip- ment at VUMC was select- ed based on input from nurses at VUMC who rated each piece of equipment on comfort, safety, ease of use, and ease of cleaning. We utilize: Slippery Sheets Sit-to-Stand Air Transport Moving Device Stedy: Non -powered patient transport de- vice Maxi Move: total lift Click here to watch instruc- tional videos on the use of each type of patient han- dling equipment. Policy: Safety: Patient Handling and Movement # CL 30 -04.02 Safe patient handling equipment is in place across VUMC to prevent staff inju- ries while caring for patients. Please review the information on the use of this equipment. Slippery Sheets reduce friction and prevent shear inju- ries commonly caused by transferring or moving pa- tients. The sheets also reduce staff injuries and re- duce the number of staff required for a safe transfer. The Stedy is a sit -to-stand aide that provides a simple way to encourage patients to participate in transfers and activities of existing mobility. The Maxi Move is a safe means of lifting and transferring pa- tients from lying to sitting. It is capable of lifting patients off the floor. 12 Documentation All documentation is completed through eStar, an EPIC charting system. Fol- lowing specific documentation guidelines helps to ensure our patients receive the care they need. General Documentation Tips Give detailed, objective descriptions or examples of behaviors. What behaviors were present prior to admission? What behaviors are present currently? Psychotic? - Describe the behavior. \"Patient observed talking when no one present, as if talking to her deceased mother. \" Paranoid? - Describe about what or who. \"Patient unable to sit still and constantly scanning environment. States that she feels people are trying to poison her. \" Hallucinations? - Describe what the patient states he or she is seeing, hearing, feeling, etc. \"Patient describes a 'dark, menac- ing, shapeless form ' in the corner of the room. \" Manic? Agitated? Sedated? - Describe the actual behaviors. Document specific groups that the patient attended, and the patient 's interactions in the group setting. Document the patient 's feelings as they verbalize them. Document the patient 's level of self -motivation, hopefulness for the fu- ture if present, and engagement in treatment. Documentation of Suicidal Ideation Utilize the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. If the patient is suicidal, always document if they have a plan and wheth- er or not they are willing to contract for safety. Describe the plan in detail. \"Patient states he will shoot himself in the head. \" Document if the patient has access / capacity to carry out the plan. \"Patient plans to shoot himself in the head when discharged from the hospital. He owns a gun which is kept at home. \" Self-injurious behaviors should be described in detail. Additionally, docu- ment any actions taken by staff. \"MD notified. Removed objects from patient 's room. \" Utilization Management The VPH Utilization Manage- ment Team communicates with review agencies and in- surance companies about pa- tient acuity, treatment, and discharge planning activities. The information helps obtain authorization for continued care. This important work is supported through the docu- mentation entered by clinical staff. It is important that we accu- rately document the patient 's current behaviors, treatment plan, and discharge plan. Documentation of Homicidal Ideation If the patient has homicidal ideations, always document against whom and what the plan is. Document if the patient has the access / capacity to carry out the plan. Is the plan realistic? Has the potential victim been notified? What is the safety plan after discharge? Documentation of Substance Misuse Issues and Withdrawal from Substances Note any signs and symptoms of withdrawal: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, perspiration, abnormal vital signs, complaints of sensation of head fullness, etc. Document drug history specifics: specific drug used, age first used, current usage & how long, any period of sobriety, any prior treatments, etc. Documentation of Family Sessions Family sessions are arranged for each patient by Social Work according to individual need. Family involvement is necessary in order to encourage partnerships between the patient, family, and pro- viders of care. Document the patient 's response to the family session and / or any effects on the patient 's mood or interactions in the milieu. Downtime Procedures In the event of computer systems downtime, downtime kits are available in each area of VPH to allow for continued operation and documentation. Refer to the kit on your unit for specific instruc- tions. 13 SUICIDE IDEATION DEFINITIONS AND PROMPTS Past month Ask questions that are bolded and underlined . YES NO Ask Questions 1 and 2 1) Wish to be Dead: Person endorses thoughts about a wish to be dead or not alive anymore, or wish to fall asleep and not wake up. Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up? 2) Suicidal Thoughts: General non -specific thoughts of wanting to end one 's life/die by suicide, \"I've thought about killing myself \" without general thoughts of ways to kill oneself/associated methods, intent, or plan. Have you actually had any thoughts of killing yourself? If YES to 2, ask questions 3, 4, 5, and 6. If NO to 2, go directly to question 6. 3) Suicidal Thoughts with Method (without Specific Plan or Intent to Act): Person endorses thoughts of suicide and has thought of a least one method during the assessment period. This is different than a specific plan with time, place or method de- tails worked out. \"I thought about taking an overdose but I never made a specific plan as to when where or how I would actually do it ....and I would never go through with it. \" Have you been thinking about how you might do this? 4) Suicidal Intent (without Specific Plan): Active suicidal thoughts of killing oneself and patient reports having some intent to act on such thoughts , as opposed to \"I have the thoughts but I definitely will not do any- thing about them .\" Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them? 5) Suicide Intent with Specific Plan: Thoughts of killing oneself with details of plan fully or partially worked out and person has some intent to carry it out. Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself? Do you intend to carry out this plan? 6) Suicide Behavior Question: Have you ever done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life? Examples: Collected pills, obtained a gun, gave away valuables, wrote a will or suicide note, took out pills but didn 't swallow any, held a gun but changed your mind or it was grabbed from your hand, went to the roof but didn 't jump; or actually took pills, tried to shoot your- self, cut yourself, tried to hang yourself, etc. If YES, ask: Were any of these in the past 3 months? Lifetime Past 3 Months Suicide Risk Assessment At VPH all patients are assessed for suicide risk using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale; a questionnaire used for suicide assessment developed by multiple institutions with NIMH support. The scale is evidence -based and is part of a national and international public health initiative involving the assessment of suicidality. To use the CSSRS, ask the following standard questions. The patient 's suicide risk is determined by their answers. 14 The assessment of suicide risk goes beyond the CSSRS. A thorough suicide risk assessment is also based on the identification and appraisal of warning signs, and risk and protective factors that are present. Information rele- vant to the person 's history, experiences, acute condition, present plans / ideation, and available support net- works can all be used to understand the degree of risk. Suicide risk assessment is a multifaceted process for learning about a person, recognizing and addressing their needs and stressors, and working with them to mobilize strengths and supports. The reasons people take their own life are very complex. Factors that influence whether someone is likely to be suicidal are known as: Risk Factors \u2014increase the likelihood of suicidal behavior Protective Factors \u2014decrease the likelihood of suicidal behavior Risk and Protective Factors are often at opposite ends of the same continuum. Protective Factors Strong connection to family and community support Good coping skills and ability to manage conflict Having a sense of belonging and positive self -esteem Cultural connectedness / religious beliefs Future goal orientation Having hobbies or interest in activities Supportive relationships \u2014including relationships with healthcare providers Risk Factors \u2014The SAD PERSONS acronym helps to remember Risk Factors S: Sex (male) A: Age Highest risk are those younger than 19 and older than 45 Highest rate of suicides are in those 65 and older D: Depression P: Previous attempt E: Ethanol abuse R: Rational thinking loss S: Social supports lacking O: Organized plan N: No spouse S: Sickness Additional Risk Factors include impulsivity, aggression / agitation, anxiety, abnormal sleep, seeking access to means, talking / writing about wishing to die, hopelessness, increasing substance abuse, withdrawing from loved ones, expressing lack of purpose, interpersonal losses, financial difficulties, and recent traumatic event. Suicide Risk Assessment Considerations 15 Suicide Risk Assessment Considerations (continued) When assessing a patient 's risk for self -harm or suicide, it is of the utmost importance to directly inquire about thoughts of death or suicide. Asking direct questions does not increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or actions; and can lower the risk as it allows for therapeutic interventions. If suicidal ideation is identified, assess the following factors: Suicidal intent \u2014is the ideation passive (meaning the person desires to die, but doesn 't have a specific plan) or active (meaning there is a plan). Are the thoughts fleeting, persistent, or intrusive? Plan \u2014does the patient have a specific plan? What are the details? How lethal is the method? Means \u2014does the patient have access to the means to complete the plan? Previous suicidal behavior \u2014what was the timing, length of time since the behavior, previous method, level of intent, and consequences of the actions? Violence Risk Assessment We utilize the Broset Violence Checklist to assess for risk of violence. The Broset Violence Checklist (BVC) is a 6 item risk assessment tool that helps predict the potential for violent behavior. It assesses the 6 most common behaviors exhibited by patients who are likely to become violent: Confusion Irritability Boisterousness Verbal Threats Physical Threats Attacking Objects Specific care decisions are made in collaboration with the healthcare team based on the patient 's BVC score. Early interventions can often prevent outbursts of agitation and violence. Safety \u2014Observation Precautions It is the policy of VPH to provide the level of care required to protect patient and staff safety Observation precaution levels are ordered upon admission and routinely reviewed by the treatment team using tools such as the CSSRS, the BVC, and the Edmonson Falls Risk Assessment. Precaution level can be increased immediately due to an imminent risk by the RN. The RN will contact the physician to place an order for the increased level. The precaution level can only be lowered after assessment by the physician, who will order the new level. All team members are responsible for educating patients on the ordered precaution level and rationale for the ordered precautions. 16 17 Precaution Levels: Policy: Patient Observation Precautions (SOP) Precaution levels are ordered based on: - Suicide risk - Violence risk - Self-injurious behavior - Fall risk - Elopement risk - Unstable medical condition - Behavior that damages property - Sexual behavior - Use of medical equipment - Cognition - Requirement for use of a medical bed Observation Precautions Every 15 Minute Checks Every 15 minute checks (Q15min) - for patients at minimal level of risk due to suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, or other concerns of self -harm. Staff make visual contact with the patient every 15 minutes. All checks are documented. Continuous Observation Visual Observation (Eyesight) - for patients who are not at imminent risk, but at an elevated risk. The patient is always in the line of sight of an assigned staff mem- ber. Arm 's Length (1:1) - for patients who are an imminent risk of harm to self or others. The patient is always within arm 's reach of the assigned staff mem- ber. This can be ordered as strict \"1:1\" (at arm 's length at all times) or \"1:1, eyesight if asleep \" (at arm 's length while awake and in line of sight while asleep). Guidelines for Continuous Observation Observation pertains to all areas of the hospital including bathroom areas, pa- tient rooms, group & multi -purpose rooms, cafeteria, courtyard, gym, and ECT. When the patient is using the restroom, a staff member of the same identified gender must be present. If a staff member of same identified gender is not avail- able, then two staff members must be present. Eyesight zones can be utilized when multiple patients on eyesight precautions are in one area together. One staff member assigned to the zone is responsible for all eyesight patients. If one patient needs to leave the zone, another staff member must take over the assignment for that patient. Unit Restrictions This precaution is ordered for patients who are unable to demonstrate safe be- havior outside the hospital unit. This level of precaution is ordered in addition to the observation level (Q15min, Eyesight, or 1:1) Seclusion and Restraint Policy Restraint / Seclusion Management # CL 30 -04.18 18 Seclusion and Restraint All our patients have the right to be free from unnecessary restraint and se- clusion. Restraints and seclusion can only be used in emergency situations when needed to ensure physical safety of staff, patients, and visitors. Re- straints and seclusion should only be used when less restrictive interventions are ineffective . When restraints or seclusion are required, we always protect the patient 's rights, dignity, physical, and psychological well -being. Attempts at de -escalation that should be considered before the use of four - point restraints include the following: Verbal de -escalation including verbally requesting cooperation while maintaining a nonaggressive posture and tone of voice Calling for additional staff or VUPD to have a supportive presence nearby that is visible to the patient Redirecting and/or diverting the patient's attention from the focus of agitation Separating the patient from others Offering medications as ordered VPH Philosophy on the Use of Restraint & Seclusion VPH has established an organizational commitment to prevent, reduce, and strive to eliminate the use of restraint and seclusion. To achieve our goals, the staff have adopted the following principles: Preventing emergencies that have the potential to lead to the use of re- straint and seclusion is the most effective way to minimize the use. Therefore, all direct care staff receive training in the underlying causes of threatening behaviors and how their own behaviors can affect patients. Non-physical interventions are always the preferred intervention. This may include redirecting the patient 's focus or verbal de -escalation. All direct care staff receive training in the use of de -escalation, mediation, self-protection, and other techniques. Obtain information at admission that can minimize the use of restraint / seclusion including techniques that have helped the patient in the past. Remember that over 90% of patients in the inpatient mental health setting have a history of trauma and that restraint / seclusion can cause a re - experiencing of that trauma. The use of restraint and seclusion is limited to emergencies in which there is an imminent risk of a patient physically harming themselves or others. Consider how a patient 's age, developmental stage, gender issues, ethnicity, and history of physical or sexual abuse may affect the way they react to physical contact. As early as possible in the restraint / seclusion process, make the patient aware of the rationale for the re- straint / seclusion and the behavior criteria for its discontinuation (ex: contract for safety, cessation of verbal threats). Restraint / seclusion is discontinued as soon as the patient meets the behavior criteria. The patient 's emergency contact is notified at the time of the restraint / seclusion. Always remember that restraint / seclusion have the potential to produce serious consequences such as: Physical or psychological harm Loss of dignity Violation of a patient 's rights Death Definitions Physical Escort : Using a light grasp to escort a patient to a desired location. If the patient can easily remove or escape the grasp, it is not a physical restraint. If the patient cannot easily remove or escape the grasp, it is a physical restraint. Seclusion : Any involuntary confinement of a patient alone in a room or area where they are physically prevented from leav- ing. This includes situations where a staff member physically prevents the patient from leaving or gives the per- ception that threatens the patient with physical intervention if they attempt to leave the room. The standards of seclusion do not apply to: Time Outs (must be voluntary) Visitation in which patients and visitors are restricted to a designated area consistent with unit rules for the purposes of infection control, security, patient privacy, or disruption of treatment Forensic restrictions and restrictions imposed by correctional authorities for security purposes Restraint : Physical Restraint / Hold: Any manual or physical holding of the patient against the patient 's will that restricts freedom of movement or normal access to one 's body. The Physical Restraint Technique (PRT) used with our behavioral management system Handle With Care is considered a physical restraint and should be documented as such. For example, holding a patient to give a forced psychotropic medication in a manner that restricts their movement is a physical restraint. Considerations for Seclusion and Restraint 19 Mechanical Restraint: The application or use of any mechanical device, material, or equipment attached to the patient 's body that restricts freedom of movement or normal access to their body as a result of the material or equipment attached or adjacent to the patient 's body. This can include using Geri -chairs if the patient cannot easily remove the restraint appliance and get out of the chair on their own. \"Easily remove \" means that the de- vice or material can be removed intentionally by the patient in the same manner as it was applied by the staff. Time Out : A process (patient initiated or directed by staff) in which the patient is provided an opportunity to calm down and / or regain control voluntarily through quiet disengagement from immediate stressors. During time out, the patient is not physically prevented from leaving the designated area. The patient and staff collaboratively deter- mine when the patient has regained self -control and is able to return to the treatment milieu. When staff do not permit the patient to leave the room because the patient thinks they are calm but the staff disagree, then then time out becomes a seclusion. Physical holds are considered a form of restraint and follow all of the guide- lines and documentation requirements of a mechanical restraint. Debriefing after Restraints or Seclusions We recognize there is an emotional impact after a restraint or seclusion and the goal of a debriefing is to support all people involved, start healing, and evaluate the process. Who Staff The patient / patients involved The patients who observed \u2014talk about what happened, let them know they are safe, and allow them to process feelings triggered by the event What Debriefing provides an opportunity to learn from the process, honor the people who went through the process, and involve them in solutions. Discuss: Who was involved? What happened? Where did it happen? Why did it happen? What did we learn? Why Debriefing allows a safe discussion of issues, mistakes, misunderstandings, and allows for self -assessment. It identifies needs of the unit and / or staff involved and encourages problem solving. 20 21 The goals of debriefing: To reverse or minimize the negative effects of the use of restraint / seclusion by: Evaluating the physical and emotional impact on all involved Identifying the need and provide processing or support for the peo- ple involved for any trauma that may have occurred To prevent future restraints / seclusions How Remember to respect each other 's emotions, to keep facts separate, and to ad- dress physical and emotional needs of patients and staff. Set Ground Rules Voluntary, confidential, no one forced to talk Respectful communication (emotional safety) Close meeting after it starts Questions for Staff What were the first signs? Did staff notice and respond to signs? Could the trigger for conflict have been prevented, or not? How was conflict in the environment minimized? What de -escalation techniques were used? What worked and what did not? If the intervention was ineffective, what else was tried? Did the restraint / seclusion happen only in response to imminent danger, or not? Was the restraint / seclusion applied safely, or not? Was the patient released as soon as possible, or not? What would you do differently next time? How could a similar situation be avoided in the future? What emotional impact does putting someone in restraints have on you? What was your emotional state at the time of the escalation? Questions for the Patient What were you feeling before the event happened? What did you need that you weren 't getting? What upset you most? What did we do that was helpful? What did we do that got in the way? What can we do better next time to help you? Is there anything you could do differently next time to help yourself?
