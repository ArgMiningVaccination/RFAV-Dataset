W OOL Counsel of Record AIMEE H. W AGSTAFF ANDRUS WAGSTAFF , COUNTERSTATEMENT OF QUESTIONS PRESENTED In Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC , this Court held that the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenti- cide Act (FIFRA) does not preempt state-law causes of action that parallel or ar e narrower than the federal statute's misbranding standard. 544 U.S. 431, 447 (2005). That is so even if \"properly instructed juries might on occasion reach con trary conclusions\" than the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \"on a similar issue of misbranding.\" Id. at 452. The district court found that California's failure- to-warn law is narrower than the federal misbranding standard, and it properly instructed the jury on that claim. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Petitioner does not challenge the lower courts' in terpretation of California law or the jury instruction on the failure-to-warn claim. The questions presented are: 1. Did the Ninth Circuit correctly apply Bates in holding that California's failure-to-warn requirement is not preempted where state law is equivalent to or narrower than FIFRA's mi sbranding provision? 2. Does the Ninth Circuit, like all other circuits, follow Rule 702 in requiring every expert to utilize re- liable methodologies, and to reliably apply those meth-odologies to the fact s of the case? ii TABLE OF CONTENTS Page COUNTERSTATEMENT OF QUESTIONS PRE- SENTED ........................................................... i TABLE OF AUTHORITIES ................................. iv INTRODUCTION ................................................ 1 COUNTERSTATEMENT OF FACTS .................. 5 A.

This request for error correction is unworthy of re- view. Petitioner cannot identify any appellate deci-sion\u2014state or federal\u2014that disagrees with the Ninth Circuit's fact-bound application of governing precedent of this Court . If, as Petitioner claims, the issues are so important, they will arise again. Further percolation is likely to yield agreement rather than discord among the Courts of Appeals because the Ninth Circuit's judg-ment is plainly correct. Regardless, this Court should not depart from its normal practice of eschewing re- view of decisions that no other appellate court disa-grees with. 1. As to the first question (regarding federal preemption), all appellate courts agree that, under this Court's decision in Bates v. Dow Agrosciences , 544 U.S. 431 (2005), there is no express preemption of failure-to-warn claims involving Roundup. That is no surprise, given Bates ' holding that the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) does not preempt state-law failure-to-warn claims that are substantiv ely equivalent to, or nar- rower than, federal misbranding requirements. See id. at 447. As the lower court recognized, the core teaching of Bates is that EPA's approval of a pesticide's label 2 does not mean the pesticide satisfies federal misbrand- ing requirements. App.14a. To the contrary, where, as here, a plaintiff proves that a herbicide is dangerous to human health, the manufacturer can be found in vio-lation of both state and federal law. And there is no split of authority at all as to whether federal law impliedly preempts such claims\u2014 all courts agree: it does not. That, too, is no surprise, given that the text of FIFRA forecloses any inquiry into implied preemption. See Bates , 544 U.S. at 459 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). Even if implied preemption did exist under FIFRA, Monsanto's argument would fail because, as the Ninth Circuit held, it principally rests on a two- page, post-verdict letter from EPA's Office of Pesticide Program (OPP Letter) that lacks the force of law. App.16a. That aside, the letter has no bearing here be- cause it merely told pe sticide registrants that\u2014 con- trary to EPA decisions from a few months earlier \u2014they cannot change their product labels \"where the only ba- sis for the warning is glyphosate.\" App.197a (emphasis added). The letter says nothing about the unique risks posed by glyphosate and various other ingredients that combine to form Roundup. Monsanto's other implied preemption argument relates to EPA's pre-approva l authority over changes to pesticide labels, which Monsanto says creates a ba- sis for a finding of impossibility preemption under PLIVA v. Mensing , 564 U.S. 604 (2011), because EPA 3 would supposedly never approve a cancer warning on Roundup\u2014even though it has already approved can- cer warnings on glyphosate-based formulations like Roundup several times in the past and might do so again in the future. Putting aside the counterfactual premise at the core of this argument, Mo nsanto's argument fails be- cause Bates itself involved a situation where, as here, the EPA had approved a pesticide label, yet this Court found that the plaintiffs' failure-to-warn claims would not be preempted so long as the state-law tort standard was equivalent to FIFRA's misbranding requirement (an issue left for remand). See 544 U.S. at 453-454. Monsanto also ignores that FIFRA includes a pro- vision stating that \"[i]n no event shall registration of an article be construed as a defense for the commission of any offense under\" FIFRA. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 includes approval label\u2014 doesn't mean the pesticide co mplies with federal law, then why should a lawsuit challenging that label as in- adequate under state law necessarily conflict with FIFRA? Short answer: it doesn't. 2. The second question presented by Monsanto\u2014 whether the Ninth Circuit applied a \"uniquely lenient\" standard when affirming the district court's admission of certain expert testimony (in purported conflict with Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc ., 509 U.S. 579 (1993))\u2014is equally unworthy of this Court's review. 4 First, contrary to Monsanto's argument, there is no split of authority as to the proper standard for eval- uating the admissibility of the expert testimony at is- sue here. What Monsanto fails to tell the Court is that the Ninth Circuit itself explicitly rejected Monsanto's suggestion that its Daubert approach is more lenient than that of other jurisdictions, holding that \"[it] is not an outlier following a more flexible Daubert approach than other circuits.\" App.24a-25a. Monsanto also fails to acknowledge that, in up- holding the district cou rt's admissibility determina- tions, the Ninth Circuit found support for its ruling in decisions issued by the other, supposedly \"stricter,\" ju- risdictions cited by Monsanto. Id. That alone defeats Monsanto's effort to transform the Ninth Circuit's rul-ing into a vehicle worthy of this Court's review. Monsanto's Daubert arguments are also fatally flawed as a factual matter. Monsanto repeatedly in- sists that Respondent's experts \"relied on little more than subjective intuitions rather than the reliable ap-plication of scientific principles.\" Pet.(i); see also Pet.27. In fact, as the district court determined in its Daubert rulings (which are chronicled in over a hundred pages of written decisions on both general and specific cau- sation, see App.91a; App.79a), the expert testimony at issue was grounded in reliable scientific principles and passed the Daubert threshold of reliability. Id. As the Ninth Circuit held, there was no error in the admission 5 of this testimony, let alone an error of such dimensions as to warrant review by this Court. --------------------------------- --------------------------------- COUNTERSTATEMENT OF FACTS A. Statutory Framework FIFRA requires pesticide manufacturers to regis- ter their products with the EPA. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136a(a). But registration of a pesticide does not confer an uncondi- tioned right to sell a federa lly registered pesticide. Ra- ther, FIFRA gives states the authority to \"regulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(a). This broad delegation includes the authority to \"ban the sale of a pesticide if [such a state] finds, for instance, that one of the pesticide's label- approved uses is unsafe.\" Bates , 544 U.S. at 446 (citing 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(a)). Nor does federal registration mean that a pesti- cide and its labeling comply with FIFRA. FIFRA states that \"[i]n no event shall registration of an article be construed as a defense for the commission of any of-fense under this subchapter. \" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136a(f )(2). Un- der FIFRA, registration of a pesticide is merely \"prima facie evidence that the pesticide, its labeling and pack-aging comply with the registration provisions of the subchapter.\" Id. EPA can bring various enforcement actions against the manufacturer of a register ed pesticide if it deter- mines that the product is \"misbranded,\" including 6 seeking civil and criminal penalties. Bates , 544 U.S. at 439 & n.11 (citation omitted). A duly registered pesti- cide is misbranded if, inter alia, the label \"does not con- tain adequate instructions for use, or if its label omits necessary warnings or cautionary statements.\" Id. at 438 (citation omitted). FIFRA's only relevant limitation on state au- thority is set forth in the Act's preemption clause: 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(b). As Bates explained, this provision is \"narrow.\" 544 U.S. at 452. Although Section 136v(b) \"reaches beyond positive enactments . . . to embrace common-law duties,\" id. at 443, it \"prohibits only state- law labeling and packaging requirements that are 'in addition to or different from' the labeling and packag- ing requirements under FIFRA.\" Id. at 447 (quoting 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(b) (emphasis in original)). B. Regulatory History Monsanto's Petition contains two central errors regarding the nature of Roundup and its regulatory history that warrant discussion at the outset. 1. The Petition tries to obscure the distinction between Roundup, which is a combination of glypho- sate and other chemicals, with its active ingredient glyphosate, suggesting that the two terms can accu- rately be used \"interchangeably.\" Pet.6 n.1. But, as Respondent proved at trial, Monsanto's own scientists understood that Roundup and glypho- sate have vastly disparate toxicological profiles. See 7 App.44a-45a; see also App.42a & n.18. In fact, a 2003 internal email from a Monsanto toxicologist admitted that \"[t]he terms glyphosate and Roundup cannot be used interchangeably.\" C.A.P.E.R.257.1 The toxicolo- gist, who also served as Monsanto's chief glyphosate spokesperson, likewise admitted that \"you cannot say that Roundup is not a carcinogen . . . [because] we have not done the necessary testing on the formulation to make that statement.\" App.45a. Years later, in 2009, the same toxicologist again acknowledged that \"you cannot say that Roundup does not cause cancer . . . [be- cause] with 'Roundup'.\" App.42a n.18. Accordingly, Monsanto's contentions that the terms \"Roundup\" and \"glyphosate\" can be used inter-changeably, and that studies regarding glyphosate are dispositive as to the carcinogenicity of Roundup, were specifically disproven at trial. As explained below, those contentions are also co ntrary to EPA's own views on the matter. 2. Monsanto also falsely contends that \"EPA has repeatedly concluded that [a cancer warning on Roundup] is not appropriate.\" Pet.(i); see also Pet.3 a cancer warning on Roundup); Pet.21 (\"EPA would unquestionably reject a cancer warning for Roundup's labeling.\"). 1 \"E.R.\" refers to Monsanto's Excerpts of Record filed in this Court. \"C.A.E.R.\" refers to Monsan to's Excerpts of Record in the Court of Appeals. \"C.A.P.E.R.\" re fers to Petitioner's Excerpt of Record in the Court of Appeals. 8 In truth, Monsanto has never proposed any warn- ing on Roundup regarding the potential carcinogenic- ity of glyphosate-based formulations, and EPA has never rejected one. The OPP Letter at the center of Monsanto's argument actually establishes that EPA has allowed cancer warnings to be included on various glyphosate-based formulations like Roundup\u2014a fact the United States confirmed in its amicus brief to the Ninth Circuit. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae Supporting Defendant-Appellant at 17, Mon- santo Co. v. Hardeman , No. 19-16636 (9th Cir. Dec. 20, 2019). 2 The OPP Letter, moreover, merely concerns glyphosate , Roundup's active ingredient, not Roundup itself. As explained below, EPA has never made any for-mal findings as to the carcinogenicity of Roundup. In- stead, over the past 40 years, EPA has only reviewed and considered the carcinogenicity of glyphosate, and it has repeatedly stated that it lacks sufficient data to determine whether glyphosate-based formulations\u2014 such as Roundup\u2014pose any risk to human health. 3 2 The OPP Letter can be found at App.195a-197a. It specifi- cally stated that EPA will \" no longer approve labeling that in- cludes the Proposition 65 warning statement on glyphosate-containing products.\" Id. (emphasis added). 3 In 1985, an EPA review of a mouse study found \"[g]lypho- sate was oncogenic in male mice,\" causing rare tumors, and clas- sified glyphosate as a possible human carcinogen. App.4a. EPA later changed that classification based in part on new evidence submitted by Monsanto\u2014evidence that turned out to have been falsified, as Respondent proved at trial. See Edwin Hardeman's 9 Thus, in 2017, as part of its re-registration review of glyphosate, EPA acknowledged this distinction, not- ing that \"farmers and other applicators apply formula- tions , not the active ingredient alone .\" EPA, Revised Glyphosate Issue Paper 137 (Dec. 12, 2017) (emphasis added), http://tinyurl.com/eparevdglyphosate. The agency acknowledged a need for additional research \" to deter- mine whether formulation co mponents, such as surfac- tants, increase the toxicity of glyphosate formulations .\" Id. at 144 (emphasis added) . EPA said the same thing in April 2019\u2014shortly after the jury verdict in this case\u2014when the agency published its 2019 Interim Glyphosate Review. EPA, Glyphosate: Proposed Interi m Registration Review De- cision 11 (Apr. 2019), http ://tinyurl.com/y6h2u8w6. There, EPA again acknowledged that it had not made any conclusions as to whether glyphosate \"formula- tions,\" like Roundup, pose any risks to human health. See id. at 11 (emphasis added). To this day, EPA still has not reached any conclu- sions as to the carcinogenicity of glyphosate-based for- mulations like Roundup. C. District Court Proceedings This appeal arises out of the only federal trial re- garding Roundup. After re gularly spraying concen- trated Roundup for 26 years, Respondent Edwin Principal and Response Brief at 33-35, Hardeman v. Monsanto Co., Nos. 19-16636, 19-16708 (9th Cir. Mar. 16, 2020). 10 Hardeman, was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (\"NHL\"). Hardeman sued Monsanto in February 2016, alleging his cancer was caus ed by his long-term expo- sure to Roundup. 1. The Daubert Hearings After denying Monsanto's pre-trial motion to dis- miss based on federal preemption, the district court conducted a week of Daubert hearings on whether Roundup can cause cancer generally (general causa- tion), which were videotaped so they could be used by judges in other cases agai nst Monsanto involving Roundup. App.98a n.4. In July 2018, the court issued a comprehensive, 67-page opinion on general causation. ER49-116. The court examined each discrete line of evidence in de- tail, and individually ev aluated the strengths and weaknesses of every epidemiological study. The court ultimately held that \"the plaintiffs have presented ev-idence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that glyphosate can cause NHL at human relevant doses.\" App.179a-180a. After defeating summary judgment at the general- causation stage, Monsant o moved for summary judg- ment again, arguing that Hardeman's specific-causa- tion experts' opinions did not satisfy Daubert . response, the district court again held Daubert hear- ings with live testimony from three specific causation experts. Based on the evidence presented, the district 11 court denied Monsanto's motion for summary judg- ment. App.79a. 2. The Trial At Monsanto's request, the trial was \"reverse- bifurcated\" into two phases: the first causation (whether Roundup caused Hardeman's NHL); the second on liability and damages. App.7a-8a. After Phase One, the jury found that \"Mr. Harde- man prove[d] by a preponderance of the evidence that his exposure to Roundup was a substantial factor in causing his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\" C.A.E.R.1710. After Phase Two, the jury found Monsanto failed to warn of Roundup's risks , that \"Monsanto was neg- ligent by not [non-Ho dgkin's lymphoma] that Roundup was that Mr. Har- deman proved by \"clear and convincing evidence that he is entitled to punitive damages.\" C.A.E.R.1680-1681. The jury awarded Hardeman roughly $5 million in compensatory damages and $75 million in punitive damages\u2014later remitted to $20 million, bringing the total verdict to roughly $25 million. App.10a-11a. 12 D. The Decision Below The Ninth Circuit affirmed. App.1a-69a. The panel first held that FIFRA neither expressly nor impliedly preempts Hardeman's failure-to-warn claims. App.11a. that \"[b]ecause FIFRA's misbranding requirements paral-lel those of California's claims e ffectively enforce FIFRA's re- and are thus not ex-pressly preempted.\" App.13a. In so ruling, the panel held that \"EPA's approval of a label\u2014one step in a larger registration process\u2014 is not conclusive of FIFRA compliance.\" App.14a. Ra- ther, the court observed, \"FIFRA specifies: In no event shall registration of an arti cle be construed as a de- fense for the commission of any offense under this sub- chapter.\" Id. Nor, in the panel's view, did the 2019 OPP Letter from a subdivision of EPA possess any power to trigger express preemption under FIFRA, because that letter \"was issued without any written notice, gave no hear- ing or opportunity to respon d, and lacked any sort of dispute-resolution process\"\u2014and thus lacked any force of law. App.17a. As to implied preemption, the Ninth Circuit held that \"[b]ecause Monsanto could comply with both FIFRA and California law, FIFRA did not impliedly 13 preempt Hardeman's state failure-to-warn claims.\" App.18a. On this point, the court did not address Harde- man's argument that FIFRA itself, as construed in Bates , entirely forecloses any inquiry into implied preemption. Instead, the Cou rt addressed the merits of the issue, rejecting Monsanto's effort to shoehorn this case into PLIVA v. Mensing , 564 U.S. (2011), which exclu-sive control over generic-drug labeling. App.20a. Regarding PLIVA , the court observed, first, that FIFRA's concurrent state/federal pesticide labeling re- gime is a \"far cry\" from the strict regulatory regime ap- plicable to prescription drugs under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). App.20a. Unlike the FDA, which forbids generic drug manufacturers from making any label changes without prior agency au- thorization, EPA \"permits pesticide manufacturers to make certain changes to labels without prior ap- proval\"\u2014including adding cancer warnings. App.20a & n.10. Indeed, the panel emphasized, \"EPA has repeat- edly permitted pesticide manufacturers to use the no- tification procedure to add no tices related to cancer to their products' labels.\" App.21a. \"Thus,\" the court con- c drug manufacturers in PLIVA , pesticide manufacturers ' can act sufficiently independently under federal law' when amending a la- bel.\" App.21a (citing PLIVA , 564 U.S. at 623; emphasis added). 14 The court also rejected Monsanto's argument that EPA's 2017 Revised Glyphosate Issue Paper and the 2019 OPP Letter created a basis for impossibility pre- emption, finding that the OPP Letter lacked the force of law and that neither act ion \"divert[s] Monsanto to a different process for amending a label beyond those normally followed by pesticide manufacturers under FIFRA and its regulations.\" App.21a. The panel ultimately concluded that \"[c]onsider- ing the responsibility FIFRA places on manufacturers to update pesticide labels and [the fact] that EPA has allowed pesticide manufacturers to add cancer warn-ings to labels through the notification process without prior approval, it is not impossible for Monsanto to add a cancer warning to Roundup's label.\" App.21a-22a (ci-tations omitted). 2. As to the district court's Daubert rulings, the Ninth Circuit unanimously held that it is \"not an out- lier following a more flexible Daubert approach than other circuits.\" App.24a. The panel applied the univer-sal standard for admissibility under Rule 702 and Daubert : \"expert testimony must be reliable to be ad- missible.\" App.22a. It then conducted a detailed review of the general and specific causation opinions of multi- ple experts. App.22a. The panel held that the district court applied the correct legal standard for evaluating the admissibility of expert testimony but was incorrect in its belief that the Ninth Circuit applies a more flex- ible Daubert approach than other circuits. App.26a. 15 The panel also rejected the district court's sugges- tion that the Ninth Circuit is more deferential to ex- pert opinions in close cases. App.24a; 26a. To illustrate this point, the panel compared its own precedent to cases from other circuits in volving injuries with high background rates of idiopathy, finding that the differ- ent outcomes owed to different facts, not a disparity in the Daubert standard or its application. App.24a-25a. On the merits, the pan el performed an exhaustive review of the general caus ation evidence, concluding that Hardeman's experts' opinions \"were sufficiently supported by reliable epidemiological evidence\" and were therefore properly admitted. App.33a. The court observed that Hardeman's multiple experts relied upon epidemiological studies showing statistically significant associations, fu lly adjusted for the possi- bility of confounding by other pesticides. App.31a; 82a. The panel then found that the reliability of the epidemiological studies was further corroborated by the experts' reliance upon animal studies showing glyphosate causes cancer in rodents and cell studies showing Roundup is genotoxic to human lymphocytes. App.28a. The panel also found that Hardeman's experts reliably discounted the on e epidemiological study Monsanto's experts predica ted their defense upon. App.29a. The court observed that the study was criti- cized by Monsanto's own scientists (prior to litigation) on grounds that \"resemble[ d] those from Hardeman's experts.\" App.30a. The pan el concluded that these 16 opinions fell within \"the range where experts might reasonably differ.\" App.30a. On specific causation, the panel held that Dr. Den- nis Weisenburger's differential diagnosis, including his opinion \"ruling out\" idiopathy, was reliable. App.33a; 36a. reliably Roundup as a pote ntial cause of Hardeman's NHL on the basis of the epidemiological evidence (in- cluding studies adjusted for confounding by other pes-ticides), toxicology studies, c ell studies, his review of the medical records, and his own clinical experience. App.36a. The court held that, \"as a whole,\" the evi-dence Dr. Weisenburger relied upon provided a suffi- cient basis for reliably ruling out idiopathy.\" App.36a. The court likewise found that Dr. Weisenburger's ex-clusion of hepatitis C to be reliable. Id. The court ulti- mately found that, as with general causation, the district court did not err in allowing the testimony of Hardeman's specific-causation experts. --------------------------------- --------------------------------- REASONS FOR DENYING REVIEW I. THE NINTH CIRCUIT'S PREEMPTION DECISION IS NOT WORTHY OF THIS COURT'S REVIEW A. There is No Conf lict On the Preemption Question 1. The preemption issue decided below has only been the subject of a single federal appellate decision: 17 the Ninth Circuit's decision here. No state high courts have yet weighed in. And as to whether FIFRA expressly preempts a state-law failure-to-warn claim (the first part of the first question presented by Monsanto), this Court re- solved that question in Bates. There is no conflict be- tween the circuits on that point. In fact, every circuit to consider this question is in agreement: EPA ap- proval of a pesticide label does not preempt parallel warnings claims. See Schoenhofer v. McClaskey is not clear that EPA-approved labels can preempt state laws on their own; if anything, Bates suggests the opposite. It iden- tified only two sources of preemption: FIFRA itself and any implementing regulations.\"); Indian Brand Farms, Inc. v. Novartis Crop Prot. Inc ., 617 F.3d 207, 222 (3d Cir. 2010) (\"[T]he remand [in Bates ] established that mere inconsistency between the duty imposed by state law and the content of a manufacturer's labeling ap- proved by the EPA at registration did not necessarily mean that the state law duty was preempted .\"). Recognizing that there is no split in authority, Monsanto pivots to the curious argument that this Court should grant review because all future federal cases will necessarily be de cided as part of the MDL. See Pet.20. That argument is both misguided and self- centered. It is misguide d because an assurance of uniformity in the law is a ground for denying rather than granting certiorari. It is self-centered because 18 it presumes that whether failure-to-warn claims in- volving Roundup are preempted is a question of great national significance worthy of this Court's attention. While that question is surely important to Monsanto , this Court does not serve on e company or show special concern for one product. If the application of Bates to products like Roundup is truly of great national signif-icance, the issue will recur in other cases, in other courts, as applied to other companies' products. And in the unlikely event a split in authority emerges, this Court can step in at that time. There is no \"MDLs-are- special\" reason to depart from this Court's normal standards for cert-worthy petitions. 4 2. Without a split in authority, Monsanto tries to manufacture one by hypothesizing that the Ninth Cir-cuit's application of FIFRA might affect application of wholly unrelated federal statutes involving medical devices. See Pet.18-19. This argument is naked conjecture, not an actual conflict that requires this Court's present attention. And it is incorrect. It is self-evident that different textual provi- sions, read within the context of disparate statutory schemes (involving medical de vices), may well command 4 Federal district courts largel y agree that claims like Re- spondent's are not preempted. See Holyfield v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., No. 1:20-CV-00165-JAR, 2021 WL 1380280, at *2 (E.D. Mo. Apr. 12, 2021) (collecting cases and noting that, \"[s]ince Bates , courts have generally held that FIFRA does not preempt state law claims . . . \"). Moreover, there are many cases similar to Respond-ent's being litigated in state courts around the country. 19 different preemption outcom es than FIFRA. But dif- ferent preemption outcome s hardly qualify as a fu- ture split in judicial authority. Instead, any disparity merely reflects a split in how Congress chose to regu-late products with vastly different benefits and safety profiles\u2014here, to regulate medical devices (which save and improve lives) more ex tensively than pesticides (which are poisons designed to kill living things). It is obvious why Congre ss chose to regulate Class III medical devices more extensively than pesticides. These devices are \"purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustai ning human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing im- pairment of human health.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c(a)(1)(C). Thus, human health concerns weigh on both sides of the scale concerning whether to allow additional state regulation. Hence, in Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc ., 552 U.S. 312 (2008), this Court concluded that Congress delib-erately chose to foreclose compensation of injured per- sons through the state tort system to encourage the manufacture of federally approved devices. Id. FIFRA's structure represents a different legisla- tive choice; it stems from the fact that the products reg-ulated by the statute\u2014insecticides, fungicides, and rodenticides\u2014 cannot , by their very nature, be tested on humans. That fact necess arily limits the ability of regulatory entities (like EPA) to predict, in advance, whether any given product will be hazardous to hu- man health. And in the context of pesticides, unlike medical devices and pharmaceutical drugs, there is no 20 public health concern that can spring from over-warn- ing about the dangers of pesticides. These disparate concerns are reflected in the re- spective preemption provisions of each statute: the preemptive reach of the Medical Device Amendments (the statute at issue in Riegel ) encompasses all state regulation of \"the safety or effectiveness of the device or . . . any other matter U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a)(2). And under the preemption occurs whenever there are \" specific re- quirements applicable to a particular device .\" Riegel , 522 U.S. at 322 (emphasis a dded) (citing 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 808.1). Therefore, this Co urt that \"when Con- gress enacted 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 360k, it was primarily con- cerned with the problem of specific , conflicting state statutes and regulations rather than the general du- ties enforced by common-law actions.\" Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr 518 U.S. 470, 489 (1996) (emphasis added). By contrast, FIFRA's preemptive reach is limited by its text to only general labeling or packaging require- ments. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(b). And in any event, if there is confusion about appli- cation of preemption for medical devices, that confu-sion should be addressed in a case involving the MDA, not FIFRA. 21 B. The Ninth Circuit's Express Preemp- tion Decision Does Not Conflict With Any Rulings of This Court Monsanto also argues that the Ninth Circuit's ex- press preemption ruling conflicts with prior preemp-tion rulings of this Court, including (remarkably) Bates and Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc ., 552 U.S. 312 (2008). See Pet.13-19 . Monsanto is wrong on both counts. 1 . The Ninth Circuit's express preemption ruling is a textbook application of Bates . Just as Bates in- structed, the court compared \"elements of California's duty to warn and FIFRA's misbranding provision\" to determine whether \"they impose parallel require-ments fully consistent with each other . . . \" App .12a (citing Bates , 544 U.S. at 454). The court found that \"be- cause FIFRA's requirement th at a pesticide not be misbranded is consistent with, if not broader than, California's common law duty to warn,\" Hardeman's claims are not preempted. App.11a; see also App.12a- 13a. Monsanto argues, however, that because Bates it- self said that \"a state-la w labeling requirement must in fact be equivalent to a requirement under FIFRA in order to survive pre-emption ,\" 544 U.S. at 453 (empha- sis added by Monsanto), the Ninth Circuit erred by not considering OPP's 2019 Letter and EPA's registration of glyphosate to be \"federal requirements\" within the meaning of FIFRA. Here again, Monsanto's argument cannot be squared with Bates ' actual holding that, pursuant to 22 FIFRA's text, the only federal \"requirements\" that have the power to preem pt are FIFRA's misbranding standard and duly promulgated \"regulations.\" See 544 U.S. at 543; see also 544 U.S. at 445 (holding that \"[a] requirement is a rule of law that must be obeyed.\").5 Bates ' holding makes sense because it limits FIFRA's preemptive reach to agency actions that actu- ally possess the force of law. If Monsanto were correct, a court confronted with a FIFRA preemption argument would have to consider any agency action, no matter how informal or tentative, that \"in fact\" might be un- dermined by the plaintiff 's state-law claims, even if that action does not possess any force of law. Put another way, Monsanto's reading would give unelected officials the power to preempt without fol- lowing any formal procedure, sometimes even through mere inaction. Not only is that contrary to Bates itself, but it also violates this Court's repeated holdings that informal agency actions do not possess the power to preempt. See, e.g. , Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. v. 5 The example from Bates that Monsanto cites in its brief (at 14) concerns a specific EPA regulation , not an informal agency action like the OPP Letter, which clearly lacks the power to preempt. See Bates , 544 U.S. at 453 (citing 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 156.64 (2004)); App.17a (holding that OPP Letter lacks force of law). EPA's determination regarding glyphosate likewise lacks the power to preempt; as the Ninth Ci rcuit held, \"[e]ven if [that de- termination] stems from more formal procedures, it . . . was made as part of EPA's registration decision, which only supports pre-sumptive (not conclusive) compliance with FIFRA.\" Id. Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine , 537 U.S. 51, 65 (2002). 2. The Ninth Circuit's express preemption ruling is also consistent with this Court's ruling in Riegel , 552 U.S. 312, which involved a Class III medical device. Monsanto argues that the Nin th Circuit ran afoul of Riegel because, there, this Court, interpreting the MDA, held that device-specific federal requirements regarding a medical device\u2014the FDA's pre-market ap-proval of a specific pacemaker\u2014preempted state tort claims. In Monsanto's view, Riegel should apply with equal force in the pesticid e context, where it would have mandated a finding of preemption based on EPA's pesticide-specific decision to approve Roundup without a cancer warning. This argument, if correct, would mean that Bates itself was wrongly decided, because Bates found that EPA's approval of a specific herbicide did not preempt state-law failure-to-warn claims challenging the herb- icide's label. That aside, Monsanto's argument fails be- cause pesticides are govern ed by FIFRA, not the MDA. And FIFRA\u2014unlike the MDA\u2014says that tration of a pesticide merely constitutes \"prima facie\" evidence that the pesticide is not misbranded (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(a))\u2014evidence that can be overcome in a federal misbranding or registration-cancellation proceeding. There is no comparable provision in the MDA; in- stead, under that statute, FDA's pre-market approval of a device is dispositive as to the device's statutory compliance. Riegel , 522 U.S. at 323. So\u2014as the Ninth 24 Circuit held here (App.14a n.6)\u2014Monsanto's effort to import Riegel into the pesticide context is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. C. The Ninth Circuit's Implied Preemp- tion Decision Does Not Conflict With Any Rulings of this Court Monsanto has two argument s as to why the Ninth Circuit's implied-preemption ruling conflicts with prior rulings of this Court, both are equally flawed. 1. Monsanto's first argument\u2014that the lower court's implied preemption ruling conflicts with Merck , 139 S. Ct. 166 ( see Pet.21-23)\u2014is easily answered. First, as noted above, Bates itself construed the text of FIFRA as foreclosing any inquiry into implied preemption. See 544 U.S. at 459 (Thomas, J., concur- ring in judgment and dissent ing in part) (noting that the majority's decision \"co mports with this Court's increasing reluctance to expand federal statutes be- yond their terms through doctrines of implied pre-emption.\"). That aside, Monsanto's contention is predicated on the assertion that it present ed \"clear evidence\" to the Ninth Circuit that EPA will \"never\" approve a cancer warning on Roundup\u2014evidence that Monsanto says should have triggered a finding of impossibility pre- emption under Merck . The argument fails for a ll the reasons discussed above: (1) EPA allowed such warnings in the past ( see 25 supra B. Regulatory History 6-9 & n.1); (2) EPA has never formally rejected any such warnings or con- ducted any misbranding or registration-cancellation proceedings as to any product containing such a warn-ing, as FIFRA requires ( see App.14a-15a; App.17a & n.8); and (3) EPA has never reached any conclusions carrying the force of law as to whether Roundup, a glyphosate-based formulation , as opposed to glypho- sate alone, poses any risk to human health; instead, it merely found, in its 2020 Interim Registration Review Decision, that \" glyphosate is not likely to be carcino- genic to humans.\" EPA, Glyphosate: Interim Registra- tion Review Decision 7 (Jan. 2020) (emphasis added), https://tinyurl.com/wnklu3d. And even that decision was tentative: EPA added that it \"will continue to mon- itor the open literature for studies . . . that have the potential to impact the risk evaluation of glyphosate.\" Id. at 7. Accordingly, even if the Court wanted to address the scope of conflict preemption under FIFRA, this case is a poor vehicle for doing so because the question as to which Monsanto seeks review\u2014\"whether FIFRA preempts a state-law failure-to-warn claim where . . . EPA has repeatedly concluded that the warning is not appropriate,\" (Pet.(i))\u2014is not even presented in this case. And, based on this record, the most that can be said is that EPA might reject a cancer warning on Roundup. Even assuming that impossibility preemp-tion exists under FIFRA, the mere \"possibility of im- possibility is not enough.\" Merck , 139 S. Ct. at 1679; see 26 also id. at 1679 (requiring a showing that federal and state laws \"irreconcilably conflic[t]\"). Monsanto tries to overcome this defect by taking aim at the Ninth Circuit's co nclusion that the OPP Let- ter does not have force of law. That is wrong for all the reasons stated by the Ninth Circuit. See App.16a-17a. But even if the OPP Letter did have the force of law, it still could not preempt Hardeman's claim (or an-swer the question as to wh ich Monsanto seeks review) because the letter, by its plain text, speaks only to glyphosate and not Roundup. The letter merely says that EPA will not approve Proposition 65 warnings \"where the only basis for the warning is glyphosate.\" App.197a (emphasis added). But Hardeman's theory of the case was always that Roundup, which is mix- ture of glyphosate and other chemicals, \"is more toxic than glyphosate alone.\" C.A.E.R.2289. And EPA itself has repeatedly said that it lacks sufficient data to determine whether glyphosate-based formulations like Roundup cause cancer. See supra at 8. Thus, the OPP Letter, and EPA's underlying decisions, even taken at face value, do not conflict with the jury's ver- dict in this case. 2. Monsanto also argues (Pet.23) that the Ninth Circuit \"independently erred in concluding that Mon-santo could have unilaterally amended its labeling to include a cancer warning.\" Here again, Monsanto does not claim that there is any conflict on this point am ong the federal appellate or state high courts; instead, it argues that the Ninth 27 Circuit misread the EPA's \"notification\" procedures, which allow changes to be made to a pesticide label without prior agency approval. Pet.24 & n.5. Respond- ent disagrees, but because the Ninth Circuit's opinion did not turn on this point, it is not worth discussing. The issue is obviously not worthy of this Court's re- view. Ironically, Monsanto tries to overcome that fact by suggesting that this part of the Ninth Circuit's ruling conflicts with PLIVA v. Mensing , which expressly cau- tioned against exactly what Monsanto encourages here: \"distort[ing] the Supremacy Clause in order to create similar pre-emption across dissimilar statutory schemes.\" 564 U.S. at 626. law preempts state-law failure-to-warn claims in-volving generic drugs because generic drugs are required to have the same label as brand name drugs. See 564 U.S. at 617-619. As the Ninth Circuit recog- nized, however, FIFRA, unlike the FDCA, provides that EPA's mere approval of a drug label does not insu- late the drug manufacturer from a federal misbrand-ing action. See App.14a (citing 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136a(f )(2)). Accordingly, as this Court recognized in Bates , mere approval of a label cannot prevent states from providing a damages remedy for conduct that violates FIFRA. 544 U.S. at 448. 28 D. Both Bates and FIFRA Itself Disprove the Uniformity Concerns Cited by Mon-santo Monsanto also argues (Pet.24) that \"the scope of FIFRA preemption\" is an issue of \"national im- portance\" because the lower court's ruling threatens FIFRA's overriding goal of ensuring \"uniformity\" of pesticide labeling\u2014and thus review is warranted even in the absence of a lower-court split of authority on preemption. Once again, Monsanto's argument rests on a de- monstrably false premise: that the main goal of FIFRA is to prevent a patchwork of state-law labeling regimes for pesticides. Bates itself rejected that argument out- right, stating that FIFRA's \"clear text\" demonstrates that Congress intended to tolerate even a \"crazy quilt\" of different labeling standards in order to protect the public from dangerous pesticides. See 544 U.S. at 448. What FIFRA prohibits ar e disparate state re- quirements relating to aspects of labels like \"color\" and \"font size,\" not rules of law that parallel misbranding requirements. Bates , 544 U.S. at 452. Accordingly, Monsanto's claim that 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 162.153(e)(5) (delegating labeling authority to states including authority to require supplemental labeling). Moreover, as Justice Breyer wrote in Bates , to the extent \"state tort liability rules\" threaten \"a counter- productive 'crazy-quilt of an ti-misbranding requirements,\" 29 it is EPA, not the courts, that should take appropriate measures. See 544 U.S. at 455 (Breyer, J., concurring). Yet in the 15 years since Bates was decided, EPA has not issued a single regulation or taken any other action with the force of law to su ggest that state tort actions are causing a \"crazy quilt\" of misbranding standards. Id. at 453. That fact alone speaks volumes. * * * In short, the first quest ion presented is not worthy of this Court's review. There is no conflict as to the preemption issue, and because it relates to FIFRA\u2014a singularly unique statute\u2014the re is no risk that the Ninth Circuit's decision will cause confusion among the lower courts as to other statutory schemes. And the uniformity concerns cited by Monsanto are belied by FIFRA itself, which was desi gned to tolerate\u2014and, in- deed, encourage\u2014state tort suits that \"help to expose new dangers associated with pesticides.\" Id. at 451 (ci- tation omitted). That is exactly what the jury verdict accomplished in this case. The decision below should stand. II. THE NINTH CIRCUI T'S FACT-SPECIFIC EVIDENTIARY DECISION TO ADMIT RE- SPONDENT'S EXPERT TESTIMONY IS NOT WORTHY OF THIS COURT'S REVIEW The second question presented rests on an incor- rect premise: that the Ninth Circuit's standard for ad- mitting expert testimony \"departs from other circuits' standards.\" That's incorrect as a matter of law, as the 30 Ninth Circuit held in its decision below. See App.24a (stating that \"this court is not an outlier following a more flexible Daubert approach than other circuits.\"). In reality, the Ninth Circuit applies the same Daubert standard as all other circuits\u2014a fact that Monsanto itself argued in its opening brief below. See First Step Brief of Monsanto Co. at 41, Hardeman v. Monsanto Co. , Nos. 19-16636, 19-16708 (9th Cir. Dec. 13, 2019) (arguing that \"[the Ninth Circuit] does not employ a lower Daubert standard than other cir- cuits.\"). As explained infra at II(A), Monsanto was right With no substantive split to point to, Monsanto's argument devolves into a contention that the Ninth Circuit applies Daubert more leniently than other cir- cuits. But that is not true either. As explained infra at II(C), the Ninth Circuit was not more permissive in its application of the universal Daubert standard than the other circuits cited by Mo nsanto. The panel reached that conclusion as well. App.24a. So the split that Monsanto cl aims is worthy of this Court's review does not actually exist. And without its imagined split, Monsanto is le ft to hypothesize that the Ninth Circuit either does not mean what it says or mis- applied its own rules. This amounts to a request for er-ror correction at best.\u2014That is not a reason for this Court to grant review. 31 A. The Panel Did Not Apply an \"Impermis- sibly Forgiving\" Daubert Standard. Monsanto's first argument Cir- cuit applies an \"impermissibly forgiving\" Daubert standard, in contrast to other federal appellate courts. Pet.29; see also Pet.30 (stating that \"the Ninth Circuit's lenient admissibility standard makes it an outlier among the circuits.\"). In particular, Monsanto argues that the testimony of Ha rdeman's specific causation expert\u2014Dr. Weisenburger\u2014would have been excluded under the Sixth and Tenth Circuits' application of the Daubert standard. See Pet. at 30-31 (citing Tamraz v. Lincoln Electric Co. , 620 F.3d 665 (6th Cir. 2010) and Hall v. Conoco , 886 F.3d 1308 (10th Cir. 2018)). 6 What is most striking about Monsanto's argument is that it fails to address what the Ninth Circuit actu- ally held. As noted above, the panel held that its ap- proach to Daubert is no different from other circuits. See App.24a. Monsanto ignores this holding, citing in- stead to statements from th e district court that the Ninth Circuit expressly rejected . See id. Monsanto tries to bolster its position by pointing to decisions from other circuits that supposedly apply a different standard. See Pet.30 (citing Tamraz and Hall ). In reality, there is no disparity in the legal standards applied in th ose cases. The standard 6 Monsanto's argument that Dr. Weisenburger based his tes- timony on \"unsupported intuitions,\" and that the Ninth Circuit deviated from other circuits in admitting that testimony, is based on a mischaracterization of the record, as explained infra at II(B). 32 under Daubert is always the same: whether \"the principles and methodology used by an expert are grounded in the methods of science.\" App.22a (citing 1049, 1056 (9th Cir. 2003)). Instead, Monsanto points to different outcomes in the cases, as though they demonstrate that the Ninth Circuit applies an \"impermissibly forgiving\" approach. App.29a. But the difference in outcomes is simply due to factual differences among the cases\u2014in particular the absence of epidemiology and other lines of evi- dence\u2014not disparate standards. Consider Tamraz , 620 F.3d 670 (6th Cir. 2010), which Monsanto points to as evidence of other circuits' allegedly stricter approaches to Daubert. Pet.31. After citing Rule 702 and Daubert \u2014the same substantive rules the Ninth Circuit cited to here\u2014the Sixth Circuit rejected the expert's testimony based on a fact-inten- sive evaluation of whether the expert in that case had offered reliable evidence that manganese exposure caused the plaintiff 's injuries. See 620 F.3d at 668-669. The Tamraz expert came up short, in the Sixth Circuit's view, \"because the scientific literature had only hypothesized but did not find a link between chemical and disease,\" App.24a (citing Tamraz at 667- 668). There, unlike this case, there was no epidemio- logical evidence supporting an association between ex- posure and disease, leading that expert to admit that \"he knew of no studies finding a link between [expo- sure and disease]\" and the expert admitted that a key 33 step in his methodology was based on \"speculation.\" Tamraz at 670. Here, by contra st, the experts' opinions were based on reliable epidemiology supporting an as- sociation between exposure and disease and with other powerful lines of evidence, including studies showing that glyphosate-based formulations like Roundup caused chromosomal damage to human lymphocytes and that glyphosate causes cancer in rodent studies. App.8a; see also App.128a-135a (discussing animal and cell studies). Each of Hardeman's experts' testimony was found to be reliably based on sound epidemiology, toxicology, and cell studies, a much different factual scenario than Tamraz . The result in the other case Monsanto relies upon, Hall v. Conoco , 886 F.3d 1308, 1315 (10th Cir. 2018), likewise owes its outcome to different facts. There, as in Tamraz , the Tenth Circuit applied the same sub- stantive Daubert standard as the Ninth Circuit here. See Hall , 866 F.3d at 1311 (\"Before expert testimony can be admitted, the district court must determine that the proposed testimony is reliable.\") (citing Daub- ert). The difference in result was due to the fact that the expert's method of calculating dose was clearly and demonstrably erroneous, resulting in an opinion that incorrectly doubled the plaintiff 's exposure. Id. at 1313-1314. Beyond that, and unlike Dr. Weisenburger here ( see App.33a-34a), the expert in Hall did not even purport to rule out idiopathy. Id. His opinions ulti- mately failed at both stages of his differential diagno- sis: he failed to reliably rule in benzene as a cause and failed to reliably rule out the possibility of idiopathic 34 causes. Id. That's entirely different from what hap- pened in this case where Dr. Weisenburger used relia- ble methods to both rule in Roundup and rule out alternative causes including idiopathy. See App.33a- 36a. Monsanto mischaracterizes the record when it in- sists, based on Hall, that the Ninth Circuit, unlike the Tenth, does not \"require[ ] experts to address 'a large body of contrary epidemiological evidence.' \" Pet.32. Not only did Hardeman's ex perts consider and analyze the single large cohort study Monsanto predicated its entire scientific defense upon, see App.124a-128a, but the district court required an additional round of ex- perts reports, depositions, and Daubert briefing dedi- cated exclusively to that study. App.124a. As the Ninth Circuit observed, moreover, Hardeman's experts con- sidered the study but afforded it less weight on account of the same glaring flaws t hat led Monsanto's own sci- entists to disparage the same study before litigation. App.29a-30a. In sum, Tamraz and Hall merely stand for the un- remarkable proposition that experts must reliably ac- count for alternative causes of an injury when employing a differential diagnosis. Here, Hardeman's experts did just that, relying upon an abundance of sci- entific evidence, and expressly ruling out idiopathy. The difference in outcomes stems from different facts, not different legal standards for evaluating the admis- sibility of expert testimony. 35 B. The Panel Did Not Allow or Endorse the Admission of \"Unsup ported Intuitions\" Founded Only on \"Clinical Experience.\" Because there is no real ci rcuit split as to the ap- plicable Daubert standard, Monsanto tries to manufac- ture one by misrepresenting the Ninth Circuit's ruling as a factual matter. Monsanto predicates the entirety of its Daubert arguments on a demonstrably false premise\u2014that the Ninth Circu it allows experts to tes- tify based only upon \"unsupported intuitions\" so long are in 'clinical experience.' \" Pet.27 (citing App.26a-27a). That is not the Ninth Circuit's rule in this or any other. In reality, the panel did not even purport to admit testimony based solely upon clinical ex perience or \"intuitions,\" especially no t \"as a separate, standalone category, divorced from logic and science.\" App.26a. Ra- ther, as both the district court and the Ninth Circuit observed, all of Hardeman's experts based their opin- ions upon multiple lines of reliable scientific evidence, including epidemiology, toxicology, and cell studies. App.8a; App.107a-137a (discussing each line of evi-dence). In fact, only one expert, Dr. Weisenburger, re- lied upon clinical experience at all, and he did so merely to supplement the larger body of evidence he relied upon including epidemiology, toxicology, and cell studies. App.28a. Monsanto itself eventually concedes this point. Despite repeatedly suggesting that Hardeman's ex- perts relied on nothing more than clinical experience, 36 Monsanto admits that th e Ninth Circuit, by its own terms, \"justif[ied] Weisenburger's testimony on grounds beyond his clinical experience.\" Pet.34. This justification included, as Mo nsanto admits, epidemio- logical evidence showing \"a strong association\" be- tween glyphosate-based formulations like Roundup and NHL. Id. (citing App.35a). Knowing that the Daubert portion of its petition falls apart without this misrepresentation, Monsanto tries to save its argument by contending that Weisen- burger's opinion \"rested partly\" on epidemiological studies \"that did not adjust for exposure to other pes-ticides.\" Pet.34. Thus, according to Monsanto, even though Dr. Weisenburger's opinions were based on more than \"intuition\" rooted in \"clinical experience,\" they are unreliable. Id. Monsanto's argument ignores that, in addition to two limited studies that did not adjust for confounding, Dr. Weisenburger also relied upon epidemiological studies fully adjusted for the possibility of confounding by other pesticides, including findings that people ex- posed to glyphosate-based formulations like Roundup developed NHL at double the rate of the unexposed. App.35a; 31a; 82a. 7 And in any event, the Ninth Circuit 7 Monsanto argued below that a statistically significant more than doubling of risk ( e.g., an odds ratio over 2.0) is an important threshold for proving specific causation. As Monsanto put it, \"[a]n odds ratio exceeding 2. 0 can provide evidence that an individual contracted the disease 'more likely than not' because of the sub-stance.\" See Monsanto Br. 52, Hardeman v. Monsanto Company , Nos. 19-16636, 19-16708 (9th Cir. Dec. 13, 2019). In other words, a statistically significant odds ra tio over 2.0 is reliable evidence 37 specifically addressed the Petition's argument, noting that if Dr. Weisenburger had \"relied only on\" unad- justed studies, his opinions would likely \"have been un- reliable.\" App.35a. But the panel correctly found that Monsanto's version of events \"is not what happened here.\" App.35a. In sum, the second question presented rests on a mischaracterization of what actually happened below. Because Hardeman's experts relied upon valid epide-miological studies that did adjust for confounders, and were merely supplemented with clinical experience, the Ninth Circuit did not permit scientific testimony based solely on \"unsupported intuitions.\" Its approach to Daubert is no different from other circuits, leaving no evidentiary question worthy of this Court's review. C. The Panel's Decision Adhered Faith- fully to Daubert and Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Monsanto's final point\u2014that the decision 702 ( see Pet.32- 33)\u2014is based on the same factual misrepresentations that dooms the foregoing arguments. Monsanto argues that, by allowing Hardeman's experts to testify based solely on their \"unverifiable conjecture,\" the Ninth of both the capacity of an agent to cause a disease (general cau- sation) and the probability that an agent caused an individual's disease (specific causation). See App.87a n.5. Here, Hardeman's experts relied upon epidemiological studies with statistically sig-nificant odds ratio exceeding 2.0. See, e.g. , App.163a; App.82a. 38 Circuit endorsed \"intuition without scientific valida- tion.\" Pet.33. This is simply wrong. As explained above, Dr. Weisenburger's testimony (and all of the other ex- perts who did not purport to rely upon clinical experi-ence) was supported by a large body of evidence, including epidemiology, toxicology, and cell studies. App.28a; see also App.33a (noting that Respondent's experts' testimony was based in part on epidemiologi- cal evidence). Thus, the notion that the Ninth Circuit allows expert testimony based on \"intuition without scientific validation\" (Pet.33) is incorrect as a matter of fact. In reality, the Ninth Circuit, like every other cir- cuit, always requires experts to employ a reliable methodology, no matter their clinical experience or other qualifications, just as Daubert requires. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc ., 43 F.3d 1311, 1315 (9th Cir. 1995) (finding testimony inadmis-sible because of the expert's unreliable methodology despite their \"impressive qualifications\"). Indeed, the Ninth Circuit has consistently held that qualifications like clinical experience d oes not transmogrify unrelia- ble opinions into admissible testimony. See, e.g. , mingo ex rel. Domingo v. T.K. , 289 F.3d 600, 607 (9th Cir. 2002) (upholding the exclusion of a qualified expert because his opinion was connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert.\"). The Ninth Circuit's approach is no different in the context of differential diagnoses\u2014reliable methodolo-gies are always required for \"ruling in\" and \"ruling out\" potential causes of an injury. In particular, the Ninth 39 Circuit holds that \"[w]hen an expert rules out a poten- tial cause in the course of a differential diagnosis, the 'expert must provide reasons for rejecting alternative hypotheses using scientific methods and procedures and elimination of those hypotheses must be founded on more than subjective b eliefs or unsupported specu- lation.' Clausen , 339 F.3d at 1058). In other words, unsupported intuition is never admissible in the Ninth Circuit. See also Nelson v. Ma- trixx Initiatives, Inc ., 592 F. App'x 591, 592 (9th Cir. 2015) (excluding expert for fa iling to reliably rule out alternative causes of the plaintiff 's injury); Avila v. Willits Envtl. Remediation Tr. , 633 F.3d 828, 839 (9th Cir. 2011) (excluding an expert report when, among other reasons, it \"does not actually consider confound-ing factors\" and \"failed to consider and rule out other sources [of injury] at all\"); Newkirk v. ConAgra Foods Inc., 438 F. App'x 607, 609 (9th Cir. 2011); Whisnant v. United States , 274 F. App'x 536, 537 (9th Cir. 2008) (ex- cluding differential diagnosis for \"fail[ing] to account for possible alternate causes of the plaintiff 's symp-toms.\"). Monsanto also errs in arguing that the Ninth Cir- cuit \"strayed from Daubert \" by endorsing a flexible ap- proach to evaluating expert testimony. Pet.34. As this Court held in Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael , \"the test of reliability is 'flexible.' \" 526 U.S. 137, 141 (1999). Thus, not only is some degree of flexibility appropriate, it is essential . And here, the Ninth Circuit correctly 40 held that it is no more flexible in its approach to Daub- ert than any other circuit. See App.26a. * * * In sum, Monsanto's second question presented rests on misstatements of law and misrepresentations of the record. There is no conflict among the circuits as to the appropriate Daubert standard and the panel here did not allow scientific testimony based on \"un- supported intuition.\" --------------------------------- --------------------------------- CONCLUSION The petition for a writ of certiorari should be de- nied.
