Naturopathic medicine is successful in treating many conditions by addressing the fundamental cause of disease, dysfunction or syndrome; this happens by bringing the body into balance, providing conditions for healing, and sustaining these conditions so that the body can maintain optimal health. Therapies that are within the scope of naturopathic medicine include, but are not limited to: nutritional counseling, physical medicine, counseling, botanical medicine, homeopathy, IV therapy, injection therapy and supplement therapy. Each patient is treated as a whole person which means the whole person will receive treatment, not just the symptom. These therapies are often used to treat and prevent disease exclusively, as well as used in conjunction with other forms of medicine. Education Naturopathic Doctors attend a 4 year accredited, graduate level naturopathic medical school and receive the same basic science training as medical doctors. Naturopathic medical students receive approximately 3400 hundred hours of academic training and 1400 hours of clinical training before graduation. Naturopathic doctors undergo 2 rigorous board examinations to receive licensure. Foundations of Naturopathic Medicine - The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae): Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. - Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam): The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. - First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere): Naturopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming the patient: - Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; - Avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms; and - Acknowledge, respect, and work with individuals' self-healing process. - - Doctor as Teacher (Docere): Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. - Treat the Whole Person: Naturopathic physicians treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. - Prevention: Naturopathic physicians emphasize the prevention of disease by assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease, and by making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness.
