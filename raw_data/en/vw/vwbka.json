Furthermore, no party to a treaty or international agreement subject to registration which has not been registered may invoke that treaty or agreement before any organ of the United Nations. The General Assembly, by resolution 97 (I), established regulations to give effect to Article 102 of the Charter (see text of the regulations, vol. 859, p. VIII). The terms \"treaty\" and \"international agreement\" have not been defined either in the Charter or in the regulations, and the Secretariat follows the principle that it acts in accordance with the position of the Member State submitting an instrument for registration that so far as that party is concerned the instru- ment is a treaty or an international agreement within the meaning of Article 102. Registration of an instrument submitted by a Member State, therefore, does not imply a judgement by the Secretariat on the nature of the instrument, the status of a party or any similar question. It is the understanding of the Secretariat that its action does not confer on the instrument the status of a treaty or an international agreement if it does not already have that status and does not confer on a party a status which it would not otherwise have. * * Unless otherwise indicated, the translations of the original texts of treaties, etc., published in this Series have been made by the Secretariat of the United Nations.

GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1. DEFINITIONS In this Convention: 1. \"Carrier\" means any person by whom or in whose name a contract of car- riage of goods by sea has been concluded with a shipper. 2. \"Actual carrier\" means any person to whom the performance of the carriage of the goods, or of part of the carriage, has been entrusted by the carrier, and includes any other person to whom such performance has been entrusted. 3. \"Shipper\" means any person by whom or in whose name or on whose behalf a contract of carriage of goods by sea has been concluded with a carrier, or any person by whom or in whose name or on whose behalf the goods are actually delivered to the carrier in relation to the contract of carriage by sea. 4. \"Consignee\" means the person entitled to take delivery of the goods. 5. \"Goods\" includes live animals; where the goods are consolidated in a con- tainer, pallet or similar article of transport or where they are packed, \"goods\" includes such article of transport or packaging if supplied by the shipper. 6. \"Contract of carriage by sea\" means any contract whereby the carrier undertakes against payment of freight to carry goods by sea from one port to another; however, a contract which involves carriage by sea and also carriage by I Came into force on 1 November 1992, i.e., the first day of the month following the expiration of one year from the date of deposit of the twentieth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, in accordance with article 30 (1): Date of deposit of the instrument of ratification Partiipant or accession (a) Barbados ............................................. 2 February 1981a Botswana ............................................ 16 February 1988 a B irkina Faso ...................................... 14August 1989a Chile .................................................... 9 July 1982 Egypt ................................................... 23 April 1979 Guinea ................................................. 23 January 1991 a Hungary .............................................. 5 July 1984 Kenya .................................................. 31 July 1989a Lebanon .............................................. 4 April 1983 a Lesotho ............................................... 26 October 1989 a Vol. 1695, 1-29215Date of deposit of the instrument of ratification Participant oraccesson (a) M alawi ................................................. 18 M arch 1991a M orocco .............................................. 12 June 1981a Nigeria ................................................. 7 November 1988 a Romania .............................................. 7 January 1982 a Senegal ................................................ 17 M arch 1986 Sierra Leone ....................................... 7 October 1988 Tunisia ................................................. 15 September 1980 a Uganda ................................................ 6July 1979a United Republic of Tanzania ............ 24 July 1979 a Zambia ................................................ 7 October 1991a 1992 United Nations -Treaty Series e Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 5 some other means is deemed to be a contract of carriage by sea for the purposes of this Convention only in so far as it relates to the carriage by sea. 7. \"Bill of lading\" means a document which evidences a contract of carriage by sea and the taking over or loading of the goods by the carrier, and by which the carrier undertakes to deliver the goods against surrender of the document. A provi- sion in the document that the goods are to be delivered to the order of a named person, or to order, or to bearer, constitutes such an undertaking. 8. \"Writing\" includes, inter alia, telegram and telex. Article 2. SCOPE OF APPLICATION 1. The provisions of this Convention are applicable to all contracts of carriage by sea between two different States, if: (a) The port of loading as provided for in the contract of carriage by sea is located in a Contracting State, or (b) The port of discharge as provided for in the contract of carriage by sea is located in a Contracting State, or (c) One of the optional ports of discharge provided for in the contract of car- riage by sea is the actual port of discharge and such port is located in a Contracting State, or (d) The bill of lading or other document evidencing the contract of carriage by sea is issued in a Contracting State, or (e) The bill of lading or other document evidencing the contract of carriage by sea provides that the provisions of this Convention or the legislation of any State giving effect to them are to govern the contract. 2. The provisions of this Convention are applicable without regard to the nationality of the ship, the carrier, the actual carrier, the shipper, the consignee or any other interested person. 3. The provisions of this Convention are not applicable to charter-parties. However, where a bill of lading is issued pursuant to a charter-party, the provisions of the Convention apply to such a bill of lading if it governs the relation between the carrier and the holder of the bill of lading, not being the charterer. 4. If a contract provides for future carriage of goods in a series of shipments during an agreed period, the provisions of this Convention apply to each shipment. However, where a shipment is made under a charter-party, the provisions of para- graph 3 of this article apply. Article 3. INTERPRETATION OF THE CONVENTION In the interpretation and application of the provisions of this Convention regard shall be had to its international character and to the need to promote uniformity. Vol. 1695, 1-29215 6 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 1992 PART I. LIABILITY OF THE CARRIER Article 4. PERIOD OF RESPONSIBILITY 1. The responsibility of the carrier for the goods under this Convention covers the period during which the carrier is in charge of the goods at the port of loading, during the carriage and at the port of discharge. 2. For the purpose of paragraph 1 of this article, the carrier is deemed to be in charge of the goods (a) From the time he has taken over the goods from: (i) The shipper, or a person acting on his behalf; or (ii) An authority or other third party to whom, pursuant to law or regulations appli- cable at the port of loading, the goods must be handed over for shipment; (b) Until the time he has delivered the goods: (i) By handing over the goods to the consignee; or (ii) In cases where the consignee does not receive the goods from the carrier, by placing them at the disposal of the consignee in accordance with the contract or with the law or with the usage of the particular trade, applicable at the port of discharge; or (iii) By handing over the goods to an authority or other third party to whom, pur- suant to law or regulations applicable at the port of discharge, the goods must be handed over. 3. In paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article, reference to the carrier or to the con- signee means, in addition to the carrier or the consignee, the servants or agents, respectively of the carrier or the consignee. Article 5. BASIS OF LIABILITY 1. The carrier is liable for loss resulting from loss of or damage to the goods, as well as from delay in delivery, if the occurrence which caused the loss, damage or delay took place while the goods were in his charge as defined in article 4, unless the carrier proves that he, his servants or agents took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the occurrence and its consequences. 2. Delay in delivery occurs when the goods have not been delivered at the port of discharge provided for in the contract of carriage by sea within the time expressly agreed upon or, in the absence of such agreement, within the time which it would be reasonable to require of a diligent carrier, having regard to the circumstances of the case. 3. The person entitled to make a claim for the loss of goods may treat the goods as lost if they have not been delivered as required by article 4 within 60 con- secutive days following the expiry of the time for delivery according to paragraph 2 of this article. 4. (a) The carrier is liable (i) For loss of or damage to the goods or delay in delivery caused by fire, if the claimant proves that the fire arose from fault or neglect on the part of the carrier, his servants or agents; Vol. 1695, 1-29215 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis (ii) For such loss, damage or delay in delivery which is proved by the claimant to have resulted from the fault or neglect of the carrier, his servants or agents, in taking all measures that could reasonably be required to put out the fire and avoid or mitigate its consequences, (b) In case of fire on board the ship affecting the goods, if the claimant or the carrier so desires, a survey in accordance with shipping practices must be held into the cause and circumstances of the fire, and a copy of the surveyor's report shall be made available on demand to the carrier and the claimant. 5. With respect to live animals, the carrier is not liable for loss, damage or delay in delivery resulting from any special risks inherent in that kind of carriage. If the carrier proves that he has complied with any special instructions given to him by the shipper respecting the animals and that, in the circumstances of the case, the loss, damage or delay in delivery could be attributed to such risks, it is presumed that the loss, damage or delay in delivery was so caused, unless there is proof that all or a part of the loss, damage or delay in delivery resulted from fault or neglect on the part of the carrier, his servants or agents. 6. The carrier is not liable, except in general average, where loss, damage or delay in delivery resulted from measures to save life or from reasonable measures to save property at sea. 7. Where fault or neglect on the part of the carrier, his servants or agents combines with another cause to produce loss, damage or delay in delivery the carrier is liable only to the extent that the loss, damage or delay in delivery is attributable to such fault or neglect, provided that the carrier proves the amount of the loss, damage or delay in delivery not attributable thereto. Article 6. LIMITS OF LIABILITY 1. (a) The liability of the carrier for loss resulting from loss of or damage to goods according to the provisions of article 5 is limited to an amount equivalent to 835 units of account per package or other shipping unit or 2.5 units of account per kilogramme of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged, whichever is the higher. (b) The liability of the carrier for delay in delivery according to the provisions of article 5 is limited to an amount equivalent to two and a half times the freight payable for the goods delayed, but not exceeding the total freight payable under the contract of carriage of goods by sea. (c) In no case shall the aggregate liability of the carrier, under both subpara- graphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph, exceed the limitation which would be estab- lished under subparagraph (a) of this paragraph for total loss of the goods with respect to which such liability was incurred. 2. For the purpose of calculating which amount is the higher in accordance with paragraph 1 (a) of this article, the following rules apply: (a) Where a container, pallet or similar article of transport is used to consol- idate goods, the package or other shipping units enumerated in the bill of lading, if issued, or otherwise in any other document evidencing the contract of carriage by sea, as packed in such article of transport are deemed packages or shipping units. Except as aforesaid the goods in such article of transport are deemed one shipping unit. Vol. 1695, 1-29215 8 United Nations -Treaty Series -Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitks 1992 (b) In cases where the article of transport itself has been lost or damaged, that article of transport, if not owned or otherwise supplied by the carrier, is considered one separate shipping unit. 3. Unit of account means the unit of account mentioned in article 26. 4. By agreement between the carrier and the shipper, limits of liability exceeding those provided for in paragraph 1 may be fixed. Article 7. APPLICATION TO NON-CONTRACTUAL CLAIMS 1. The defences and limits of liability provided for in this Convention apply in any action against the carrier in respect of loss or damage to the goods covered by the contract of carriage by sea, as well as of delay in delivery whether the action is founded in contract, in tort or otherwise. 2. If such an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier, such servant or agent, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, is entitled to avail himself of the defences and limits of liability which the carrier is entitled to invoke under this Convention. 3. Except as provided in article 8, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier and from any persons referred to in paragraph 2 of this article shall not exceed the limits of liability provided for inthis Convention. Article 8. Loss OF RIGHT TO LIMIT RESPONSIBILITY 1. The carrier is not entitled to the benefit of the limitation of liability provided for in article 6 if it is proved that the loss, damage or delay in delivery resulted from an act or omission of the carrier done with the intent to cause such loss, damage or delay, or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss, damage or delay would probably result. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 7, a servant or agent of the carrier is not entitled to the benefit of the limitation of liability provided for in article 6 if it is proved that the loss, damage or delay in delivery resulted from an act or omission of such servant or agent, done with the intent to cause such loss, damage or delay, or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss, damage or delay would probably result. Article 9. DECK CARGO 1. The carrier is entitled to carry the goods on deck only if such carriage is in accordance with an agreement with the shipper or with the usage of the particular trade or is required by statutory rules or regulations. 2. If the carrier and the shipper have agreed that the goods shall or may be carried on deck, the carrier must insert in the bill of lading or other document evi- dencing the contract of carriage by sea a statement to that effect. In the absence of such a statement the carrier has the burden of proving that an agreement for carriage on deck has been entered into; however, the carrier is not entitled to invoke such an agreement against a third party, including a consignee, who has acquired the bill of lading in good faith. 3. Where the goods have been carried on deck contrary to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article or where the carrier may not under paragraph 2 of this Vol. 1695, 1-29215 1992 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitks 9 article invoke an agreement for carriage on deck, the carrier, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 5, is liable for loss of or damage to the goods, as well as for delay in delivery, resulting solely from the carriage on deck, and the extent of his liability is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of arti- cle 6 or article 8 of this Convention, as the case may be. 4. Carriage of goods on deck contrary to express agreement for carriage under deck is deemed to be an act or omission of the carrier within the meaning of article 8. Article 10. LIABILITY OF THE CARRIER AND ACTUAL CARRIER 1. Where the performance of the carriage or part thereof has been entrusted to an actual carrier, whether or not in pursuance of a liberty under the contract of carriage by sea to do so, the carrier nevertheless remains responsible for the entire carriage according to the provisions of this Convention. The carrier is responsible, in relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, for the acts and omissions of the actual carrier and of his servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment. 2. All the provisions of this Convention governing the responsibility of the carrier also apply to the responsibility of the actual carrier for the carriage per- formed by him. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 7 and of paragraph 2 of article 8 apply if an action is brought against a servant or agent of the actual carrier. 3. Any special agreement under which the carrier assumes obligations not imposed by this Convention or waives rights conferred by this Convention affects the actual carrier only if agreed to by him expressly and in writing. Whether or not the actual carrier has so agreed, the carrier nevertheless remains bound by the obli- gations or waivers resulting from such special agreement. 4. Where and to the extent that both the carrier and the actual carrier are liable, their liability is joint and several. 5. The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, the actual car- rier and their servants and agents shall not exceed the limits of liability provided for in this Convention. 6. Nothing in this article shall prejudice any right of recourse as between the carrier and the actual carrier. Article 11. THROUGH CARRIAGE 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 10, where a con- tract of carriage by sea provides explicitly that a specified part of the carriage cov- ered by the said contract is to be performed by a named person other than the carrier, the contract may also provide that the carrier is not liable for loss, damage or delay in delivery caused by an occurrence which takes place while the goods are in the charge of the actual carrier during such part of the carriage. Nevertheless, any stipulation limiting or excluding such liability is without effect if no judicial pro- ceedings can be instituted against the actual carrier in a court competent under paragraph 1 or 2 of article 21. The burden of proving that any loss, damage or delay in delivery has been caused by such an occurrence rests upon the carrier. Vol. 1695, 1-29215 United Nations -Treaty Series o Nations Unies -Recueil des Trait~s 2. The actual carrier is responsible in accordance with the provisions of para- graph 2 of article 10 for loss, damage or delay in delivery caused by an occurrence which takes place while the goods are in his charge. PART III. LIABILITY OF THE SHIPPER Article 12. GENERAL RULE The shipper is not liable for loss sustained by the carrier or the actual carrier, or for damage sustained by the ship, unless such loss or damage was caused by the fault or neglect of the shipper, his servants or agents. Nor is any servant or agent of the shipper liable for such loss or damage unless the loss or damage was caused by fault or neglect on his part. Article 13. SPECIAL RULES ON DANGEROUS GOODS 1. The shipper must mark or label in a suitable manner dangerous goods as dangerous. 2. Where the shipper hands over dangerous goods to the carrier or an actual carrier, as the case may be, the shipper must inform him of the dangerous character of the goods and, if necessary, of the precautions to be taken. If the shipper fails to do so and such carrier or actual carrier does not otherwise have knowledge of their dangerous character: (a) The shipper is liable to the carrier and any actual carrier for the loss resulting from the shipment of such goods, and (b) The goods may at any time be unloaded, destroyed or rendered innocuous, as the circumstances may require, without payment of compensation. 3. The provisions of paragraph 2 of this article may not be invoked by any person if during the carriage he has taken the goods in his charge with knowledge of their dangerous character. 4. If, in cases where the provisions of paragraph 2, subparagraph (b), of this article do not apply or may not be invoked, dangerous goods become an actual danger to life or property, they may be unloaded, destroyed or rendered innocuous, as the circumstances may require, without payment of compensation except where there is an obligation to contribute in general average or where the carrier is liable in accordance with the provisions of article 5. PART IV. TRANSPORT DOCUMENTS Article 14. ISSUE OF BILL OF LADING 1. When the carrier or the actual carrier takes the goods in his charge, the carrier must, on demand of the shipper, issue to the shipper a bill of lading. 2. The bill of lading may be signed by a person having authority from the carrier. A bill of lading signed by the master of the ship carrying the goods is deemed to have been signed on behalf of the carrier. Vol. 1695, 1-29215 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 3. The signature on the bill of lading may be in handwriting, printed in facsim- ile, perforated, stamped, in symbols, or made by any other mechanical or electronic means, if not inconsistent with the law of the country where the bill of lading is issued. Article 15. CONTENTS OF BILL OF LADING 1. The bill of lading must include, inter alia, the following particulars: (a) The general nature of the goods, the leading marks necessary for identifica- tion of the goods, an express statement, if applicable, as to the dangerous character of the goods, the number of packages or pieces, and the weight of the goods or their quantity otherwise expressed, all such particulars as furnished by the shipper; (b) The apparent condition of the goods; (c) The name and principal place of business of the carrier; (d) The name of the shipper; (e) The consignee, if named by the shipper; (f) The port of loading under the contract of carriage by sea and the date on which the goods were taken over by the carrier at the port of loading; (g) The port of discharge under the contract of carriage by sea; (h) The number of originals of the bill of lading, if more than one; (i) The place of issuance of the bill of lading; (j) The signature of the carrier or a person acting on his behalf; (k) The freight to the extent payable by the consignee or other indication that freight is payable by him; (1) The statement referred to in paragraph 3 of article 23; (m) The statement, if applicable, that the goods shall or may be carried on deck; (n) The date or the period of delivery of the goods at the port of discharge if expressly agreed upon between the parties; and (o) Any increased limit or limits of liability where agreed in accordance with paragraph 4 of article 6. 2. After the goods have been loaded on board, if the shipper so demands, the carrier must issue to the shipper a \"shipped\" bill of lading which, in addition to the particulars required under paragraph 1 of this article, must state that the goods are on board a named ship or ships, and the date or dates of loading. If the carrier has previously issued to the shipper a bill of lading or other document of title with respect to any of such goods, on request of the carrier, the shipper must surrender such document in exchange for a \"shipped\" bill of lading. The carrier may amend any previously issued document in order to meet the shipper's demand for a \"shipped\" bill of lading if, as amended, such document includes all the information required to be contained in a \"shipped\" bill of lading. 3. The absence in the bill of lading of one or more particulars referred to in this article does not affect the legal character of the document as a bill of lading provided that it nevertheless meets the requirements set out in paragraph 7 of article 1. Vol. 1695, 1-292151992 12 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitks 1992 Article 16. BILLS OF LADING: RESERVATIONS AND EVIDENTIARY EFFECT 1. If the bill of lading contains particulars concerning the general nature, leading marks, number of packages or pieces, weight or quantity of the goods which the carrier or other person issuing the bill of lading on his behalf knows or has reasonable grounds to suspect do not accurately represent the goods actually taken over or, where a \"shipped\" bill of lading is issued, loaded, or if he had no reasonable means of checking such particulars, the carrier or such other person must insert in the bill of lading a reservation specifying these inaccuracies, grounds of suspicion or the absence of reasonable means of checking. 2. If the carrier or other person issuing the bill of lading on his behalf fails to note on the bill of lading the apparent condition of the goods, he is deemed to have noted on the bill of lading that the goods were in apparent good condition. 3. Except for particulars in respect of which and to the extent to which a reservation permitted under paragraph 1 of this article has been entered: (a) The bill of lading is prima facie evidence of the taking over or, where a\"shipped\" bill of lading is issued, loading, by the carrier of the goods as described in the bill of lading; and (b) Proof to the contrary by the carrier is not admissible if the bill of lading has been transferred to a third party, including a consignee, who in good faith has acted in reliance on the description of the goods therein. 4. A bill of lading which does not, as provided in paragraph 1, subpara- graph (k) of article 15, set forth the freight or otherwise indicate that freight is pay- able by the consignee or does not set forth demurrage incurred at the port of loading payable by the consignee, is primafacie evidence that no freight or such demurrage is payable by him. However, proof to the contrary by the carrier is not admissible when the bill of lading has been transferred to a third party, including a consignee, who in good faith has acted in reliance on the absence in the bill of lading of any such indication. Article 17. GUARANTEES BY THE SHIPPER 1. The shipper is deemed to have guaranteed to the carrier the accuracy of particulars relating to the general nature of the goods, their marks, number, weight and quantity as furnished by him for insertion in the bill of lading. The shipper must indemnify the carrier against the loss resulting from inaccuracies in such particulars. The shipper remains liable even if the bill of lading has been transferred by him. The right of the carrier to such indemnity in no way limits his liability under the contract of carriage by sea to any person other than the shipper. 2. Any letter of guarantee or agreement by which the shipper undertakes to indemnify the carrier against loss resulting from the issuance of the bill of lading by the carrier, or by a person acting on his behalf, without entering a reservation relating to particulars furnished by the shipper for insertion in the bill of lading, or to the apparent condition of the goods, is void and of no effect as against any third party, including a consignee, to whom the bill of lading has been transferred. 3. Such letter of guarantee or agreement is valid as against the shipper unless the carrier or the person acting on his behalf, by omitting the reservation referred to in paragraph 2 of this article, intends to defraud a third party, including a consignee, Vol. 1695, 1-29215 1992 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitks 13 who acts in reliance on the description of the goods in the bill of lading. In the latter case, if the reservation omitted relates to particulars furnished by the shipper for insertion in the bill of lading, the carrier has no right of indemnity from the shipper pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article. 4. In the case of intended fraud referred to in paragraph 3 of this article the carrier is liable, without the benefit of the limitation of liability provided for in this Convention, for the loss incurred by a third party, including a consignee, because he has acted in reliance on the description of the goods in the bill of lading. Article 18. DOCUMENTS OTHER THAN BILLS OF LADING Where a carrier issues a document other than a bill of lading to evidence the receipt of the goods to be carried, such a document is prima facie evidence of the conclusion of the contract of carriage by sea and the taking over by the carrier of the goods as therein described. PART V. CLAIMS AND ACTIONS Article 19. NOTICE OF LOSS, DAMAGE OR DELAY 1. Unless notice of loss or damage, specifying the general nature of such loss or damage, is given in writing by the consignee to the carrier not later than the working day after the day when the goods were handed over to the consignee, such handing over is primafacie evidence of the delivery by the carrier of the goods as described in the document of transport or, if no such document has been issued, in good condition. 2. Where the loss or damage is not apparent, the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article apply correspondingly if notice in writing is not given within 15 con- secutive days after the day when the goods were handed over to the consignee. 3. If the state of the goods at the time they were handed over to the consignee has been the subject of a joint survey or inspection by the parties, notice in writing need not be given of loss or damage ascertained during such survey or inspection. 4. In the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage the carrier and the consignee must give all reasonable facilities to each other for inspecting and tallying the goods. 5. No compensation shall be payable for loss resulting from delay in delivery unless a notice has been given in writing to the carrier within 60 consecutive days after the day when the goods were handed over to the consignee. 6. If the goods have been delivered by an actual carrier, any notice given under this article to him shall have the same effect as if it had been given to the carrier, and any notice given to the carrier shall have effect as if given to such actual carrier. 7. Unless notice of loss or damage, specifying the general nature of the loss or damage, is given in writing by the carier or actual carrier to the shipper not later than 90 consecutive days after the occurrence of such loss or damage or after the delivery of the goods in accordance with paragraph 2 of article 4, whichever is later, the failure to give such notice is prima facie evidence that the carrier or the actual Vol. 1695. 1-29215 14 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recuei des Traitis 1992 carrier has sustained no loss or damage due to the fault or neglect of the shipper, his servants or agents. 8. For the purpose of this article, notice given to a person acting on the car- rier's or the actual carrier's behalf, including the master or the officer in charge of the ship, or to a person acting on the shipper's behalf is deemed to have been given to the carrier, to the actual carrier or to the shipper, respectively. Article 20. LIMITATION OF ACTIONS 1. Any action relating to carriage of goods under this Convention is time- barred if judicial or arbitral proceedings have not been instituted within a period of two years. 2. The limitation period commences on the day on which the carrier has deliv- ered the goods or part thereof or, in cases where no goods have been delivered, on the last day on which the goods should have been delivered. 3. The day on which the limitation period commences is not included in the period. 4. The person against whom a claim is made may at any time during the run- ning of the limitation period extend that period by a declaration in writing to the claimant. This period may be further extended by another declaration or decla- rations. 5. An action for indemnity by a person held liable may be instituted even after the expiration of the limitation period provided for in the preceding paragraphs if instituted within the time allowed by the law of the State where proceedings are instituted. However, the time allowed shall not be less than 90 days commencing from the day when the person instituting such action for indemnity has settled the claim or has been served with process in the action against himself. Article 21. JURISDICTION 1. In judicial proceedings relating to carriage of goods under this Convention the plaintiff, at his option, may institute an action in a court which, according to the law of the State where the court is situated, is competent and within the jurisdiction of which is situated one of the following places: (a) The principal place of business or, in the absence thereof, the habitual resi- dence of the defendant; or (b) The place where the contract was made provided that the defendant has there a place of business, branch or agency through which the contract was made; or (c) The port of loading or the port of discharge; or (d) Any additional place designated for that purpose in the contract of carriage by sea. 2. (a) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this article, an action may be instituted in the courts of any port or place in a Contracting State at which the carrying vessel or any other vessel of the same ownership may have been arrested in accordance with applicable rules of the law of that State and of international law. However, in such a case, at the petition of the defendant, the claimant must remove Vol. 1695, 1-29215 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis the action, at his choice, to one of the jurisdictions referred to in paragraph 1 of this article for the determination of the claim, but before such removal the defendant must furnish security sufficient to ensure payment of any judgement that may sub- sequently be awarded to the claimant in the action. (b) All questions relating to the sufficiency or otherwise of the security shall be determined by the court of the port or place of the arrest. 3. No judicial proceedings relating to carriage of goods under this Convention may be instituted in a place not specified in paragraph 1 or 2 of this article. The provisions of this paragraph do not constitute an obstacle to the jurisdiction of the Contracting States for provisional or protective measures. 4. (a) Where an action has been instituted in a court competent under para- graph 1 or 2 of this article or where judgement has been delivered by such a court, no new action may be started between the same parties on the same grounds unless the judgement of the court before which the first action was instituted is not enforce- able in the country in which the new proceedings are instituted; (b) For the purpose of this article the institution of measures with a view to obtaining enforcement of a judgement is not to be considered as the starting of a new action; (c) For the purpose of this article, the removal of an action to a different court within the same country, or to a court in another country, in accordance with para- graph 2 (a) of this article, is not to be considered as the starting of a new action. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, an agreement made by the parties, after a claim under the contract of carriage by sea has arisen, which designates the place where the claimant may institute an action, is effective. Article 22. ARBITRATION 1. Subject to the provisions of this article, parties may provide by agreement evidenced in writing that any dispute that may arise relating to carriage of goods under this Convention shall be referred to arbitration. 2. Where a charter-party contains a provision that disputes arising thereunder shall be referred to arbitration and a bill of lading issued pursuant to the charter- party does not contain a special annotation providing that such provision shall be binding upon the holder of the bill of lading, the carrier may not invoke such provi- sion as against a holder having acquired the bill of lading in good faith. 3. The arbitration proceedings shall, at the option of the claimant, be instituted at one of the following places: (a) A place in a State within whose territory is situated: (i) The principal place of business of the defendant or, in the absence thereof, the habitual residence of the defendant; or (ii) The place where the contract was made, provided that the defendant has there a place of business, branch or agency through which the contract was made; or (iii) The port of loading or the port of discharge; or (b) Any place designated for that purpose in the arbitration clause or agreement, Vol. 1695, 1-29215 16 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 1992 4. The arbitrator or arbitration tribunal shall apply the rules of this Con- vention. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this article are deemed to be part of every arbitration clause or agreement, and any term of such clause or agreement which is inconsistent therewith is null and void. 6. Nothing in this article affects the validity of an agreement relating to arbi- tration made by the parties after the claim under the contract of carriage by sea has arisen. PART VI. SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS Article 23. CONTRACTUAL STIPULATIONS 1. Any stipulation in a contract of carriage by sea, in a bill of lading, or in any other document evidencing the contract of carriage by sea is null and void to the extent that it derogates, directly or indirectly, from the provisions of this Conven- tion. The nullity of such a stipulation does not affect the validity of the other provi- sions of the contract or document of which it forms a part. A clause assigning benefit of insurance of the goods in favour of the carrier, or any similar clause, is null and void. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article, a carrier may increase his responsibilities and obligations under this Convention. 3. Where a bill of lading or any other document evidencing the contract of carriage by sea is issued, it must contain a statement that the carriage is subject to the provisions of this Convention which nullify any stipulation derogating therefrom to the detriment of the shipper or the consignee. 4. Where the claimant in respect of the goods has incurred loss as a result of a stipulation which is null and void by virtue of the present article, or as a result of the omission of the statement referred to in paragraph 3 of this article, the carrier must pay compensation to the extent required in order to give the claimant compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Convention for any loss of or damage to the goods as well as for delay in delivery. The carrier must, in addition, pay compen- sation for costs incurred by the claimant for the purpose of exercising his right, provided that costs incurred in the action where the foregoing provision is invoked are to be determined in accordance with the law of the State where proceedings are instituted. Article 24. GENERAL AVERAGE 1. Nothing in this Convention shall prevent the application of provisions in the contract of carriage by sea or national law regarding the adjustment of general average. 2. With the exception of article 20, the provisions of this Convention relating to the liability of the carrier for loss of or damage to the goods also determine whether the consignee may refuse contribution in general average and the liability of the carrier to indemnify the consignee in respect of any such contribution made or any salvage paid. Vol. 1695, 1-29215 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis Article 25. OTHER CONVENTIONS 1. This Convention does not modify the rights or duties of the carrier, the actual carrier and their servants and agents, provided for in international conven- tions or national law relating to the limitation of liability of owners of seagoing ships. 2. The provisions of articles 21 and 22 of this Convention do not prevent the application of the mandatory provisions of any other multilateral convention al- ready in force at the date of this Convention relating to matters dealt with in the said articles, provided that the dispute arises exclusively between parties having their principal place of business in States members of such other convention. However, this paragraph does not affect the application of paragraph 4 of article 22 of this Convention. 3. No liability shall arise under the provisions of this Convention for damage caused by a nuclear incident if the operator of a nuclear installation is liable for such damage: (a) Under either the Paris Convention of 29 July 1960 on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy as amended by the Additional Protocol of 28 January 19641 or the Vienna Convention of 21 May 1963 on Civil Liability for Nuclear Dam- age,2 or (b) By virtue of national law governing the liability for such damage, provided that such law is in all respects as favourable to persons who may suffer damage as either the Paris or Vienna Conventions. 4. No liability shall arise under the provisions of this Convention for any loss of or damage to or delay in delivery of luggage for which the carrier is responsible under any international convention or national law relating to the carriage of pas- sengers and their luggage by sea. 5. Nothing contained in this Convention prevents a Contracting State from applying any other international convention which is already in force at the date of this Convention and which applies mandatorily to contracts of carriage of goods primarily by a mode of transport other than transport by sea. This provision also applies to any subsequent revision or amendment of such international convention. Article 26. UNIT OF ACCOUNT 1. The unit of account referred to in article 6 of this Convention is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts men- tioned in article 6 are to be converted into the national currency of a State according to the value of such currency at the date of judgement or the date agreed upon by the parties. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a Contracting State which is a member of the International Monetary Fund is to be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect at the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency in terms of the Special Drawing Right of a Con- tracting State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund is to be calculated in a manner determined by that State. I United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 956, p. 251. 2 Ibid., vol. 1063, p. 265. Vol. 1695, 1-29215 18 United Nations -Treaty Series e Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitks 1992 2. Nevertheless, those States which are not members of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article may, at the time of signature, or at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limits of liability provided for in this Convention to be applied in their territories shall be fixed as: 12,500 monetary units per package or other shipping unit or 37.5 monetary units per kilogramme of gross weight of the goods. 3. The monetary unit referred to in paragraph 2 of this article corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of the amounts referred to in paragraph 2 into the national currency is to be made according to the law of the State concerned. 4. The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1 and the con- version mentioned in paragraph 3 of this article is to be made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of the Contracting State as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in article 6 as is expressed there in units of account. Contracting States must communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article, or the result of the conversion mentioned in paragraph 3 of this article, as the case may be, at the time of signature or when depositing their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or when availing themselves of the option provided for in paragraph 2 of this article and whenever there is a change in the manner of such calculation or in the result of such conversion. PART VII. FINAL CLAUSES Article 27 DEPOSITARY The Secretary-General of the United Nations is hereby designated as the depositary of this Convention. Article 28. SIGNATURE, RATIFICATION, ACCEPTANCE, APPROVAL, ACCESSION 1. This Convention is open for signature by all States until 30 April 1979 at the Headquarters of the United Nations, New York. 2. This Convention is subject to ratification, acceptance or approval by the signatory States. 3. After 30 April 1979, this Convention will be open for accession by all States which are not signatory States. 4. Instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval and accession are to be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Article 29. RESERVATIONS No reservations may be made to this Convention. Article 30. ENTRY INTO FORCE 1. This Convention enters into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of one year from the date of deposit of the 20th instrument of ratifica- tion, acceptance, approval or accession. Vol. 1695. 1-29215 1992 United Nations -Treaty Series o Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 19 2. For each State which becomes a Contracting State to this Convention after the date of the deposit of the 20th instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, this Convention enters into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of one year after the deposit of the appropriate instrument on behalf of that State. 3.

Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows: a) He shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State with which his personal and eco- nomic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); b) If the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which he has an habitual abode; c) If he has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State of which he is a national; d) If he is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent author- ities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3.

For the purposes of this Convention, the term \"permanent establishment\" means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2.

A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a perma- nent establishment only if it lasts more than twelve months. 4. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term \"perma- nent establishment\" shall be deemed not to include: a) The use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; Vol. 1695, 1-29217 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traits b) The maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enter- prise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; c) The maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enter- prise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; d) The maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of pur- chasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; e) The maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary char- acter; f) The maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in subparagraphs (a) to (e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person -other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 6 applies -is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enter- prise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 6. An enterprise of a Contracting State shall not be deemed to have a perma- nent establishment in the other Contracting State merely because it carries on busi- ness in that other State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. 7. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent estab- lishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. Article 6. INCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable prop- erty (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. For the purposes of this Convention, the term \"immovable property\" shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property acces- sory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and for- estry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consid- eration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. Vol. 1695, 1-29217 236 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Trait6s 1992 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property and to income from the alienation of such property. 4. Where the ownership of shares or other corporate rights in a company entitles the owner of such shares or corporate rights to the enjoyment of immovable property held by the company, the income from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of such right to enjoyment may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the immovable property is situated. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services. Article 7. BUSINESS PROFITS 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on or has carried on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent estab- lishment. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Con- tracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed those deductible expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the per- manent establishment including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 5. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 6. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then, the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. Article 8. SHIPPING AND AIR TRANSPORT 1. Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. Vol. 1695, 1-29217 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Trait~s 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 and Article 7, profits de- rived from the operation of ships used principally to transport passengers or goods exclusively between places in a Contracting State may be taxed in that State. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. Article 9. ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES 1. Where a) An enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or b) The same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, con- trol or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those condi- tions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State -and taxes accordingly -profits on which an enterprise of the other Con- tracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged therein on those profits, where that other State considers the adjustment justified. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. 3. A Contracting State shall not change the profits of an enterprise in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 after six years from the end of the year in which the profits which would be subject to such change would have accrued to an enterprise of that State. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply in the case of fraud, willful default or neglect. Article 10. DIVIDENDS 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed: Vol. 1695. 1-29217 238 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 1992 a) 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which owns at least 10 per cent of the voting stock of the company paying the dividends; b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases. The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company on the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 3. The term \"dividends\" as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the taxation law of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such perma- nent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Arti- cle 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the divi- dends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. 6. Notwithstanding any provision in this Convention, Canada may impose on the earnings of a company attributable to permanent establishments in Canada, tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company incorporated in Canada, provided that the rate of such additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 10 per cent of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this provision, the term \"earnings\" means the profits attributable to such permanent establishments in Canada (including gains from the alienation of property forming part of the business property, referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 13, of such perma- nent establishments) in accordance with Article 7 in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom: a) Business losses attributable to such permanent establishments (including losses from the alienation of property forming part of the business property of such permanent establishments) in such year and previous years, b) All taxes chargeable in Canada on such profits, other than the additional tax referred to herein. c) The profits reinvested in Canada, provided that the amount of such deduc- tion shall be determined in accordance with the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the computation of the allowance in respect of investment in prop- erty in Canada, and any subsequent modification of those provisions which shall not affect the general principle hereof, and Vol. 1695, 1-29217 1992 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 239 d) Five hundred thousand Canadian dollars ($500,000) less any amount de- ducted under this paragraph (i) By the company, or (ii) By a person related thereto from the same or a similar business as that carried on by the company. Article 11. INTEREST 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in a Con- tracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is the bene- ficial owner thereof shall be taxable only in that other State to the extent that such interest: a) Is a penalty charge for late payment; b) Is paid by the central bank of a Contracting State to the central bank of the other Contracting State; or c) Is paid by the purchasing enterprise to the selling enterprise in connec- tion with the sale on credit of any equipment or merchandise, except where the sale is made between associated enterprises within the meaning of Article 9, para- graph 1 (a) or (b). 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, a) Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid in respect of a bond, deben- ture or other similar obligation of the government of that Contracting State or of a political subdivision or a local authority thereof shall, provided that the interest is beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, be taxable only in that other State; b) Interest arising in Finland and paid to a resident of Canada shall be taxable only in Canada if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by the Export Development Corporation; and c) Interest arising in Canada and paid to a resident of Finland shall be taxable only in Finland if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by the Export Guarantee Board or the Finn- ish Export Credit Limited. 5. The term \"interest\" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income assimilated to income from money lent by the taxation law of the State in which the income arises. However, the term \"interest\" does not include income dealt with in Article 10. Vol. 1695, 1-29217 240 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitks 1992 6. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent estab- lishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal serv- ices from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 7. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Con- tracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 8. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the bene- ficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. Article 12. ROYALTIES 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the royalties the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, a) Copyright royalties and other like payments in respect of the production or reproduction of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work (but not including royalties in respect of motion picture films and works on film or videotape for use in connection with television) arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State; b) Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to the government of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, royalties in respect of cul- tural motion picture films arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State. This provision shall apply only to royalties. a) Paid to a resident of Finland in respect of Finnish films which are approved by the relevant authorities and which are exempt from motion picture tax under the Motion Picture Tax Act of 26 June 1964, No. 366; Vol. 1695, 1-29217 1992 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Trait6s 241 b) Paid to a resident of Canada in respect of films wholly or principally directed and produced in Canada and which are included in the list of films prepared by the Committee of the Bureau of Film Festivals established under Order-in-Council P.C. 1968-400 dated February 29, 1968. 5. The term \"royalties\" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information con- cerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience, and includes payments of any kind in respect of motion picture films and works on film or videotape for use in connection with television. 6. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent estab- lishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal serv- ices from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 7. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Con- tracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 8. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the bene- ficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. Article 13. CAPITAL GAINS 1. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State or of movable property pertaining to a fixed base available to a resident of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing independent personal services, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise) or of such fixed base may be taxed in that other State. Vol. 1695, 1-29217 242 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 1992 3. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State. 4. Gains from the alienation of: a) Shares or other corporate rights in a company, the property of which con- sists principally of immovable property situated in a Contracting State; or b) An interest in a partnership or a trust, the property of which consists princi- pally of immovable property situated in a Contracting State, may be taxed in that State. For the purposes of this paragraph the term \"immovable property\" shall not include property, other than rental property, in which the business of the company, partnership or trust is carried on; however this term shall include shares or other corporate rights in a company described in subparagraph (a) above and an interest in a partnership or a trust described in subparagraph (b) above. 5. Gains from the alienation of any property other than that referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident. 6. The provision of paragraph 5 shall not affect the right of either of the Con- tracting States to levy, according to its law, a tax on gains derived by an individual who is a resident of the other Contracting State, from the alienation of any property if the alienator: a) Is a national of the first-mentioned State or was a resident of that State for ten years or more prior to the alienation of the property, and b) Was a resident of that first-mentioned State at any time during the five years immediately preceding such alienation. Article 14. INDEPENDENT PERSONAL SERVICES 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of profes- sional services or other activities of an independent character shall be taxable only in that State unless he has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other Con- tracting State for the purpose of performing his activities. If he has or had such a fixed base, the income may be taxed in the other State but only so much of it as is attributable to that fixed base. 2. The term \"professional services\" includes especially independent scientific, literary, artistic, educational or teaching activities as well as the independent activ- ities of physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists and accountants. Article 15. DEPENDENT PERSONAL SERVICES 1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18 and 19, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. Vol 1695, 1-29217 United Nations -Treaty Series a Nations Unies -Recueil des Trait(s 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: a) The recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the calendar year concerned, and b) The remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State, and c) The remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the other State. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in interna- tional traffic by an enterprise of a Contracting State, shall be taxable only in that State.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14, and 15, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as an athlete, from his personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or an athlete in his capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or athlete himself but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Arti- cles 7, 14 and 15, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or athlete are exercised. 3. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if it is established that neither the entertainer or the athlete nor persons related thereto, participate directly or indirectly in the profits of the person referred to in that paragraph. Article 18. PENSIONS AND ANNUITIES 1. Pensions and annuities arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Pensions arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may also be taxed in the State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State. However, in the case of periodic pension payments, the tax so charged shall not exceed 20 per cent of the gross amount of the payment. 3. Annuities arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may also be taxed in the State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the portion thereof that is subject to tax in that State. However, this limitation does not Vol. 1695.1-29217 244 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 1992 apply to lump-sum payments arising on the surrender, cancellation, redemption, sale or other alienation of an annuity, or to payments of any kind under an income- averaging annuity contract. 4. Notwithstanding any provision of this Convention, war veterans pensions and allowances arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in that other State to the extent that they would be exempt from tax if received by a resident of the first-mentioned State. Article 19. GOVERNMENT SERVICE 1. a) Remuneration, other than a pension, paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of serv- ices rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State. b) However, such remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: (i) Is a national of that State; or (ii) Did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to remuneration in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof. Article 20. STUDENTS AND APPRENTICES Payments which a student or business apprentice who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of his education or training receives for the purpose of his maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State. Article 21. OTHER INCOME 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State. 2. However, if such income is derived by a resident of a Contracting State from sources in the other Contracting State, such income may also be taxed in the State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State. However, in the case of income from an estate or trust, the tax so charged shall, provided that the income is taxable in the Contracting State in which the recipient resides, not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the income. 3. For the purposes of this Article, a trust does not include an arrangement whereby the contributions made to the trust are deductible for the purposes of taxation in Canada. Vol. 1695. 1-29217 1992 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitks 245 Article 22. ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION 1. In the case of Canada, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows: a) Subject to the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the deduc- tion from tax payable in Canada of tax paid in a territory outside Canada and to any subsequent modification of those provisions -which shall not affect the general principle hereof -and unless a greater deduction or relief is provided under the laws of Canada, tax payable in Finland on profits, income or gains arising in Finland shall be deducted from any Canadian tax payable in respect of such profits, income or gains. b) Subject to the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the deter- mination of the exempt surplus of a foreign affiliate and to any subsequent modifi- cation of those provisions -which shall not affect the general principle hereof - for the purpose of computing Canadian tax, a company resident 'in Canada shall be allowed to deduct in computing its taxable income any dividend received by it out of the exempt surplus of a foreign affiliate resident in Finland. 2. In the case of Finland, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows: a) Where a resident of Finland derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Canada, Finland shall, subject t3 the provisions of subparagraph (b), allow as a deduction from the taxes on income of that person, an amount equal to the taxes on income paid in Canada. The deduc- tion shall not, however, exceed the part of the tax on income, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in Canada. b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a), dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Canada to a company which is a resident of Finland and controls directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends shall be exempt from Finnish tax. c) Where in accordance with any provision of the Convention income derived by a resident of Finland is exempt from tax in Finland, Finland may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income of such resident, take into account the exempted income. 3. For the purposes of this Article, profits, income or gains of a resident of a Contracting State which are taxed in the other Contracting State in accordance with the Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources in that other State. Article 23. NON-DISCRIMINATION 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Con- tracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nation- als of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Con- tracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. Vol. 1695. 1-29217 246 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 1992 3. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents. 4. In this Article, the term \"taxation\" means taxes which are the subject of this Convention. Article 24. MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, address to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident an application in writing stating the grounds for claiming the revision of such taxation. To be admissible, the said application must be submitted within two years from the first notification of the action which gives rise to taxation not in accordance with the Convention. 2. The competent authority referred to in paragraph 1 shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfac- tory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. 3. A Contracting State shall not after six years from the end of the taxable period in which the income concerned has accrued, increase the tax base of a resi- dent of either of the Contracting States by including therein items of income which have also been charged to tax in the other Contracting State. This paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud, willful default or neglect. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpreta- tion or application of the Convention. In particular, the competent authorities of the Contracting States may consult together to endeavour to agree: a) To the same attribution of profits to a resident of a Contracting State and its permanent establishment situated in the other Contracting State; b) To the same allocation of income between a resident of a Contracting State and any associated person provided for in Article 9. 5. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention. Article 25. EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by the Con- vention insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assess- Vol. 1695, 1-29217 1992 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitks 247 ment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determi- nation of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by the Convention. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. 2. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: a) To carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and admin- istrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; b) To supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of tfie other Contracting State; c) To supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (order public). Article 26. DIPLOMATIC AGENTS AND CONSULAR OFFICERS 1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic agents or consular officers under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. 2. Notwithstanding Article 4, an individual who is a member of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a Contracting State which is situated in the other Contracting State or in a third State shall be deemed for the purposes of the Convention to be a resident of the sending State if he is liable in the sending State to the same obligations in relation to tax on his total income as are residents of that sending State. 3. The Convention shall not apply to International Organizations, to organs or officials thereof and to persons who are members of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a third State, being present in a Contracting State and who are not liable in either Contracting State to the same obligations in relation to tax on their total income as are residents thereof. Article 27. MISCELLANEOUS RULES 1. The provisions of this Convention shall not be construed to restrict in any manner any exclusion, exemption, deduction, credit, or other allowance now or hereafter accorded a) By the laws of a Contracting State in the determination of the tax imposed by that State, or b) By any other agreements entered into by a Contracting State. 2. Nothing in the Convention shall be construed as preventing Canada from imposing a tax on amounts included in the income of a resident of Canada according to section 91 of the Canadian Income Tax Act (Foreign Accrual Property Income). 3. Notwithstanding anything in the Convention, alimony and other similar payments arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Con- tracting State who is subject to tax therein in respect thereof, shall be taxable only in that other State. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of applying the Convention. Vol. 1695, 1-29217 248 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 1992 Article 28. ENTRY INTO FORCE 1. The Governments of the Contracting States shall notify to each other that the constitutional requirements for the entry into force of this Convention have been complied with. 2. The Convention shall enter into force thirty days after the date of the later of the notifications referred to in paragraph 1 and its provisions shall have effect: a) In Canada: (i) In respect of tax withheld at the source on amounts paid or credited to non- residents on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force; and (ii) In respect of other Canadian tax for taxation years beginning on or after 1 Jan- uary in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force; b) In Finland: (i) In respect of taxes withheld at source, on income derived on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following the year in which the Convention enters into force; and (ii) In respect of other taxes on income, for taxes chargeable for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following the year in which the Convention enters into force. 3. The provisions of the Convention between Canada and Finland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income signed at Ottawa on March 28, 1959,' as modified by the Supple- mentary Conventions signed at Helsinki on December 30, 1964,2 and at Ottawa on April 2, 1971,3 (hereinafter referred to as \"the 1959 Convention\") shall cease to have effect with respect to taxes to which this Convention applies in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2. 4. The 1959 Convention shall terminate on the last date on which it has effect in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Article. Article 29. TERMINATION This Convention shall remain in force until terminated by one of the Con- tracting States. Either Contracting State may terminate the Convention, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination at least six months before the end of any calendar year following after the period of 5 years from the date on which the Convention enters into force. In such event, the Convention shall cease to have effect: a) In Canada: (i) In respect of tax withheld at the source on amounts paid or credited to non- residents on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice is given; and I United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 355, p. 3. 2 Ibid., vol. 544, p. 347. 3 Ibid., vol. 862, p. 390.

TITLE II. COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION Article 6 Each Government shall grant to the other Party all necessary facilities for set- ting up, maintaining and supporting in its territory, with due regard for the laws and regulations in force, teaching establishments under its authority. Each Government shall give nationals of the other Party free access to its edu- cational establishments.

They shall be entitled to import through their respective embassies, free of customs duties and charges, such equipment, vehicles, furniture and supplies as are needed for the operation of an educational estab- lishment.

Such students must abide by the laws and regula- tions of the host country.

FAIT A Djibouti, le 27 septembre 1986 en double exemplaire, en langue fran- [Signg -Signed]2 I Sign6 par Robert Traitis [TRANSLATION -TRADUCTION] EXTRADITION CONVENTION' BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF DJIBOUTI The Government of the French Republic and The Government of the Republic of Djibouti, Desiring to ensure more effective cooperation between their States with a view to combating crime, Desiring for this purpose to regulate, by mutual agreement, their relations in the field of extradition, Have agreed as follows: Article I The two States undertake to surrender to each other, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, any person in the territory of either State who is being proceeded against by the authorities of the other State in respect of an offence or who is wanted by the said authorities for the carrying out of a sentence. Article 2 Extradition shall be granted: (a) In respect of an act or acts which, under the laws of the two States, consti- tute a criminal or correctional offence punishable under those laws by a penalty entailing deprivation of liberty for at least two years or, subject to the provisions of article 8, by a more severe penalty, on condition that the latter is provided for in the scale of penalties of each State; (b) In respect of sentences imposed by the courts of the requesting State, for acts referred to in the preceding subparagraph, entailing deprivation of liberty for at least four months or, subject to the provisions of article 8, a more severe penalty, on condition that the latter is provided for in the scale of penalties of each State. Article 3 Where the extradition request applies to several separate acts, each of which is punishable under the laws of the two States but some of which do not meet the criteria set out in article 2, the requested State may also agree to extradition in respect of such acts. I Came into force on I August 1992, i.e., the first day of the second month following the date of receipt of the last of the notifications (of 12 January 1988 and 3 June 1992) by which the Contracting Parties had informed each other of the completion of the required constitutional procedures, in accordance with article 23 (I) and (2). Vol. 1695. 1-29219 290 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitks 1992 Article 4 Extradition shall not be granted: (1) If the offence in respect of which it is requested is regarded by the re- quested State as a political offence or as an act connected with a political offence; (2) If the requested State has substantial grounds for believing that a request for extradition has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons; (3) If the person claimed is likely to be tried in the requesting State by a court that does not offer fundamental procedural guarantees and guarantees of protection of the rights of the defence, or by a court established specifically to try his case, or if extradition is requested for the execution of a sentence imposed by such a court; (4) If the offence in respect of which extradition is requested consists solely of a violation of military obligations; (5) If a final judgement of conviction or acquittal has been passed in the re- quested State upon the person claimed, in respect of the offence or offences for which extradition is requested; (6) If, according to the law of the requesting State or the requested State, the person claimed has become immune from prosecution or punishment by reason of lapse of time; (7) If amnesty has been granted in respect of the offence, either in the re- questing State or in the requested State, provided that, in the latter instance, the requested State was competent according to its domestic law to institute criminal proceedings; (8) If the offence in respect of which the person is claimed was committed entirely or partly in the territory of the requested State or in any other place subject to the jurisdiction of that State. Article 5 Extradition shall also be refused if the person claimed is a national of the re- quested State. Nationality shall be determined as at the date on which the acts for which extradition is requested were committed. If a request for extradition is refused solely because the person claimed is a national of the requested State, the latter shall, at the request of the requesting State, call upon its competent authorities to institute criminal proceedings. Article 6 Extradition may be granted, under the conditions laid down in this Convention, for offences relating to taxes, duties, customs and foreign exchange, when so decided by a simple exchange of letters between the two Governments in each specific case. Article 7 Extradition may be refused: (1) If the offence was committed outside the territory of the requesting State by a person not a national of that State, where the law of the requested State does Vol. 1695. 1-29219 1992 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitks 291 not allow prosecution for the same offence when committed outside its territory by an alien; (2) If the person claimed is the subject of proceedings in the requested State in respect of the offence for which extradition is requested or if the judicial author- ities of the requested State have decided to terminate the proceedings brought by them in respect of that offence, in accordance with procedures consistent with the law of that State; (3) If a final judgement of conviction or acquittal has been passed in a third State in respect of the offence or offences for which extradition is requested. Article 8 Extradition also may be refused if the offence concerned is punishable by death under the law of only the requesting State. Article 9 This Convention shall not prevent either State from refusing extradition on humanitarian grounds, if the surrender of the person claimed is likely to have very serious consequences for that person, particularly in view of his age, state of health or any other personal reason. Article 10 The request for extradition and all subsequent correspondence shall be commu- nicated through the diplomatic channel. Article 11 The request for extradition shall be made in writing and shall be accompanied by: (1) The original or an authenticated copy either of the final sentence or of the warrant of arrest or any other order having the same effect, issued in accordance with the procedure laid down by the law of the requesting State; (2) A statement of the circumstances of the offence for which extradition is requested. The time and place at which it was committed, the legal description and references to the relevant legal provisions shall be set out as accurately as possible; (3) A copy of the relevant legal provisions and, where the offence was com- mitted outside the territory of the requesting State, a copy of the legal provisions establishing the competence of the requesting State; (4) As precise a description as possible of the person claimed and any other information which may serve to establish his identity, nationality and whereabouts. Article 12 If the information communicated by the requesting State is found to be insuffi- cient to allow the requested State to make a decision in pursuance of this Conven- tion, the latter State shall request the necessary supplementary information and may fix a time-limit for the receipt of such information. Vol. 1695. 1-29219 292 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 1992 Article 13 1. In an emergency, the competent authorities of the requesting State may request the provisional arrest of the person sought. The competent authorities of the requested State shall decide on the request in accordance with the law of that State. 2. The request for provisional arrest shall state that one of the documents mentioned in article 11, paragraph 1, exists and that it is intended to send a request for extradition; it shall also state for what offence extradition is requested, the time, place and circumstances in which it was committed and, to the extent possible, shall give a description and indicate the whereabouts of the person sought. 3. The request for provisional arrest shall be sent to the competent authorities of the requested State, either through the diplomatic channel, directly by post, tele- gram or telex, or through the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol). The requesting authority shall be informed without delay of the action taken on its request. 4. Provisional arrest may be terminated if, within a period of 20 days after the arrest, the requested State has not received the request for extradition and the docu- ments mentioned in article 11; in no case shall it extend beyond 40 days following the arrest. However, provisional release may be ordered at any time, but the re- quested State must take all such measures as it deems necessary to prevent the flight of the person claimed. 5. Such release shall be without prejudice to a new arrest and to extradition if the request for extradition arrives at a later stage. Article 14 If extradition is requested simultaneously by several States, either for the same act or for different acts, the requested State shall make its decision giving due regard to all circumstances, in particular to the relative seriousness of the offences and the places where they were committed, the respective dates of the requests, the nation- ality of the person claimed and the possibility of subsequent extradition to another State. Article 15 1. The requested State shall inform the requesting State of its decision with regard to extradition. 2. Reasons shall be given for any complete or partial rejection. 3. If extradition is granted, the requesting State shall be informed of the place and date of the surrender and of the length of time for which the person claimed was detained. 4. Subject to the situation envisaged in paragraph 5 of this article, if the person claimed has not been taken over on the date prescribed, he may be released after a period of 15 days from that date and shall in any event be released after a period of 30 days. The person released may not be claimed again for the same offences. 5. If, owing to force majeure, the person claimed cannot be surrendered or taken over, the State concerned shall so inform the other State; the two States shall agree on another date for surrender and the provisions of paragraph 4 of this article shall apply. Vol. 1695. 1-29219 1992 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 293 Article 16 The requested State may postpone extradition of the person claimed in order to prosecute him or in order to make him serve a sentence in respect of an offence other than that for which extradition has been requested, and shall so inform the re- questing State. Article 17 1. The person surrendered may not be the subject of proceedings or be sen- tenced or be detained for the purpose of serving a sentence or complying with a detention order, or subjected to any other restriction of his personal liberty, in re- spect of any offence committed prior to his surrender other than that which has given rise to the extradition, except in the following cases: (a) When the State which surrendered him so consents. To this end, a request shall be submitted, accompanied by the documents referred to in article 11 and by a legal record reproducing any statements by the extradited person. Such consent shall be given only where the offence in respect of which it is requested itself gives rise to an obligation to extradite under this Convention; (b) When the extradited person, having had the opportunity to leave the terri- tory of the State to which he was surrendered, has not done so within 60 days of his final release or has returned to that territory after leaving it. 2. The requesting State may, however, take the necessary steps for possi- ble expulsion from the territory or for suspension of the time-limit, pursuant to its legislation. 3. If the legal designation of an offence for which a person has been extradited is altered, the person may be prosecuted or tried only if the newly designated offence: (a) Could be grounds for extradition under this Convention; and (b) Relates to the same acts as the offence in respect of which extradition was granted. Article 18 1. At the request of the requesting State, the requested State shall, to the extent permitted by its legislation, seize and deliver articles: (a) Which may serve as evidence; or (b) Which, having been obtained as a result of the commission of the offence, were found in the possession of the person claimed at the time of his arrest or discovered subsequently. 2. The articles referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall be delivered even if extradition already agreed to cannot be carried out owing to the death or escape of the person claimed. 3. Where such articles are likely to be seized or confiscated in the territory of the requested State, that State may temporarily retain the articles or forward them, on condition that they are returned, if they are necessary for the purpose of criminal proceedings which are in progress. 4. Any rights which the requested State or third parties may have acquired to the said articles shall be reserved. Where such rights exist, the articles shall be Vol. 1695, 1-29219 294 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 1992 returned without charge to the requested State as soon as possible after the pro- ceedings are concluded. Article 19 The Contracting State to which a person has been handed over under this Con- vention may not hand him over to a third State without the consent of the other State, except in the circumstances referred to in article 17, paragraph 1 (b). The requested State may require that the documents refered to in article 11 be produced. Article 20 1. Transit through the territory of either State shall be authorized upon sub- mission of a request in the manner set forth in article 10, provided that the offence is not considered by the State through which transit is requested to be of a political or purely military nature within the meaning of article 4 of this Convention. 2. Transit may be refused in all other situations in which extradition is refused. 3. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 (a) of this article, the documents provided for in article 11 must be produced. 4. If air transport is to be used, the following provisions shall apply: (a) When no intermediate landing is scheduled, the requesting State shall notify the State over whose territory the flight is to be made and shall certify that one of the documents mentioned in article 11, paragraph 1, exists. In the case of an un- scheduled landing, such notification shall produce the same effects as the request for provisional arrest referred to in article 13, and the requesting State shall submit a formal request for transit; (b) When an intermediate landing is scheduled, the requesting State shall sub- mit a formal request for transit. Article 21 The procedures of provisional arrest, extradition and transit shall be governed solely by the law of the requested State. Article 22 With the exception of the costs of transfer and the costs incurred in connection with transit, which shall be borne by the requesting State, the costs of the extradition shall be borne by the State in whose territory these costs were incurred. Article 23 1. Each Contracting State shall notify the other of the completion of the pro- cedures required under its Constitution for the entry into force of this Convention. The notifications indicating that these procedures have been completed shall be exchanged as soon as possible. 2. This Convention shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following the date of receipt of the latter of these notifications. 3. Either State may denounce this Convention at any time by sending notice of denunciation through the diplomatic channel; denunciation shall take effect one year after the date of receipt of such notice.

In that note the Royal Government declare that: \"Inasmuch as it is considered advisable to establish in a precise and definite manner a standard principle for the application of Article 14 of the preliminary Regulations to the Italian Customs Tariff, as regards the importation into Italy of drugs and medical preparations from the United Kingdom, and in view of the fact that the Superior Council of Public Health is of opinion that the Regulations which govern the production of drugs and medical preparations in the United Kingdom offer, as far as sanitary safeguards are concerned, identically efficacious guarantees to those ensured by Italian legislation for the national production of drugs and medi- cal preparations, the Royal Government has decided on principle to grant to drugs and medical preparations produced in the United Kingdom as far as sanitary regula- tions are concerned, and in order to avoid the necessity of applying special precau- tionary measures in the case of each individual product, unrestricted entry into Italian territory, always provided that His Britannic Majesty's Government is pre- pared to grant identical treatment, as far as sanitary regulations are concerned, to Italian drugs and medical preparations imported into the United Kingdom.\" His Majesty's Government, having taken note of this declaration, declare that they are prepared, on their part, to grant identical treatment, as far as sanitary reg- ulations are concerned, to Italian drugs and medical preparations imported into the United Kingdom.

Samples of a replacement brake lining assembly type shall be tested on a machine capdble of generating the test conditions and applying the test procedures described in this annex. 1.2. Test results shall be evaluated to determine sample friction behaviour. 1.3. The friction behaviour of samples shall be compared to assess conformity with the standard registered for a replacement brake lining assembly type. 2. EQUIPMENT 2.1. The machine shall be designed to accept and operate a full scale brake similar to those fitted to the vehicle axle used for approval testing to paragraph 5 of this Regulation. 2.2. The disc or drum rotational speed shall be 660 + 10 I/min without load and shall not fall below 600 I/min on full load. 2.3. The mean contact pressure at the brake lining working surface shall be constant at 100+ 20 N/cm2 for pad assemblies and 22 \u00b1 6 N/cm2 for shoe assemblies, calculated for a static brake without self-energizing. 2.4. The test cycles and brake applications during the cycles to be adjustable and automatic. 2.5. Output torque and working surface temperature shall be recorded. 2.6. Provision shall be made to direct cooling air across the brake at a rate of 600 + 60 m3/hr. 3. TEST PROCEDURE 3.1. Sample Preparation The manufacturer's bedding schedule shall ensure a minimum of 80 per cent surface contact area for pad assemblies without exceeding a surface temperature of 3000 C and 70 per cent surface contact area for leading shoe assemblies without exceeding a surface temperature of 2000 C. 3.2. Test Schedule The test schedule comprises a number of consecutive braking cycles each containing 10 braking intervals of 5 seconds brake applied followed by 10 seconds brake released. 3.2.1. For pad assemblies six cycles without forced cooling one cycle with forced cooling. Initial temperature for first application of first cycle 60*C max. Initial temperature for first application of all subsequent cycles 1000 C. Vol. 1695, A-4789 344 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitks 1992 3.2.2. For shoe assemblies one cycle with forced cooling limiting temperature to 2000 C. One cycle without forced cooling One cycle with forced cooling limiting temperature to 2000 C One cycle without forced cooling Initial temperature for first application of first cycle 600 C max. Initial temperature for first application of subsequent cycles 1000 C. 4. EVALUATION OF TEST RESULTS Friction behaviour is determined from the brake torque noted at selected points in a test schedule. Where brake factor is constant, e.g. a disc brake, brake torque may be translated to coefficient of friction. 4.1. Pad Assemblies 4.1.1. The operational coefficient of friction (pop) is the mean of the values recorded during cycles two to seven; measurement being made one second after commencing the first brake application of each cycle. 4.1.2. The maximum coefficient of friction (1,..) is the highest value recorded during cycles one to seven inclusive. 4.1.3. The minimum coefficient of friction (ymin) is the lowest value recorded during cycles one to seven inclusive. 4.2. Shoe Assemblies 4.2.1. The mean torque (Mman) is the average of the maximum and minimum values of brake torque recorded during the fifth brake application of cycles one and three. 4.2.2. The hot torque (Mho) is the minimum brake torque developed during cycles two and four. If the temperature exceeds 300* C during these cycles the value at 3000 C is to be taken as M4h. 5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 5.1. With each application for approval of a replacement brake lining assembly type there shall be submitted: 5.1.1. for pad assemblies, values for y,, u,,,,, Pmax- 5.1.2. for shoe assemblies, values for Mm\u00a2m and Mh,,.
