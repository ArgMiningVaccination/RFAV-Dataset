Throughout history, illness has been attributed to [witchcraft](/index.php?title=Witchcraft&action=edit&redlink=1), [demons](/index.php?title=Demons&action=edit&redlink=1), adverse [astral influence](/index.php?title=Astrology&action=edit&redlink=1), or the will of the [gods](/index.php?title=Deity&action=edit&redlink=1). These ideas still retain some power, with [faith healing](/index.php/Faith_healing) and [shrines](/index.php?title=Shrine&action=edit&redlink=1) still used in some places, although the rise of scientific medicine over the past millenium has altered or replaced many of the old beliefs. General overview of the history of medicine Herbalism Although there is no actual record of when the use of plants for medicinal purposes first started, the first generally accepted use of plants as healing agents was depicted in the cave paintings discovered in the [Lascaux](/index.php?title=Lascaux&action=edit&redlink=1) caves in France, which have been [radiocarbon dated](/index.php/Radiocarbon_dating) to between 13,000 and 25,000 BC. Over time and with trial and error, a small base of knowledge was acquired within early tribal communities. As this knowledge base expanded over the generations, tribal culture developed into specialized areas. These 'specialized jobs' became what are now known as healers or [shamans](/index.php/Shaman). Indian medicine In [Mehrgarh](/index.php?title=Mehrgarh&action=edit&redlink=1), [Pakistan](/index.php?title=Pakistan&action=edit&redlink=1), archeologists made the discovery that the people of [Indus Valley Civilization](/index.php?title=Indus_Valley_Civilization&action=edit&redlink=1), even from the early Harappan periods (c. [3300 BC](/index.php?title=3300_BC&action=edit&redlink=1)), had knowledge of medicine and [dentistry](/index.php/Dentistry). The physical anthropologist that carried out the examinations, Professor Andrea Cucina from the University of Missouri-Columbia, made the discovery when he was cleaning the teeth from one of the men. Later research in the same area found evidence of teeth having been drilled, dating back 9,000 years. [[1]](#cite_note-1) [Ayurveda](/index.php/Ayurveda) (the science of living), is the literate, scholarly system of medicine that originated over 2000 years ago in South Asia. Its two most famous texts belong to the schools of [Caraka](/index.php/Caraka) and [Suruta](/index.php?title=Su%C5%9Bruta&action=edit&redlink=1). While these writings display some limited continuities with very ancient medical ideas known from the religious literature called the [Veda](/index.php?title=Veda&action=edit&redlink=1), historians have been able to demonstrate direct historical connections between early yurveda and the early literature of the Buddhists and Jains. It seems that the earliest foundations of yurveda were built on a synthesis of selected ancient herbal practices dating back to the early second millennium BC, together with a massive addition of theoretical conceptualizations, new nosologies and new therapies dating from about 400 BC onwards, and coming out of the communities of thinkers who included the Buddha and others. - Zysk, Asceticism and Healing in Ancient India: Medicine in the Buddhist Monastery (OUP). According to the compendium of [Caraka](/index.php/Caraka), the [Carakasamhit](/index.php?title=Carakasamhit%C4%81&action=edit&redlink=1), health and disease are not predetermined and life may be prolonged by human effort. The compendium of [Suruta](/index.php?title=Su%C5%9Bruta&action=edit&redlink=1), the [Surutasamhit](/index.php?title=Su%C5%9Brutasamhit%C4%81&action=edit&redlink=1) defines the purpose of medicine to cure the diseases of the sick, protect the healthy, and to prolong life. Both these ancient compendia include details of the examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of numerous ailments. The [Surutasamhit](/index.php?title=Su%C5%9Brutasamhit%C4%81&action=edit&redlink=1) is notable for describing procedures on various forms of [surgery](/index.php/Surgery), including [rhinoplasty](/index.php/Rhinoplasty), the repair of torn ear lobes, perineal lithotomy, cataract surgery, and several other excisions and other surgical procedures. The yurvedic classics spoke of of rejuvenation), and vjkaraa (aphrodesiacs, mainly for men). Apart from learning these, the student of yurveda was expected to know ten arts that were indispensable in the preparation and application of his medicines: distillation, operative skills, cooking, horticulture, metallurgy, sugar manufacture, pharmacy, analysis and separation of minerals, compounding of metals, and preparation of alkalis. The teaching of various subjects was done during the instruction of relevant clinical subjects. For example, teaching of anatomy was a part of the teaching of surgery, [embryology](/index.php/Embryology) was a part of training in pediatrics and [obstetrics](/index.php/Obstetrics), and the knowledge of [physiology](/index.php/Physiology) and [pathology](/index.php/Pathology) was interwoven in the teaching of all the clinical disciplines. At the closing of the initiation, the [guru](/index.php?title=Guru&action=edit&redlink=1) gave a solemn address to the students where the guru directed the students to a life of chastity, honesty, and [vegetarianism](/index.php?title=Vegetarianism&action=edit&redlink=1). The student was to strive with all his being for the health of the sick. He was not to betray patients for his own advantage. He was to dress modestly and avoid strong drink. He was to be collected and self-controlled, measured in speech at all times. He was to constantly improve his knowledge and technical skill. In the home of the patient he was to be courteous and modest, directing all attention to the patient's welfare. He was not to divulge any knowledge about the patient and his family. If the patient was incurable, he was to keep this to himself if it was likely to harm the patient or others. The normal length of the student's training appears to have been seven years. Before graduation, the student was to pass a test. But the physician was to continue to learn through texts, direct observation ( [pratyaksha](/index.php?title=Pratyaksha&action=edit&redlink=1)), and through inference ( [anumna](/index.php?title=Anum%C4%81na&action=edit&redlink=1)). In addition, the [vaidyas](/index.php?title=Vaidyas&action=edit&redlink=1) attended meetings where knowledge was exchanged. The doctors were also enjoined to gain knowledge of unusual remedies from hillsmen, herdsmen, and forest-dwellers. - Dominik Wujastyk, The Roots of Ayurveda (Penguin, 2003). Egyptian medicine Medical information contained in the [Edwin Smith Papyrus](/index.php?title=Edwin_Smith_Papyrus&action=edit&redlink=1) [[2]](#cite_note-2) may date to a time as early as [3000 BC](/index.php?title=3000_BC&action=edit&redlink=1) [[3]](#cite_note-3). The earliest known [surgery](/index.php/Surgery) in Egypt in [Egypt](/index.php?title=History_of_ancient_Egypt&action=edit&redlink=1) around [2750 BC](/index.php?title=2800_BC&action=edit&redlink=1) (see [surgery](/index.php/Surgery)). [Imhotep](/index.php/Imhotep) in the [3rd dynasty](/index.php?title=Third_dynasty_of_Egypt&action=edit&redlink=1) is sometimes credited with being the founder of ancient Egyptian medicine and with being the original author of the Edwin Smith [papyrus](/index.php?title=Papyrus&action=edit&redlink=1), detailing cures, ailments and [anatomical](/index.php/Anatomical) observations. The Edwin Smith papyrus is regarded as a copy of several earlier works and was written circa [1600 BC](/index.php?title=1600s_BC&action=edit&redlink=1). It is an ancient textbook on surgery almost completely devoid of magical thinking and describes in exquisite detail the examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of numerous ailments [[4]](#cite_note-4). Conversely, the [Ebers papyrus](/index.php/Ebers_papyrus) [[5]](#cite_note-5) (c. [1550 BC](/index.php?title=16th_century_BC&action=edit&redlink=1)) is full of incantations and foul applications meant to turn away disease-causing demons, and other superstition. The Ebers papyrus also provides our earliest possible documentation of ancient awareness of [tumors](/index.php/Tumor), but ancient medical terminology being badly understood, cases pEbers 546 and 547 for instance may refer to simple swellings. The Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus [[6]](#cite_note-6) treats women's complaints, problems with conception. Thirty four cases detailing diagnosis and treatment survive, some of them fragmentarily [[7]](#cite_note-7) Medical institutions, referred to as Houses of Life are known to have been established in [ancient Egypt](/index.php?title=Ancient_Egypt&action=edit&redlink=1) since as early as the [1st Dynasty](/index.php?title=First_dynasty_of_Egypt&action=edit&redlink=1) [[8]](#cite_note-articles8c-8). By the time of the [19th Dynasty](/index.php?title=Nineteenth_dynasty_of_Egypt&action=edit&redlink=1) some workers enjoyed such benefits as [medical insurance](/index.php/Medical_insurance), [pensions](/index.php?title=Pensions&action=edit&redlink=1) and [sick leave](/index.php?title=Sick_leave&action=edit&redlink=1). [[8]](#cite_note-articles8c-8) The also credited to [ancient Egypt](/index.php?title=History_of_ancient_Egypt&action=edit&redlink=1): [Hesyre](/index.php?title=Hesyre&action=edit&redlink=1), \"Chief of Dentists and in the [27th century BC](/index.php?title=27th_century_BC&action=edit&redlink=1). [[8]](#cite_note-articles8c-8) Also, the earliest known woman physician, [Peseshet](/index.php?title=Peseshet&action=edit&redlink=1), practiced in [Ancient Egypt](/index.php?title=Ancient_Egypt&action=edit&redlink=1) at the time of the [4th dynasty](/index.php?title=Fourth_dynasty_of_Egypt&action=edit&redlink=1). Her title was \"Lady Overseer of the Lady Physicians.\" In addition to her supervisory role, Peseshet graduated midwives at an ancient Egyptian medical school in [Sais](/index.php?title=Sais&action=edit&redlink=1). [[8]](#cite_note-articles8c-8) See also the article on ancient Egyptian medicine posted at [Indiana University: Medicine in Ancient Egypt](http://www.indiana.edu/~ancmed/egypt.HTM). Babylonian medicine - Further information: [Babylonia - Medicine](/index.php?title=Babylonia&action=edit&redlink=1) The oldest Babylonian texts on [medicine](/index.php/Medicine) date back to the [Old Babylonian](/index.php?title=Old_Babylonian&action=edit&redlink=1) period in the first half of the [2nd millenium BC](/index.php?title=2nd_millenium_BC&action=edit&redlink=1). The most extensive Babylonian medical text, however, is the Diagnostic Handbook written by the physician Esagil-kin-apli of [Borsippa](/index.php?title=Borsippa&action=edit&redlink=1), [[9]](#cite_note-Stol-99-9) during reign of the BC). [[10]](#cite_note-10) Along with contemporary [ancient Babylonians introduced the concepts of [diagnosis](/index.php/Diagnosis), [prognosis](/index.php/Prognosis), [physical examination](/index.php/Physical_examination), and [prescriptions](/index.php/Prescription). In addition, the Diagnostic Handbook introduced the methods of [therapy](/index.php/Therapy) and a [etiology](/index.php/Etiology) and the use of [empiricism](/index.php?title=Empiricism&action=edit&redlink=1), [logic](/index.php/Logic) and [rationality](/index.php?title=Rationality&action=edit&redlink=1) in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. The text contains a list of medical [symptoms](/index.php/Symptom) and often detailed empirical [observations](/index.php/Observation) along with logical rules used in combining observed symptoms on the body of a [patient](/index.php/Patient) with its diagnosis and prognosis. [[11]](#cite_note-11) The Diagnostic Handbook was based on a logical set of [axioms](/index.php/Axiom) and assumptions, including the modern view that through the examination and [inspection](/index.php?title=Inspection&action=edit&redlink=1) of the symptoms of a patient, it is possible to determine the patient's [disease](/index.php/Disease), its aetiology and future development, and the chances of the patient's recovery. The symptoms and diseases of a patient were treated through therapeutic means such as [bandages](/index.php/Bandage), [creams](/index.php?title=Cream&action=edit&redlink=1) and [pills](/index.php?title=Pill&action=edit&redlink=1). [[9]](#cite_note-Stol-99-9) Persian medicine The practice and study of medicine in [Persia](/index.php?title=Persia&action=edit&redlink=1) has a long and prolific history. Persia's position at the crossroads of the East and the West frequently placed it in the midst of developments in both ancient Greek and Indian medicine. Many contributions were added to this body of knowledge in both pre- and post-Islamic Iran as well. The first generation of Persian physicians was trained at the [Academy of Jundishapur](/index.php?title=Academy_of_Jundishapur&action=edit&redlink=1), where the teaching hospital has sometimes been claimed to have been invented. Rhazes, for example, became the first physician to systematically use alcohol in his practice as a physician. The Comprehensive Book of Medicine (Large Comprehensive, Hawi, \"al-Hawi\" or \"The Continence\") was written by the Iranian chemist [Rhazes](/index.php?title=Rhazes&action=edit&redlink=1) (known also as [Razi](/index.php?title=Rhazes&action=edit&redlink=1)), the \"Large Comprehensive\" was the most sought after of all his compositions. In it, Rhazes recorded clinical cases of his own experience and provided very useful recordings of various diseases. The \"Kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah\" by Rhazes, with its introduction on [measles](/index.php/Measles) and [smallpox](/index.php/Smallpox) was also very influential in [Europe](/index.php?title=Europe&action=edit&redlink=1). The [Mutazilite](/index.php?title=Mutazilite&action=edit&redlink=1) philosopher and doctor [Ibn Sina](/index.php/Ibn_Sina) (also known as [Avicenna](/index.php?title=Avicenna&action=edit&redlink=1) in the western world) was another influential figure. His [The Canon of Medicine](/index.php/The_Canon_of_Medicine), sometimes considered the most famous book in the history of medicine, remained a standard text in Europe up until its [Age of Enlightenment](/index.php?title=Age_of_Enlightenment&action=edit&redlink=1). Chinese medicine China also developed a large body of traditional medicine. Much of the philosophy of [traditional Chinese medicine](/index.php/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) derived from empirical observations of disease and illness by [Taoist](/index.php?title=Taoist&action=edit&redlink=1) physicians and reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. These causative principles, whether material, essential, or mystical, correlate as the expression of the natural order of the universe. During the golden age of his reign from 2696 to 2598 B.C, as a result of a dialogue with his minister Ch'i Pai, the [Yellow Emperor](/index.php?title=Yellow_Emperor&action=edit&redlink=1) is supposed by Chinese tradition to have composed his Neijing () [Suwen](/index.php?title=Suwen&action=edit&redlink=1) () or Basic Questions of Internal Medicine. During the Han dynasty, Chang Chung-Ching, who was mayor of Chang-sha near the end of the second century A.D., wrote a Treatise on Typhoid Fever, which contains the earliest known reference to [Neijing Suwen](/index.php?title=Neijing_Suwen&action=edit&redlink=1). The [Jin Dynasty](/index.php?title=Jin_Dynasty_(265%E2%80%93420)&action=edit&redlink=1) practitioner (215-282 A.D), also quotes the [Yellow Emperor](/index.php?title=Yellow_Emperor&action=edit&redlink=1) in his Chia I Ching, ca. 265 A.D. During the Tang dynasty, Wang Ping claimed to have located a copy of the originals of the Neijing Suwen, which he expanded and edited substantially. This work was revisited by an imperial commission during the eleventh century A.D., and the result is our best extant representation of the foundational roots of traditional Chinese medicine. Hebrew medicine Most of our knowledge of ancient Hebrew medicine during the [1st millennium BCE](/index.php?title=1st_millennium_BCE&action=edit&redlink=1) comes from the [Torah](/index.php?title=Torah&action=edit&redlink=1), i.e. the Five Books of [Moses](/index.php?title=Moses&action=edit&redlink=1), which contain various health related laws and rituals, such as isolating infected people (Leviticus 13:45-46), washing after handling a dead body (Numbers 19:11-19) and burying excrement away from camp (Deuteronomy 23:12-13). Max Neuberger, writing in his \"History of Medicine\" says\" - \"The commands concern prophylaxis and suppression of epidemics, suppression of venereal disease and prostitution, care of the skin, baths , food, housing and clothing, regulation of labour , sexual life , discipline of the people , etc. Many of these commands, such as Sabbath rest, circumcision, laws concerning food (interdiction of blood and pork), measures concerning menstruating and lying-in women and those suffering from gonorrhoea, isolation of lepers, and hygiene of the camp, are, in view of the conditions of the climate, surprisingly rational.\"(Neuburger: History of Medicine, Oxford University Press, 1910, Vol. I, p. 38). Greco-Roman medicine Since the discovery in 1991 of the frozen and preserved body of [\u00d6tzi the Iceman](/index.php?title=%C3%96tzi_the_Iceman&action=edit&redlink=1) in the Austrian-Italian Alps, it has been thought that the history of medicine moved further back in time. He was aged about 46 and had over 40 tattoos, most of them in locations where medical analysis also showed he had disease or pain such as arthritis. His death occurred in 3300 BC and his body, held in the museum in [Bolzano](/index.php?title=Bolzano&action=edit&redlink=1), is the oldest preserved European [mummy](/index.php?title=Mummy&action=edit&redlink=1). As societies developed in Europe and Asia, belief systems were replaced with a different natural system. The [Greeks](/index.php?title=Ancient_Greece&action=edit&redlink=1), from [Hippocrates](/index.php?title=Hippocrates&action=edit&redlink=1), developed a humoral medicine system where treatment was to restore the balance of [humours](/index.php?title=Classical_element&action=edit&redlink=1) within the body. [Ancient Medicine](/index.php?title=Ancient_Medicine&action=edit&redlink=1) is a treatise on medicine, written roughly [400 BC](/index.php?title=400_BC&action=edit&redlink=1) by Hippocrates. Similar views were espoused in [China](/index.php?title=China&action=edit&redlink=1) and in [India](/index.php?title=India&action=edit&redlink=1). (See [Medicine in ancient Greece](/index.php?title=Medicine_in_ancient_Greece&action=edit&redlink=1) for more details.) In Greece, through [Galen](/index.php?title=Galen&action=edit&redlink=1) until the [Renaissance](/index.php?title=Renaissance&action=edit&redlink=1) the main thrust of medicine was the maintenance of health by control of [diet](/index.php/Diet_(nutrition)) and [hygiene](/index.php/Hygiene). [Anatomical](/index.php/Anatomy) knowledge was limited and there were few surgical or other cures, doctors relied on a good relation with patients and dealt with minor ailments and soothing chronic conditions and could do little when epidemic diseases, growing out of [urbanization](/index.php?title=Urbanization&action=edit&redlink=1) and the [domestication](/index.php?title=Domestication&action=edit&redlink=1) of animals, then raged across the world. Medieval medicine was an evolving mixture of the [scientific](/index.php/Science) and the spiritual. In the early [Middle Ages](/index.php?title=Middle_Ages&action=edit&redlink=1), following the fall of the [Roman Empire](/index.php?title=Roman_Empire&action=edit&redlink=1), standard medical knowledge was based chiefly upon surviving Greek and Roman texts, preserved in monasteries and elsewhere. Ideas about the origin and cure of [disease](/index.php/Disease) were not, however, purely [secular](/index.php?title=Secular&action=edit&redlink=1), but were also based on a [spiritual](/index.php?title=Spirituality&action=edit&redlink=1) world view, in which factors such as destiny, sin, and astral influences played as great a part as any physical cause. Medicine was notably not one of the seven classical [Artes liberales](/index.php?title=Artes_liberales&action=edit&redlink=1), and was consequently looked upon more as a handicraft than as a science. Medicine did, nevertheless, establish itself as a faculty, along with [law](/index.php?title=Law&action=edit&redlink=1) and [theology](/index.php?title=Theology&action=edit&redlink=1) in the first European [Universities](/index.php?title=Medieval_university&action=edit&redlink=1) from the 12th century. Islamic medicine The [Islamic civilization](/index.php?title=Islamic_Golden_Age&action=edit&redlink=1) rose to primacy in medical science as Muslim [physicians](/index.php/Physician) contributed significantly to the field of medicine, including [pharmacology](/index.php/Pharmacology), [pharmacy](/index.php/Pharmacy), [physiology](/index.php/Physiology), [surgery](/index.php/Surgery), and the [pharmaceutical sciences](/index.php/Pharmaceutical_sciences). physicians set up some of the earliest dedicated [hospitals](/index.php/Hospital), which later spread to Europe during the [Crusades](/index.php?title=Crusade&action=edit&redlink=1), inspired by the hospitals in the Middle East. [[12]](#cite_note-Sarton-12) [Al-Kindi](/index.php?title=Al-Kindi&action=edit&redlink=1) wrote [De Gradibus](/index.php?title=De_Gradibus&action=edit&redlink=1), in which he demonstrated the application of mathematics to medicine, particularly in the field of pharmacology. This includes the development of a mathematical scale to quantify the strength of [drugs](/index.php/Drug), and a system that would allow a doctor to determine in advance the most critical days of a patient's illness. [[13]](#cite_note-13) [Razi](/index.php?title=Rhazes&action=edit&redlink=1) (Rhazes) (865-925) recorded [clinical](/index.php/Clinical) cases of his own experience and provided very useful recordings of various [diseases](/index.php/Disease). His Comprehensive Book of Medicine, which introduced [measles](/index.php/Measles) and [smallpox](/index.php/Smallpox), was very influential in Europe. In his Doubts about Galen, Razi was also the first to prove both [Galen](/index.php?title=Galen&action=edit&redlink=1)'s theory of [humorism](/index.php/Humorism) and [Aristotle](/index.php/Aristotle)'s theory of [classical using an experimental method. [[14]](#cite_note-14) [Abu al-Qasim](/index.php?title=Abu_al-Qasim&action=edit&redlink=1) (Abulcasis), regarded as the Kitab [al-Tasrif](/index.php?title=Al-Tasrif&action=edit&redlink=1) ( [1000](/index.php?title=1000&action=edit&redlink=1)), a 30-volume which was taught at Muslim and European [medical schools](/index.php/Medical_school) until the 17th century. He invented numerous [surgical instruments](/index.php/Surgical_instruments), including the first instruments unique to women, [[16]](#cite_note-Saad-16) as well as the surgical uses of considered the father of modern medicine [[20]](#cite_note-20) and one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history, [[12]](#cite_note-Sarton-12) wrote [The Canon of Healing](/index.php?title=The_Book_of_Healing&action=edit&redlink=1) ( [11th century](/index.php?title=11th_century&action=edit&redlink=1)), which remained standard textbooks in both Muslim and European [universities](/index.php?title=University&action=edit&redlink=1) until the 17th century. Avicenna's contributions include the introduction of systematic [experimentation](/index.php/Experiment) and [quantification](/index.php/Quantification) into the study of [physiology](/index.php/Physiology), [[21]](#cite_note-21) the discovery of the contagious nature of [infectious diseases](/index.php/Infectious_disease), the introduction of [quarantine](/index.php/Quarantine) to limit the spread of contagious diseases, the introduction of [experimental medicine](/index.php?title=Experimental_medicine&action=edit&redlink=1) and [clinical trials](/index.php/Clinical_trial), [[23]](#cite_note-23) the distinction of [mediastinitis](/index.php/Mediastinitis) from [pleurisy](/index.php/Pleurisy), the contagious nature of [phthisis](/index.php?title=Phthisis&action=edit&redlink=1) and [tuberculosis](/index.php/Tuberculosis), the distribution of [diseases](/index.php/Disease) by [water](/index.php/Water) and [soil](/index.php/Soil), and the first careful descriptions [sexually transmitted diseases](/index.php/Sexually_transmitted_disease), [perversions](/index.php?title=Perversion&action=edit&redlink=1), and [nervous](/index.php/Nervous_system) [ailments](/index.php?title=Ailment&action=edit&redlink=1), well the use of [ice](/index.php/Ice) to treat [fevers](/index.php/Fever), and the separation of [medicine](/index.php/Medicine) from [pharmacology](/index.php/Pharmacology), which was important to the development [pharmaceutical sciences](/index.php/Pharmaceutical_sciences). [[16]](#cite_note-Saad-16) In in [eye surgery](/index.php/Eye_surgery), as he studied and correctly explained the process of [sight](/index.php/Sight) and [visual perception](/index.php/Visual_perception) for the first time (1021).

[[25]](#cite_note-25) He also described the earliest concept of [metabolism](/index.php/Metabolism), [[26]](#cite_note-26) and developed new systems of [physiology](/index.php/Physiology) and [psychology](/index.php/Psychology) to replace the [Avicennian](/index.php?title=Avicenna&action=edit&redlink=1) and [Galenic](/index.php?title=Galen&action=edit&redlink=1) systems, while discrediting many of their erroneous of four [humours](/index.php/Humorism) supported by [Galen](/index.php?title=Galen&action=edit&redlink=1) and [Hippocrates](/index.php?title=Hippocrates&action=edit&redlink=1), discovered that the [body](/index.php/Body) and its preservation depend exclusively upon [blood](/index.php/Blood), rejected Galen's idea that women can produce [sperm](/index.php/Sperm), and discovered that the movement of [arteries](/index.php/Arteries) are not dependant upon the movement of the [heart](/index.php/Heart), that the heart is the first organ to form in a [fetus](/index.php/Fetus)' body (rather than the [brain](/index.php/Brain) as claimed by Hippocrates), and that the [bones](/index.php/Bone) forming the [skull](/index.php/Skull) can grow into [tumors](/index.php/Tumor). [[29]](#cite_note-29) [Maimonides](/index.php?title=Maimonides&action=edit&redlink=1), although a [Jew](/index.php?title=Jew&action=edit&redlink=1) himself, made various contributions to Islamic medicine in the 13th century. The Tashrih al-badan (Anatomy of the body) of [Mansur ibn Ilyas](/index.php/Mansur_ibn_Ilyas) (c. 1390) contained comprehensive Ibn Khatima and Ibn al-Khatib discovered that infecious diseases are caused by [microorganisms](/index.php/Microorganism) which enter the human body. [[31]](#cite_note-31) Other medical innovations first introduced by Muslim physicians include the discovery of the [immune system](/index.php/Immune_system), the introduction of [microbiology](/index.php/Microbiology), the use of [animal testing](/index.php/Animal_testing), and the combination of medicine with other [sciences](/index.php/Science) (including [agriculture](/index.php?title=Agriculture&action=edit&redlink=1), [botany](/index.php/Botany), [chemistry](/index.php/Chemistry), and [pharmacology](/index.php/Pharmacology)), [[16]](#cite_note-Saad-16) as the of the [injection](/index.php/Injection_(medicine)) [syringe](/index.php/Syringe) by Ammar ibn Ali al-Mawsili in 9th century [Iraq](/index.php?title=Iraq&action=edit&redlink=1), the first [drugstores](/index.php?title=Drugstore&action=edit&redlink=1) in [Baghdad](/index.php?title=Baghdad&action=edit&redlink=1) (754), the distinction between medicine and pharmacy by the 12th century, and the discovery of at least 2,000 medicinal and [chemical substances](/index.php/Chemical_substance). [[32]](#cite_note-32) European Renaissance and Enlightenment medicine This idea of medicine was challenged in Europe by the rise of experimental investigation, principally in dissection and examining bodies. The work of individuals like [Andreas Vesalius](/index.php/Andreas_Vesalius) and [William Harvey](/index.php?title=William_Harvey&action=edit&redlink=1) challenged accepted folklore with scientific evidence. Understanding and diagnosis improved but with little direct benefit to health. Few effective drugs existed, beyond [opium](/index.php/Opium) and [quinine](/index.php/Quinine), folklore cures and almost or actually poisonous metal-based compounds were popular, if useless, treatments. Important figures: [Guy de Chauliac](/index.php?title=Guy_de_Chauliac&action=edit&redlink=1), considered to be one of the earliest fathers of modern surgery, after the great Islamic surgeon, [El Zahrawi](/index.php?title=Abu_al-Qasim&action=edit&redlink=1). [Realdo Colombo](/index.php?title=Realdo_Colombo&action=edit&redlink=1), anatomist and surgeon who contributed to understanding of lesser circulation. [Michael Servetus](/index.php?title=Michael_Servetus&action=edit&redlink=1), considered to be the first European to discover the pulmonary circulation of the blood. [Ambroise Par\u00e9](/index.php?title=Ambroise_Par%C3%A9&action=edit&redlink=1)suggested using ligatures instead of cauterisation guessed their function. [Garcia de Orta](/index.php?title=Garcia_de_Orta&action=edit&redlink=1)first to describe [Cholera](/index.php/Cholera)and other tropical diseases and herbal treatments [Percivall Pott](/index.php?title=Percivall_Pott&action=edit&redlink=1), surgeon. - Sir and so-called \"English Hippocrates.\" Modern medicine Medicine was revolutionized in the 19th century and beyond by advances in [chemistry](/index.php/Chemistry) and laboratory techniques and equipment, old ideas of infectious disease epidemiology were replaced with [bacteriology](/index.php/Bacteriology). [Ignaz Semmelweis](/index.php?title=Ignaz_Semmelweis&action=edit&redlink=1) (1818-1865) in [1847](/index.php?title=1847&action=edit&redlink=1) dramatically reduced the death rate of new mothers from [childbed fever](/index.php?title=Childbed_fever&action=edit&redlink=1) by the simple expedient of requiring physicians to clean their hands before attending to women in [childbirth](/index.php/Childbirth). His discovery predated the [germ theory of disease](/index.php/Germ_theory_of_disease). However, his discoveries were not appreciated by his contemporaries and came into general use only with discoveries of British surgeon [Joseph Lister](/index.php/Joseph_Lister), who in [1865](/index.php?title=1865&action=edit&redlink=1) proved the principles of [antisepsis](/index.php?title=Antisepsis&action=edit&redlink=1); However, medical conservatism on new breakthroughs in pre-existing science prevented them from being generally well received during the 19th century. After [Charles Darwin](/index.php?title=Charles_Darwin&action=edit&redlink=1)'s 1859 publication of (1822-1884) published in 1865 his books on pea plants, which would be later known as [Mendel's laws](/index.php/Mendelian_inheritance). Re-discovered at the turn of the century, they would form the basis of [classical genetics](/index.php/History_of_genetics). The 1953 discovery of the structure of [DNA](/index.php/DNA) by [Watson](/index.php?title=James_D._Watson&action=edit&redlink=1) and [Crick](/index.php/Francis_Crick) would open the door to [molecular biology](/index.php/History_of_molecular_biology) and modern genetics. During the late 19th century and the first part of the 20th century, several physicians, such as Nobel prize winner Alexis Carrel, supported [eugenics](/index.php?title=Eugenics&action=edit&redlink=1), a theory first formulated in 1865 by [Francis Galton](/index.php?title=Francis_Galton&action=edit&redlink=1). Eugenics was discredited as a science after the [Nazis](/index.php?title=Nazi_Germany&action=edit&redlink=1)' experiments in [World War II](/index.php?title=World_War_II&action=edit&redlink=1) became known; however, [compulsory sterilization](/index.php?title=Compulsory_sterilization&action=edit&redlink=1) programs continued to be used in modern countries (including the US, Sweden or Peru) until much later. Semmelweis's work was supported by the discoveries made by [Louis Pasteur](/index.php?title=Louis_Pasteur&action=edit&redlink=1), who produced in 1880 the [vaccine](/index.php/Vaccine) against rabies. Linking microorganisms with disease, Pasteur brought about a revolution in medicine. He also invented with [Claude Bernard](/index.php?title=Claude_Bernard&action=edit&redlink=1) (1813-1878) the process of [pasteurization](/index.php/Pasteurization) still in use today. His experiments confirmed the germ theory. Claude Bernard aimed at establishing [scientific method](/index.php/Scientific_method) in medicine; he published An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine in 1865. Beside this, Pasteur, along with [Robert Koch](/index.php/Robert_Koch) (who was awarded the [Nobel Prize](/index.php/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine) in 1905), founded bacteriology. Koch was also famous for the discovery of the bacillus](/index.php/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis) ( [1882](/index.php?title=1882&action=edit&redlink=1)) and the his development of [Koch's postulates](/index.php/Koch%27s_postulates). The participation of women in medical care (beyond serving as midwives, sitters and cleaning women) was brought about by the likes of [Florence Nightingale](/index.php?title=Florence_Nightingale&action=edit&redlink=1). These women showed a previously male dominated profession the elemental role of nursing in order to lessen the aggravation of patient mortality which resulted from lack of hygiene and nutrition. Nightingale set up the St Thomas hospital, post-Crimea, in 1852. [Elizabeth Blackwell](/index.php?title=Elizabeth_Blackwell_(doctor)&action=edit&redlink=1) became the first woman to formally study, and subsequently practice, medicine in the United States. It was in this era that actual cures were developed for certain endemic infectious diseases. However the decline in many of the most lethal diseases was more due to improvements in public health and nutrition than to medicine. It was not until the 20th century that the application of the [scientific method](/index.php/Scientific_method) to medical research began to produce multiple important developments in medicine, with great advances in [pharmacology](/index.php/Pharmacology) and surgery. During the [First World War](/index.php?title=First_World_War&action=edit&redlink=1), [Alexis Carrel](/index.php?title=Alexis_Carrel&action=edit&redlink=1) and [Henry Dakin](/index.php?title=Henry_Drysdale_Dakin&action=edit&redlink=1) developed the Carrel-Dakin method of treating wounds with sutures, which prior to the development of widespread antibiotics, was a major medical progress. The antibiotic prevented the deaths of thousands during the conquest of [Vichy France](/index.php?title=Vichy_France&action=edit&redlink=1) in 1944. The great war spurred the usage of Roentgen's X-ray, and the electrocardiograph, for the monitoring of internal bodily functions, However, this was overshadowed by the remarkable mass production of penicillum antibiotics, which resulted from government and public pressure. In the early 1930s scientists in [Nazi Germany](/index.php?title=Nazi_Germany&action=edit&redlink=1) definitively linked [smoking](/index.php/Smoking) to [lung cancer](/index.php/Lung_cancer), leading to the most aggressive anti-smoking campaign ever. This knowledge was lost with the 1945 [United States'](/index.php?title=United_States_of_America&action=edit&redlink=1) occupation of [Germany](/index.php?title=Germany&action=edit&redlink=1). (Ref: The Nazi War on Cancer Robert N. Proctor, 2000, ISBN 0-691-07051-2) [Lunatic asylums](/index.php?title=Lunatic_asylum&action=edit&redlink=1) [Emil Kraepelin](/index.php/Emil_Kraepelin) (1856-1926) introduced new medical categories of mental illness, which eventually came into psychiatric usage despite their basis in behavior rather than [pathology or etiology](/index.php?title=Biopsychiatry_controversy&action=edit&redlink=1). In the 1920s [surrealist](/index.php?title=Surrealism&action=edit&redlink=1) opposition to psychiatry was expressed in a number of surrealist publications. In the 1930s several controversial medical practices were introduced including inducing seizures (by [electroshock](/index.php?title=Electroshock&action=edit&redlink=1), [insulin](/index.php/Insulin) or other drugs) or cutting parts of the brain apart ( [leucotomy](/index.php?title=Leucotomy&action=edit&redlink=1) or [lobotomy](/index.php/Lobotomy)). Both came into widespread use by psychiatry, but there were grave concerns and much opposition on grounds of basic morality, harmful effects, or misuse. In the 1950s new psychiatric drugs, notably the antipsychotic [chlorpromazine](/index.php/Chlorpromazine), were designed in laboratories and slowly came into preferred use. Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, there was some opposition, due to serious adverse effects such as [tardive dyskinesia](/index.php/Tardive_dyskinesia). Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control. There was also increasing opposition to the use of psychiatric hospitals, and attempts to move people back into the community on a collaborative [user-led group](/index.php?title=World_Network_of_Users_and_Survivors_of_Psychiatry&action=edit&redlink=1) approach (\"therapeutic communities\") not controlled by psychiatry. Campaigns against [masturbation](/index.php/Masturbation) were done in the [Victorian era](/index.php?title=Victorian_era&action=edit&redlink=1) and elsewhere. [Lobotomy](/index.php/Lobotomy) was used until the 1970s to treat [schizophrenia](/index.php/Schizophrenia). This was denounced by the [anti-psychiatric](/index.php?title=Anti-psychiatric&action=edit&redlink=1) movement in the 1960s and later. The 20th century witnessed a shift from a master-apprentice paradigm of teaching of clinical medicine to a more \"democratic\" system of medical schools. With the advent of the [evidence-based medicine](/index.php/Evidence-based_medicine) and great advances of information technology the process of change is likely to evolve further, the collation of ideas, resulted in international global projects, such as the Human genome project; However, adversely, the conditions brought about the increasing threat of pandemic spread of mutating diseases, such as SARS, and the danger of the H5N1. Evidence-based medicine, the application of modern scientific method to ask and answer clinical questions, has had a great impact on practice of medicine throughout the world of modern medicine, for speculation of the unknown was elemental to progress.
