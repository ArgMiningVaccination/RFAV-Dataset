As in this country, some people consume empon-empon as multivitamins consumption to prevent Coronavirus. Head of the Pharmacist Professional Study Program, Department of Pharmacology & Clinical Pharmacy, UGM Faculty of Pharmacy, Dr. Ika Puspitasari, M.Sc., Apt., appealed to the public to always maintain the immune system using the body's natural immune system to avoid the Coronavirus. Ika said there are several ways to activate the body's immune system. One of them is maintaining a balanced diet with nutrition. Also, drink at least six glasses of water/day, exercise at least three times a week for at least 30 minutes, and maintain overall body hygiene by bathing every day. No less important, wash your hands with soap or hand sanitizer every time you are going to eat or drink and get out of the bathroom, as well as resting or getting enough sleep 6-8 hours/day. Ika also said that the use of immunomodulators or vitamins and supplements are not for daily consumption.

Eighteen herbs have been studied and proven to increase immunity. Some of these herbs include Hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa Sinensis), sativum), vera tuberose) She explained the eating of these ingredients could boost the immune system. Consumption ideally carries out for a certain period of up to 8 weeks.

If health problems occur, the patient must go to a health facility,\" she explained. Furthermore, an immunomodulator is not recommended for patients with chronic diseases such as leukemia, TB, and autoimmune diseases such as SLE, Rheumatoid arthritis, Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and type 1 DM.
