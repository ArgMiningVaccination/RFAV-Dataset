SPECIALTIES Men can get as much value out of therapy as women and yet, therapy sounds like a strange concept for so many. Most of the men we work with have never been in therapy before, or they tried it once years ago, but are ready to make a change. If you want to have space to talk about anything that is weighing on you, you're in the right place. The men who see us for therapy are often surprised at how much they enjoy getting to talk about things they otherwise don't share. Our therapists understand the pressures women face. We have a deep understand of the ways that toxic shame can result in experiencing a lack of meaning, but how it can also result in more severe manifestations such as depression and anxiety. Individual therapy with us focuses on creating a safe place while giving women the resources and support they need along with the courage to be vulnerable. This is a recipe for growth and change. We offer high-quality compassionate teen therapy. Our therapists are skilled in handling teen issues. They will help your teen learn how to overcome the challenges they are having in their life, all while making counseling a positive and healing experience. We want your teen to enjoy working with us. So, we will work hard at building a strong relationship with them so they will feel comfortable sharing their struggles. Your teen and you can both feel better about this challenging time in life. In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy and fulfilling relationship can be a real challenge. Work pressures, financial stress, and the demands of everyday life can take a toll on even the strongest of partnerships. Couples therapy offers a unique opportunity for couples to navigate these challenges together and develop the skills needed to foster a deep and lasting connection. We can help with communication, intimacy & connection, trust & infidelity, pre-marital counseling, and more. Child Therapy is for children ages 5 to 13 and play therapy is one of the modalities that we employ. During these sessions, children process their thoughts and feelings and are more able to communicate their inner world through the language of play. Parents are sometimes encouraged to join. EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is a psychotherapy that enables people to heal from the symptoms and emotional distress that are the result of disturbing life experiences. Through EMDR therapy, we are able to help clients activate their natural healing processes so they feel empowered by the very experiences that once traumatized them. In a world that often feels chaotic and demanding, mental health counseling at Tribe Mind Body Wellness is a powerful resource for adults, teens, and children seeking to navigate life's challenges with confidence and emotional resilience.

By fostering emotional intelligence and learning effective communication techniques, clients can cultivate healthier connections and build stronger bonds with their loved ones. The teenage and childhood years are critical stages of development, shaping the foundation of an individual's future.
