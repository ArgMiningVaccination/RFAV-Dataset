You can use your favourite scents to create unique essential oil blends that will smell great and boost your happy hormones. Happy Hormones: What are they and how to boost them naturally? Hormones and neurotransmitters moderate our feelings of well-being, and lifestyle factors affect them. Here are four of the main happy hormones and neurotransmitters, plus ways to boost them. However, if you feel consistently unhappy, see your doctor. Dopamine: widely known as a \"feel-good\" hormone. It gives you a sense of pleasure and reward. Dopamine also plays a role in many important body functions, including movement, memory and pleasurable reward and motivation. Because dopamine is made from tyrosine, getting more of this amino acid from food could potentially boost dopamine levels in your brain. There is evidence that a diet rich in tyrosine also may improve memory and mental performance. [ [source](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/dopamine-the-pathway-to-pleasure)] In other words, to boost dopamine levels naturally, eat a diet high in protein and low in saturated fats [ [source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-increase-dopamine#8.-Meditate)]. Exercising often, listening to music that you love, getting a good night's sleep and even [meditation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25390009/) can help boost dopamine levels naturally. Serotonin: is a neurotransmitter that mediated satisfaction, happiness and optimism. Researchers indicated that an increase in serotonin levels was related to a positive mood [ [source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16962146/)] and reduce depression. When serotonin is at normal levels, you feel more focused, emotionally stable, happier and calmer. There are several ways to boost serotonin levels without medication including spending time outdoors, adjusting your diet, exercising, socialising and laughing more. Oxytocin is often referred to as the \"love hormone\" or a \"cuddle chemical\" because our bodies produce oxytocin when we're excited by our sexual partner, and when we fall in love. One of the hormone's main functions is to facilitate childbirth and support the lactation process. A natural way to increase oxytocin levels is through rigorous exercise, and singing especially in groups because it encourages the feeling of belonging and dancing. Just the simple act of touch seems to boost oxytocin release. Giving someone a massage, cuddling, making love, or giving someone a hug leads to higher levels of this hormone and a greater sense of well-being. [ [source](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/oxytocin-the-love-hormone)] Endorphins are also studied as neurotransmitters in happiness. They are released during continuous exercise, fear, love, music, chocolate eating, laughter, sex, orgasm etc. The body's natural pain reliever, which functions in the brain similarly to morphine and is released during times of stress and discomfort. Endorphins trigger a positive feeling during a rigorous workout and put a person in a good mood. Exercises such as walking, running, workouts, laughing, exercise, meditation, and listening to music and all these exercises are responsible for the release of the endorphin hormone [ [source](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320839#summary)]. Can essential oils help to boost your mood and balance your hormones? Have you ever noticed the impact a scent can have on your mood? We've experienced this so often - with a deep breath of ocean air, the earthy smell of a forest when hiking, or the familiar scent of freshly cut grass ... We can instantly feel our body calming and our mood lifting. Essential oils can help with restoring hormonal balances and good health. As part of a healthy lifestyle, which includes stress reduction, good quality sleep, regular exercise, and a nutritious diet, essential oils can really make a difference. Whilst research on the impact of essential oils is limited, some studies show some positive benefits, particularly on hormonal activity. If there aren't a lot of solid studies that prove the benefits, why are so many people touting essential oils for healing? Quite simply, it's because they work for them! One of the most important things you can do for your health is reducing stress - and pleasant scents can help that happen. 11 Essential Oils that will help you reduce stress and lift your mood. 1.
