Section A Identification Information Section A Identification Information A0050: Type of Record A0100: Facility Provider Numbers NATIONAL PROVIDER IDENTIFIER (NPI) A unique Federal number that identifies providers of health care services. The NPI applies to the nursing home for all of its residents. CMS CERTIFICATION NUMBER (CCN) Replaces the term \"Medicare/Medicaid Provider Number\" in survey, certification, and assessment-related activities. STATE PROVIDER NUMBER Medicaid Provider Number established by a state. Section A A0300: Optional State Assessment Item Rationale Allows for collection of data required for state payment reimbursement. Coding Instructions for A0300, Optional State Assessment Enter the code identifying whether this is an optional payment assessment. This assessment is not required by CMS but may be required by your state. If the assessment is being completed for state-required payment purposes, complete items A0300A and A0300B. Coding Instructions for A0300A, Is this assessment for state payment purposes only? Enter the value indicating whether your state requires this assessment for payment. 0. No 1. Yes 4 5 610/8/2019 3 Section A A0300: Optional State Assessment Coding Tips and Special Populations This assessment is optional, as it is not federally required; however, it may be required by your state. For questions regarding completion of this assessment, please contact your State agency. This must be a standalone assessment (i.e., cannot be combined with any other type of assessment). The responses to the items in this assessment are used to calculate the case mix group Health Insurance Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) code for state payment purposes. If your state does not require this record for state payment purposes, enter a value of \"0\" (No). If your state requires this record for state payment purposes, enter a value of \"1\" (Yes) and proceed to item A0300B, Assessment Type.

None of the above7 8 910/8/2019 4 Section A A0310A Federal OBRA Reason for Assessment Coding Tips and Special Populations If a nursing home resident elects the hospice benefit, the nursing home is required to complete an MDS Significant Change in Status Assessment (SCSA). The nursing home is required to complete an SCSA when the resident comes off the hospice benefit (revoke). See Chapter 2 for details on this requirement. It is a CMS requirement to have an SCSA completed EVERY time the hospice benefit has been elected, even if a recent MDS was done and the only change is the election of the hospice benefit.

IPA-Interim Payment AssessmentPPS Unscheduled Assessment for Medicare Part A Stay 99. None of the above Not PPS Assessment A0310G1, Is this a SNF Part A Interrupted Stay? If the resident was discharged from SNF care (i.e., from a Medicare Part A-covered stay) but did not resume SNF care in the same SNF within the interruption window.Code 0, no: If the resident was discharged from SNF care (i.e., from a Medicare Part A-covered stay) but did resume SNF care in the same SNF within the interruption window.Code 1, yes: The interrupted stay policy applies to residents who either leave the SNF, then return to the same SNF within the interruption window, or to residents who are discharged from Part A-covered services and remain in the SNF, but then resume a Part A-covered stay within the interruption window.Coding Tips10 11 1210/8/2019 5 Section A Interrupted Stay Interrupted Stay Interrupted Stay Is a Medicare Part A SNF stay in which a resident is discharged from SNF care (i.e., the resident is discharged from a Medicare Part A- covered stay) and subsequently resumes SNF care in the same SNF for a Medicare Part A- covered stay during the interruption window. Section A Interruption Window Is a 3-day period, starting with the calendar day of Part A discharge and including the 2 immediately following calendar days. If a resident in a Medicare Part A SNF stay is discharged from Part A, the resident must resume Part A services, or return to the same SNF (if physically discharged) to resume Part A services, by 11:59 p.m. at the end of the third calendar day after their Part A-covered stay ended. The interruption window begins with the first non-covered day following a Part A-covered stay and ends at 11:59 p.m. on the third consecutive non-covered day following a Part A-covered SNF stay. If these conditions are met, the subsequent stay is considered a continuation of the previous Medicare Part A-covered stay for the purposes of both the variable per diem schedule and PPS assessment completion. Section A Interrupted Stay Examples of an interrupted stay when the resident leaves the SNF and then returns to the same SNF to resume Part A-covered services Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: Resident transfers to an acute care setting for evaluation or treatment due to a change in condition and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window. Resident transfers to a psychiatric facility for evaluation or treatment and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window. Resident transfers to an outpatient facility for a procedure or treatment and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window. Resident transfers to an assisted living facility or a private residence with home health services and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window. Resident leaves against medical advice and returns to the same SNF within the interruption window.13 14 1510/8/2019 6 Section A Interrupted Stay Examples of an interrupted stay when the resident under a Part A-covered stay remains in the facility but the stay stops being covered under the Part A PPS benefit, and then resumes Part A-covered services in the SNF within the interruption window. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: Resident elects the hospice benefit, thereby declining the SNF benefit, and then revokes the hospice benefit and resumes SNF-level care within the interruption window. Resident refuses to participate in rehabilitation and has no other daily skilled need; this ends the Part A coverage. Within the interruption window, the resident decides to engage in the planned rehabilitation regime and Part A coverage resumes. Resident changes payer sources from Medicare Part A to an alternate payer source (i.e., hospice, private pay or private insurance) and then wishes to resume their Medicare Part A stay, at the same SNF, within the interruption window. Section A Interrupted Stay If a resident is discharged from SNF care, remains in the SNF, and resumes a Part A-covered stay in the SNF within the interruption window, this is an interrupted stay. No discharge assessment (OBRA or Part A PPS) is required, nor is an Entry Tracking Record or 5-Day required on resumption. If a resident leaves the SNF and returns to resume Part A-covered services in the same SNF within the interruption window, this is an interrupted stay. Although this situation does not end the resident's Part A PPS stay, the resident left the SNF, and therefore an OBRA Discharge assessment is required. On return to the SNF, no 5-Day would be required. An OBRA Admission would be required if the resident was discharged return not anticipated. If the resident was discharged return anticipated, no new OBRA Admission would be required. Section A Interrupted Stay When an interrupted stay occurs, a 5-Day PPS assessment is not required upon reentry or resumption of SNF care in the same SNF, because an interrupted stay does not end the resident's Part A PPS stay. If a resident is discharged from SNF care, remains in the SNF and does not resume Part A-covered services within the interruption window, an interrupted stay did not occur. In this situation, a Part A PPS Discharge is required. If the resident qualifies and there is a resumption of Part A services within the 30-day window allowed by Medicare, a 5-Day would be required as this would be considered a new Part A stay. The OBRA schedule would continue from the resident's original date of admission (item A1900).16 17 1810/8/2019 7 Section A Interrupted Stay When an interrupted stay occurs, a 5-Day PPS assessment is not required upon reentry or resumption of SNF care in the same SNF, because an interrupted stay does not end the resident's Part A PPS stay. If a resident leaves the SNF and does not return to resume Part A-covered services in the same SNF within the interruption window, an interrupted stay did not occur. In this situation, both the Part A PPS and OBRA Discharge assessments are required (and may be combined). If the resident returns to the same SNF, this would be considered a new Part A stay. An Entry Tracking record and 5-Day would be required on return. An OBRA Admission would be required if the resident was discharged return not anticipated. If the resident was discharged return anticipated, no new OBRA Admission would be required. The OBRA assessment schedule is unaffected by the interrupted stay policy. Please refer to Chapter 2 for guidance on OBRA assessment scheduling requirements. Section A Interrupted Stay A2400: Medicare Stay When a resident on Medicare Part A has an interrupted stay (i.e., is discharged from SNF care and subsequently readmitted to the same SNF within the interruption window after the discharge), this is a continuation of the Medicare Part A stay, not a new Medicare Part A stay. Section A Interrupted Stay Example Mr. N began receiving services under Medicare Part A on December 11, 2019. He was unexpectedly sent to the emergency department on December 19, 2019 at 8:30 p.m. and was not admitted to the hospital. He returned to the facility on December 20, 2019, at 11:00 a.m. Upon Mr. N's return, his physician's orders included significant changes in his treatment regime. The facility staff determined that an Interim Payment Assessment (IPA) was indicated as the PDPM nursing component was impacted. They completed the IPA with an ARD of December 24, 2019. Code the following on the IPA: A2400A = 1 A2400B = 12-11-2019 A2400C = ---------- Rationale: Mr. N was out of the facility at midnight but returned in less than 24 hours and was not admitted to the hospital, so was considered LOA. Therefore, no Discharge assessment was required. His Medicare Part A Stay is considered ongoing; therefore, the date in A2400C is dashed.19 20 2110/8/2019 8 Section B, Hearing, Speech, and VisionDocument the resident's ability to hear, understand, and communicate with others and whether the resident experiences visual, hearing or speech limitations and/or difficulties. B0100: Comatose PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE Sometimes residents who were comatose after an anoxic-ischemic injury (i.e., not enough oxygen to the brain) from a cardiac arrest, head trauma, or massive stroke, regain wakefulness but do not evidence any purposeful behavior or cognition. Their eyes are open, and they may grunt, yawn, pick with their fingers, and have random body movements. Neurological exam shows extensive damage to both cerebral hemispheres. B0700: Makes Self Understood Able to express or communicate requests, needs, opinions, and to conduct social conversation in his or her primary language, whether in speech, writing, sign language, gestures, or a combination of these. Deficits in the ability to make one's self understood (expressive communication deficits) can include reduced voice volume and difficulty in producing sounds, or difficulty in finding the right word, making sentences, writing, and/or gesturing.22 23 2410/8/2019 9 B0700: Makes Self Understood Coding Tips and Special Populations This item cannot be coded as Rarely/Never Understood if the resident completed any of the resident interviews, as the interviews are conducted during the look-back period for this item and should be factored in when determining the residents' ability to make self understood during the entire 7-day look-back period. While B0700 and the resident interview items are not directly dependent upon one another, inconsistencies in coding among these items should be evaluated. Section C, Cognitive PatternsDetermine the resident's attention, orientation, and ability to register and recall information. Section C, Cognitive Patterns Coding Tips Attempt to conduct the interview with ALL residents. This interview is conducted during the look-back period of the Assessment Reference Date (ARD) and is not contingent upon item B0700, Makes Self Understood. If the resident needs an interpreter, every effort should be made to have an interpreter present for the BIMS. If it is not possible for a needed interpreter to participate on the day of the interview, code C0100 = 0 to indicate interview not attempted and complete C0700-C1000, Staff Assessment of Mental Status, instead of C0200-C0500, Brief Interview for Mental Status. Includes residents who use American Sign Language (ASL). If the resident interview was not conducted within the look-back period (preferably the day before or the day of) the ARD, item C0100 must be coded 1, Yes, and the standard \"no information\" code (a dash \"-\") entered in the resident interview items.25 26 2710/8/2019 10 Section C, Cognitive Patterns Coding Tips cont. Do not complete the Staff Assessment for Mental Status items (C0700-C1000) if the resident interview should have been conducted but was not done. Because a PDPM cognitive level is utilized in the speech language pathology (SLP) payment component of PDPM, only in the case of PPS assessments, staff may complete the Staff Assessment for Mental Status for an interviewable resident when the resident is unexpectedly discharged from a Part A stay prior to the completion of the BIMS. In this case, the assessor should enter 0, No in C0100: Should Brief Interview for Mental Status Be Conducted? and proceed to the Staff Assessment for Mental Status. C1000: Cognitive Skills for Daily Decision Making DAILY DECISION MAKING Includes: choosing clothing; knowing when to go to meals; using environmental cues to organize and plan (e.g., clocks, calendars, posted event notices); In the absence of environmental cues, seeking information appropriately (i.e. not repetitively) from others in order to plan the day; Using awareness of one's own strengths and limitations to regulate the day's events (e.g., asks for help when necessary); Acknowledging need to use appropriate assistive equipment such as a walker. C1310: Signs and Symptoms of Delirium DELIRIUM A mental disturbance characterized by new or acutely worsening confusion, disordered expression of thoughts, change in level of consciousness or hallucinations. Steps for Assessment 1. Observe resident behavior during the BIMS items (C0200-C0400) for the signs and symptoms of delirium. Some experts suggest that increasing the frequency of assessment (as often as daily for new admissions) will improve the level of detection.28 29 3010/8/2019 11 C1310: Signs and Symptoms of Delirium INATTENTION Reduced ability to maintain attention to external stimuli and to appropriately shift attention to new external stimuli. Resident seems unaware or out of touch with environment (e.g., dazed, fixated or darting attention). FLUCTUATION The behavior tends to come and go and/or increase or decrease in severity. The behavior may fluctuate over the course of the interview or during the 7- day look- back period. Fluctuating behavior may be noted by the interviewer, reported by staff or family or documented in the medical record. C1310: Signs and Symptoms of Delirium DISORGANIZED THINKING Evidenced by rambling, irrelevant, or incoherent speech. ALTERED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS VIGILANT - startles easily to any sound or touch; LETHARGIC - repeatedly dozes off when you are asking questions, but responds to voice or touch; STUPOR - very difficult to arouse and keep aroused for the interview; COMATOSE - cannot be aroused despite shaking and shouting. Section D, MoodIdentify signs and symptoms of mood distress. 31 32 3310/8/2019 12 Section D, Mood 9-ITEM PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-9\u00a9) PHQ-9 - A validated interview that screens for symptoms of depression. It provides a standardized severity score and a rating for evidence of a depressive disorder. Health-related Quality of Life Depression can be associated with: \u2014 psychological and physical distress, \u2014 decreased participation in therapy and activities, \u2014 decreased functional status, and \u2014 poorer outcomes. Section D, Mood Coding Tips and Special Populations For question D0200I, Thoughts That You Would Be Better Off Dead or of Hurting Yourself in Some Way: Beginning interviewers may feel uncomfortable asking this item because they may fear upsetting the resident or may feel that the question is too personal. Others may worry that it will give the resident inappropriate ideas. However, Experienced interviewers have found that most residents who are having this feeling appreciate the opportunity to express it. Asking about thoughts of self-harm does not give the person the idea. It does let the provider better understand what the resident is already feeling. The best interviewing approach is to ask the question openly and without hesitation. Section D, Mood Coding Tips and Special Populations cont. Responses to PHQ-9\u00a9 can indicate possible depression. Responses can be interpreted as follows: Major Depressive Syndrome is suggested if\u2014of the 9 items\u2014 5 or more items are identified at a frequency of half or more of the days (7-11 days) during the look-back period and at least one of these, (1) little interest or pleasure in doing things, or (2) feeling down, depressed, or hopeless is identified at a frequency of half or more of the days (7-11 days) during the look-back period.34 35 3610/8/2019 13 Section D, Mood Coding Tips and Special Populations cont. Minor Depressive Syndrome is suggested if, of the 9 items, (1) feeling down, depressed or hopeless, (2) trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much, or (3) feeling tired or having little energy are identified at a frequency of half or more of the days (7-11 days) during the look-back period and At least one of these, (1) little interest or pleasure in doing things, or (2) feeling down, depressed, or hopeless is identified at a frequency of half or more of the days (7-11 days). Section D, Mood Coding Tips and Special Populations cont. In addition, PHQ-9\u00a9 Total Severity Score can be used to track changes in severity over time. Total Severity Score can be interpreted as follows: 1-4: minimal depression 5-9: mild depression 10-14: moderate depression 15-19: moderately severe depression 20-27: severe depression Section E, BehaviorIdentify behavioral symptoms that may cause distress or are potentially harmful to the resident, or may be distressing or disruptive to facility residents, staff members or the environment. 37 38 3910/8/2019 14 Section E, Behavior HALLUCINATION The perception of the presence of something that is not actually there. It may be auditory or visual or involve smells, tastes or touch. DELUSION A fixed, false belief not shared by others that the resident holds even in the face of evidence to the contrary. Section E, Behavior Health-related Quality of Life Psychotic symptoms may be associated with \u2014 delirium, \u2014 dementia, \u2014 adverse drug effects, \u2014 psychiatric disorders, and \u2014 hearing or vision impairment. Section E, Behavior Health-related Quality of Life cont. Hallucinations and delusions may \u2014 be distressing to residents and families, \u2014 cause disability, \u2014 interfere with delivery of medical, nursing, rehabilitative and personal care, and \u2014 lead to dangerous behavior or possible harm.40 41 4210/8/2019 15 Section E, Behavior Planning for Care Reversible and treatable causes should be identified and addressed promptly. When the cause is not reversible, the focus of management strategies should be to minimize the amount of disability and distress. E0200: Behavioral Symptom\u2014Presence & Frequency E0200: Behavioral Symptom\u2014Presence & Frequency Examples Every morning, a nursing assistant tries to help a resident who is unable to dress himself. On the last 4 out of 6 mornings, the resident has hit or scratched the nursing assistant during attempts to dress him. Coding: E0200A would be coded 2, behavior of this type occurred 4-6 days, but less than daily. Rationale: Scratching the nursing assistant was a physical behavior directed toward others.43 44 4510/8/2019 16 E0500: Impact on Resident E0500: Impact on Resident Examples A resident frequently grabs and scratches staff when they attempt to change her soiled brief, digging her nails into their skin. This makes it difficult to complete the care task. Coding: E0500B would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: This behavior interfered with delivery of essential personal care. E0600: Impact on Others 46 47 4810/8/2019 17 E0600: Impact on Others Example A resident, when sitting in the hallway outside the community activity room, continually yells, repeating the same phrase. The yelling can be heard by other residents in hallways and activity/recreational areas but not in their private rooms. Coding: E0600A would be coded 0, no; E0600B and E0600C would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: The behavior does not put others at risk for significant injury. The behavior does create a climate of excessive noise, disrupting the living environment and the activity of others. E0800: Rejection of Care\u2014Presence & Frequency REJECTION OF CARE Behavior that interrupts or interferes with the delivery or receipt of care. Care rejection may be manifested by verbally declining or statements of refusal or through physical behaviors that convey aversion to or result in avoidance of or interfere with the receipt of care. INTERFERENCE WITH CARE Hindering the delivery or receipt of care by disrupting the usual routines or processes by which care is given, or by exceeding the level or intensity of resources that are usually available for the provision of care. Section F, Preferences for Customary Routine and ActivitiesObtain information regarding the resident's preferences for his or her daily routine and activities. 49 50 5110/8/2019 18 F0400: Interview for Daily Preferences F0500: Interview for Activity Preferences Section G, Functional StatusAssess the need for assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs), altered gait and balance, and decreased range of motion. 52 53 5410/8/2019 19 Section G, Functional Status ADL - Tasks related to personal care; any of the tasks listed in items G0110A-J and G0120. ADL ASPECTS Components of an ADL activity. These are listed next to the activity in the item set. For example, the components of G0110H (Eating) are eating, drinking, and intake of nourishment or hydration by other means, including tube feeding, total parenteral nutrition and IV fluids for hydration. ADL SELF- PERFORMANCE Measures what the resident actually did (not what he or she might be capable of doing) within each ADL category over the last 7 days according to a performance- based scale. ADL SUPPORT PROVIDED Measures the most support provided by staff over the last 7 days, even if that level of support only occurred once. Coding Instructions for G0110, Column 1, ADL Self-Performance Code 0, independent: If resident completed activity with no help or oversight every time during the 7- day look-back period and the activity occurred at least three times. Code 1, supervision: If oversight, encouragement, or cueing was provided three or more times during the last 7 days. Code 2, limited assistance: If resident was highly involved in activity and received physical help in guided maneuvering of limb(s) or other non-weight-bearing assistance on three or more times during the last 7 days. Coding Instructions for G0110, Column 1, ADL Self-Performance Code 3, extensive assistance: If resident performed part of the activity over the last 7 days and help of the following type(s) was provided three or more times: \u2014 Weight-bearing support provided three or more times, OR \u2014 Full staff performance of activity three or more times during part but not all of the last 7 days. 55 56 5710/8/2019 20 Coding Instructions for G0110, Column 1, ADL Self-Performance Code 4, total dependence: If there was full staff performance of an activity with no participation by resident for any aspect of the ADL activity and the activity occurred three or more times. The resident must be unwilling or unable to perform any part of the activity over the entire 7-day look-back period. Code 7, activity occurred only once or twice: If the activity occurred fewer than three times. Code 8, activity did not occur: If the activity did not occur or family and/or non-facility staff provided care 100% of the time for that activity over the entire 7-day look-back period. Coding Instructions for G0110, Column 1, ADL Self-Performance The Rule of 3 The following ADL Self-Performance coding levels are exceptions to the Rule of 3: Code 0, Independent - Coded only if the resident completed the ADL activity with no help or oversight every time the ADL activity occurred during the 7- day look-back period and the activity occurred at least three times. Code 4, Total dependence - Coded only if the resident required full staff performance of the ADL activity every time the ADL activity occurred during the 7-day look-back period and the activity occurred three or more times. Code 7, Activity occurred only once or twice - Coded if the ADL activity occurred fewer than three times in the 7-day look back period. Code 8, Activity did not occur - Coded only if the ADL activity did not occur or family and/or non-facility staff provided care 100% of the time for that activity over the entire 7-day look-back period. Instructions for the Rule of 3 When an ADL activity has occurred three or more times, apply the steps of the Rule of 3 below (keeping the ADL coding level definitions and the above exceptions in mind) to determine the code to enter in Column 1, ADL Self- Performance. These steps must be used in sequence. Use the first instruction encountered that meets the coding scenario (e.g., if #1 applies, stop and code that level). 1. When an activity occurs three or more times at any one level, code that level. 2. When an activity occurs three or more times at multiple levels, code the most dependent level that occurred three or more times. 58 59 6010/8/2019 21 Instructions for the Rule of 3 cont. 3. When an activity occurs three or more times and at multiple levels, but not three times at any one level, apply the following: a. Convert episodes of full staff performance to weight-bearing assistance when applying the third Rule of 3, as long as the full staff performance episodes did not occur every time the ADL was performed in the 7-day look-back period. It is only when every episode is full staff performance that Total dependence (4) can be coded. Remember, that weight-bearing episodes that occur three or more times or full staff performance that is provided three or more times during part but not all of the last 7 days are included in the ADL Self- Performance coding level definition for Extensive assistance (3). Instructions for the Rule of 3 cont. 3. When an activity occurs three or more times and at multiple levels, but not three times at any one level, apply the following cont.: b. When there is a combination of full staff performance and weight- bearing assistance that total three or more times\u2014code extensive assistance (3). c. When there is a combination of full staff performance/weight- bearing assistance, and/or non-weight-bearing assistance that total three or more times\u2014code limited assistance (2). If none of the above are met, code supervision. Coding Instructions for G0110, Column 2, ADL Support Code for the most support provided over all shifts. Code 0, no setup or physical help from staff: if resident completed activity with no help or oversight. Code 1, setup help only: if resident is provided with materials or devices necessary to perform the ADL independently. This can include giving or holding out an item that the resident takes from the caregiver. Code 2, one person physical assist: if the resident was assisted by one staff person. Code 3, two+ person physical assist: if the resident was assisted by two or more staff persons. Code 8, ADL activity itself did not occur during the entire period: if the activity did not occur or family and/or non-facility staff provided care 100% of the time for that activity over the entire 7-day period. 61 62 6310/8/2019 22 Section G, Functional Status Coding Tips and Special Populations Do NOT include the emptying of bedpan, urinal, bedside commode, catheter bag or ostomy bag in G0110 I. Do NOT record the staff's assessment of the resident's potential capability to perform the ADL activity. The assessment of potential capability is covered in ADL Functional Rehabilitation Potential Item (G0900). Do NOT record the type and level of assistance that the resident \"should\" be receiving according to the written plan of care. The level of assistance actually provided might be very different from what is indicated in the plan. Record what actually happened. Do NOT include assistance provided by family or other visitors Section G, Functional Status Coding Tips and Special Populations Some residents sleep on furniture other than a bed (for example, a recliner). Consider assistance received in this alternative bed when coding bed mobility. Differentiating between guided maneuvering and weight-bearing assistance: determine who is supporting the weight of the resident's extremity or body. For example, if the staff member supports some of the weight of the resident's hand while helping the resident to eat (e.g., lifting a spoon or a cup to mouth), or performs part of the activity for the resident, this is \"weight-bearing\" assistance for this activity. If the resident can lift the utensil or cup, but staff assistance is needed to guide the resident's hand to his or her mouth, this is guided maneuvering. Section G, Functional Status Coding Tips and Special Populations Some residents are transferred between surfaces, including to and from the bed, chair, and wheelchair, by staff, using a full-body mechanical lift. Whether or not the resident holds onto a bar, strap, or other device during the full-body mechanical lift transfer is not part of the transfer activity and should not be considered as resident participation in a transfer. Transfers via lifts that require the resident to bear weight during the transfer, such as a stand-up lift, should be coded as Extensive Assistance, as the resident participated in the transfer and the lift provided weight-bearing support. How a resident turns from side to side, in the bed, during incontinence care, is a component of Bed Mobility and should not be considered as part of Toileting. When a resident is transferred into or out of bed or a chair for incontinence care or to use the bedpan or urinal, the transfer is coded in G0110B, Transfers. How the resident uses the bedpan or urinal is coded in G0110I, Toilet use.64 65 6610/8/2019 23 Section G, Functional Status Example Mr. Q. is a wheelchair-bound and is able to self-propel on the unit. On two occasions during the 7-day look-back period, he self-propelled off the unit into the courtyard. Coding: G0110F1 would be coded 7, activity occurred only once or twice. G0110F2 would be coded 0, no setup or physical help from staff. Rationale: The activity of going off the unit happened only twice during the look-back period with no help or oversight from staff. Section G, Functional Status Example Staff must assist Mr. P. to zip his pants, hand him a washcloth, and remind him to wash his hands after using the toilet daily. This occurred multiple times each day during the 7-day look-back period. Coding: G0110I1 would be coded 2, limited assistance. G0110I2 would be coded 2, one person physical assist. Rationale: Resident required staff to perform non-weight-bearing activities to complete the task multiple times each day during the 7-day look-back period. Examples for G0110J, Personal Hygiene Mrs. J. normally completes all hygiene tasks independently. Three mornings during the 7-day look-back period, however, she was unable to brush and style her hair because of elbow pain, so a staff member did it for her. Coding: G0110J1 would be coded 3, extensive assistance. G0110J2 would be coded 2, one person physical assist. Rationale: A staff member had to complete part of the activity of personal hygiene for the resident 3 out of 7 days during the look-back period. The assistance, although non-weight-bearing, is considered full staff performance of the personal hygiene sub-task of brushing and styling her hair. Because this ADL sub-task was completed for the resident 3 times, but not every time during the last 7 days, it qualifies under the second criterion of the extensive assistance definition.67 68 6910/8/2019 24 G0120: Bathing G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking Planning for Care Individuals with impaired balance and unsteadiness should be evaluated for the need for \u2014 rehabilitation or assistive devices; \u2014 supervision or physical assistance for safety; and/or \u2014 environmental modification. Care planning should focus on preventing further decline of function, and/or on return of function, depending on resident-specific goals. Assessment should identify all related risk factors in order to develop effective care plans to maintain current abilities, slow decline, and/or promote improvement in the resident's functional ability.70 71 7210/8/2019 25 G0300: Balance During Transitions and Walking UNSTEADY Residents may appear unbalanced or move with a sway or with uncoordinated or jerking movements that make them unsteady. They might exhibit unsteady gaits such as fast gaits with large, careless gaits with small shuffling steps; or wide-based gaits with halting, tentative steps. Coding for G0300D, Moving on and off Toilet Code for the least steady episode of moving on and off a toilet or portable commode, using an assistive device if applicable. Include stability while manipulating clothing to allow toileting to occur in this rating. G0400: Functional Limitation in Range of Motion FUNCTIONAL LIMITATION IN RANGE OF MOTION Limited ability to move a joint that interferes with daily functioning (particularly with activities of daily living) or places the resident at risk of injury.73 74 7510/8/2019 26 G0400: Functional Limitation in Range of Motion Coding Tips Do not look at limited ROM in isolation. You must determine if the limited ROM impacts functional ability or places the resident at risk for injury. For example, if the resident has an amputation it does not automatically mean that they are limited in function. He/she may not have a particular joint in which certain range of motion can be tested, however, it does not mean that the resident with an amputation has a limitation in completing activities of daily living, nor does it mean that the resident is automatically at risk of injury. There are many amputees who function extremely well and can complete all activities of daily living either with or without the use of prosthetics. If the resident with an amputation does indeed have difficulty completing ADLs and is at risk for injury, the facility should code this item as appropriate. This item is coded in terms of function and risk of injury, not by diagnosis or lack of a limb or digit. G0400: Functional Limitation in Range of Motion, Example The resident has a diagnosis of Parkinson's and ambulates with a shuffling gate. The resident has had 3 falls in the past quarter and often forgets his walker which he needs to ambulate. He has tremors of both upper extremities that make it very difficult to feed himself, brush his teeth or write. Coding: G0400A would be coded 2, upper extremity impairment on both sides. G0400B would be coded 2, lower extremity impairment on both sides. Rationale: Impairment due to Parkinson's disease affects the resident at the upper and lower extremities on both sides. Section GG, Functional Abilities and Goals Assess the need for assistance with self-care and mobility activities. 76 77 7810/8/2019 27 GG0100. Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities GG0130: Self-Care (3-day assessment period) Admission (Start of Medicare Part A Stay) GG0130: Self-Care & GG0170: Mobility, 3-day assessment period For the 5-Day PPS assessment, code the resident's functional status based on a clinical assessment of the resident's performance that occurs soon after the resident's admission. This functional assessment must be completed within the first three days (3 calendar days) of the Medicare Part A stay, starting with the date in A2400B, Start of Most Recent Medicare Stay, and the following two days, ending at 11:59 PM on day 3. The admission function scores are to reflect the resident's admission baseline status and are to be based on an assessment. The scores should reflect the resident's status prior to any benefit from interventions. The assessment should occur, when possible, prior to the resident benefitting from treatment interventions in order to determine the resident's true admission baseline status. Even if treatment started on the day of admission, a baseline functional status assessment can still be conducted. Treatment should not be withheld in order to conduct the functional assessment.79 80 8110/8/2019 28 GG0130: Self-Care (3-day assessment period) Interim Performance (Interim Payment Assessment - Optional) GG0130: Self-Care & GG0170: Mobility, 3-day assessment period Interim Performance (Optional): The Interim Payment Assessment (IPA) is an optional assessment that may be completed by providers in order to report a change in the resident's PDPM classification. For Section GG on the IPA, providers will use the same 6-point scale and activity not attempted codes to complete the column \"Interim Performance,\" which will capture the interim functional performance of the resident. The ARD for the IPA is determined by the provider, and the assessment period is the last 3 days (i.e., the ARD and the 2 calendar days prior). It is important to note that the IPA changes payment beginning on the ARD and continues until the end of the Medicare Part A stay or until another IPA is completed. The IPA does not affect the variable per diem schedule. GG0130: Self-Care (3-day assessment period) Discharge (End of Medicare Part A Stay) 82 83 8410/8/2019 29 GG0130: Self-Care & GG0170: Mobility, 3-day assessment period Discharge: The Part A PPS Discharge assessment is required to be completed when the resident's Medicare Part A Stay ends (as documented in A2400C, End of Most Recent Medicare Stay), Either as a standalone assessment when the resident's Medicare Part A stay ends, but the resident remains in the facility; or May be combined with an OBRA Discharge if the Medicare Part A stay ends on the day of, or one day before the resident's Discharge Date (A2000). Section GG USUAL PERFORMANCE A resident's functional status can be impacted by the environment or situations encountered at the facility. Observing the resident's interactions with others in different locations and circumstances is important for a comprehensive understanding of the resident's functional status. If the resident's functional status varies, record the resident's usual ability to perform each activity. Do not record the resident's best performance and do not record the resident's worst performance, but rather record the resident's usual performance. QUALIFIED CLINICIAN Healthcare professionals practicing within their scope of practice and consistent with Federal, State, and local law and regulations. GG0130: Self-Care & GG0170: Mobility, 3-day assessment period Admission, Interim, or Discharge Performance Coding Instructions When coding the resident's usual performance and discharge goal(s), use the six-point scale, or use one of the four \"activity was not attempted\" codes to specify the reason why an activity was not attempted. Code 06, Independent: if the resident completes the activity by him/herself with no assistance from a helper. Code 05, Setup or clean-up assistance: if the helper sets up or cleans up; resident completes activity. Helper assists only prior to or following the activity, but not during the activity. For example, the resident requires assistance cutting up food or opening container or requires setup of hygiene item(s) or assistive device(s).85 86 8710/8/2019 30 GG0130: Self-Care & GG0170: Mobility, 3-day assessment period Admission, Interim, or Discharge Performance Coding Instructions cont. Code 04, Supervision or touching assistance: If the helper provides verbal cues or touching/steadying/contact guard assistance as resident completes activity. Assistance may be provided throughout the activity or intermittently. For example, the resident requires verbal cueing, coaxing, or general supervision for safety to complete activity; or resident may require only incidental help such as contact guard or steadying assist during the activity. GG0130: Self-Care & GG0170: Mobility, 3-day assessment period Admission, Interim, or Discharge Performance Coding Instructions cont. Code 03, Partial/moderate assistance: if the helper does LESS THAN HALF the effort. Helper lifts, holds, or supports trunk or limbs, but provides less than half the effort. Code 02, Substantial/maximal assistance: if the helper does MORE THAN HALF the effort. Helper lifts or holds trunk or limbs and provides more than half the effort. Code 01, Dependent: if the helper does ALL of the effort. Resident does none of the effort to complete the activity; or the assistance of two or more helpers is required for the resident to complete the activity. GG0130: Self-Care & GG0170: Mobility, 3-day assessment period Admission, Interim, or Discharge Performance Coding Instructions cont. Code 07, Resident refused: if the resident refused to complete the activity. Code 09, Not applicable: if the activity was not attempted and the resident did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Code 10, Not attempted due to environmental limitations: if the resident did not attempt this activity due to environmental limitations. Examples include lack of equipment and weather constraints. Code 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns: if the activity was not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns.88 89 9010/8/2019 31 Section GG Coding Tips: Admission, Interim, or Discharge Performance If the resident does not attempt the activity and a helper does not complete the activity for the resident during the entire assessment period, code the reason the activity was not attempted. For example, code as 07 if the resident refused to attempt the activity; Code as 09 if the activity is not applicable for the resident (the activity did not occur at the time of the assessment and prior to the current illness, injury, or exacerbation); Code as 10 if the resident was not able to attempt the activity due to environmental limitations; or Code as 88 if the resident was not able to attempt the activity due to medical condition or safety concerns. Section GG Coding Tips: Admission, Interim, or Discharge Performance If two or more helpers are required to assist the resident to complete the activity, code as 01, Dependent. A dash (\"-\") indicates \"No information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Documentation in the medical record is used to support assessment coding of Section GG. Data entered should be consistent with the clinical assessment documentation in the resident's medical record. This assessment can be conducted by appropriate healthcare personnel as defined by facility policy and in accordance with State and Federal regulations.91 92 9310/8/2019 32 Section GG: Tips for Coding the Resident's Usual Performance When coding the resident's usual performance, \"effort\" refers to the type and amount of assistance a helper provides in order for the activity to be completed. The six-point rating scale definitions include the following types of assistance: Setup/cleanup Touching assistance Verbal cueing Lifting assistance Section GG: Tips for Coding the Resident's Usual Performance Do not record the resident's best performance, and do not record the resident's worst performance, but rather record the resident's usual performance during the assessment period. Code based on the resident's performance. Do not record the staff's assessment of the resident's potential capability to perform the activity. Section GG: Tips for Coding the Resident's Usual Performance If the resident performs the activity more than once during the assessment period and the resident's performance varies, coding in Section GG should be based on the resident's \"usual performance,\" which is identified as the resident's usual activity/performance for any of the Self-Care or Mobility activities, not the most independent or dependent performance over the assessment period. Therefore, if the resident's Self-Care performance varies during the assessment period, report the resident's usual performance, not the resident's most independent performance and not the resident's most dependent performance. A provider may need to use the entire three-day assessment period to obtain the resident's usual performance.94 95 9610/8/2019 33 Coding Tips for GG0130A, Eating GG0130A, Eating involves bringing food and liquids to the mouth and swallowing food. The administration of tube feedings and parenteral nutrition is not considered when coding this activity. If the resident does not eat or drink by mouth and relies solely on nutrition and liquids through tube feedings or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) because of a new (recent-onset) medical condition, Code GG0130A as 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. Assistance with tube feedings or TPN is not considered when coding Eating. Coding Tips for GG0130A, Eating If the resident does not eat or drink by mouth at the time of the assessment, and the resident did not eat or drink by mouth prior to the current illness, injury, or exacerbation, Code GG0130A as 09, Not applicable - Not attempted and the resident did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. If the resident eats and drinks by mouth, and relies partially on obtaining nutrition and liquids via tube feedings or parenteral nutrition, Code Eating based on the amount of assistance the resident requires to eat and drink by mouth. Coding Tips for GG0130C, Toileting Hygiene Toileting hygiene includes managing undergarments, clothing, and incontinence products and performing perineal cleansing before and after voiding or having a bowel movement. If the resident does not usually use undergarments, then assess the resident's need for assistance to manage lower body clothing and perineal hygiene. Toileting hygiene takes place before and after use of the toilet, commode, bedpan, or urinal. If the resident completes a bowel toileting program in bed, code Toileting hygiene based on the resident's need for assistance in managing clothing and perineal cleansing. If the resident has an indwelling urinary catheter and has bowel movements, code the Toilet hygiene item based on the amount of assistance needed by the resident before and after moving his or her bowels.97 98 9910/8/2019 34 Examples for GG0130C, Toileting hygiene Toileting hygiene: Mrs. P has urinary urgency. As soon as she gets in the bathroom, she asks the certified nursing assistant to lift her gown and pull down her underwear due to her balance problems. After voiding, Mrs. P wipes herself, pulls her underwear back up, and adjusts her gown. Coding: GG0130C would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The helper provides more than touching assistance. The resident performs more than half the effort; the helper does less than half the effort. The resident completes two of the three toileting hygiene tasks. GG0130H Putting on/taking off footwear Mrs. F was admitted to the SNF for a neurologic condition and experiences visual impairment and fine motor coordination and endurance issues. She requires setup for retrieving her socks and shoes, which she prefers to keep in the closet. Mrs. F often drops her shoes and socks as she attempts to put them onto her feet or as she takes them off. Often a certified nursing assistant must first thread her socks or shoes over her toes, and then Mrs. F can complete the task. Mrs. F needs the certified nursing assistant to initiate taking off her socks and unstrapping the Velcro used for fastening her shoes. Coding: GG0130H would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: A helper provides Mrs. F with assistance in initiating putting on and taking off her footwear because of her limitations regarding fine motor coordination when putting on/taking off footwear. The helper completes more than half of the effort with this activity. Discharge Goals: Coding Tips Discharge goals are coded with each Admission (Start of SNF PPS Stay) assessment. For the SNF Quality Reporting Program (QRP), a minimum of one self-care or mobility discharge goal must be coded. However, facilities may choose to complete more than one self-care or mobility discharge goal. Code the resident's discharge goal(s) using the six-point scale. Use of the \"activity was not attempted\" codes (07, 09, 10, and 88) is permissible to code discharge goal(s). Use of a dash is permissible for any remaining self-care or mobility goals that were not coded. Of note, at least one Discharge Goal must be indicated for either Self-Care or Mobility. Using the dash in this allowed instance after the coding of at least one goal does not affect Annual Payment Update (APU) determination.100 101 10210/8/2019 35 Discharge Goals: Coding Tips Licensed, qualified clinicians can establish a resident's Discharge Goal(s) at the time of admission based on the resident's prior medical condition, admission assessment self-care and mobility status, discussions with the resident and family, professional judgment, the professional's standard of practice, expected treatments, the resident's motivation to improve, anticipated length of stay, and the resident's discharge plan. Goals should be established as part of the resident's care plan. If the admission performance of an activity was coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concern during the admission assessment, a Discharge Goal may be entered using the 6-point scale if the resident is expected to be able to perform the activity by discharge. Discharge Goal: Coding Examples 1. Discharge Goal Code Is Higher than 5-Day PPS Assessment Admission Performance Code If the qualified clinician determines that the resident is expected to make gains in function by discharge, the code reported for Discharge Goal will be higher than the admission performance code. 2. Discharge Goal Code Is the Same as 5-Day PPS Assessment Admission Performance Code The qualified clinician determines that a medically complex resident is not expected to progress to a higher level of functioning during the SNF Medicare Part A stay; however, the qualified clinician determines that the resident would be able to maintain her admission functional performance level. The qualified clinician discusses functional status goals with the resident and her family and they agree that maintaining functioning is a reasonable goal. In this example, the Discharge Goal is coded at the same level as the resident's admission performance code. 3. Discharge Goal Code Is Lower than 5-Day PPS Assessment Admission Performance Code The qualified clinician determines that a resident with a progressive neurologic condition is expected to rapidly decline and that skilled therapy services may slow the decline of function. In this scenario, the Discharge Goal code is lower than the resident's 5-Day PPS assessment admission performance code. GG0170: Mobility: 3-day assessment period, Coding Tips for GG0170G, Car transfer Admission, Interim, and Discharge Performance Coding Tips Use of an indoor car can be used to simulate outdoor car transfers. These half or full cars would need to have similar physical features of a real car for the purpose of simulating a car transfer, that is, a car seat within a car cabin. The Car transfer item does not include transfers into the driver's seat, opening/closing the car door, fastening/unfastening the seat belt. The Car transfer item includes the resident's ability to transfer in and out of the passenger seat of a car or car simulator. In the event of inclement weather or if an indoor car simulator or outdoor car is not available during the entire 3-day assessment period, then use code 10, Not attempted due to environmental limitations. If at the time of the assessment the resident is unable to attempt car transfers, and could not perform the car transfers prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury, code 09, Not applicable.103 104 10510/8/2019 36 Coding Tips for GG0170I-G0170L Walking Items Walking activities do not need to occur during one session. Allowing a resident to rest between activities or completing activities at different times during the day or on different days may facilitate completion of the activities. Do not consider the resident's mobility performance when using parallel bars. Parallel bars are not a portable assistive device. If safe, assess and code walking using a portable walking device. The turns included in item GG0170J, Walk 50 feet with two turns, are 90- degree turns. The turns may be in the same direction (two 90-degree turns to the right or two 90-degree turns to the left) or may be in different directions (one 90-degree turn to the left and one 90-degree turn to the right). The 90- degree turn should occur at the person's ability level and can include use of an assistive device (for example, cane). Coding Tips for GG0170I-G0170L Walking Items Example Walk 50 feet with two turns: Mr. T walks 50 feet with the therapist providing trunk support. He also requires a second helper, the rehabilitation aide, who provides supervision and follows closely behind with a wheelchair for safety. Mr. T walks the 50 feet with two turns with the assistance of two helpers. Coding: GG0170J would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: Mr. T requires two helpers to complete the activity. Section H: Bladder and BowelGather information on the use of bowel and bladder appliances, the use of and response to urinary toileting programs, urinary and bowel continence, bowel training programs, bowel patterns.106 107 10810/8/2019 37 Section H: B&B, H0100. Appliances Coding Tips and Special Populations Suprapubic catheters and nephrostomy tubes should be coded as an indwelling catheter (H0100A) only and not as an ostomy (H0100C). Condom catheters (males) and external urinary pouches (females) are often used intermittently or at night only; these should be coded as external catheters. Do not code gastrostomies or other feeding ostomies in this section. Only appliances used for elimination are coded here. Do not include one-time catheterization for urine specimen during look-back period as intermittent catheterization. Self-catheterizations that are performed by the resident in the facility should be coded as intermittent catheterization (H0100D). This includes self- catheterizations using clean technique. 109 110 11110/8/2019 38 H0200. Urinary Toileting Program Health-related Quality of Life An individualized, resident-centered toileting program may decrease or prevent urinary incontinence, minimizing or avoiding the negative consequences of incontinence. Determining the type of urinary incontinence can allow staff to provide more individualized programming or interventions to enhance the resident's quality of life and functional status. Many incontinent residents (including those with dementia) respond to a toileting program, especially during the day. H0200. Urinary Toileting Program Planning for Care The steps toward ensuring that the resident receives appropriate treatment and services to restore as much bladder function as possible are Determining if the resident is currently experiencing some level of incontinence or is at risk of developing urinary incontinence; Completing an accurate, thorough assessment of factors that may predispose the resident to having urinary incontinence; and Implementing appropriate, individualized interventions and modifying them as appropriate. Steps for Assessment: H0200A, Trial of a Toileting Program The look-back period for this item is since the most recent admission/entry or reentry or since urinary incontinence was first noted within the facility. BLADDER REHABILITATION/ BLADDER RETRAINING A behavioral technique that requires the resident to resist or inhibit the sensation of urgency (the strong desire to urinate), to postpone or delay voiding, and to urinate according to a timetable rather than to the urge to void. PROMPTED VOIDING Prompted voiding includes (1) regular monitoring with encouragement to report continence status, (2) using a schedule and prompting the resident to toilet, and (3) praise and positive feedback when the resident is continent and attempts to toilet. HABIT TRAINING/ SCHEDULED VOIDING A behavior technique that calls for scheduled toileting at regular intervals on a planned basis to match the resident's voiding habits or needs. CHECK AND CHANGE Involves checking the resident's dry/wet status at regular intervals and using incontinence devices and products.112 113 11410/8/2019 39 Steps for Assessment: H0200B, Response to Trial Toileting Program Review the resident's responses as recorded during the toileting trial, noting any change in the number of incontinence episodes or degree of wetness the resident experiences. Steps for Assessment: H0200C, Current Toileting Program or Trial 1. Review the medical record for evidence of a toileting program being used to manage incontinence during the 7-day look-back period. Note the number of days during the look-back period that the toileting program was implemented or carried out. 2. Look for documentation in the medical record showing that the following three requirements have been met: Implementation of an individualized, resident-specific toileting program that was based on an assessment of the resident's unique voiding pattern; Evidence that the individualized program was communicated to staff and the resident (as appropriate) verbally and through a care plan, flow records, and a written report; and Notations of the resident's response to the toileting program and subsequent evaluations, as needed. 3. Guidance for developing a toileting program may be obtained from sources found in Appendix C. Section I: Active DiagnosesCode diseases that have a relationship to the resident's current functional, cognitive, mood or behavior status, medical treatments, nursing monitoring, or risk of death. 115 116 11710/8/2019 40 I0020: Indicate the resident's primary medical condition category I0020: Indicate the resident's primary medical condition category Planning for Care Indicate the resident's primary medical condition category that best describes the primary reason for the Medicare Part A stay. I0020: Indicate the resident's primary medical condition category Coding Instructions Complete only if A0310B = 01 or 08 Indicate the resident's primary medical condition category that best describes the primary reason for the Medicare Part A stay; then proceed to I0020B and enter the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for that condition, including the decimal. While certain conditions described below represent acute diagnoses, SNFs should not use acute diagnosis codes in I0020B. Sequelae and other such codes should be used instead. Include the primary medical condition coded in this item in Section I: Active Diagnoses in the last 7 days.118 119 12010/8/2019 41 I0020: Indicate the resident's primary medical condition category Code 09, Hip and Knee Replacement, if the resident's primary medical condition category is due to a hip or knee replacement. An example is total knee replacement. If hip replacement is secondary to hip fracture, code as fracture. Code 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma, if the resident's primary medical condition category is fractures and other multiple trauma. Examples include hip fracture, pelvic fracture, and fracture of tibia and fibula. Code 11, Other Orthopedic Conditions, if the resident's primary medical condition category is other orthopedic condition. An example is unspecified disorders of joint. I0020: Indicate the resident's primary medical condition category, Example Mrs. E is an 82-year-old female who was hospitalized for a hip fracture with subsequent total hip replacement and is admitted for rehabilitation. The admitting physician documents Mrs. E's primary medical condition as total hip replacement (THR) in her medical record. The hip fracture resulting in the total hip replacement is also documented in the medical record in the discharge summary from the acute care hospital. Coding: I0020 would be coded 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. I0020B would be coded as S72.062D (Displaced articular fracture of the head of the left femur). I0020: Indicate the resident's primary medical condition category, Example cont. Rationale: Medical record documentation demonstrates that Mrs. E had a total hip replacement due to a hip fracture and required rehabilitation. Because she was admitted for rehabilitation as a result of the hip fracture and total hip replacement, Mrs. E's primary medical condition category is 10, Fractures and Other Multiple Trauma. The ICD-10 code provided in I0020B above is only an example of an appropriate code for this condition category.121 122 12310/8/2019 42 I: Active Diagnoses in the Last 7 Days Health-related Quality of Life Disease processes can have a significant adverse effect on an individual's health status and quality of life. Planning for Care This section identifies active diseases and infections that drive the current plan of care. Steps for Assessment There are two look-back periods for this section: Diagnosis identification (Step 1) is a 60-day look-back period. Diagnosis status: Active or Inactive (Step 2) is a 7-day look-back period (except for Item I2300 UTI, which does not use the active 7-day look-back period). I: Active Diagnoses in the Last 7 Days ACTIVE DIAGNOSES Physician-documented diagnoses in the last 60 days that have a direct relationship to the resident's current functional status, cognitive status, mood or behavior, medical treatments, nursing monitoring, or risk of death during the 7-day look-back period. FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS Loss of range of motion, contractures, muscle weakness, fatigue, decreased ability to perform ADLs, paresis, or paralysis. NURSING MONITORING Nursing Monitoring includes clinical monitoring by a licensed nurse (e.g., serial blood pressure evaluations, medication management, etc.).124 125 12610/8/2019 43 I: Active Diagnoses in the Last 7 Days If a disease or condition is not specifically listed, enter the diagnosis and ICD code in item I8000, Additional active diagnosis. If an individual is receiving aftercare following a hospitalization, a Z code may be assigned. Z codes cover situations where a patient requires continued care for healing, recovery, or long-term consequences of a disease when initial treatment for that disease has already been performed. When Z codes are used, another diagnosis for the related primary medical condition should be checked in items I0100-I7900 or entered in I8000. ICD-10-CM coding guidance with links to appendices can be found here: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/index.html . Section J: Health Conditions Document health conditions that impact the resident's functional status and quality of life. J0100: Pain Management 5-Day Look Back 127 128 12910/8/2019 44 J0100: Pain Management 5-Day Look Back PAIN MEDICATION REGIMEN Pharmacological agent(s) prescribed to relieve or prevent the recurrence of pain. Include all medications used for pain management by any route and any frequency during the look-back period. Include oral, transcutaneous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, rectal, intravenous injections or intraspinal delivery. This item does not include medications that primarily target treatment of the underlying condition, such as chemotherapy or steroids, although such treatments may lead to pain reduction. SCHEDULED PAIN MEDICATION REGIMEN Pain medication order that defines dose and specific time interval for pain medication administration. For example, \"once a day,\" \"every 12 hours.\" J0100: Pain Management 5-Day Look Back PRN PAIN MEDICATIONS Pain medication order that specifies dose and indicates that pain medication may be given on an as needed basis, including a time interval, such as \"every 4 hours as needed for pain\" or \"every 6 hours as needed for pain.\" NON-MEDICATION PAIN INTERVENTION Scheduled and implemented non-pharmacological interventions include, but are not limited to, biofeedback, application of heat/cold, massage, physical therapy, nerve block, stretching and strengthening exercises, chiropractic, electrical stimulation, radiotherapy, ultrasound and acupuncture. Herbal or alternative medicine products are not included in this category. J0200: Should Pain Assessment Interview Be Conducted? Coding Tips and Special Populations If the resident interview should have been conducted, but was not done within the look-back period of the ARD (except when an interpreter is needed/requested and unavailable), item J0200 must be coded 1, Yes, and the standard \"no information\" code (a dash \"-\") entered in the resident interview items J0300-J0600. Item J0700, Should the Staff Assessment for Pain be Conducted, is coded 0, No. Do not complete the Staff Assessment for Pain items (J0800-J0850) if the resident interview should have been conducted, but was not done. If it is not possible for an interpreter to be present during the look-back period, code J0200 = 0 to indicate interview not attempted and complete Staff Assessment of Pain item (J0800), instead of the Pain Interview items (J0300-J0600).130 131 13210/8/2019 45 J0200: Should Pain Assessment Interview Be Conducted? Health-related Quality of Life The effects of unrelieved pain impact the individual in terms of functional decline, complications of immobility, skin breakdown and infections. Pain significantly adversely affects a person's quality of life and is tightly linked to depression, diminished self-confidence and self- esteem, as well as an increase in behavior problems, particularly for cognitively-impaired residents. Some older adults limit their activities in order to avoid having pain. Their report of lower pain frequency may reflect their avoidance of activity more than it reflects adequate pain management. Steps for Assessment: Basic Interview Instructions for Pain Assessment Interview (J0300-J0600) 1. Interview any resident not screened out by the Should Pain Assessment Interview be Conducted? item (J0200). 2. The Pain Assessment Interview for residents consists of four items: The primary question Pain Presence item (J0300), and Three follow-up questions Pain Frequency item (J0400); Pain Effect on Function item (J0500); and Pain Intensity item (J0600). If the resident is unable to answer the primary question on Pain Presence item J0300, skip to the Staff Assessment for Pain beginning with Indicators of Pain or Possible Pain item (J0800). 3. The look-back period on these items is 5 days. Because this item asks the resident to recall pain during the past 5 days, this assessment should be conducted close to the end of the 5- day look-back period; preferably on the day before, or the day of the ARD. This should more accurately capture pain episodes that occur during the 5-day look-back period. Steps for Assessment: Basic Interview Instructions for Pain Assessment Interview (J0300-J0600) PAIN Any type of physical pain or discomfort in any part of the body. It may be localized to one area or may be more generalized. It may be acute or chronic, continuous or intermittent, or occur at rest or with movement. Pain is very subjective; pain is whatever the experiencing person says it is and exists whenever he or she says it does.133 134 13510/8/2019 46 J1400: Prognosis CONDITION OR CHRONIC DISEASE THAT MAY RESULT IN A LIFE EXPECTANCY OF LESS THAN 6 MONTHS In the physician's judgment, the resident has a diagnosis or combination of clinical conditions that have advanced (or will continue to deteriorate) to a point that the average resident with that level of illness would not be expected to survive more than 6 months. This judgment should be substantiated by a physician note. It can be difficult to pinpoint the exact life expectancy for a single resident. Physician judgment should be based on typical or average life expectancy of residents with similar level of disease burden as this resident. J1400: Prognosis HOSPICE SERVICES A program for terminally ill persons where an array of services is provided for the palliation and management of terminal illness and related conditions. The hospice must be licensed by the state as a hospice provider and/or certified under the Medicare program as a hospice provider. Under the hospice program benefit regulations, a physician is required to document in the medical record a life expectancy of less than 6 months, so if a resident is on hospice the expectation is that the documentation is in the medical record. TERMINALLY ILL \"Terminally ill\" means that the individual has a medical prognosis that his or her life expectancy is 6 months or less if the illness runs its normal course. J1550: Problem Conditions Coding Tips Fever: Fever is defined as a temperature 2.4 degrees F higher than baseline. The resident's baseline temperature should be established prior to the Assessment Reference Date. Fever assessment prior to establishing base line temperature: A temperature of 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) on admission (i.e., prior to the establishment of the baseline temperature) would be considered a fever. Internal Bleeding: Bleeding may be frank (such as bright red blood) or occult (such as guaiac positive stools). Clinical indicators include black, tarry stools, vomiting \"coffee grounds,\" hematuria (blood in urine), hemoptysis (coughing up blood), and severe epistaxis (nosebleed) that requires packing. However, nose bleeds that are easily controlled, menses, or a urinalysis that shows a small amount of red blood cells should not be coded as internal bleeding.136 137 13810/8/2019 47 J1550: Problem Conditions Coding Tips Dehydrated: Check this item if the resident presents with two or more of the following potential indicators for dehydration: 1. Resident takes in less than the recommended 1,500 ml of fluids daily (water or liquids in beverages and water in foods with high fluid content, such as gelatin and soups). Note: The recommended intake level has been changed from 2,500 ml to 1,500 ml to reflect current practice standards. 2. Resident has one or more potential clinical signs (indicators) of dehydration, including but not limited to dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, cracked lips, thirst, sunken eyes, dark urine, new onset or increased confusion, fever, or abnormal laboratory values (e.g., elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, potassium chloride, sodium, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, or urine specific gravity). 3. Resident's fluid loss exceeds the amount of fluids he or she takes in (e.g., loss from vomiting, fever, diarrhea that exceeds fluid replacement). Fall, J1700 - J1900 Definitions FALL Unintentional change in position coming to rest on the ground, floor or onto the next lower surface (e.g., onto a bed, chair, or bedside mat). The fall may be witnessed, reported by the resident or an observer or identified when a resident is found on the floor or ground. Falls include any fall, no matter whether it occurred at home, while out in the community, in an acute hospital or a nursing home. Falls are not a result of an overwhelming external force (e.g., a resident pushes another resident). An intercepted fall occurs when the resident would have fallen if he or she had not caught him/herself or had not been intercepted by another person - this is still considered a fall. CMS understands that challenging a resident's balance and training him/her to recover from a loss of balance is an intentional therapeutic intervention and does not consider anticipated losses of balance that occur during supervised therapeutic interventions as intercepted falls. Fall, J1700 - J1900 Definitions FRACTURE RELATED TO A FALL Any documented bone fracture (in a problem list from a medical record, an x-ray report, or by history of the resident or caregiver) that occurred as a direct result of a fall or was recognized and later attributed to the fall. Do not include fractures caused by trauma related to car crashes or pedestrian versus car accidents or impact of another person or object against the resident.139 140 14110/8/2019 48 J1800: Any Falls Since Admission/Entry or Reentry or Prior Assessment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS), whichever is more recent Planning for Care Identification of residents who are at high risk of falling is a top priority for care planning. A previous fall is the most important predictor of risk for future falls. Falls may be an indicator of functional decline and development of other serious conditions such as delirium, adverse drug reactions, dehydration, and infections. External risk factors include medication side effects, use of appliances and restraints, and environmental conditions. A fall should stimulate evaluation of the resident's need for rehabilitation, ambulation aids, modification of the physical environment, or additional monitoring (e.g., toileting, to avoid incontinence). J1900: Number of Falls Since Admission/Entry or Reentry or Prior Assessment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS), whichever is more recent INJURY RELATED TO A FALL Any documented injury that occurred as a result of, or was recognized within a short period of time (e.g., hours to a few days) after the fall and attributed to the fall. INJURY (EXCEPT MAJOR) Includes skin tears, abrasions, lacerations, superficial bruises, hematomas, and sprains; or any fall-related injury that causes the resident to complain of pain. MAJOR INJURY Includes bone fractures, joint dislocations, closed head injuries with altered consciousness, subdural hematoma. J1900: Number of Falls Since Admission/Entry or Reentry or Prior Assessment (OBRA or Scheduled PPS), whichever is more recent Coding Tip If the level of injury directly related to a fall that occurred during the look-back period is identified after the ARD and is at a different injury level than what was originally coded on an assessment that was submitted to the Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES) Assessment Submission and Processing (ASAP) system, the assessment must be modified to update the level of injury that occurred with that fall.142 143 14410/8/2019 49 J2000: Prior Surgery Coding Tips Generally, major surgery for item J2000 refers to a procedure that meets the following criteria: 1. the resident was an inpatient in an acute care hospital for at least one day in the 100 days prior to admission to the skilled nursing facility (SNF), and 2. the surgery carried some degree of risk to the resident's life or the potential for severe disability. J2100: Recent Surgery Requiring Active SNF Care Health-related Quality of Life A recent history of major surgery during the inpatient stay that preceded the resident's Part A admission can affect a resident's recovery. Planning for Care This item identifies whether the resident had major surgery during the inpatient stay that immediately preceded the resident's Part A admission. A recent history of major surgery can affect a resident's recovery. J2100: Recent Surgery Requiring Active SNF Care Generally, major surgery for item J2100 refers to a procedure that meets the following criteria: 1. the resident was an inpatient in an acute care hospital for at least one day in the 30 days prior to admission to the skilled nursing facility (SNF), and 2. the surgery carried some degree of risk to the resident's life or the potential for severe disability.145 146 14710/8/2019 50 J2100: Surgical Procedures In the rare circumstance of the absence of specific documentation that a surgery requires active SNF care, the following indicators may be used to confirm that the surgery requires active SNF care: The inherent complexity of the services prescribed for a resident is such that they can be performed safely and/or effectively only by or under the general supervision of skilled nursing. For example: \u2014 The management of a surgical wound that requires skilled care (e.g., managing potential infection or drainage). \u2014 Daily skilled therapy to restore functional loss after surgical procedures. \u2014Administration of medication and monitoring that requires skilled nursing. Section K: Swallowing/ Nutritional StatusAssess conditions that could affect the resident's ability to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. K0100: Swallowing Disorder Coding Tips Do not code a swallowing problem when interventions have been successful in treating the problem and therefore the signs/symptoms of the problem (K0100A through K0100D) did not occur during the 7-day look-back period. Code even if the symptom occurred only once in the 7-day look- back period. 148 149 15010/8/2019 51 PHYSICIAN-PRESCRIBED WEIGHT- LOSS REGIMEN A weight reduction plan ordered by the resident's physician with the care plan goal of weight reduction. May employ a calorie-restricted diet or other weight loss diets and exercise. Also includes planned diuresis. It is important that weight loss is intentional. BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) Number calculated from a person's weight and height. BMI is used as a screening tool to identify possible weight problems for adults. Visit http://www.cdc.gov/healthywei ght/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/in dex.html. K0510: Nutritional Approaches Coding Instructions for Column 1 Check all nutritional approaches performed prior to admission/entry or reentry to the facility and within the 7-day look-back period. Leave Column 1 blank if the resident was admitted/entered or reentered the facility more than 7 days ago. When completing the Interim Payment Assessment (IPA), the completion of items K0510A, K0510B, and K0510Z will still be required. Coding Tips for K0510A K0510A includes any and all nutrition and hydration received by the nursing home resident in the last 7 days either at the nursing home, at the hospital as an outpatient or an inpatient, provided they were administered for nutrition or hydration. Parenteral/IV feeding\u2014The following fluids may be included when there is supporting documentation that reflects the need for additional fluid intake specifically addressing a nutrition or hydration need. This supporting documentation should be noted in the resident's medical record according to State and/or internal facility policy:151 152 15310/8/2019 52 Coding Tips for K0510A The following items are NOT to be coded in K0510A: \u2014 IV Medications\u2014Code these when appropriate in O0100H, IV Medications. \u2014 IV fluids used to reconstitute and/or dilute medications for IV administration. \u2014 IV fluids administered as a routine part of an operative or diagnostic procedure or recovery room stay. \u2014 IV fluids administered solely as flushes. \u2014 Parenteral/IV fluids administered in conjunction with chemotherapy or dialysis. Enteral feeding formulas: \u2014 Should not be coded as a mechanically altered diet. \u2014 Should only be coded as K0510D, Therapeutic Diet when the enteral formula is altered to manage problematic health conditions, e.g. enteral formulas specific to diabetics. Section M: Skin Conditions Document the risk, presence, appearance, and change of pressure ulcers as well as other skin ulcers, wounds or lesions. Also includes treatment categories related to skin injury or avoiding injury. M0100: Determination of Pressure Ulcer/Injury Risk Planning for Care Throughout this section, terminology referring to \"healed\" versus \"unhealed\" ulcers refers to whether or not the ulcer is \"closed\" versus \"open.\" When considering this, recognize that Stage 1, Deep Tissue Injury (DTI), and unstageable pressure ulcers although \"closed\" (i.e., may be covered with tissue, eschar, slough, etc.) would not be considered \"healed.\" Facilities should be aware that the resident is at higher risk of having the area of a closed pressure ulcer open up due to damage, injury, or pressure, because of the loss of tensile strength of the overlying tissue. Tensile strength of the skin overlying a closed pressure ulcer is 80% of normal skin tensile strength. Facilities should put preventative measures in place that will154 155 15610/8/2019 53 M0100: Determination of Pressure Ulcer/Injury Risk HEALED PRESSURE ULCER Completely closed, fully epithelialized, covered completely with epithelial tissue, or resurfaced with new skin, even if the area continues to have some surface discoloration. PRESSURE ULCER/ INJURY RISK FACTOR Examples of risk factors include immobility and decreased functional ability; co- morbid conditions such as end-stage renal disease, thyroid disease, or diabetes; drugs such as steroids; impaired diffuse or localized blood flow; resident refusal of care and treatment; cognitive impairment; exposure of skin to urinary and fecal incontinence; microclimate, malnutrition, and hydration deficits; and a healed ulcer. PRESSURE ULCER/ INJURY RISK TOOLS Screening tools that are designed to help identify residents who might develop a pressure ulcer/injury. A common risk assessment tool is the Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sore Risk\u00a9. M0210: Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries PRESSURE ULCER/INJURY A pressure ulcer/injury is localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of intense and/or prolonged pressure or pressure in combination with shear. The pressure ulcer/injury can present as intact skin or an open ulcer and may be painful. CMS has adapted the NPUAP guidelines for MDS purposes, the definitions do not perfectly correlate with each stage as described by NPUAP. Therefore, you must code the MDS according to the instructions in this manual. M0210: Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries, Coding Tips If an ulcer/injury arises from a combination of factors that are primarily caused by pressure, then the area should be included in this section as a pressure ulcer/injury. Oral Mucosal ulcers caused by pressure should not be coded in Section M. These ulcers are captured in item L0200C, Abnormal mouth tissue. Mucosal pressure ulcers are not staged using the skin pressure ulcer staging system because anatomical tissue comparisons cannot be made. Therefore, mucosal ulcers (for example, those related to nasogastric tubes, nasal oxygen tubing, endotracheal tubes, urinary catheters, etc.) should not be coded here.157 158 15910/8/2019 54 M0210: Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries, Coding Tips If a pressure ulcer is surgically closed with a flap or graft, it should be coded as a surgical wound and not as a pressure ulcer. If the flap or graft fails, continue to code it as a surgical wound until healed. Residents with diabetes mellitus (DM) can have a pressure, venous, arterial, or diabetic neuropathic ulcer. The primary etiology should be considered when coding whether a resident with DM has an ulcer/injury that is caused by pressure or other factors. If a resident with DM has a heel ulcer/injury from pressure and the ulcer/injury is present in the 7-day look-back period, code 1 and proceed to code items in M0300 as appropriate for the pressure ulcer/injury. If a resident with DM has an ulcer on the plantar (bottom) surface of the foot closer to the metatarsals and the ulcer is present in the 7-day look-back period, code 0 and proceed to M1040 to code the ulcer as a diabetic foot ulcer. It is not likely that pressure is the primary cause of the resident's ulcer when the ulcer is in this location. M0210: Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries, Coding Tips Scabs and eschar are different both physically and chemically. Eschar is a collection of dead tissue within the wound that is flush with the surface of the wound. A scab is made up of dried blood cells and serum, sits on the top of the skin, and forms over exposed wounds such as wounds with granulating surfaces (like pressure ulcers, lacerations, evulsions, etc.). A scab is evidence of wound healing. A pressure ulcer that was staged as a 2 and now has a scab indicates it is a healing stage 2, and therefore, staging should not change. Eschar characteristics and the level of damage it causes to tissues is what makes it easy to distinguish from a scab. It is extremely important to have staff who are trained in wound assessment and who are able to distinguish scabs from eschar. M0210: Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries, Coding Tips If two pressure ulcers/injuries occur on the same bony prominence and are separated, at least superficially, by skin, then count them as two separate pressure ulcers/injuries. Stage and measure each pressure ulcer/injury separately. If a resident had a pressure ulcer/injury that healed during the look-back period of the current assessment, do not code the ulcer/injury on the assessment.160 161 16210/8/2019 55 M0300: Current Number of Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage Step 1: Determine Deepest Anatomical Stage For each pressure ulcer, determine the deepest anatomical stage. Do not reverse or back stage. Consider current and historical levels of tissue involvement. If the pressure ulcer has ever been classified at a higher numerical stage than what is observed now, it should continue to be classified at the higher numerical stage. Pressure ulcers do not heal in a reverse sequence, that is, the body does not replace the types and layers of tissue (e.g., muscle, fat, and dermis) that were lost during pressure ulcer development before they re-epithelialize. Stage 3 and 4 pressure ulcers fill with granulation tissue. This replacement tissue is never as strong as the tissue that was lost and hence is more prone to future breakdown. Once a pressure ulcer has healed, it is documented as a healed pressure ulcer at its highest numerical stage\u2014in this example, a healed Stage 4 pressure ulcer. For care planning purposes, this healed Stage 4 pressure ulcer would remain at increased risk for future breakdown or injury and would require continued monitoring and preventative care. M0300: Current Number of Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage DEFINITIONS EPITHELIAL TISSUE New skin that is light pink and shiny (even in persons with darkly pigmented skin). In Stage 2 pressure ulcers, epithelial tissue is seen in the center and at the edges of the ulcer. In full thickness Stage 3 and 4 pressure ulcers, epithelial tissue advances from the edges of the wound. GRANULATION TISSUE Red tissue with \"cobblestone\" or bumpy appearance; bleeds easily when injured. M0300: Current Number of Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage Step 2: Identify Unstageable Pressure Ulcers 1. Visualization of the wound bed is necessary for accurate staging. 2. If, after careful cleansing of the pressure ulcer/injury, a pressure ulcer's/injury's anatomical tissues remain obscured such that the extent of soft tissue damage cannot be observed or palpated, the pressure ulcer/injury is considered unstageable. 3. Pressure ulcers that have eschar (tan, black, or brown) or slough (yellow, tan, gray, green or brown) tissue present such that the anatomic depth of soft tissue damage cannot be visualized or palpated in the wound bed, should be classified as unstageable. 4. If the wound bed is only partially covered by eschar or slough, and the anatomical depth of tissue damage can be visualized or palpated, numerically stage the ulcer, and do not code this as unstageable. 5. A pressure injury with intact skin that is a deep tissue injury (DTI) should not be coded as a Stage 1 pressure injury. It should be coded as unstageable 6. Known pressure ulcers/injuries covered by a non-removable dressing/device (e.g., primary surgical dressing, cast) should be coded as unstageable. \"Known\" refers to when documentation is available that says a pressure ulcer/injury exists under the non- removable dressing/device.163 164 16510/8/2019 56 M0300: Current Number of Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage Step 3: Determine \"Present on Admission\" For each pressure ulcer/injury, determine if the pressure ulcer/injury was present at the time of admission/entry or reentry and not acquired while the resident was in the care of the nursing home. Consider current and historical levels of tissue involvement. DEFINITION ON ADMISSION As close to the actual time of admission as possible. M0300: Current Number of Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage Ms. K is admitted to the facility without a pressure ulcer/injury. During the stay, she develops a stage 2 pressure ulcer. This is a facility acquired pressure ulcer and was not \"present on admission.\" Ms. K is hospitalized and returns to the facility with the same stage 2 pressure ulcer. This pressure ulcer was originally acquired in the nursing home and should not be considered as \"present on admission\" when she returns from the hospital. M0300: Current Number of Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage Mr. J is a new admission to the facility and is admitted with a stage 2 pressure ulcer. This pressure ulcer is considered as \"present on admission\" as it was not acquired in the facility. Mr. J is hospitalized and returns with the same stage 2 pressure ulcer, unchanged from the prior admission/entry. This pressure ulcer is still considered \"present on admission\" because it was originally acquired outside the facility and has not changed. 166 167 16810/8/2019 57 M0300 current Number if Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage STAGE 1 PRESSURE INJURY An observable, pressure- related alteration of intact skin whose indicators, as compared to an adjacent or opposite area on the body, may include changes in one or more of the following parameters: skin temperature (warmth or coolness); tissue consistency (firm or boggy); sensation (pain, itching); and/or a defined area of persistent redness in lightly pigmented skin, whereas in darker skin tones, the injury may appear with persistent red, blue, or purple hues. NON-BLANCHABLE Reddened areas of tissue that do not turn white or pale when pressed firmly with a finger or device. M0300 current Number if Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage STAGE 2 PRESSURE ULCER Partial thickness loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red-pink wound bed, without slough or bruising. May also present as an intact or open/ ruptured blister. Planning for Care Most Stage 2 pressure ulcers should heal in a reasonable time frame (e.g., 60 days). If a pressure ulcer fails to show some evidence toward healing within 14 days, the pressure ulcer (including potential complications) and the patient's overall clinical condition should be reassessed. The care plan should include individualized interventions and evidence that the interventions have been monitored and modified as appropriate. Coding Tips Stage 2 pressure ulcers by definition have partial thickness loss of the dermis. Granulation tissue, slough, and eschar are not present in Stage 2 pressure ulcers. Do not code skin tears, tape burns, moisture associated skin damage, or excoriation here. When a pressure ulcer presents as an intact blister, examine the adjacent and surrounding area for signs of deep tissue injury. When a deep tissue injury is determined, do not code as a Stage 2. M0300 current Number if Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage STAGE 3 PRESSURE ULCER Full thickness tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon or muscle is not exposed. Slough may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. May include undermining or tunneling (see definition of undermining and tunneling on page M-19). Coding Tips The depth of a Stage 3 pressure ulcer varies by anatomical location. Stage 3 pressure ulcers can be shallow, particularly on areas that do not have subcutaneous tissue, such as the bridge of the nose, ear, occiput, and malleolus. In contrast, areas of significant adiposity can develop extremely deep Stage 3 pressure ulcers. Therefore, observation and assessment of skin folds should be part of overall skin assessment. Do not code moisture-associated skin damage or excoriation here. Bone/tendon/muscle is not visible or directly palpable in a Stage 3 pressure ulcer.169 170 17110/8/2019 58 M0300 current Number if Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage STAGE 4 PRESSURE ULCER Full thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or eschar may be present on some parts of the wound bed. Often includes undermining and tunneling. TUNNELING A passage way of tissue destruction under the skin surface that has an opening at the skin level from the edge of the wound. UNDERMINING The destruction of tissue or ulceration extending under the skin edges (margins) so that the pressure ulcer is larger at its base than at the skin surface. M0300 current Number if Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage Coding Tips for a Stage 4 pressure ulcer The depth of a Stage 4 pressure ulcer varies by anatomical location. The bridge of the nose, ear, occiput, and malleolus do not have subcutaneous tissue, and these ulcers can be shallow. Stage 4 pressure ulcers can extend into muscle and/or supporting structures (e.g., fascia, tendon, or joint capsule) making osteomyelitis possible. Exposed bone/tendon/muscle is visible or directly palpable. Cartilage serves the same anatomical function as bone. Therefore, pressure ulcers that have exposed cartilage should be classified as a Stage 4. M0300 current Number if Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Related to Non-removable Dressing/Device NON-REMOVABLE DRESSING/ DEVICE Includes, for example, a primary surgical dressing that cannot be removed, an orthopedic device, or cast. Planning for Care Although the pressure ulcer/injury itself cannot be observed, the surrounding area is monitored for signs of redness, swelling, increased drainage, or tenderness to touch, and the resident is monitored for adequate pain control.172 173 17410/8/2019 59 M0300 current Number if Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage Unstageable Pressure Ulcers Related to Slough and/or Eschar SLOUGH TISSUE Non-viable yellow, tan, gray, green or brown tissue; usually moist, can be soft, stringy and mucinous in texture. Slough may be adherent to the base of the wound or present in clumps throughout the wound bed. ESCHAR TISSUE Dead or devitalized tissue that is hard or soft in texture; usually black, brown, or tan in color, and may appear scab-like. Necrotic tissue and eschar are usually firmly adherent to the base of the wound and often the sides/ edges of the wound. M0300 current Number if Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage Coding Tips for Unstageable Pressure Ulcers Related to Slough and/or Eschar Only until enough slough and/or eschar is removed to expose the anatomic depth of soft tissue damage involved, can the stage of the wound be determined. Stable eschar (i.e., dry, adherent, intact without erythema or fluctuance) on the heels serves as \"the body's natural (biological) cover\" and should only be removed after careful clinical consideration, including ruling out ischemia, and consultation with the resident's physician, or nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist if allowable under state licensure laws. Once the pressure ulcer is debrided of slough and/or eschar such that the anatomic depth of soft tissue damage involved can be determined, then code the ulcer for the reclassified stage. The pressure ulcer does not have to be completely debrided or free of all slough and/or eschar tissue in order for reclassification of stage to occur. M0300 current Number if Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage Unstageable Pressure Injuries Related to Deep Tissue Injury DEEP TISSUE INJURY Purple or maroon area of discolored intact skin due to damage of underlying soft tissue. The area may be preceded by tissue that is painful, firm, mushy, boggy, warmer or cooler as compared to adjacent tissue. Health-related Quality of Life Deep tissue injury may precede the development of a Stage 3 or 4 pressure ulcer even with optimal treatment. Planning for Care Deep tissue injury requires vigilant monitoring because of the potential for rapid deterioration. Such monitoring should be reflected in the care plan.175 176 17710/8/2019 60 M0300 current Number if Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage Coding Tips for Unstageable Pressure Injuries Related to Deep Tissue Injury Once deep tissue injury has opened to an ulcer, reclassify the ulcer into the appropriate stage. Then code the ulcer for the reclassified stage. Deep tissue injury may be difficult to detect in individuals with dark skin tones. Evolution may be rapid, exposing additional layers of tissue even with optimal treatment. When a lesion due to pressure presents with an intact blister AND the surrounding or adjacent soft tissue does NOT have the characteristics of deep tissue injury, do not code here (see definition of Stage 2 pressure ulcer on page M-12). M1030: Number of Venous and Arterial Ulcers VENOUS ULCERS Ulcers caused by peripheral venous disease, which most commonly occur proximal to the medial or lateral malleolus, above the inner or outer ankle, or on the lower calf area of the leg. ARTERIAL ULCERS Ulcers caused by peripheral arterial disease, which commonly occur on the tips and tops of the toes, tops of the foot, or distal to the medial malleolus. HEMOSIDERIN An intracellular storage form of iron; the consist of an ill-defined complex of ferric hydroxides, polysaccharides, and proteins having an iron content of approximately 33% by weight. It appears as a dark yellow-brown pigment. M1030: Number of Venous and Arterial Ulcers, Coding Tips Arterial Ulcers Trophic skin changes (e.g., dry skin, loss of hair growth, muscle atrophy, brittle nails) may also be present. The wound may start with some kind of minor trauma, such as hitting the leg on a wheelchair. The wound does not typically occur over a bony prominence, however, can occur on the tops of the toes. Pressure forces play virtually no role in the development of the ulcer, however, for some residents, pressure may play a part. Ischemia is the major etiology of these ulcers. Lower extremity and foot pulses may be diminished or absent. Venous Ulcers The wound may start with some kind of minor trauma, such as hitting the leg on a wheelchair. The wound does not typically occur over a bony prominence, and pressure forces play virtually no role in the development of the ulcer.178 179 18010/8/2019 61 M1040: Other Ulcers, Wounds and Skin Problems Coding Instructions Check all that apply in the last 7 days. If there is no evidence of such problems in the last 7 days, check none of the above. Pressure ulcers/injuries coded in items M0200 through M0300 should not be coded here. M1040: Other Ulcers, Wounds and Skin Problems DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS Ulcers caused by the neuropathic and small blood vessel complications of diabetes. Diabetic foot ulcers typically occur over the plantar (bottom) surface of the foot on load bearing areas such as the ball of the foot. Ulcers are usually deep, with necrotic tissue, moderate amounts of exudate, and callused wound edges. The wounds are very regular in shape and the wound edges are even with a punched-out appearance. These wounds are typically not painful. SURGICAL WOUNDS Any healing and non-healing, open or closed surgical incisions, skin grafts or drainage sites. M1040: Other Ulcers, Wounds and Skin Problems OPEN LESION(S) OTHER THAN ULCERS, RASHES, CUTS Most typically skin lesions that develop as a result of diseases and conditions such as syphilis and cancer. BURNS (SECOND OR THIRD DEGREE) Skin and tissue injury caused by heat or chemicals and may be in any stage of healing. MOISTURE ASSOCIATED SKIN DAMAGE Is superficial skin damage caused by sustained exposure to moisture such as incontinence, wound exudate, or perspiration.181 182 18310/8/2019 62 M1200: Skin and Ulcer/Injury Treatments Coding Instructions Check all that apply in the last 7 days. Check Z, None of the above were provided, if none applied in the past 7 days.

Mrs. P was admitted to the nursing home on 10/23/2019 for a Medicare stay. In completing the PPS 5-day assessment (ARD of 10/28/2019), it was noted that the resident had a head-to-toe skin assessment and her skin was intact, but upon assessment using the Braden scale, was found to be at risk for skin breakdown. The resident was noted to have a Stage 2 pressure ulcer that was identified on her coccyx on 11/1/2019. Scenarios for Pressure Ulcer Coding cont. This Stage 2 pressure ulcer was noted to have pink tissue with some epithelialization present in the wound bed. Dimensions of the ulcer were length 01.1 cm, width 00.5 cm, and no measurable depth. Mrs. P does not have any arterial or venous ulcers, wounds, or skin problems. She is receiving ulcer care with application of a dressing applied to the coccygeal ulcer. Mrs. P. also has pressure reducing devices on both her bed and chair and has been placed on a 1\u00bd hour turning and repositioning schedule per tissue tolerance. In order to stay closer to her family, Mrs. P was discharged to another nursing home on 11/5/2019. This was a planned discharge (A0310G = 2), and her OBRA Discharge assessment was coded at A0310F as 10, Discharge assessment - return not anticipated. Scenarios for Pressure Ulcer Coding cont. 5-Day PPS: Coding: M0100B (Formal assessment instrument), Check box. M0100C (Clinical assessment), Check box.

M1040 (Other ulcers, wounds and skin problems), Check Z (None of the above). M1200 (Skin and Ulcer Treatments), Check Z (None of the above were provided).187 188 18910/8/2019 64 Scenarios for Pressure Ulcer Coding Rationale: The resident had a formal assessment using the Braden scale and also had a head-to-toe skin assessment completed. Pressure ulcer risk was identified via formal assessment. Upon assessment the resident's skin was noted to be intact, therefore, M0210 was coded 0. M1030 was coded 0 due to the resident not having any of these conditions. M1040Z was checked since none of these problems were noted. M1200Z was checked because none of these treatments were provided. Section N: Medications Record the number of days that any type of injection, insulin, and/or select medications was received by the resident. N0350: Insulin Coding Tips and Special Populations For sliding scale orders: A sliding scale dosage schedule that is written to cover different dosages depending on lab values does not count as an order change simply because a different dose is administered based on the sliding scale guidelines. If the sliding scale order is new, discontinued, or is the first sliding scale order for the resident, these days can be counted and coded. For subcutaneous insulin pumps Code only the number of days that the resident actually required a subcutaneous injection to restart the pump.190 191 19210/8/2019 65 N0410: Medications Received Steps for Assessment 1. Review the resident's medical record for documentation that any of these medications were received by the resident during the 7-day look-back period (or since admission/entry or reentry if less than 7 days). 2. Review documentation from other health care settings where the resident may have received any of these medications while a resident of the nursing home (e.g., valium given in the emergency room). Coding Instructions N0410A-H: Code medications according to the pharmacological classification, not how they are being used. N0410: Medications Received ADVERSE CONSEQUENCE An unpleasant symptom or event that is caused by or associated with a medication, impairment or decline in an individual's physical condition, mental, functional or psychosocial status. It may include various types of adverse drug reactions (ADR) and interactions (e.g., medication- medication, medication-food, and medication-disease). NON- PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION Approaches that do not involve the use of medication to address a medical condition. DOSE The total amount/strength/ concentration of a medication given at one time or over a period of time. The individual dose is the amount/strength/ concentration received at each administration. The amount received over a 24-hour period may be referred to as the \"daily dose.\" N0410: Medications Received MONITORING The ongoing collection and analysis of information (such as observations and diagnostic test results) and comparison to baseline and current data in order to ascertain the individual's response to treatment and care, including progress or lack of progress toward a goal. Monitoring can detect any improvements, complications, or adverse consequences of the condition or the treatments and support decisions about adding, modifying, continuing, or discontinuing any interventions. SLEEP HYGIENE Practices, habits and environmental factors that promote and/or improve sleep patterns.193 194 19510/8/2019 66 N0410: Medications Received GRADUAL DOSE REDUCTION (GDR) Step-wise tapering of a dose to determine whether or not symptoms, conditions, or risks can be managed by a lower dose or whether or not the dose or medication can be discontinued. MEDICATION INTERACTION The impact of medication or other substance (such as nutritional supplements including herbal products, food, or substances used in diagnostic studies) upon another medication. The interactions may alter absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination. These interactions may decrease the effectiveness of the medication or increase the potential for adverse consequences. N0450: Antipsychotic Medication Review N0450: Antipsychotic Medication Review Coding Instructions for N0450D Code 0, no: if a GDR has not been documented by a physician as clinically contraindicated. Skip N0450E Date physician documented GDR as clinically contraindicated. Code 1, yes: if a GDR has been documented by a physician as clinically contraindicated. Continue to N0450E, Date physician documented GDR as clinically contraindicated. Coding Instructions for N0450E Enter date the physician documented GDR attempts as clinically contraindicated. 196 197 19810/8/2019 67 Coding Tips and Special Populations (N0450B and N0450C) Within the first year in which a resident is admitted on an antipsychotic medication or after the facility has initiated an antipsychotic medication, The facility must attempt a GDR in two separate quarters (with at least one month between the attempts), Unless physician documentation is present in the medical record indicating that a GDR is clinically contraindicated. After the first year, a GDR must be attempted at least annually, unless clinically contraindicated (see F758 in Appendix PP of the State Operations Manual). Coding Tips and Special Populations (N0450B and N0450C) In N0450B and N0450C, include GDR attempts conducted since the resident was admitted to the facility, if the resident was receiving an antipsychotic medication at the time of admission, OR since the resident was started on the antipsychotic medication, if the medication was started after the resident was admitted. Do not include gradual dose reductions that occurred prior to admission to the facility (e.g., GDRs attempted during the resident's acute care stay prior to admission to the facility). If the resident was admitted to the facility with a documented GDR attempt in progress and the resident received the last dose(s) of the antipsychotic medication of the GDR in the facility, then the GDR would be coded in N0450B and N0450C. Coding Tips and Special Populations (N0450B and N0450C) Do not count as a GDR an antipsychotic medication reduction performed for the purpose of switching the resident from one antipsychotic medication to another. The start date of the last attempted GDR should be entered in N0450C, Date of last attempted GDR. The GDR start date is the first day the resident received the reduced dose of the antipsychotic medication.199 200 20110/8/2019 68 Coding Tips and Special Populations (N0450B and N0450C) In cases in which a resident is or was receiving multiple antipsychotic medications on a routine basis and one medication was reduced or discontinued, record the date of the reduction attempt or discontinuation in N0450C. If multiple dose reductions have been attempted since admission OR since initiation of the antipsychotic medication, record the date of the most recent reduction attempt in N0450C. Federal requirements regarding GDRs are found at 42 CFR 483.45(d) Unnecessary drugs and 483.45(e) Psychotropic drugs. N2001: Drug Regimen Review Intent: The intent of the drug regimen review items is to document whether a drug regimen review was conducted upon the resident's admission (start of Skilled Nursing Facility [SNF] Prospective Payment System [PPS] stay) and throughout the resident's stay (through Part A PPS discharge) and whether any clinically significant medication issues identified were addressed in a timely manner. N2001: Drug Regimen Review DRUG REGIMEN REVIEW A drug regimen review includes medication reconciliation, a review of all medications a resident is currently using, and a review of the drug regimen to identify, and if possible, prevent potential clinically significant medication adverse consequences. The drug regimen review includes all medications, prescribed and over the counter (OTC), nutritional supplements, vitamins, and homeopathic and herbal products, administered by any route. It also includes total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and oxygen.202 203 20410/8/2019 69 N2001: Drug Regimen Review Coding Instructions Code 0, No: if no clinically significant medication issues were identified during the drug regimen review. Code 1, Yes: if one or more clinically significant medication issues were identified during the drug regimen review. Code 9, NA: if the resident was not taking any medications at the time of the drug regimen review. N2001: Drug Regimen Review POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT MEDICATION ISSUE A clinically significant medication issue is a potential or actual issue that, in the clinician's professional judgment, warrants physician (or physician- designee) communication and completion of prescribed/recommended actions by midnight of the next calendar day at the latest. \"Clinically significant\" means effects, results, or consequences that materially affect or are likely to affect an individual's mental, physical, or psychosocial well-being, either positively, by preventing a condition or reducing a risk, or negatively, by exacerbating, causing, or contributing to a symptom, illness, or decline in status. Any circumstance that does not require this immediate attention is not considered a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue for the purpose of the drug regimen review items. N2001: Drug Regimen Review Coding Tips A dash (-) value is a valid response for this item; however, CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. The drug regimen review includes all medications, prescribed and over the counter (OTC), including nutritional supplements, vitamins, and homeopathic and herbal products, administered by any route. The drug regimen review also includes total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and oxygen.205 206 20710/8/2019 70 N2003: Medication Follow-up MEDICATION FOLLOW-UP The process of contacting a physician to communicate an identified medication issue and completing all physician- prescribed/recommended actions by midnight of the next calendar day at the latest. N2003: Medication Follow-up Steps for Assessment This item is completed if one or more potential or actual clinically significant medication issues were identified during the admission drug regimen review (N2001 = 1). 1. Review the resident's medical record to determine whether the following criteria were met for any potential or actual clinically significant medication issues that were identified upon admission: Two-way communication between the clinician(s) and the physician was completed by midnight of the next calendar day, AND All physician-prescribed/-recommended actions were completed by midnight of the next calendar day. N2003: Medication Follow-up Coding Instructions Code 0, No: if the facility did not contact the physician and complete prescribed/recommended actions in response to each identified potential or actual clinically significant medication issue by midnight of the next calendar day. Code 1, Yes: if the facility contacted the physician AND completed the prescribed/recommended actions by midnight of the next calendar day after each potential or actual clinically significant medication issue was identified.208 209 21010/8/2019 71 N2005: Medication Intervention The observation period for this item is from the date of admission (start of SNF PPS stay) through discharge (Part A PPS discharge). N2005: Medication Intervention Coding Instructions Code 0, No: if the facility did not contact the physician and complete prescribed/ recommended actions by midnight of the next calendar day each time a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue was identified since admission (start of SNF PPS stay). Code 1, Yes: if the facility contacted the physician and completed prescribed/ recommended actions by midnight of the next calendar day each time a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue was identified since admission (start of SNF PPS stay). Code 9, NA: if there were no potential or actual clinically significant medication issues identified at admission or throughout the resident's stay or the resident was not taking any medications at admission or at any time throughout the stay. Section O: Special Treatments, Procedures, and ProgramsIdentify any special treatments, procedures, and programs that the resident received during the specified time periods.211 212 21310/8/2019 72 O0100: Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs Coding Instructions for Column 1 Check all treatments, procedures, and programs received or performed by the resident prior to admission/entry or reentry to the facility and within the 14-day look- back period. Leave Column 1 blank if the resident was admitted/entered or reentered the facility more than 14 days ago. If no items apply in the last 14 days, check Z, none of the above. Coding Instructions for Column 2 Check all treatments, procedures, and programs received or performed by the resident after admission/entry or reentry to the facility and within the 14-day look- back period. O0100: Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs Coding Tips O0100A, Chemotherapy Code any type of chemotherapy agent administered as an antineoplastic given by any route in this item. Each medication should be evaluated to determine its reason for use before coding it here. Medications coded here are those actually used for cancer treatment O0100: Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs Coding Tips for O0100H, IV medications Code any drug or biological given by intravenous push, epidural pump, or drip through a central or peripheral port in this item. Subcutaneous pumps are not coded in this item. Do not include IV medications of any kind that were administered during dialysis or chemotherapy. Dextrose 50% and/or Lactated Ringers given IV are not considered medications, and should not be coded here. To determine what products are considered medications or for more information consult the FDA website: The Orange Book, http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/ The National Drug Code Directory, http://www.fda.gov/drugs/informationondrugs/ucm142438.htm214 215 21610/8/2019 73 O0100: Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs Coding Tips for O0100M, Isolation for active infectious disease (does not include standard precautions) Code for \"single room isolation\" only when all of the following conditions are met: 1. The resident has active infection with highly transmissible or epidemiologically significant pathogens that have been acquired by physical contact or airborne or droplet transmission. 2. Precautions are over and above standard precautions. That is, transmission- based precautions (contact, droplet, and/or airborne) must be in effect. 3. The resident is in a room alone because of active infection and cannot have a roommate. This means that the resident must be in the room alone and not cohorted with a roommate regardless of whether the roommate has a similar active infection that requires isolation. 4. The resident must remain in his/her room. This requires that all services be brought to the resident (e.g. rehabilitation, activities, dining, etc.). O0250: Influenza Vaccine Health-related Quality of Life When infected with influenza, older adults and persons with underlying health problems are at increased risk for complications and are more likely than the general population to require hospitalization. An institutional Influenza A outbreak can result in up to 60 percent of the population becoming ill, with 25 percent of those affected developing complications severe enough to result in hospitalization or death. Influenza-associated mortality results not only from pneumonia, but also from subsequent events arising from cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and other chronic or immunocompromising diseases that can be exacerbated by influenza. O0300: Pneumococcal Vaccine Health-related Quality of Life Pneumococcus is one of the leading causes of community-acquired infections in the United States, with the highest disease burden among the elderly. Adults 65 years of age and older and those with chronic medical conditions are at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease and have higher case-fatality rates. Pneumococcal vaccines can help reduce the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia.217 218 21910/8/2019 74 O0300: Pneumococcal Vaccine Coding Tips Specific guidance about pneumococcal vaccine recommendations and timing for adults can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/downloads/pneumo-vaccine- timing.pdf. \"Up to date\" in item O0300A means in accordance with current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations. For up-to-date information on timing and intervals between vaccines, please refer to ACIP vaccine recommendations available at \u2014 https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/index.html \u2014http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html \u2014 https://www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/vaccination.html If a resident has received one or more pneumococcal vaccinations and is indicated to get an additional pneumococcal vaccination but is not yet eligible for the next vaccination because the recommended time interval between vaccines has not lapsed, O0300A is coded 1, yes, indicating the resident's pneumococcal vaccination is up to date. O0400: Therapies Planning for Care Code only medically necessary therapies that occurred after admission/readmission to the nursing home that were (1) ordered by a physician (physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, and/or clinical nurse specialist) based on a qualified therapist's assessment (i.e., one who meets Medicare requirements or, in some instances, under such a person's direct supervision) and treatment plan, (2) documented in the resident's medical record, and (3) care planned and periodically evaluated to ensure that the resident receives needed therapies and that current treatment plans are effective. Therapy treatment may occur either inside or outside of the facility. O0400: Therapies Individual minutes Enter the total number of minutes of therapy that were provided on an individual basis in the last 7 days. Concurrent minutes Enter the total number of minutes of therapy that were provided on a concurrent basis in the last 7 days. Concurrent therapy is defined as the treatment of 2 residents at the same time, when the residents are not performing the same or similar activities, regardless of payer source, both of whom must be in line- of-sight of the treating therapist or assistant for Medicare Part A. When a Part A resident receives therapy that meets this definition, it is defined as concurrent therapy for the Part A resident regardless of the payer source for the second resident. For Part B, residents may not be treated concurrently: For all other payers, follow Medicare Part A instructions. Group minutes Enter the total number of minutes of therapy that were provided in a group in the last 7 days. Group therapy is defined for Part A as the treatment of two to six residents , regardless of payer source, who are performing the same or similar activities, and are supervised by a therapist or an assistant who is not supervising any other individuals. For Medicare Part B, treatment of two patients (or more), regardless of payer source, at the same time is documented as group treatment. For all other payers, follow Medicare Part A instructions.220 221 22210/8/2019 75 O0400: Therapies Coding Instructions for Respiratory, Psychological, and Recreational Therapies Total Minutes\u2014Enter the actual number of minutes therapy services were provided in the last 7 days. Enter 0 if none were provided. Days\u2014Enter the number of days therapy services were provided in the last 7 days. A day of therapy is defined as treatment for 15 minutes or more in the day. Enter 0 if therapy was provided but for less than 15 minutes every day for the last 7 days. If the total number of minutes during the last 7 days is 0, skip this item and leave blank. For Speech-Language Pathology Services (SLP) and Physical (PT) and Occupational Therapies (OT) include only skilled therapy services. Skilled therapy services must meet all of the following conditions (Refer to Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapters 8 and 15, for detailed requirements and policies): Part A, services must be ordered by a physician. For Part B the plan of care must be certified by a physician following the therapy evaluation; Services must be directly and specifically related to an active written treatment plan that is approved by the physician after any needed consultation with the qualified therapist and is based on an initial evaluation performed by a qualified therapist prior to the start of therapy services in the facility; Services must be of a level of complexity and sophistication, or the condition of the resident must be of a nature that requires the judgment, knowledge, and skills of a therapist; Services must be provided with the expectation, based on the assessment of the resident's restoration potential made by the physician, that the condition of the patient will improve materially in a reasonable and generally predictable period of time; or, the services must be necessary for the establishment of a safe and effective maintenance program; or, the services must require the skills of a qualified therapist for the performance of a safe and effective maintenance program. Services must be considered under accepted standards of medical practice to be specific and effective treatment for the resident's condition; and, Services must be reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the resident's condition; this includes the requirement that the amount, frequency, and duration of the services must be reasonable, and they must be furnished by qualified personnel. O0425: Part A Therapies 223 224 22510/8/2019 76 O0425: Part A Therapies Planning for Care Code only medically necessary therapies that occurred after admission/readmission to the nursing home that were (1) ordered by a physician (physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, and/or clinical nurse specialist as allowable under state licensure laws) based on a qualified therapist's assessment (i.e., one who meets Medicare requirements or, in some instances, under such a person's direct supervision) and treatment plan, (2) documented in the resident's medical record, and (3) care planned and periodically evaluated to ensure that the resident receives needed therapies and that current treatment plans are effective. Therapy treatment may occur either inside or outside of the facility. O0425: Part A Therapies, Steps for Assessment NOTE: The look back for these items is the entire SNF Part A stay, starting at Day 1 of the Part A stay and finishing on the last day of the Part A stay. Once reported on the MDS, CMS grouping software will calculate the percentage of group and concurrent therapy, combined, provided to each resident as a percentage of all therapies provided to that resident, by discipline. If the combined amount of group and concurrent therapy provided, by discipline, exceeds 25 percent, then this would be deemed as non-compliance and a warning message would be received on the Final Validation Report. Providers should follow the steps outlined below for calculating compliance with the concurrent/group therapy limit: Step 1: Total Therapy Minutes, by discipline (O0425X1 + O0425X2 + O0425X3) Step 2: Total Concurrent and Group Therapy Minutes, by discipline (O0425X2+O0425X3) Step 3: Concurrent/Group Ratio (Step 2 result/Step 1 result) Step 4: If Step 3 result is greater than 0.25, then the provider is non-compliant. O0430: Distinct Calendar Days of Part A Therapy Item Rationale To record the number of calendar days that the resident received Speech- Language Pathology and Audiology Services, Occupational Therapy, or Physical Therapy for at least 15 minutes during the Part A SNF stay. 226 227 22810/8/2019 77 O0450: Resumption of Therapy CMS does not require completion of this item; however, some States continue to require its completion. It is important to know your State's requirements for completing this item. O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs Health-related Quality of Life Maintaining independence in activities of daily living and mobility is critically important to most people. Functional decline can lead to depression, withdrawal, social isolation, and complications of immobility, such as incontinence and pressure ulcers/injuries.229 230 23110/8/2019 78 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs, Steps for Assessment 1. Review the restorative nursing program notes and/or flow sheets in the medical record. 2. For the 7-day look-back period, enter the number of days on which the technique, training or skill practice was performed for a total of at least 15 minutes during the 24-hour period. O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs, Steps for Assessment 3. The following criteria for restorative nursing programs must be met in order to code O0500: Measureable objective and interventions must be documented in the care plan and in the medical record. If a restorative nursing program is in place when a care plan is being revised, it is appropriate to reassess progress, goals, and duration/frequency as part of the care planning process. Good clinical practice would indicate that the results of this reassessment should be documented in the resident's medical record. O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs 3. The following criteria for restorative nursing programs must be met in order to code O0500 cont: Evidence of periodic evaluation by the licensed nurse must be present in the resident's medical record. When not contraindicated by state practice act provisions, a progress note written by the restorative aide and countersigned by a licensed nurse is sufficient to document the restorative nursing program once the purpose and objectives of treatment have been established.232 233 23410/8/2019 79 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs 3. The following criteria for restorative nursing programs must be met in order to code O0500 cont: Nursing assistants/aides must be trained in the techniques that promote resident involvement in the activity. This category does not include groups with more than four residents per supervising helper or caregiver. O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs, Steps for Assessment 3. The following criteria for restorative nursing programs must be met in order to code O0500 cont: A registered nurse or a licensed practical (vocational) nurse must supervise the activities in a restorative nursing program. Sometimes, under licensed nurse supervision, other staff and volunteers will be assigned to work with specific residents. Restorative nursing does not require a physician's order. Nursing homes may elect to have licensed rehabilitation professionals perform repetitive exercises and other maintenance treatments or to supervise aides performing these maintenance services. In situations where such services do not actually require the involvement of a qualified therapist, the services may not be coded as therapy in item O0400, Therapies or O0425, Part A Therapies, because the specific interventions are considered restorative nursing services (see item O0400, Therapies and O0425, Part A Therapies). The therapist's time actually providing the maintenance service can be included when counting restorative nursing minutes. Although therapists may participate, members of the nursing staff are still responsible for overall coordination and supervision of restorative nursing programs. O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs, Technique O0500A, Range of Motion (Passive) Code provision of passive movements in order to maintain flexibility and useful motion in the joints of the body. These exercises must be individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500B, Range of Motion (Active) Code exercises performed by the resident, with cueing, supervision, or physical assist by staff that are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. Include active ROM and active-assisted ROM. O0500C, Splint or Brace Assistance Code provision of (1) verbal and physical guidance and direction that teaches the resident how to apply, manipulate, and care for a brace or splint; or (2) a scheduled program of applying and removing a splint or brace. These sessions are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record.235 236 23710/8/2019 80 O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs, Training and Skill Practice Activities including repetition, physical or verbal cueing, and/or task segmentation provided by any staff member under the supervision of a licensed nurse. O0500D, Bed Mobility Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self-performance in moving to and from a lying position, turning side to side and positioning himself or herself in bed. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500E, Transfer Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self-performance in moving between surfaces or planes either with or without assistive devices. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500F, Walking Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self-performance in walking, with or without assistive devices. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs, Training and Skill Practice Activities including repetition, physical or verbal cueing, and/or task segmentation provided by any staff member under the supervision of a licensed nurse. O0500G, Dressing and/or Grooming Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self-performance in dressing and undressing, bathing and washing, and performing other personal hygiene tasks.

O0500: Restorative Nursing Programs, Training and Skill Practice Activities including repetition, physical or verbal cueing, and/or task segmentation provided by any staff member under the supervision of a licensed nurse. O0500I, Amputation/ Prosthesis Care Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self-performance in putting on and removing a prosthesis, caring for the prosthesis, and providing appropriate hygiene at the site where the prosthesis attaches to the body (e.g., leg stump or eye socket). Dentures are not considered to be prostheses for coding this item. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record. O0500J, Communication Code activities provided to improve or maintain the resident's self-performance in functional communication skills or assisting the resident in using residual communication skills and adaptive devices. These activities are individualized to the resident's needs, planned, monitored, evaluated, and documented in the resident's medical record.238 239 24010/8/2019 81 Section P: Restraints and Alarms Record the frequency that the resident was restrained by any of the listed devices at any time during the day or night; record the frequency that any of the listed alarms were used. SECTION P: RESTRAINTS AND ALARMS Intent: The intent of this section is to record the frequency that the resident was restrained by any of the listed devices or an alarm was used, at any time during the day or night, during the 7-day look-back period. Assessors will evaluate whether or not a device meets the definition of a physical restraint or an alarm and code only the devices that meet the definitions in the appropriate categories. Are Restraints Prohibited by CMS? Federal regulations and CMS guidelines do not prohibit use of physical restraints in nursing homes, except when they are imposed for discipline or convenience and are not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms. The regulation specifically states, \"The resident has the right to be free from any physical or chemical restraints imposed for the purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms\" (42 CFR 483.10(e)(1) and 483.12). SECTION P: RESTRAINTS AND ALARMS PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS Any manual method or physical or mechanical device, material or equipment attached or adjacent to the resident's body that the individual cannot remove easily, which restricts freedom of movement or normal access to one's body (State Operations Manual, Appendix PP).241 242 24310/8/2019 82 SECTION P: RESTRAINTS AND ALARMS SECTION P: RESTRAINTS AND ALARMS Clarifications \"Remove easily\" means that the manual method or physical or mechanical device, material, or equipment can be removed intentionally by the resident in the same manner as it was applied by the staff (e.g., side rails are put down or not climbed over, buckles are intentionally unbuckled, ties or knots are intentionally untied), considering the resident's physical condition and ability to accomplish his or her objective (e.g., transfer to a chair, get to the bathroom in time). \"Freedom of movement\" means any change in place or position for the body or any part of the body that the person is physically able to control or access. SECTION P: RESTRAINTS AND ALARMS Clarifications \"Medical symptoms/diagnoses\" are defined as an indication or characteristic of a physical or psychological condition. Objective findings derived from clinical evaluation of the resident's subjective symptoms and medical diagnoses should be considered when determining the presence of medical symptom(s) that might support restraint use. The resident's subjective symptoms may not be used as the sole basis for using a restraint. In addition, the resident's medical symptoms/diagnoses should not be viewed in isolation; rather, the medical symptoms identified should become the context in which to determine the most appropriate method of treatment related to the resident's condition, circumstances, and environment, and not a way to justify restraint use.244 245 24610/8/2019 83 SECTION P: RESTRAINTS AND ALARMS Additional Information Restraint reduction/elimination. It is further expected, for residents whose care plan indicates the need for physical restraints, that the nursing home engages in a systematic and gradual process towards reducing (or eliminating, if possible) the restraints (e.g., gradually increasing the time for ambulation and strengthening activities). This systematic process also applies to recently-admitted residents for whom physical restraints were used in the previous setting. SECTION P: RESTRAINTS AND ALARMS Additional Information Restraints as a fall prevention approach. Although physical restraints have been traditionally used as a fall prevention approach, they have major drawbacks and can contribute to serious injuries. Falls do not constitute self-injurious behavior nor a medical symptom supporting the use of physical restraints. There is no evidence that the use of physical restraints, including but not limited to side rails, will prevent, reduce, or eliminate falls. In fact, in some instances, reducing the use of physical restraints may actually decrease the risk of falling. Additionally, falls that occur while a person is physically restrained often result in more severe injuries. SECTION P: RESTRAINTS AND ALARMS Additional Information Request for restraints. While a resident, family member, legal representative, or surrogate may request use of a physical restraint, the nursing home is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of that request, just as they would for any medical treatment. As with other medical treatments, such as the use of prescription drugs, a resident, family member, legal representative, or surrogate has the right to refuse treatment, but not to demand its use when it is not deemed medically necessary. According to 42 CFR 483.10(e)(1) and 483.12, \"The resident has the right to be free from any physical or chemical restraints imposed for the purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms.\" CMS expects that no resident will be physically restrained for discipline or convenience. Prior to employing any physical restraint, the nursing home must perform a prescribed resident assessment to properly identify the resident's needs and the medical symptom the physical restraint is being employed to address. The guidelines in the State Operations Manual (SOM) state,247 248 24910/8/2019 84 SECTION P: RESTRAINTS AND ALARMS Additional Information \"...the legal surrogate or representative cannot give permission to use restraints for the sake of discipline or staff convenience or when the restraint is not necessary to treat the resident's medical symptoms. That is, the facility may not use restraints in violation of regulation solely based on a resident, legal surrogate or representative's request or approval.\" The SOM goes on to state, \"While Federal regulations affirm the resident's right to participate in care planning and to refuse treatment, the regulations do not create the right for a resident, legal surrogate or representative to demand that the facility use specific medical interventions or treatment that the facility deems inappropriate. Statutory requirements hold the facility ultimately accountable for the resident's care and safety, including clinical decisions.\" SECTION P: RESTRAINTS AND ALARMS, P0200: Alarms Section Q Participation in Assessment and Goal SettingRecord the participation of the resident, family and/or significant others in the assessment, and to understand the resident's overall goals.250 251 25210/8/2019 85 Q0100: Participation in Assessment Q0100: Participation in Assessment RESIDENT'S PARTICIPATION IN ASSESSMENT The resident actively engages in interviews and conversations to meaningfully contribute to the completion of the MDS 3.0.

Coding Instructions For Z0500B, use the actual date that the MDS was completed, reviewed, and signed as complete by the RN assessment coordinator. This date must be equal to the latest date at Z0400 or later than the date(s) at Z0400, which documents when portions of the assessment information were completed by assessment team members. If for some reason the MDS cannot be signed by the RN assessment coordinator on the date it is completed, the RN assessment coordinator should use the actual date that it is signed. Coding Tips The RN assessment coordinator is not certifying the accuracy of portions of the assessment that were completed by other health professionals. CAA Process and Care PlanningIn accordance with 42 CFR 483.21(b) the facility must develop a comprehensive care plan for each resident that includes measurable objectives and timetables to meet a resident's medical, nursing, and mental and psychosocial needs that are identified in the comprehensive assessment. The services that are to be furnished to attain or maintain the resident's highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being and any services that would otherwise be required but are not provided due to the resident's exercise of rights including the right to refuse treatment. CARE AREA ASSESSMENT (CAA) PROCESS AND CARE PLANNING Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) consists of three basic components: 1) Minimum Data Set (MDS) Version 3.0, 2) Care Area Assessment (CAA) process, and 3) RAI Utilization Guidelines. The RAI-related processes help staff identify key information about residents as a basis for identifying resident-specific issues and objectives.271 272 27310/8/2019 92 The CAA process framework The CAA process provides a framework for guiding the review of triggered areas, and clarification of a resident's functional status and related causes of impairments. It also provides a basis for additional assessment of potential issues, including related risk factors. The assessment of the causes and contributing factors gives the interdisciplinary team (IDT) additional information to help them develop a comprehensive plan of care. The CAA process framework When implemented properly, the CAA process should help staff: Consider each resident as a whole, with unique characteristics and strengths that affect his or her capacity to function; Identify areas of concern that may warrant interventions; Develop, to the extent possible, interventions to help improve, stabilize, or prevent decline in physical, functional, and psychosocial well-being, in the context of the resident's condition, choices, and preferences for interventions; and Address the need and desire for other important considerations, such as advanced care planning and palliative care; e.g., symptom relief and pain management. What Are the Care Area Assessments (CAAs)? The completed MDS must be analyzed and combined with other relevant information to develop an individualized care plan. To help nursing facilities apply assessment data collected on the MDS, Care Area Assessments (CAAs) are triggered responses to items coded on the MDS specific to a resident's possible problems, needs or strengths. Specific \"CAT logic\" for each care area is identified under section 4.10 (The Twenty Care Areas). The CAAs reflect conditions, symptoms, and other areas of concern that are common in nursing home residents and are commonly identified or suggested by MDS findings. Interpreting and addressing the care areas identified by the CATs is the basis of the Care Area Assessment process, and can help provide additional information for the development of an individualized care plan.274 275 27610/8/2019 93 Table 1. Care Area Assessments in the Resident Assessment Instrument, Version 3.0 1. Delirium 2. Cognitive Loss/Dementia 3. Visual Function 4. Communication 5. Activity of Daily Living (ADL) Functional / Rehabilitation Potential 6. Urinary Incontinence and Indwelling Catheter 7. Psychosocial Well-Being 8. Mood State 9. Behavioral Symptoms 10. Activities11.

Return to Community Referral When do I complete CAAs? CAAs are not required for Medicare PPS assessments. They are required only for OBRA comprehensive assessments (Admission, Annual, Significant Change in Status, or Significant Correction of a Prior Comprehensive). However, when a Medicare PPS assessment is combined with an OBRA comprehensive assessment, the CAAs must be completed in order to meet the requirements of the OBRA comprehensive assessment. Care Area Triggers (CATs) Care Area Triggers (CATs) identify conditions that may require further evaluation because they may have an impact on specific issues and/or conditions, or the risk of issues and/or conditions for the resident. Each triggered item must be assessed further through the use of the CAA process to facilitate care plan decision making, but it may or may not represent a condition that should or will be addressed in the care plan. The significance and causes of any given trigger may vary for different residents or in different situations for the same resident. Different CATs may have common causes, or various items associated with several CATs may be connected.277 278 27910/8/2019 94 Care Area Triggers (CATs) CATs provide a \"flag\" for the IDT members, indicating that the triggered care area needs to be assessed more completely prior to making care planning decisions. Further assessment of a triggered care area may identify causes, risk factors, and complications associated with the care area condition. The plan of care then addresses these factors with the goal of promoting the resident's highest practicable level of functioning: (1) improvement where possible or (2) maintenance and prevention of avoidable declines. Care Area Triggers (CATs) A risk factor increases the chances of having a negative outcome or complication. For example, impaired bed mobility may increase the risk of getting a pressure ulcer/injury. In this example, impaired bed mobility is the risk factor, unrelieved pressure is the effect of the compromised bed mobility, and the potential pressure ulcer is the complication. Care Area Triggers (CATs) A care area issue/condition (e.g., falls) may result from a single underlying cause (e.g., administration of a new medication that causes dizziness) or from a combination of multiple factors (e.g., new medication, resident forgot walker, bed too high or too low, etc.). 280 281 28210/8/2019 95 Care Area Triggers (CATs) There can also be a single cause of multiple triggers and impairments. For example, hypothyroidism is an example of a common, potentially reversible medical condition that can have diverse physical, functional, and psychosocial complications. Thus, if a resident has hypothyroidism, it is possible that the MDS might trigger any or several of the following CAAs depending on whether or not the hypothyroidism is controlled, there is an acute exacerbation, etc.: Nutritional Status Dehydration (#14), Psychotropic Medication Use (#17), and Pain (#19). Even if the MDS does not trigger a particular care area, the facility can use the CAA process and resources at any time to further assess the resident. Care Area Triggers (CATs) Not all triggers identify deficits or problems. Some triggers indicate areas of resident strengths, and can suggest possible approaches to improve a resident's functioning or minimize decline. For example, MDS item responses indicate the \"resident believes he or she is capable of increased independence in at least some ADLs\" (Item G0900A) may focus the assessment and care plan on functional areas most important to the resident or on the area with the greatest potential for improvement. Care Area Triggers (CATs) In addition to identifying causes and risk factors that contribute to the resident's care area issues or conditions, the CAA process may help the IDT: Identify and address associated causes and effects; Determine whether and how multiple triggered conditions are related; Identify a need to obtain additional medical, functional, psychosocial, financial, or other information about a resident's condition that may be obtained from sources such as the resident, the resident's family or other responsible party, the attending physician, direct care staff, rehabilitative staff, or that requires laboratory and diagnostic tests; Identify whether and how a triggered condition actually affects the resident's function and quality of life, or whether the resident is at particular risk of developing the conditions; Review the resident's situation with a health care practitioner (e.g., attending physician, medical director, or nurse practitioner), to try to identify links among causes and between causes and consequences, and to identify pertinent tests, consultations, and interventions; Determine whether a resident could potentially benefit from rehabilitative interventions; Begin to develop an individualized care plan with measurable objectives and timetables to meet a resident's medical, functional, mental and psychosocial needs as identified through the comprehensive assessment.283 284 28510/8/2019 96 CAA Documentation Relevant documentation for each triggered CAA describes: causes and contributing factors; The nature of the issue or condition (may include presence or lack of objective data and subjective complaints). In other words, what exactly is the issue/problem for this resident and why is it a problem; Complications affecting or caused by the care area for this resident; Risk factors related to the presence of the condition that affects the staff's decision to proceed to care planning; Factors that must be considered in developing individualized care plan interventions, including the decision to care plan or not to care plan various findings for the individual resident; The need for additional evaluation by the attending physician and other health professionals, as appropriate; The resource(s), or assessment tool(s) used for decision-making, and conclusions that arose from performing the CAA; Completion of Section V (CAA Summary; see Chapter 3 for coding instructions) of the MDS. CAA Documentation Written documentation of the CAA findings and decision making process may appear anywhere in a resident's record; In discipline-specific flow sheets, progress notes, the care plan summary notes, CAA summary narrative, etc. Nursing homes should use a format that provides the information as outlined in this manual and the State Operations Manual (SOM). CAA Documentation If it is not clear that a facility's documentation provides this information, Surveyors may ask facility staff to provide such evidence.286 287 28810/8/2019 97 CAA Documentation Use the \"Location and Date of CAA Documentation\" column on the CAA Summary (Section V of the MDS 3.0) to note where the CAA information and decision making documentation can be found in the resident's record. Also indicate in the column \"Care Planning Decision\" whether the triggered care area is addressed in the care plan. CAA Documentation RAI does not constitute the entire assessment that may be needed to address issues and manage the care of individual residents. Thus, it can potentially be misleading or problematic to care plan individual MDS findings or CAAs without any additional thought or investigation. The MDS may not trigger every relevant issue Not all triggers are clinically significant The MDS is not a diagnostic tool or treatment selection guide The MDS does not identify causation or history of problems 4.9 Using the Care Area Assessment (CAA) Resources Step 1: Identification of Triggered CAAs After completing the MDS, identify triggered care areas Generally, software vendors use these test files to test their systems, but the nursing home is responsible for ensuring that the software is triggering correctly. To identify the triggered CAAs manually using the CAT logic tables in section 4.10 Please note: Because MDS 3.0 trigger logic is complex, please refer to the CAT Logic tables within each CAA description (Section 4.10) for detailed information on triggers.289 290 29110/8/2019 98 4.9 Using the Care Area Assessment (CAA) Resources Step 2: Analysis of Triggered CAAs Using the results of the assessment can help the interdisciplinary team (IDT) and the resident and/or resident's representative to identify areas of concern that: Warrant intervention; Affect the resident's capacity to help identify and implement interventions to improve, stabilize, or maintain current level of function to the extent possible, based upon the resident's condition and choices and preferences for interventions; Can help to minimize the onset or progression of impairments and disabilities; and Can help to address the need and desire for other specialized services (e.g. palliative care, including symptom relief and pain management). 4.9 Using the Care Area Assessment (CAA) Resources Steps 3 and 4: Decision Making and CAA Documentation Key components of the care plan may include, but are not limited to the following: Resident goals and preferences Measurable objective with established timeframes Specific interventions, including those that address common causes of multiple issues Additional follow-up and clarification Items needing additional assessment, testing, and review with the practitioner Items that may require additional monitoring but do not require other interventions The resident's preference and potential for future discharge and discharge plan Case Study Mrs. R Case Study Handout 292 293 29410/8/2019 99 4.9 Using the Care Area Assessment (CAA) Resources Communication CAT Logic Table Triggering Conditions (any of the following): 1. Hearing item has a value of 1 through 3 indicating hearing problems on the current assessment as indicated by: B0200 >= 1 AND B0200 <= 3 4.9 Using the Care Area Assessment (CAA) Resources The information gleaned from the assessment should be used to evaluate the characteristics of the problematic issue/condition and the underlying cause(s), the success of any attempted remedial actions, the person's ability to compensate with nonverbal strategies (e.g., the ability to visually follow non-verbal signs and signals), and the willingness and ability of caregivers to ensure effective communication. The assessment should also help to identify any related possible contributing and/or risk factors. The next step is to develop an individualized care plan based directly on these conclusions. The focus of the care plan should be to address any underlying issues/conditions and causes, as well as verbal and nonverbal strategies, in order to help the resident improve quality of life, health, and safety. In the presence of reduced language skills, both caregivers and the resident can strive to expand their nonverbal communication skills, for example, touch, facial expressions, eye contact, hand movements, tone of voice, and posture. 4.9 Using the Care Area Assessment (CAA) Resources ADL Functional/Rehabilitation Potential CAT Logic Table Triggering Conditions (any of the following): 1.

Urinary incontinence has a value of 1 through 3 as indicated by: H0300 >= 1 AND H0300 <= 3 4.9 Using the Care Area Assessment (CAA) Resources Successful management will depend on accurately identifying the underlying cause(s) of the incontinence or the reason for the indwelling catheter. Some of the causes can be successfully treated to reduce or eliminate incontinence episodes or the reason for catheter use. Even when incontinence cannot be reduced or resolved, effective incontinence management strategies can prevent complications related to incontinence. Because of the risk of substantial complications with the use of indwelling urinary catheters, they should be used for appropriate indications and when no other viable options exist. The assessment should include consideration of the risks and benefits of an indwelling (suprapubic or urethral) catheter, the potential for removal of the catheter, and consideration of complications resulting from the use of an indwelling catheter (e.g., urethral erosion, pain, discomfort, and bleeding). The next step is to develop an individualized care plan based directly on these conclusions. 4.9 Using the Care Area Assessment (CAA) Resources Psychosocial Well-Being CAT Logic Table Triggering Conditions (any of the following): 1.
