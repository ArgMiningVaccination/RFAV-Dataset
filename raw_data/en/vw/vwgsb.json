Groundbreaking for the campus occurred two years later, and during the following year, Ogeech ee Tech began offering its first credit program, Practical Nursing, with 25 students enrolled. Ogeechee Tech assumed the responsibility for offering Adult Literacy programs and administering the General Equivalency Diploma (GED) examination in 1989. Faculty and staff moved into the new 75,000 square foot, $6 million state-of-the-art facility Fall term of 1990, and additional program offerings began Spring Semester 1991. Ogeechee Tech graduated its first class of nine Practical Nursing students in December of 1990. The opening of Ogeechee coin cided with the expansive growth of Georgia Southern University and the Statesboro area. In addition, the estab lishment of the Georgia State Lottery funded Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE) financial aid program in 1993 was a contributing factor in the unprecedented growth of Ogeechee Tech. Ogeechee Tech experienced a $5.5 million expansion by adding three buildings\u2014a Health Sciences Building, a Child Enrichment Center, and a Horticulture Building in 1999. During this time, Ogeechee Tech also increased its services through the opening of the Screven County Learning Center in Sylvania. Ogeechee Tech offered its first Associate of Applied Technology (AAT) degree program in Industrial Manufacturing Technology Winter Semester 2000, with eight students enrolled, and in the following academic year offered AAT degrees in Accounting, Computer Information Systems, Early Childhood Care and Education, Funeral Service Education, Health Information Technology, Healthcare Management Technology, Marketing Management, Opticianry, and Secretarial Science. House Bill 1187, known as the A + Education Reform Act, enacted in 2000, changed the names of technical institutes in Georgia to technical colleges. On July 6th of that year, Ogeechee Technical Institute officially became Ogeechee Technical College. Ogeechee Tech awarded its first AAT degree in December 2000 in Early Childhood Care and Education. During the summer of 2002, Ogeechee Tech opened the Evans County Learning Center. Student growth continued at Og eechee Tech due largely to the addition of new programs, many of which are unique to DTAE, the state, and the region. These distinctive programs included certificate, diploma, and degrees in technical areas such as Funeral Service Education, Forensic Science Technology, and Opticianry. With the opening of the Occupational Studies Building in Fall 2003, a wider variety of programs, such as Agribusiness, Wildlife and Plantation Management, Geographical Information Systems Technology, Veterinary Technology, Culinary Arts, and Hotel, Restaurant and Tourism Management, enabled the college to further expand its offerings. In 2004, Ogeechee Tech paid tribute to the late Senator Joseph E. Kennedy for his role in the establishment of Ogeechee Technical Institute by dedicating the main building on campus as the Joseph E. Kennedy Building. On May 13, 2008, Governor Sonny Perdue signed legislation that officially changed the name of the Department of Technical and Adult Education. Effective July 1, 2008, the system became known as the T echnical College System of Georgia. Governor Perdue also served as the keynote speaker for the 2008 Spring Commence ment at Ogeechee Technical College. Shortly thereafter, Laura \"Molly\" Bickerton, a student in the College's Radiologic Technology program, was selected as Georgia's technical college Student of the Year in the 37th annual Georgia Occupational Award of Leadership (GOAL) competition. In July of 2008, Ogeechee Technical College was awarded a regional law enforcement academy. The project, which involves five other technical colleges, allows new law enforcement officers to receiv e their basic law enforcement training at a state technical colle ge and obtain college credit at the same time. In an effort to continually grow and expand, in August of 2008, Ogeechee Technical College began construction of the Evans Technical Education complex in Hagan, Georgia. Ogeechee Tech was established to develop the existing and future workforce needs of the communities of Bulloch, Evans, Screven, and surrounding counties. As a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia, Ogeechee Tech continues to exist as a key player in the economic development of these communities. Mission Statement Ogeechee Technical College (OTC), a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia, is a public institution of higher education that contributes to the economic, educational, and community development of its three-county service area of Bulloch, Evans, and Screven counties. OTC provides technical education programs at the associate degree, diploma, and certificate le vels utilizing traditional and distance education methodologie s; student support services; adult literacy education; continuing education; and customized business and industry workforce training to the citizens of the communities it serves. Vision Statement Ogeechee Technical College will serve as a catalyst for economic prosperity in the region by providing a student-9 centered environment to prepare lifelong learners to succeed in a global society.

ADMISSIONS Eligible Applicants Any individual 16 years of age or older who seeks access to quality instruction designed to develop or improve occupational competencies is eligible for admission. The President may waive the \"16 years of age\" requirement for secondary students who are participating in an articulated program of study. Required Academic Criteria A GED or high school diploma (verified by an official transcript including graduation date and diploma type) will be required for admission to Ogeechee Technical College unless otherwise specified by the program's standards. Certificates of Attendance or special education diplomas are not recognized for admission purposes. Students with diplomas from secondary schools located outside the United States must have their transcripts evaluated for equivalency by an approved outside evaluation organization (suggested agencies are available through the Admissions Office). Applicants who have successfully completed (C or better) a minimum of 30 semester or 45 quarter hours at the degree level may submit official transcripts from all previously attended colleges accredited by an accepted accrediting agency in lieu of a GED or high school diploma. In order to be accepted by Ogeechee Technical College, the applicant must have been awarded a high school diploma from a secondary school that is accredited by a regional accrediting agency such as the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School Improvement, the Georgia Accrediting Commission, the Georgia Association of Christian Schools, the Association of Christian Schools International, the Georgia Private School Accreditation Council, the Accrediting Commission for Independent Study, the Southern Association of Independent Schools, the Florida Council of Independent Schools and the Distance Education Training Council; or from a public school regulated by a school system and state department of education. Applicants of home schools who did not attend a recognized accredited progr am must adhere to the following alternative path for admission: Submit a letter from the local superintendent's office verifying that the parent or legal guardian notified the superintendent of intent to home school and must also verify that the parent or legal guardian submitted the required attendance reports to the superintendent's office on a monthly basis as required by O.C.G.A. 20-2-690. Annual progress reports or final transcript for the equivalent of the home-schooled student's junior and senior years is required. The final progress report should include the graduation date. The President may waive the GED/high school diploma requirement for those secondary students or those pursuing a GED who are otherwise eligib le to enroll in a specific program of study. Assessment The ability of a student to succeed in a program at Ogeechee Technical College is greatly determined by the math and language skills possessed by that student. Ogeechee Tech is committed to assisting each student to achieve at their maximum potential. All students applying for diploma, degree, and certificate programs must be assessed prior to acceptance to a program of study. Students will then be admitted in accordance with the academic standards applicab le to that program. Ogeechee Tech utilizes COMP ASS or ASSET, the TCSG- approved assessment instruments, when evaluating students for program readiness. However, in the place of COMPASS or ASSET, Ogeechee Tech may accept a student's official entrance scor e on a validated assessment instrument (such as SAT, ACT), or Georgia High School Graduation Test in English/Language Arts if the scores meet the college program's required minimums. If a student's SAT, ACT, or Georgia High School Graduation Test in English/Language Arts scores do not meet the college's program minimums for regular admission, a student must be assessed using one of the TCSG-approved instruments. Assessment results will be valid for placement purposes for a period of 60 months and are transferable to any TCSG college. Official transcripts from a regionally or nationally accredited postsecondary instit ution recognized by the United States Department of Education documenting equivalent program-level English and math coursework successfully completed (C or better) may be used in lieu of completing the corresponding portion of the TCSG- approved assessment instrument. Admissions Categories Minimum admissions requirements are established for each program. Students shall be admitted to Ogeechee Technical College in one of the following categor ies: Regular, Provisional, Learning Support, Sp ecial, or Transient. Regular Status Students who meet all requirements for admission into a selected program and are eligible to take all courses in the program curriculum are grante d Regular admission status. Any change in the credential being sought shall require a student to meet the admission requirements of the new credential. Provisional Status Students who do not meet all requirements for Regular admission into a selected progr am are granted Provisional 12 admission status. Provisionally admitted students may take learning support classes and certain specified occupational courses as long as class pre- and co-requisites are satisfied. All certificate, diploma, an d associate degree program students initially admitted on a provisional basis must have satisfactorily completed the necessary prerequisite and learning support coursework in order to progress through the State Standard Curriculum. Learning Support Status Applicants who score below the provisional cut scores in English, math, or reading are granted Learning Support status or referred to Adult Education. Students with Learning Support status may not take occupational courses until achieving Provisional status. Students with this status are not eligible for federal financial aid (i.e. Pell, SEOG, or Federal Work Study). Special Admit Status (Non-credential seeking) Applicants who wish to take credit coursework but are not seeking a certificate, diploma, or associate degree are granted Special Admit status . The following specifics define the parameters of this status: May apply up to a maximum of 25 credit hours into a specific program for credential seeking purposes after achieving regular admit status. The hours taken as a special admit student in no way waives the requirements of the regular admission process. May enroll in classes only on a space-available basis.

Readmission for Competitive Admission Programs A student who leaves the College in good standing may apply for readmission as early as the next academic semester. This should be done through the Admissions Office. Students who have been dismissed because of unsatisfactory academic progress may be readmitted after one semester of absence from the College. A student suspended for disciplinary reasons may be considered for readmission at th e end of the suspension by making an appointment with the Vice President for Student Affairs. Readmission to a program will be granted on a space- available basis within the ap propriate course sequence. A student will be required to complete the curriculum requirements in place at the time of re-enrollment. Also, some programs have specific readmission guidelines. Visit the individual program description in the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook for specific program readmission procedures. Advanced Placement Admission of Transfer Students Applicants to Ogeechee Technical College (OTC) who have been previously enrolled at a postsecondary institution will be considered for admission under the following policies: Applicants who are in good standing at their previous institution may be accepted in good standing; and Applicants who are on academic probation at their previous institution may be accepted on academic probation. Applicants who wish to transfer to OTC must meet the entrance requirements and follow the guidelines listed in the \"Program Requirement s/Admission Procedures\" section of the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook . Applicants to OTC who have been previously enrolled at a postsecondary institution and desire entrance into one of the competitive admission programs (Echocardiography, Practical Nursing, Diagnos tic Medical Sonography, or Radiologic Technology) mu st meet certain specific requirements listed in the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook . Students may be eligible for advanced placement through two methods: transfer cr edit and exemption credit. Transfer Credit Ogeechee Technical College recognizes previous postsecondary coursework by accepting credits earned from other regionally or na tionally accredited institutions that are applicable to the st udent's program of study. OTC requires all transfer cred its within associate level coursework to be taken at regionally accredited institutions that are part of the Commission on Colleges. If needed, a Faculty Credential check will be conducted prior to awarding credit. Credit for courses at an institution accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the Technical College System of Georgia and whose entrance requirements and curriculum are equivalent to or greater than those of OTC will be considered fo r award of tr ansfer credit. Credit may be granted for formal military schools, training and correspondence courses in ac cordance with the American Council on Education. A student who presents credit for evaluation and transfer must be aware that the awarding of credit does not guarantee that institutions subsequently attended by the student will accept those credits. Due to the rapid changes in technology and technical information, program-specific technical courses will be considered for transfer cred it in a program only if the coursework has been completed within the past five years. Technical courses that were taken five years prior to admission to OTC will be evaluated for technical currency for course content by the program faculty. A student desiring consideration of cred it for technical courses or experiences that are more than five years old can request transfer by exemption testing. Transfer credit will be consid ered without restriction of completion dates for those courses in academic disciplines. Examples of these courses include, but are not limited to, English, psychology, mathematics, physical sciences, natural sciences, and social sciences. A student may receive credit for courses taken at another postsecondary institution if: The course taken is essentially the same equivalent course content as the course taken at OTC; The course taken has the same number of credit hours (or greater) as the course taken at OTC; An official transcript is on file in the student's admission file from all postsecondary institutions attended; and 16 A grade of \"C\" or higher has been earned for the course to be transferred. A grade of \"TRA\", \"TRB\", or \"TRC\" will be entered on the permanent record if credit is awarded. The third letter indicates the grade earned in the course; however, this grade will not be counted in the cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA). For competitive admissions pr ograms, grades for credit earned as transfer credit will be evaluated for GPA and calculated into the GPA under consideration for program admission. A student who has attended a previous college and is eligible for transfer of credit for English and math is not required to take the COMPASS placement exam. However, if the student for an y reason takes the exam and scores indicate the need for a Learning Support class, the student forfeits evaluation of his/her transcript, and the scores on the exam will determ ine placement, except in the case of a competitive admission program. Transient Courses A transient student is a student who is currently enrolled at one postsecondary institution seeking to take classes at another postsecondary institution. At OTC, students must obtain permission from their program advisor before applying as a transient student to other postsecondary institutions. To ensure coursework and learning outcomes are at the collegiate level, OTC requires that associate degree level educational coursework taken as a transient student be taken at a regionally accredite d institution. However, if students cannot find the associ ate degree course offered at a regionally accredited college, they must request a \"Faculty Credentials Form\" be sent from the Registrar's office at OTC to the Registrar of the non-regionally accredited host institution. Grading procedures for transien t students are the same as for traditional students. Theref ore, the transient student's grade will be sent from the host school to OTC (home school) for recording of the grade upon completion of the course. The grade becomes a part of the student's permanent record. The hours will be computed in the grade point average and will appear on the student's transcript. Military Training Credit Credit may be awarded for training received in the Armed Forces. The training should be certified by the Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services published by the American Council on Education or by the official catalog of the Community College of the Air Force or some similar document. Credit should be given when training experience meets required competencies of courses offered at the institution. Foreign Earned Credit Credit may be awarded based upon an evaluation performed by an independent evaluation service. The Registrar will make the final decision regarding the award of transfer credit. Grade po ints will not be assigned to transfer credit. Institutional Exemption Exam A student may receive credit for courses by passing an exemption examination only if the student has never attempted the course nor made a grade of D or F in an equivalent course at OTC or another postsecondary institution. A student cannot withdraw from a course and register to take an exemption examination within the same semester nor can a student take an exemption examination if he/she is currently regist ered for the course. Students wishing to pursue credit by examination must: Be admitted and enrolled in a program of study at Ogeechee Technical College; Be able to present evidence which would indicate that the student has the education, training, or work experience similar to that given in a course being challenged, and not a faculty member from his/her program; Complete the Application for Credit by Examination form, and obtain approval from the student's academic adviso r and the instructor responsible for administering the exam, the Academic Dean, and the Vice President for Academic Affairs; Take the application to the Business Office in Building 600 (JEK Annex) and pay the TCSG approved non-refundable f ee for the examination; Present the application and a receipt of payment to the instructor responsi ble for administering the examination; and Earn a score of at least a \"C\". For competitive admissions programs, grades for credit earned by exemption exam will be evaluated for GPA and calculated into the GPA under consideration for program admission. The examination will be taken during the week of final examinations unless otherwise approved on a case-by-case basis by the appropriate Dean for Academic Affairs. A grade of \"EX\" will be entered on the permanent record if the exemption exam is successf ully completed. The hours for the exempted grades will not be computed in the grade point average. Exemption exams may be taken twice and must be a course or an elective in the student's program of study. NOTE: Academic Affairs determines which courses are available for course exemption and a listing of courses eligible for exemption examinations is available upon request. Secondary School Articulation Ogeechee Technical College is required to establish articulation agreements with interested area high schools to ensure that students receive course credit when established competencies have been achieved. Formal Articulation Agreement - Ogeechee Tech is required to develop formal written agreements with interested area high schools that give credit based on competencies achieved in selected courses. All Articulation Agreements are developed by advisory 17 committees with members from both secondary programs and College programs to develop articulation agreements. Validation of Credit - Ogeec hee Tech must validate student competencies before aw arding articulated credit for competencies learned in high school by administering the final examination/exemption examination for the course to be articulated. No fee shall be charged to students taking an exam to validate articulat ed credit from high school. Transferability of Credit - Og eechee Tech will honor local articulation agreements statewide when students move from one area of the state to another and will validate the credit by administering the final examination/exemption examination for the course being transferred. Local articulation agreements shall determine the length of time students have to use articulated credit processes. Articulated credit awarded will be indicated on transcript/permanent records by use of the letters \"AC\". Residence Requirements for Degree/Diploma Ogeechee Technical College re quires that a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the coursework of a particular program of study be completed at Ogeechee Tech to be granted an award. 18 CAMPUS SAFETY AND SECURITY Campus Security It is the obligation of the College to ensure orderly operation, to protect the rights of all members of the College community, to prohibit acts which materially and substantially interfere with legitimate educational objectives or interfere with the rights of others, and to enforce College disciplinary action where conduct adversely affects the College's pursuit of its educational objectives.

Satisfactory Academ ic Progress (SAP) To be eligible to receive Student Financial Aid (SFA) funds (PELL, SEOG, FWS, HOPE); students must maintain satisfactory aca demic progress. Ogeechee Technical College (OTC) is required by the U.S. Department of Education to establish minimum standards of satisfactory academic progre ss. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) means the st udent is proceeding in a positive manner toward fulfilling educational requirements. Students attending OTC must be in good academic standing and making satisfactory progress. OTC uses the following standards to monito r student's progress toward their diploma, degree, or certificate: Grade Point Average Students must maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.0 to remain in good standing. A student's GPA will be mon itored at the end of each semester. A student whose cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0 is placed on financial aid warning for the next semester of attendance. This will allow the student one semester to increase the cumulative GPA to the satisfactory level. If, after one semester, the GPA remains below 2.0, the student will lose financial aid eligib ility (placed on financial aid suspension). Students may receive financial aid while on warning. The student will not receive financial aid while on suspension . Maximum Time Frame There are a maximum number of hours that students may attempt in pursuing their program of study. All students must complete their educational objective within a maximum time frame of one and one half (150 percent) times the length of the program in which they are enrolled. This means that once a student has attempted one and one half times the minimum number of credit hours necessary for completing program requirements, the student is ineligible to receive financial aid. Completion Rate In order for students to graduate within this maximum \"time frame\" of hours, at the end of each semester they are expected to have cumulatively completed at least 66.6% of their credit hours attempted. A student who at the end of 22 any semester has not successfu lly completed 66.6% of his cumulative hours attempted will be placed on financial aid warning for their next semester of attendance. This will allow the student one semester to increase the cumulative completion rate to the satisfactory level. If, after one semester, the cumulative completion rate remains below 66.6%, the student will lose fi nancial aid eligibility (placed on financial aid suspension). Students may receive financial aid while on warning. The student will not receive financial aid while on suspension. Grades The following grades are calculated in the completion rate but do not count toward successful completion: IP, I , W, WP, F, or WF. Repeat courses will be considered as any other class and both grades will be counted in both the GPA and completion rate. A grade of A*, B*, C*, or D* (*learning support grades are not counted in GPA, but are in completion) will be consid ered satisfactory completion of a learning support course. A grade of F* will be considered unsatisf actory. Grades received for learning support courses are not calcu lated in the GPA, but the hours are calculated in the 66.6% cumulative completion rate. Transfer Students Transfer students accepted by OTC but not previously enrolled at OTC will be classified as maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progre ss for the first semester enrolled. Only classes transferred in will be used in the completion rate calculation. At the end of the first semester, the student's grades will be measured in accordance with the College's Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements. Students who previously attended OTC, transferred to another school, and then returned to OTC, will have all OTC cour ses and course s transferred from other institutions calculated in the cumulative completion rate. Warning/Suspension If a student fails to meet the cumulative GPA, cumulative completion rate, or the maximum time frame standards at the end of a semester, the student will be placed on Financial Aid Warning. The student will continue to receive financial aid while on financial aid warning. However, if the student does not meet the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards by the end of the warning period, he/she will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. The student can continue taking courses while on financial aid suspension at the student's expense. Appeal of Financial Aid Suspension Students have the right to appeal their suspension of financial aid if they have mitigating circumstances that prevented them from making satisfactory academic progress. A student wishing to appeal financial aid suspension must do so in writing with supportive documentation and is only allowed three appeals. The form may be obtained from the Financial Aid Office or the financial aid website. The SAP Appeal form must be submitted at the Financial Aid Appeals Briefing. Dates and times of all Financial Aid Briefings are posted in the Financial Aid Office and on the OTC website. The SAP Appeals Reviewer will review the appeals. The SAP Appeals Reviewer will notify the student of the decision. The Reviewer's decision is final. Appeal Outcomes Students will receive one of three decisions when they appeal: 1. Denial - Students whose appeals are denied remain on suspension and will have to pay for their classes. 2. Probation OT - Students whose appeals are approved will have their financial aid reinstated for one semester. Students must meet SAP at the end of the next semester of enrollment. 3. Probation AP - Students whose appeals are approved will have their financial aid reinstated for three semesters. These students must meet SAP within three semest ers and complete an academic plan. 23 FEES AND EXPENSES Fee Categories Fees are categorized as application fees, tuition fees, registration fees, etc. Tuition is assessed according to policies for postsecondary education as set by the Technical College System of Georgia.

Academic Misconduct Academic misconduct is an y act that does or could improperly distort students' grades or other student academic records. A student en rolls at Ogeechee Technical College to gain technical skills to lead to greater employability. Academic misconduct is not only \"cheating\" the student of learning the needed skills; it is an offense to the academic integrity of the learning environment. All forms of academic dishonesty will call for discipline. Procedure for Academic Misconduct The procedure for dealing wi th academic misconduct and dishonesty is as follows: First Offense Student will be assigned a grade of \"0\" for the test or assignment. Instructor keeps r ecord in course/program files and notes as first offense. Student's program advisor will also be notified. Second Offense Student is given a grade of \"WF\" for the course in which offense occurs. Instructor submits name to Office of Student Affairs indicating a \"WF\" has been issued as a result of second offense. Student's program advisor will also be notified. Third Offense Student is given a grade of \"WF\" for the course in which the offense occurs. Instructor submits student's name to 33 Office of Student Affairs indicating a \"WF\" has been issued and is student's third offense. Student Affairs would note it as third offense and schedule a judicial hearing following the guidelines in Article IV: Judicial Policies in the Catalog and Student Handbook. Article IV: Judicial Policies Charges and Hearings Any member of the Technical College community may file charges against any student for misconduct. Charges shall be prepared in writing and directed to the Judicial Advisor responsible for the administration of the Technical College judici al system. Any charge should be submitted as soon as possible after the event takes place, preferably within ten (10) business days. The Judicial Advisor may conduct an investigation to determine if the charges have merit and/or if they can be disposed of administratively by mutual consent of the parties involved on a basis acceptable to the Judicial Advisor. Such disposition shall be final, and there shall be no subsequent proceedings. If the charges cannot be disposed of by mutual consent, the Judicial Advisor may later serve in the same matter as the judicial body or a member thereof. At the accused student's discretion, a hearing shall be held before either the Judicial Advisor or the Judicial Body (Technical College Student Discipline Committee). All charges shall be presented to the accused student in written form. A time shall be set for a hearing, not less than five nor more than fifteen (15) business days after the student has been notified. Maximum time limits for scheduling of hearings may be extended at the discretion of the Judicial Advisor. Hearings shall be conducted by the Judicial Advisor or Judicial Body according to the following guidelines: Hearings normally shall be conducted in private; Admission of any person to the hearing shall be at the discretion of the judicial body and/or its Judicial Advisor; In hearings involving more than one accused student, the Chair of the judicial body may permit the hearings concerning each student to be conducted separately; The complainant and the accused have the right to be assisted by any advisor they choose, at their own expense. The advisor may be an attorney. The complainant and/or the accused is responsible for presenting his/her own case and, therefore, advisors are not permitted to speak nor to participate directly in any hearing before a judicial body; The complainant, the accused and the judicial body shall have the privilege of presenting witnesses, subject to the right of cross examination by the judicial body; Pertinent records, exhibits and written statements may be accepted as evidence for consideration by a judicial body at the discretion of the Chair; All procedural questions are subject to the final decision of the Chair of the judicial body; After the hearing, the judicial body shall determine (by majority vote if the judicial body consists of more than one person) whether the student has violated each section of the Student Code which the student is charged with violating; The judicial body's determination shall be made on the basis of whether it is more likely than not that the accused student violated the Student Code except in those instances where the student faces suspension or expulsion, in which case the standard of proof shall be by clear and convincing evidence. There shall be a single ve rbatim record, such as a tape recording, of all hearings before a judicial body. The record shall be the property of the Technical College. Except in the case of a student charged with failing to obey the summons of a judicial body or Technical College official, no student may be found to have violated the Student Code solely because the student failed to appear before a judicial body. In all cases, the evidence in support of the charges shall be presented and considered. Sanctions The following sanctions may be imposed upon any student found to have violated the Student Code: Warning: A notice in writing to the student that the student is violating or has violated institutional regulations. Probation: A written reprimand for violation of specified regulations. Probation is for a designated period of time and includes the probability of more severe disciplinary sanctions if the student is found to be violating any institutional regulation(s) during the probationary period. Loss of privileges: Denial of specified privileges for a designated period of time. Fines: Previously established and published fines may be imposed. 34 Restitution: Compensation for loss, damage, or injury.

Technical College Suspension: Separation of the student from the Technical College for a stated period of time, after which the student is eligible to return. Conditions for readmission may be specified. Technical College Expulsion: Permanent separation of the student from the Technical College. This may also mean expulsion from a particular program at the Technical College. More than one of the sanctions listed above may be imposed for any single violation. Other than Technical College suspension or expulsion, disciplinary sanctions shall not be made part of the student's permanent academic record, maintained by the Office of Admissions and Records, but shall become part of the student's confidential record, maintained by the Vice President for Student Affairs. Upon graduation, the student's confidential record may be expunged of disciplinary actions, Technical College suspension, or Technical College expulsion, upon application to the Judicial Advisor. In addition to the penalties outlined above, groups or organizations may also face: Deactivation; Loss of all privileges, including Technical College recognition, for a specified period of time. In cases heard by the j udicial body (Technical College Student Discipline Committee) where the student or organization is found to have violated the Student Code, the judicial body may make recommendations to the Judicial Advisor but the Judicial Advisor shall determine and impose the sanctions. The Judicial Advisor is not bound by the sanctions recommended by members of the judicial body. The Judicial Advisor shall notify the st udent(s) in writing of his/her final decision. In cases involving sanctions that include probation, suspension, or expulsion, the Judicial Advisor shall inform, by memorandum, the Offices of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Student Affairs. Interim Suspension In certain circumstances, the President or Vice President for Student Affairs may impose Technical College suspension prior to the hear ing before a judicial body. Interim suspension may be imposed only: a) to ensure the safety and well-being of members of the Technical College community or preservation of Technical College property; b) to ensure the student's own physical or emotional safety and well-being; or c) if the student poses a definite threat of disruption of or interference with the normal operations of the Technical College. During the interim suspension, students shall be denied access to the campus (including classes) and/or all other Technical College activities or privileges for which the student might otherwise be eligible, as the President, Vice President for Student Affairs or the Judicial Advisor (if not the Vice President for Student Affairs) may determine to be appropriate. The Offices of the Vice President for Academic Affairs shall be notified in writing of the interim suspension. Appeals A decision reached by the judicial body or a sanction imposed by the Judicial Advisor may be appealed by accused students or complainants to an appellate board within five (5) business days of the decision. Such appeals shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the Judicial Advisor or his or her designee. In cases where the Technical College is the complainant, the Technical College shall have no right of appeal. Except as required to explain the basis of new evidence, an appeal shall be limited to review of the verbatim record of the initial hearing and supporting documents for one or more of the following purposes: To determine whether the original hearing was conducted fairly in light of the charges and evidence presented, and in conformity with the prescribed procedures giving the complaining party a reasonable opportun ity to prepare and present evidence that the Student Code was violated, and giving the accused student a reasonable opportunity to prepare and to present a rebuttal of those allegations. To determine whether the decision reached regarding the accused student was based on substantial evidence, that is, whether the facts in the case were sufficient to establish that a violation of the Student Code occurred. To determine whether the sanction(s) imposed were appropriate for the violation of the Student Code that the student was found to have committed. 35 To consider new evidence, sufficient to alter a decision or other relevant facts not brought out in the original hearing, because the person appealing did not know such evidence and/or facts at the time of the original hearing. In considering an appeal, the Appellate Board may (a) uphold the appeal and reduce or suspend sanctions, (b) uphold the appeal and increase or impose sanctions, (c) dismiss the appeal and affirm the original sanction(s). The decision of the Appellate Board shall be final. Article V: Notification of Sanctions When imposition of any sanction includes restrictions on attendance in class or Technical College sponsored activities or programs, the Offices of Student Affairs, Academic Affairs, Admissions, and Registrar shall be notified by the Judicial Advisor in writing within five (5) business days.

POLICY: It is the policy of the Technical College System of Georgia to maintain a grievance process available to all students that provides an open and meaningful forum for their complaints, the resolution of these complaints, and is subject to clear guidelines. NOTE: The procedures in this section do not address complaints related to the unlawful harassment, discrimination and/or retaliation for reporting harassment/discrimination against students. Those complaints are addressed in the Student Grievances -- Unlawful Harassment and Discrimination of Students Procedure described below. II. APPLICABILITY: All technical colleges associated with the Technical College System of Georgia. III. RELATED AUTHORITY: Procedure: Unlawful Harassment and Discrimination of Students IV. DEFINITIONS: Grievable issues: Issues arising from the application of a policy/procedure to the student's specific case is always grievable. Specifically grievable are issues related to student advisement, improper disclosure of grades, unfair testing procedures and poor treatment of students; this is 40 a representative list and is not meant to be exhaustive. Non-grievable issues: Issues which have a separate process for resolution (i.e. disciplinary sanctions, FERPA, financial aid, academic grades, etc.) are not grievable, and a student must take advantage of the process in place. Business days: Weekdays that the college administrative offices are open. Vice President for Stud ent Affairs (VPSA): The staff member in charge of the student affairs division at the college. Retaliation: Unfavorable action taken, condition created, or other action taken by a student/employee for the purpose of intimidation directed toward a student because the student initiated a grievance or participated in an investigation of a grievance. Grievant: the student who is making the complaint. V. PROCEDURE: Informal Complaint Procedure: Student complaints should be resolved on an informal basis without the filing of a formal grievance. A student has 10 business days from the date of the incident being grieved to resolve their complaint informally by approaching their instructor, dean, or any other staff or faculty member directly involved in the grieved incident. Where this process does not result in a resolution of the grievance, the st udent may proceed to the formal grievance procedure. Formal Complaint Proced ure: where a student cannot resolve the complaint informally, the formal grievance procedure may be used. Within 15 business days of the incident being grieved, the student must file a formal grievance in the office of the Vi ce President for Student Affairs (VPSA) with the following information: Name, Date, Brief description of incident being grieved, Remedy requested, Signed, and Informal remedy attempted by student and outcome If the grievance is against the VPSA, the student shall file the grievance in the Office of the President. The VPSA, or his designee, will investigate the matter and supply a written response to the student within 15 business days. If the grieved incident involves possible unlawful harassment, discrimination, or retaliation for reporting unlawful harassment/discrimination, the investigation will be handled pursuant to the Procedure: Unlawful Harassment and Discrimination of Students Described in section VI. If the grieved incident is closely related to an incident being processed through the disciplinary procedure, the disciplinary procedure will take precedence, and the grievance will not be processed until after the disciplinary procedure has run its course. The VPSA, or his designee, shall be granted an additional 15 business days to investigate the grievance upon notice to the grieving student. Appeal of Staff Response: If a student is unsatisfied with the response from the VPSA, the student may appeal the decision to the President of the college. The college staff has no right to appeal. A student shall file a written appeal to the President within 5 business days of receiving the response. The appeal will be decided based entirely on documents provided by the student and the administration; therefore, the student must ensure that he has provided all relevant documents with his appeal. At the President of the Co llege's sole discretion, grievance appeals at the institution may be held in one of the following two ways: The President may review the information provided by the student and administration and make the final decision; or The President may appoint a cross-functional committee comprised of 5 members, including one chair, to make the final decision. The decision of eith er the President or the cross-functional committee shall be made within 10 business days of receipt by the President of the appeal. Whichever process is chosen by the President, the decision of the grievance appeal is final. Retaliation against a student for filing a grievance is strictly prohibited. VI. RECORD RETENTION: Documents relating to formal grievances including investigations, dispositions and the grievance itself shall be held for 5 years after the graduation of the student or the date of the student's last attendance.

A $45 non-refundable late fee will be assessed for any student who registers on the first day of class or after. This fee is not covered by financial aid. Registration for currently enrolled students is done via BannerWeb. A registration is not complete until tuition and fees are paid. Students who receive any type of financial aid must have that aid awarded before registration is confirmed. Students will be dropped from the courses for which they have attempted to register if tuition and fees are not paid before the stated course dr op date for each semester. Registration Errors It is the student's responsibility to complete the proper forms and procedures for registration or changes to registration and to verify that his/her schedule of classes is correct. The Registrar's Office cannot be held responsible for errors resulting from the student's failure to execute the proper procedure or verify his/her schedule at the time he/she registers. Course Load/Full-time Student Status A student's course load is th e total number of credit hours for the courses taken during the semester. A normal full- time load for a semester is 12 to 18 hours. A student must 46 be registered for a minimum of 12 semester credit hours to be considered a full-time student. Approval from the Vice President for Academic Affairs is required for a course load of more than 22 hours. Dropping/Adding Courses A student may add or drop courses during the Registration and Schedule change period. Tuition and fees for courses dropped after the first three da ys of each semester are not refundable. To add or drop a course, a student can, either complete a Drop/Add Course(s) Form and have it filled out by the instructor of the course (s) they wish to drop, or e- mail the instructor(s) and have them drop them via BannerWeb.

If the required make-up work is not completed by the last day of the following semester, the instructor will submit the Completion Form for Incomplete Grades with a grade of \"F\" fo r the course. When a student receives a grade of \"I\" in a co urse which is a prerequisite to other courses, the student must complete the required make-up work to determine the final grade and eligibility to enroll in subsequent courses. \"AU\" Audit/Warranty - Indicates that a course was audited. No credit is given. This is not computed into GPA. Exceptions to this policy include certain laboratory courses and supervised work experience. \"EX\" Exempted/Credit by Exam - The student received credit for a course by successfully completing a competency examination on the coursework. \"TRA\", \"TRB\", \"TRC\" Transfer Credit - The student transferred coursework to the College from another regionally or nationally accredited college. A student may transfer up to 75% of the total credits required for the program of study. The Regist rar may confer with academic deans or program instructors when determining appropriateness of transfer re quest but is responsible for final transfer credit approval. \"AC\" Articulated Credit - The student earned credit for coursework completed at the secondary level. Validation of Credit - Ogeechee Technical College must validate student competencies before awardi ng articulated credit for competencies learned in high school by administering the final examination/exemption examination for the course to be articulated. Learning Support - A grade with an asterisk following is a learning support grade and is not computed in a student's GPA. Grade Point Average Grade point averag e (GPA) is the numerical average computed by dividing total quality points (for each course, hours attempted multiplied by grade value) by total hours attempted each semester (see below). A cumulative GPA is calculated by dividing total quality points by total hours attempted at the College. For example: 25 Total Quality Points divided by 11 Hours attempted equals a GPA of 2.27. Class Code Hours Attempted Grade Grade Value Quality Points MATH 1013 3 A 4 12 ENGL 1010 3 B 3 9 COMP 1000 3 F 0 0 EMPL 1000 2 C 2 4 11 25 Work Ethics At Ogeechee Technical College, it is extremely important to encourage good work habits as an integral part of the instructional program. To achieve this, every credit course at Ogeechee Tech incorporates concepts of work ethics into the course curriculum. Desirable work traits are emphasized, including attendance, character, teamwork, appearance, attitude, productivity, organizational skills, communication, cooperation, and respect. As part of the evaluation process, the student receives a work ethics grade for each cour se. The work ethics grades are designed to evaluate an d encourage good work habits. Performance factors and indica tors include, but are not limited to, quality of work, ability to follow instructions, productivity, dependability, honesty, reliability, attendance and punctuality, attitude, integrity, enthusiasm, interpersonal skills, and initiative. Students receive a work ethics grade (3, 2, 1 or 0) each semester for each course in which they enroll. The work ethics grade does not affect the academic grade point average (GPA) of a student; work ethics grades remain separate from academic grades . Work Ethics grades are posted each semester to the student's transcript via BannerWeb. Work Ethics Descriptions: Exceeds Expectations: 3 Meets Expectations: 2 Needs Improvement: 1 Unacceptable: 0 Grade Reports Final grades are recorded by in structors. Official grades are posted to the student's transcript via BannerWeb. Academic Appeals Ogeechee Technical College faculty and administrative staff have the right and responsibility to exercise professional judgment in making decisions about student performance and progress. The College is accountable for setting and maintaining standards of academic performance and is committed to ensuring students are treated fairly in regard to all matters that relate to academic performance and progress. A student will be provided with a fair opportunity to have decisions that are believed by the student to negatively impact academic performance and 48 progress reviewed in accordance with policies and procedures established by the College. Informal If a student believes that a basis exists for appealing an academic decision regarding a grade which prevents progression in a program of study, that student should first attempt to resolve the matter informally through discussion with the instructor who made the decision. A student has five (5) working days to discuss the academic decision. If no reso lution can be reached within these five (5) working days, then the student will have another five (5) working days to discuss the concern with the Dean for Academic Affairs. The expectation is that the difference of opinion is to be resolved as closely as possible to the level at which it originated, and as quickly as is possible with careful review. It is only when a disagreement cannot be resolved through this informal process that a formal appeal of the academic decision should be made. A student may seek advice from a counselor for support and direction. Formal Once a decision has been made that the informal process has not resulted in resolution, formal procedures will begin. Written notification to the Dean for Academic Affairs must be made regarding the decision under question. The Dean for Ac ademic Affairs, upon completion of his/her review (course outline, documentation related to the student's progress, transcript, summary of events, etc.) may uphold, modify, or reverse the academic decision. The D ean for Academic Affairs will notify the student, the instructor, and the Registrar (if necessary) in writing of his/her decision with a rationale for the decision. If any party believes that the decision is not fair or reasonable, the decision may be appealed to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. This gives the opportunity to ensure that all necessary and relevant information, documentation, opinion, and argu ment are fairly presented. The decision of the Vice Presid ent for Academic Affairs is final. Repeating Courses By registering for a course for which the student has already received credit, a stude nt forfeits the previous credit in that course for graduation purposes. The student's official grade for graduation purposes in the course(s) will be the last one earned on repetition. Although all grades remain on the official academic record, only the final attempt will be calculated for the purpose of meeting graduation requirements. For graduation purposes, a student must have a graduation GPA of a 2.0 and a cumulative GPA of 2.0. A student who fails or who does not earn a passing grade as required for courses specified in the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook within two attempts will not be allowed to repeat that course for one year and will be allowed to retake a third time on a space- available basis only. Before retaking a course the third time, the student must complete any remediation assigned by the appropriate Dean for Academic Affairs. A student may request from the appropriate Dean an exemption to this requirement if the student feels that additional information should be considered. Academic Probation and Suspension Students must maintain a minimum of a 2.0 cumulative grade point average to be in satisfactory academic standing. Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below a 2.0 will be placed on academic probation for the next academic semester. A student is subject to suspension for one semester if the cumulative grade point average is less than a 2.0 during the semester enrolled on academic probation. Students will be advised and counseled as to academic defi ciencies and given official notification of academic probation/suspension status. Academic probation or suspension is indicated on the student's transcript via BannerWeb and recorded on the student's permanent academic record. Academic Transcript Request Process Students can receive an unofficial transcript via BannerWeb. The first official transcript for a student is provided free of charge. A fee of $5.00 will be charged for each additional official transc ript, which must be paid before the transcript is released. Transcripts will not be released externally without the student's written consent unless as directed by law to comply. (Transcripts will be released in compliance with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. However, every reasonable attempt will be made to notify the student in advance of the compliance.) An academic transcript will be issued within three (3) busine ss days of receiving a written request. The Academic Transcript Request form may be obtained in the Registrar's Office or on the Ogeechee Tech website using the BannerWeb electroni c request/signature. If the student is unable to come to the Registrar's Office or download the form, Ogeechee Technical College will accept written consent in the form of a letter (either mailed or faxed) from the student. Exemption Credit Credit by Exemption Examination Eligibility Ogeechee Tech provides the student an opportunity to receive credit for courses by successfully completing an exemption examination. Ogeechee Tech may allow students to exempt courses by demonstrating thorough mastery of written and/or performance tests that have been developed locally intended to adequately demonstrate achievement of the necessary competency level. A student attempting to earn credit by examination must be accepted and 49 enrolled in a program of study at Ogeechee Technical College. The course must be a course or elective in the student's program of study. The student cannot take an exemption examination if he/she is currently registered for the course. A student cannot withdraw from a course and register to take an exemption examination within the same semester. The student cannot take an exemption examination for a failed course or for a course in which a grade of D was received. An exemption examination can only be taken twice. The second testing will occur no sooner than 90 days following the original test. See the appropriate Dean for Academic Affairs for a listing of courses eligible for exemption examinations. Procedure for applying and taking the Exemption Examination The student will contact his/her advisor concerning the exemption examination. Upon approval, the student can pick up an Application for Credit by Examination form located in the Student Affairs Center. The student must take the application to the Business Office in the Kennedy Annex and pay 25% of the tuition for the course before taking the examination. The student will take the form and the receipt of payment to the appropriate Dean for Academic Affairs. The Dean will send to the administering instructor the exemption application. The administering instructor will contact the student to arrange a time for the exemption examination. The examination will generally be taken during the final week of a semester unless otherwise approved on a case-by- case basis by the appropriate Dean for Academic Affairs. The student must score at least a 70% on the examination to receive credit. When the exam has been completed, the instructor will grade the exam and forward the form to the Dean for Academic Affairs' office. The Dean will forward the results to the Registrar. The examination results, including the actual test, will be filed in the office of the Dean for Academic Affairs. Recording the grade A grade of \"EX\" will be entered on the permanent record if the exemption examination is successfully completed. The hours for the exempted courses will not be computed in the grade point average or appear on the semester grade report. Standardized Exam Credit: Credit may be awarded based on nationally normed exams including, but not limited to, the following: CLEP Credit will be awarded for successful completion of any appropriate CLEP (College Level Examination Program) subject area examina tions.

Full-time students carry 12 or more credit hours, three-quarter students carry ni ne to eleven credit hours, half-time students carry six to eight credit hours, and less than half-time students carry one to five credit hours. Withdrawals Withdrawing from a Course Since choosing to drop a course is a serious academic decision that may affect a student's progress towards a degree or a student's financial aid status, a student should consult with the in structor of the course, the academic advisor, and a financial aid advisor before making this decision. Withdrawing From the College If a student is considering withdrawing from the College, the student is strongly encouraged to discuss this with an advisor or a counselor before formalizing the decision to ensure that all alternatives are considered. In order to withdraw officially from the College, a student must complete an Application for Withdrawal form, available from the Counseling and Retention Coordinator. The effective date of withdrawal is the last date the student attended or the last date of academic activity. The impact withdrawal has on the stud ent's academic record is determined on a course-by-course basis. In certain cases, the Counselor or Registrar may act on behalf of the student in completing the withdrawal process. Typically, this would occur in cases involving death, serious injury or illness, or formal requests to do so. Failure to attend classes does not constitute an official withdrawal. Students who fail to continue attending class and who do not complete an Application for Withdrawal may be awarded a WF grade by the instructor. The instructor must still report the last date the student attended or the last date of academic activity to comply with the Federal Refund Policy. Graduation Requirements In order to be eligible for graduation, a degree, diploma, or certificate student must m eet all of the following requirements: Have completed all course and credit hours requirements as pres cribed in the state standard and/or outlined by each department, Have achieved regular admission status, Have a graduation GPA of a 2.0 for the program of study in which they are enrolled, Have a cumulative GPA of a 2.0, Have completed at least 25% of total semester credit hours at Ogeechee Technical College, Have satisfied all financial obligations to the College, Have completed an Application for Program of Study Completion form by the mid- semester of his/her final semester.
