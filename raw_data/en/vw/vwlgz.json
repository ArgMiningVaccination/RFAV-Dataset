If you're an empath, I know for a fact you've had days where you're in the company of someone who is feeling down, or depressed or anxious - and you notice that you start feeling down, depressed or anxious. Or, you walk into a crowded space and you feel overwhelmed by all of the energies around you. This meditation keeps you free of taking any of those outside energies as your own. This meditation does not make you become a brick wall to the people around you, it truly just allows you to be there, without altering your own state of being. You can still hold space for others, be in crowded spaces, be in unfortunate situations while maintaining your own state of peace. It's an incredibly powerful tool to have access to! Do this every morning, before encountering other people if you can, and you'll notice a shift in how you feel throughout the day. And if you ever forget to do it, you will definitely notice a difference in how you're feeling that day, compared to the days "}
