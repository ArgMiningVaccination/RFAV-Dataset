When patients maintain regular chiropractic adjustments, they find themselves enjoying improved health and wellness in as little as one visit. For those that are new to chiropractic, there is sometimes an adjustment period of a few days called toxic release. But what exactly is it and how can you manage the side effects? Toxic Release: What Is It? When the body is treated with a chiropractic adjustment, the toxins that were locked in it are released. This is a good thing, as the body is being cleansed and cured, but there are temporary side effects. Toxic release can impact how you feel for a few days, and you may feel cold or flu-like symptoms. Although the majority of our patients do not report symptoms of toxic release, know that if you do feel them, they won't last long! Toxic Release: Why Does It Happen? Chiropractic adjustments remove negative subluxations, also known as interferences, in the spine. Those dysfunctions disrupt communication between the brain in the body, and as they are treated, the body takes a short period of time to process its new and improved spinal function. Toxic release is sometimes a part of the adjustment process. Toxic Release: Is It Common? Toxic release isn't extremely common, as approximately 15-20% of chiropractic patients report symptoms. If you do happen to experience toxic release after your first visit, don't be encouraged. Know that your body is releasing toxins and as you continue treatment, that will no longer be an issue. With regular chiropractic care, your body will function optimally, meaning fewer toxins in the body. Toxic Release: What Are The Symptoms? Symptoms of toxic release can vary from person to person, but commonly include: Fatigue Headaches Cold- or flu-like symptoms Fever Night sweats Dizziness Nausea Diarrhea Tight muscles Remember, these symptoms will quickly improve, but if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to [contact us](https://www.stileschiropracticchicago.com/contact-us). Toxic Release: Manage Side Effects Here are our tips to manage the symptoms of toxic release: Get Rest - It is always important to get enough sleep, but particularly so after an adjustment. If you experience symptoms of toxic release, get plenty of rest over the next few days to help the symptoms run their course. Stay Hydrated - The body is made up of nearly 60% water, and hydration is key to flushing out toxins. A good rule to follow is to consume at least half your body weight in ounces of water per day. Exercise Regularly - You might not feel like staying active, but light exercise like walking and yoga can improve how you feel. Eat Healthy - Your diet is the foundation of a healthy lifestyle, and it is important to continue to make healthy choices. Try to avoid processed foods after an adjustment, and focus on well-rounded meals full of fruits and vegetables. Keep in mind that with chiropractic, consistency is key. Your health and wellness are well "}
