See \u00a7 225.1. FRA needs this information to effectively carry out its re gulatory and enforcement responsibilities under the Federal railroad safety statutes.2 FRA also uses this information for determining comparative trends of railroad safety and to develop h azard elimination and risk reduction programs that focus on preventing railroad injuries and accidents. 1 For brevity, further references in the Guide to sections in 49 CFR Part 225 will omit \"49 CFR\" and include only the section, e.g., \u00a7 225.9. 2 Title 49 U.S.C. chapters 51, 201-213. v Table of Contents Executive Summary ............................................................................................................. ........... 1 1.

The Accident Reports Act, as amended, requires, in part, that railroad carriers file with the Secretary of Tran sportation reports on \"all accidents and incidents resulting in injury or death to an individual or damage to equipment or a roadbed arising from the carrier's operations during the month\" (emphasis added). The Secretary of Transportation subsequently delegated the authority to carry out the Accident Reports Act to the Federal Railroad Administra tion (FRA). 49 U.S.C 103(c)(1 ); 49 CFR 1.49(c)(11). The accident/incident reporting regulations at 49 CFR Pa rt 225 were originally issued pursuant to the Accident Reports Act of 1910. Sixty years later, Congress enact ed the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970. Public Law No. 91- 458, recodified primarily at 49 U.S.C. chapter 201, with penalty provisions in 49 U.S.C. chapter 213, as amended. FRA's accident/incident re porting requirements, 49 CFR Part 225, are currently issued under the dual st atutory authority of the Accide nt Reports Act of 1910 and the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970. On December 29, 1970, Congress enact ed the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act). While the OSH Act gives the Secretary of Labor a broad, general authorit y to regulate working conditions that affect the occupational safety and health of employees, it also recognizes the existence of similar authority in other Federal ag encies. Section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act provides that the OSH Act shall not apply to working conditions to which another Federal agency exercises statutory authority to prescribe or enforce standa rds or regulations affecting occupational safety or health. The OSH Act also requires that the Secretary of Labor issue rules to develop and maintain an effective program of collection, compila tion, and analysis of occupational safety and health statistics. This data is compiled in a national database by the Department of Labor (DOL) and used to chart th e magnitude and nature of occupational injury and illness problems across the country. Because FRA exercises statutory authority to pres cribe and enforce standards and regulations for all areas of railroad safety under the Federa l Railroad Safety Act of 1970, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) jurisdiction may be preempted by FRA under section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act with regard to certain matters related to railroad safety. See Policy Statement asserting FRA jurisdiction over matters involving the safety of railroad operations, 43 FR 10584 (March 14, 1978). With respect to employee injury and illness recordkeeping, however, the O ccupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC) ruled that employee injury and illness recordkeeping does not come within the purview of section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act and, therefore, OSHA's jurisdiction has not been displaced by FRA's recordkeeping regulations. Secretary of Labor v. Conrail (OSHRC Docket No. 80-3495, 1982). Consequently, a railroad over which FRA exercises jurisdiction mu st comply with the employee injury and illness recordkeeping requirements promulgated by both FRA and OSHA. Nevertheless, because FRA's employee injury and illness recordkeeping/reporting requirements employ equivalent standards to those promulgated by OSHA, OSHA does not require railroad FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 2 Executive Summary carriers to maintain OSHA records in addition to FRA records. Rather, railroad carriers are only required to record and report employee injuries and illnesses to FRA in accordance with FRA's regulations. See 29 CFR \u00a7 1904.3. Consequently, FRA's accident/incident reporting re gulations that concern railroad occupational casualties should be maintained, to the extent pr acticable, in general c onformity with OSHA's recordkeeping and reporting regulations to perm it comparability of data on occupational casualties between various industries, to allow inte gration of railroad indu stry data into national statistical databases, and to impr ove the quality of data available for analysis of casualties in railroad accidents/incidents. FRA makes all employee injury and illness data available to OSHA for use in its complementary program of regulation and provides the data to the Bureau of Labor Statistics each year. In order to have a database that allows accura te comparison between industries, the rules that FRA uses must be modified whenever OSHA make s significant changes that affect the number and types of work-related deaths, injuries, and i llnesses for which records are to be maintained, and the manner in which these are to be classified. Such a change occurred for the first time (since OSHA's original reporting requirements were implemented in 1971) on January 1, 2002, when revised OSHA recordkeeping requirements became effective. In response, FRA amended its own accident/incident reporting rules, e ffective May 1, 2003, to conform with OSHA's amended rules in addition to making other miscellaneous amendments. FRA now finds it necessary to make appropriate ch anges to its regulations in response to issues identified by FRA in its administration of the current accident/incident recordkeeping and reporting program. Specifically, FRA is amending its accident/incident reporting regulations in order to: Better conform certain of the regulations' defi nitions to those set forth in 49 U.S.C. 20102, as amended. Require the reporting and recordi ng of certain suicide data. Require the reporting of longitude and latitude for trespasser casualties and reportable rail equipment accidents. Include a comprehensive list of acci dent/incident reporting exceptions. Allow for consolidated accident/incident reporting by integrated railroad systems. Add necessary definitions. Set system standards for the electronic rete ntion of accident/incident reporting records by railroads. Clarify ambiguous definiti ons and regulations. Update regulatory text, as applicable. Enhance the quality of information availa ble for railroad casualty analysis. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 3 Executive Summary Limit which highway-rail grade crossing fatal ities must be telephoni cally reported to the National Response Center (NRC). Amend the Telephonic Reporting Chart to conform to the regulatory text. Clarify and refine the requirements and cr iteria for using and retaining Form FRA F6180.107, \"Alternative Record fo r Illnesses Claimed to be Work-Related,\" and the alternative railroad-designed record. Eliminate the oath and notarization re quirements on Form FRA F6180.55, \"Railroad Injury and Illness Summary.\" Allow for the electronic submission of Form FRA F 6180.55, \"Railroad Injury and Illness Summary.\" Allow for submission of Fo rm FRA F 6180.55 and Form FRA F 6180.81 in .pdf or .jpg format. Set forth record retention requirements for certain accident/incident recordkeeping and reporting records not pr eviously addressed. Set forth requirements for electronic accident/incident recordkeeping systems. Update FRA's address information. Require railroads to try to obtain documentati on regarding: cause of death for trespassers and, in particular, suicides. Require railroads to obtain information about the nature and severity of highway-rail grade crossing casualties by contacting highway users in writing using the Form FRA F 6180.150, \"Highway User Injury Inquiry Form,\" and, if unsuccessful, by phone. Set forth the requirements for the Form FRA F 6180.150 and the accompanying cover letter (See sample cover letter contained in Appendix N). In addition to amending its regulations, FR A is revising the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports (FRA Guide), certai n accident/incident recordkeeping and reporting forms, and its companion guide: Guidelines for Submitting Accident/Incident Reports by Alternative Methods (Companion Guide).

FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 4 Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 1. Overview of Railroad Accident/I ncident Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements and Miscellaneous Provisions and Information 1.1 General This chapter provides an overview of FRA's accident/incident recordkeeping and reporting requirements. 1.1.1 Purpose of the FRA Guide for Prep aring Accident/Incident Reports The FRA Guide provides instructions and guidance associated with FRA's accident/incident recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The FR A Guide is a supplement to Part 225 and is not a replacement for the regulatory text. Fede ral railroad safety regulations at \u00a7 225.11 and \u00a7 225.21 require that each railroad subject to Part 225 complete reports and records of accidents/incidents in accordan ce with the current FRA Guide. 1.1.2 Applicability To determine if Part 225 applies to a railroad, in whole or in part, see \u00a7 225.3, \"Applicability.\" See also \"Extent Jurisdiction,\" Part 209, Appendix A, and \"Statement of Agency Policy Concerning Waivers Related to Shared Use Trackage or Rights-of- Way by Light Rail and Conventional Oper ations,\" Part 211, Appendix A. 1.1.3 Consolidated Reporting Under certain circumstances, a parent corpora tion with commonly controlled railroad carriers that operate as a single, seamless, integrated U. S. rail system, may be considered by FRA as a single railroad for purposes of Part 225 compliance. See \u00a7 225.6. 1.2 Major Recordkeeping and Report ing Requirements Under Part 225 There are many recordkeeping and reporting requir ements arising from Part 225. The following is a summarized listing of FRA's major reco rdkeeping and reporting requirements for all railroads subject to Part 225. Th is listing is a summary only a nd does not replace the regulatory text or requirements set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations. Narratives are included when supplemental information, requirements, or gui dance is warranted. 1.2.1 Telephonic Reporting Railroads must make immediate telephonic notifi cation of certain accidents/incidents. See \u00a7 225.9. For supplemental information, see Appendix M. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 5 Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements Additional Telephonic Reporting Requi rements Related to Accidents. There are four additional sections in chapter II of 49 CFR that require te lephonic reporting related to accidents. These sections are listed below fo r informational purposes. 49 CFR 229.17 - Railroad Locomotive Safety Standards; Accident reports . Under this section, in the case of an accident due to a failure from any cause of a locomotive or any part or appurtenance of a locomotive, or a person co ming in contact with an electrically energized part or appurtenance, which resu lts in serious injury (i.e., an injury that results in the amputation of any appendage, the loss of sight in an eye, bone fracture, or confinement in a hospital for a period of more than 24 consecutive hours) or death of one or more persons, the railroad operating the locomotive must immedi ately report the accident by toll-free telephone number: (800) 424-0201. 49 CFR 233.5 - Signal Systems Reporting Requirements ; Accidents resulting from signal failure. Under this section, a railroad must report to FRA within 24 hours, by toll-free telephone number: (800) 424-0201, whenever it learns of the occurrence of an accident/incident arising from the failure of an appliance, device, method, or system to function or indicate as required by Part 236 that results in a more favorable aspect than intended or other condition hazardous to the movement of a train. 49 CFR 234.7 - Grade Crossing Signal System Safety; Accidents involving grade crossing signal failure. Under this section, a railroad must report to FRA every impact between on- track railroad equipment and an automobile, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, farm vehicle, or pedestrian at a highway-rail grade crossing invo lving an activation failure. Notification shall be provided to the National Response Center within 24 hours of occurrence at: (800) 424- 0201. 49 CFR 219.209(a) - Control of Alcohol and Drug Use; Reports of tests and refusals. Under this section, a railroad that has expe rienced a qualifying accident/incident or other event for which specimens were obtained must provide immediate te lephonic notification summarizing such events to the National Res ponse Center at: ( 800) 424-8802 and to FRA's Office of Railroad Safety at: (202) 493-6313. 1.2.2 Annual Reports to FRA Railroads must submit to FRA an annual repo rt of employee hours worked and casualties by State on Form FRA F 6180.56. The report must be included with the railroad's monthly submission for December. See \u00a7 225.21(d). 1.2.3 Monthly Reports to FRA Railroads must submit to FRA m onthly reports of all reportable accidents/incidents. See \u00a7 225.11. The railroad's report must be submitted within 30 days following the month to which it applies. The report shall be made on the fo rms prescribed in \u00a7 225.21 in hardcopy or by means FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 6 Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements of optical media or electronic submission via the Internet in accordance with \u00a7 225.37, approved by FRA. The Form FRA F 6180.55 (Railroad Injury and I llness Summary) must be submitted each month, even if there were no reportable accidents/i ncidents during the mont h. Corresponding forms FRA F 6180.55a, FRA F 6180.54, FRA F 6180.81, and FR A F 6180.57 must also be completed and submitted for reportable accidents/incidents occurring during the report month. Monthly reports of accidents/incidents (which are being submitted as hardcopies) and related correspondence, and optical medi a are to be addressed to: FRA Project Office 2600 Park Tower Drive, Suite 1000 Vienna, VA 22180 Please refer to http://safetydata.fra .dot.gov/OfficeofSafety and click on \"Click Here for Changes in Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting\" for updated information. Primary Groups of Reportable Accidents/Incidents. Reportable accidents/incidents are divided into three major groups for reporting purposes. See \u00a7 225.19. These groups correspond to different FRA forms and are as follows: 1. Group I - Highway-rail grade crossing acci dent/incident (Form FRA F 6180.57) Note: For highway-rail grade crossing accident s/incidents only, railroads are required to contact potentially injured highw ay users involved in a high way-rail accident/incident, by mail, using a Highway User Injury Inquiry Form record (Form FRA F 6180.150) and, if unsuccessful, by phone. The Form FRA F 6180. 150 shall be sent w ith a cover letter drafted in accordance with the requireme nts set forth in the FRA Guide and a preaddressed, prepaid return envelope. Railroads are to use the information gathered to comply with FRA's accident/incident repor ting and recording requirements. 2. Group II - Rail equipment accident/incident (Form FRA F 6180.54) Note: Accident reports citing an employee hum an factor as a cause must be accompanied by an Employee Human Factor Attachment (Form FRA F 6180.81). In addition, each implicated employee must be provided with a Notice to Railroad Employee Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee Human Factor (Form FRA F 6180.78). Note: In preparing a rail equipment acciden t/incident report, the ra ilroad must inquire into the possible involvement of alcohol/d rug use or impairment and report such information to FRA as required by \u00a7 225.18. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 7 Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 3. Group III - Death, injury, or occupati onal illness (Form FRA F 6180.55a) Note: In preparing a Form FRA F 6180.55a fo r a fatality involving a trespasser, the railroad is responsible for acquiring additiona l documentation with regard to cause of death. The specific requirements for completing the va rious types of accident/incident forms are described in the chapters addres sing the individual forms. A singl e form is usually sufficient to report most events; however, there are situations when multiple report forms are necessary. An example is a highway-rail grade crossing collision resulting in reportable injuries. An accident of this type would require the completion of a Form FRA F 6180.55a for each FRA reportable injury sustained, and a Form FRA F 6180.57. In a ddition, if reportable on-track equipment and track damage in this accident exceeds the current monetary threshold for train accidents, then a Form FRA F 6180.54 must also be prepared. Reports are to be arranged in the following order: 1. Form FRA F 6180.55 2. Form FRA F 6180.55a 3. Form FRA F 6180.54 (Attach Form FRA F 6180.81 when applicable) 4. Form FRA F 6180.57 5. Form FRA F 6180.56 (December report only) 1.2.4 Late, Amended, and Updated Reports Late Reports. When a railroad finds that an accident/incident was omitted from a previous month's submission, a completed re port and a letter explaining the re ason for the late filing are to be sent to FRA. The late report and letter are to be forwar ded no later than the next monthly filing. See \u00a7 225.13. Late reports are not to be attached to or included in counts of reports prepared for the current month. Any late report is to be filed for the year and month in wh ich the original event occurred. Take, for example, the following scenario: An employee sustains a minor injury in June, but none of the reporting criteria are satisfied. He or she is reexamined in July because of complications and is instructed to take prescrip tion medication and remain off work for 3 days. In this instance, a late report for th e month of June must be prepared. Amended Reports. When a railroad discovers that an accident/incident has been improperly reported on a previous month's su bmission, then an amended report must be submitted to FRA with a letter of explanat ion. The amended report and letter ar e to be forwarded no later than the next monthly filing. See \u00a7 225.13. The report sh ould have the notation \"Amended Report\" at the top of the form, and items being ch anged are to be circled in red. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 8 Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements When a railroad discovers that a report has been erroneously submitted for a non-reportable event, a copy of the report is to be subm itted with the notation \"D ELETE - Non-reportable\" in red. Those who submit reports el ectronically using Accident/Inc ident Report Generator (AIRG) software provided by FRA must print out a copy of the report that is to be deleted as non- reportable, and note in red \"D ELETE - Non-reportable,\" and s ubmit this copy to FRA. Close of the Calendar Year. FRA publishes final accident/i ncident counts following the conclusion of a reporting year. Submission of the December report concludes the reporting year. However, railroads are still required to pr ovide to FRA late reports of unreported accidents/incidents, and amended reports that correct or update earlier submissions. FRA will receive and process late and amended reports for a period of 5 years following the calendar year to which an amended or late report relates. This accommod ation does not relieve a railroad of its obligation to pr omptly file a late or amende d report upon becoming aware of an omission, mistake or otherwise, in accordance with \u00a7 225.13 and the late and amended reporting guidance set forth in this Guide. FRA will c ontinue to publish its Annual Report of Railroad Safety Statistics; because the accident/incident databases will remain open for updating for a period of 5 years, the st atistics published in the Annual Report will be subject to change. The authoritative source for rail safety statistics will now be the Office of Railroad Safety's Web site: http://safetydata.fra .dot.gov/OfficeofSafety . To clarify: (1) Railroads must file amended reports with FR A (unless otherwise specified in paragraph 3 below) through December 1 of the year following the year in which the accident/incident was initially reported. (2) Railroads must file late reports with FRA for 5 years (following the end of the calendar year to which the accident/incident relates) for all unreported accident/incidents. (3) Railroads must file amended reports for 5 y ears after the end of the calendar year to which they relate for the following changes: a) Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (C ontinuation Sheet) (Form FRA F 6180.55a): Change from Injury to Fatality (only if th e injured person dies within 180 days from the date of the injury). b) Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident /Incident Report (Form FRA F 6180.57): Change from Injury to Fatality, change in Grade Crossing ID, change in the Rail Equipment Involved. c) Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Repor t (Form FRA F 6180.54): Change from Injury to Fatality, change in Grade Cr ossing ID, Rail Equipment Involved, Primary Cause Code, Contributing Cause Code, Type of Territory, Number of Cars Releasing Hazardous Material or Evacuation. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 9 Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements d) Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet) (Form FRA F 6180.55a): A significant change in the number of repor table days away from work or days restricted; a significant change is at leas t a 10% variance in the number of actual reportable days away from work or days re stricted compared to the number of days already reported. e) Railroad Equipment Accident/Incident Report (Form FRA F 6180.54): A significant change in the damage costs for reportab le rail equipment accidents/incidents; a significant change is a 10% variance be tween the damage amount reported to FRA and the current cost figures. Computer Submission of Reports. In order to assist railroads in maintaining and submitting records and reports required by this rule, FR A developed the AIRG software package for personal computers that have Microsoft Window s-based operating systems. See 61 FR 59485 (Nov. 22, 1996). FRA will provide copies of this software free of charge upon request by the reporting officer. You can find informati on on how to obtain AIRG by referring to http://safetydata.fra .dot.gov/OfficeofSafety and clicking on \"Click Here for Changes in Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Repor ting.\" From that page, click on the Forms/Publications tab and then click on th e link \"Current Railroad Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting Procedures.\" Finall y, click the link in Answer 5 that says \"Click here for AIRG Request Form.\" You can al so access this information by clicking on the Forms/Publications tab and clicking the link for FRA Forms. From the FRA Forms page, choose Accident Incident Report Generator Request Form, then downl oad and print. See Appendix K to this FRA Guide. Applicable Reporting/Recording Standards/Forms . When determining whether (and which form(s) to use) to report/record an accident/incident, a railroad must use the forms and standards that were in effect on the date that the accide nt/incident occurred. Therefore any reports, including late reports, or record s created for an accident/incident that occurred prior to June 1, 2011, are subject to the standards (and required to use the forms) that were in effect prior to the Miscellaneous Amendment to the FRA's Accident /Incident Reporting Requi rements; Final Rule, which became effective June 1, 2011. 75 FR 68862, November 9, 2010. When amending or correcting a report/record after June 1, 2011, for an accident/incident that occurred prior to June 1, 2011, a railroad should simply amend or co rrect the report/record that was originally created for the accident/incident. 1.2.5 Recordkeeping Form FRA F 6180.98 or the Altern ative Railroad-Designed Reco rd of Each Accountable and Each Employee-Reportable Injury/Illness. Railroads must maintain a record (Form FRA F 6180.98 or the alternative railroad-designed record) of each accountable and each employee- reportable injury/illness. See \u00a7\u00a7 225.25(a) and (b). Each railroad shall enter each reportable and accountable injury/illness on the appropriate record as early as practicable, but no later than 7 working days after receiving information or acquiring knowledge that an employee injury or illness has occurred. See \u00a7 225.25(f). FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 10 Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements Note that for certain claimed occupational illness cases only, railroads may maintain an alternate record (Form FRA F 6180.107 or the alternative railroad-designed record). See \u00a7\u00a7 225.25(i) and (j). Make Available to Employees Copies of Forms or Records of Employee Injury or Illness. Railroads must make available to an employ ee, upon request, a copy of the completed Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record (For m FRA F 6180.98) or the alternative railroad- designed record, as well as a copy of forms or re ports required to be maintained or filed under Part 225 pertaining to the employee's own work -related injury or illness. See \u00a7 225.25(c). Form FRA F 6180.97 or the Alternative Railroa d-Designed Record of Each On-Track Accident/Incident. Railroads must maintain a record (Form FRA F 6180.97 or the alternative railroad designed record) of each accountable and each reportable on-track accident/incident. See \u00a7\u00a7 225.25(d) and (e). The railroad shall enter each reportable and accountable rail equipment accident/incident on the appropriate record as early as practicable, but no later than 7 working days after receiving information or acquiring knowledge th at a rail equipment accident/incident has occurred. See \u00a7 225.25(f). 1.2.6 Access to Records Access to Records and Reports. Railroads must provide to FR A access to records and reports upon request within specified time limits. See \u00a7\u00a7 225.25(g) and 225.35. 1.2.7 Posting of Injuries and Illnesses Post Listing of All Injuries and Occ upational Illnesses Reported to FRA. Railroads must post a listing of all injuries and occupational illnesses re ported to FRA as having occurred to employees of an establishment, in a conspicuous location at that establishment, w ithin 30 days after the expiration of the month during wh ich the injuries and illnesses occurred. Each monthly posting shall remain continuously displayed for the next 12 consecutive months. If there are no reportable injuries or occupationa l illnesses associated with an establishment for that month, the posting must make reference to that fact. A railroad is permitted to not post information on an injury or illness only if the employee who incurred the injury or illness makes a request, in writing, to the railroad's reporting officer that his or her particular injury or illness not be posted, or if an oc cupational injury or illness is a privacy concern case. See \u00a7 225.25(h)(15). See also \u00a7 225.5 for definition of \"privacy case.\" 1.2.8 Record Retention Retain Accident/Incident Records and Duplicat es of Reports for Speci fied Periods of Time. Railroads must retain accident/in cident records and duplicates of reports for specified periods of FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 11 Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements time. See \u00a7\u00a7 225.27(a)-(c). Electronic recor dkeeping systems must conform to FRA's standards. See \u00a7 225.27(d). 1.2.9 Internal Control Plan Adopt and Comply with an Inte rnal Control Plan (ICP). Railroads must adopt and comply with an ICP. See \u00a7 225.33. FRA believes that an ICP, as prescribed by \u00a7 225.33, best provides the procedures necessary to ensure that complete, re liable, and accurate data is obtained, maintained, and disclosed by the railroads. See Appendix I to this Guide for model ICPs. FRA investigations have repeatedly found instances in which depa rtments within an individual railroad failed to provide to the railroad repor ting officer information critical to determining reportability, or information necessary for filing an accurate and complete report. The ICP is a performance standard that ensures the accuracy of a process and, in this case, the process is accident/incident repo rting. The ICP dictates the n ecessity for communication within each railroad to ensure that proper reporting will be accomplished. The ICP may vary in size, from one that is a few pages for smaller railroads and shortlines to one of considerable size for the major carriers. The ICP challenges the railroads to develop a tota l quality management (TQM) system to ensure that there are no errors in reporting. \"No e rrors\" means that all reportable accidents and incidents are reported to FRA and that each report is accurately completed prior to submission to FRA; in other words, a \"zero tolerance\" polic y with respect to inaccurate reporting. TQM focuses on continuous and incremental im provements of process performance. The ICP addresses intimidation and harassment of any person calculated to prevent or discourage such person from either receiving proper medi cal treatment for an injury/illness or from reporting an accident, incident, illness, or injur y. FRA is aware that many railroad employees fail to disclose their injuries to the railroad or fail to accept reportable treatment from a physician because they wish to avoid potential harassment fr om management or possible discipline that is sometimes associated with the reporting of such injuries. FRA is also aware that in some instances, supervisory personnel and mid-level mana gers are urged to engage in practices that may undermine or circumvent the reporting of inju ries and illnesses. Railroads must remain proactive in accurate reporting of all reportable accidents, injuri es, and illnesses, and must not engage in practices that could manipulate reportability of these incidents. In some instances, railroads report an injury or illness to FRA only after FRA inspectors make management aware that a particular injury or illness was not re ported. Many times, FRA inspectors conduct an investigation pursuant to a complaint from an em ployee alleging that his or her injury/illness was not properly reported or was not reported at all. Again, the railroad usually reports this injury/illness to FRA only after FRA informs mana gement of the situation. Each railroad shall adopt and comply with a written ICP that shall be maintained at the office where the railroad's reporting officer conducts his or he r official business. Each railroad shall amend its ICP, as necessary, to reflect any significan t changes to the railroad's inte rnal reporting procedures. The ICP shall be designed to maintain absolute accura cy and shall include, at a minimum, each of the 11 components set forth in \u00a7 225.33(a)(1-11). FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 12 Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 1.3 Miscellaneous Provisions and Information 1.3.1 Assistance and Guidance In deciding on the reportability of an accident/i ncident, or otherwise fulfilling the reporting obligation, assistance may be obtained by contac ting any of the regional offices or FRA Headquarters as listed in Appendix G. 1.3.2 Copies of the Regulations Copies of Federal regulations may be obtained by contacting the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washingt on, DC 20402-9328 (tele phone: 202-512-1803; http://www.gpo.gov ). 1.3.3 Reporting Decisions Ordinarily, the reporting officer will decide whethe r an accident/incident is reportable. This decision cannot be an arbitrary one, but must be based on a thorough review of all evidence, as opposed to speculation, related to the accident/inc ident in question and must be in accordance with the requirements of the accident repor ts statute (49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 20901-20903), Part 225, and the guidelines provided in th is Guide. If you are cer tain that a particular situation is outside the scope of the reporting requirements, then the ba sis on which this determination was made must be thoroughly documented before the case may be omitted from the monthly submission. Neither the fact that there were no witnesses to an accident/incident nor the refusal of the railroad to accept responsibility for an event is grounds for failing to report. A report must be made whenever there is credible information that a repo rtable situation may have occurred. Later, if it is determined that the event was not reportable, a request to delete it from FRA's files is to be made. If there is any uncertainty as to whether to report an accident/inci dent, it is recommended that a report be made. Later, as additional in formation is developed, or following consultation with FRA Office of Safety Assurance and Comp liance personnel, a request may be made to delete the incident from the file. See \u00a7 225.17. Note that FRA cannot delegate authority to decide matters of judgment when facts are in dispute. In such cases, FRA will make the final decision as to reportability. In arriving at this decision, FRA will review all investigatory material associ ated with the case, including, but not limited to, the following: the initial report filed by the aff ected person, witness statements, transcripts of hearings, medical records, tim e and attendance records, and the purpose of payouts made in connection with the accident/incident. Based upon its review, FRA will determine whether the injury or illness is accountable or reportable. 1.3.4 Claimed But Not Admitted Submissions When facts affecting the reportability of a case are in dispute, a report may be filed with FRA as \"Claimed But Not Admitted.\" An accident/inci dent reported under this provision is given FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 13 Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements special examination by FRA, but must still be r ecorded on the appropriate form and be included as part of the report package fo r that month. A copy of all evid ence relating to the event and a letter summarizing the reasons w hy it should be excluded from the file must be provided. FRA will examine all documentation. If the facts are sufficient to support the railroad's position, the case will not be charged against th e railroad; otherwise, it will be added to the file. In either case, FRA will advise the railroad of the agency's determination. It is suggested that prior to making such a filing that FRA be contacted by telephone (FRA telephone nu mbers are listed in Appendix G) to discuss the overall merits of the case. 1.3.5 Penalties Any person (including a railroad and any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad) who violates any requirement of Part 225 or causes the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty. The person may also be s ubject to criminal penalties. FRA may issue these civil pe nalties pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 21301, see Appendix A to Part 209 of the CFR for ot her sanctions. Criminal penalties and/or imprisonment provided for in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 2131 1 may also be imposed on any individual who knowingly and willfully makes a fa lse entry in a record or re port required by the accident reporting regulations or other regulations issued under 49 U.S. C. chapter 201; who destroys, mutilates, changes, or falsifies such a record or report; who does not enter required specified facts in a such record or report; who makes or preserves such a r ecord or report in violation of such a regulation or order; or who files a false re cord or report with FRA. FRA wants to make clear to all railroads that the agen cy will be diligent in its efforts to ensure that all parties adhere to and comply with the intimidation and harassmen t policy in the ICP. It should be noted that FRA will be aggressive in pursuing enforcemen t sanctions against any person found to be in violation of the railroad's hara ssment and intimidation policy. 1.3.6 Public Examination and Use of Reports Accident reports may be inspected at FRA's Offi ce of Railroad Safety. FRA will provide copies of accident/incident reports under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) upon written request. Written requests for copies of accident/incident reports should be accompanied by the appropriate fee and addressed to: Freedom of Information Act Coordinator Office of Chief Counsel Federal Railroad Administration U.S. Department of Transportation RCC-10, Mail Stop 10 West Building 3rd Floor, Room W33-437 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE. Washington, DC 20590 FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 14 Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements Each request should be clearly marked \"FOIA Request for Accident/Incident Report.\" See \u00a7 225.7. 1.4 Questions and Answers Q1. We are required to post a listing of all reported injuries and occupational illnesses to employees at that establishm ent. Although this listing does not contain personal identifiers, e.g., names, Social Security numbers, it may be possible to ascertain the identity of the person, particularly in small establishments, based on the informat ion listed. There may be conditions that are reportable about which the em ployee or the railroad is especially sensitive regarding the information being displayed in such a fashion. Are there any exceptions to this requirement? A1. Yes. The purpose of this listing is to raise the awareness of employees at the establishment of the hazards that exis t in the workplace, and to include the employees in the reporting process. It wa s neither FRA's intent nor its desire to have conditions that an employee would pr efer to keep conf idential displayed on this listing. Section 225.25(h)(15) permits a railroad not to post information on an occupational injury or illness case that is a \"privacy concern case.\" This includes cases in which the employee independently and voluntarily reque sts in writing to the railroad reporting officer th at his or her injury or il lness not be posted. (See \u00a7 225.5 for full definition of pr ivacy concern case.) Q2. In a single large facility, such as a major yard, must a railroad maintain the records and reports required by this regulation at each individual location where the employees of that facility report to work? A2. No. FRA has always exercised a cert ain amount of flexibility concerning the locations where these records must be ke pt. FRA does not require that separate records be maintained for the various distin ct activities that ta ke place in a large facility. Work locations that are near each other can be treated as a single establishment when they are part of a larg er facility at that location. Permanent work sites that are physically distant fr om each other, e.g., in another city, are separate establishments a nd are covered by the term, \"single physical location,\" contained in this FRA Guide. See \u00a7\u00a7 225.25(g), 225.27 and 225.35 for FRA's requirements related to record maintenance and access. Q3. Are there any particular forms that mu st be used to record injuries, illnesses, accidents and/or incidents? A3. For recording an accountab le or reportable injury or illness for a railroad employee, either the Railroad Employee In jury and/or Illness Record (Form FRA F 6180.98), or an alternative railroad record can be used. If the alternative record FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 15 Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements is used, the regulation states that it \"s hall contain all of the information required on the Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record.\" See \u00a7 225.25(b). For initially recording an accountable or reportable rail equipment accident/incident, either the Initial Ra il Equipment Accident/Incident Record (Form FRA F 6180.97) or an alte rnative railroad-designed re cord can be used. If the alternative record is used, the regulation states that it \"shall contain all of the information required on the Initial Rail E quipment Accident/Incident Record.\" See \u00a7 225.25(e). Q4. I currently maintain a database of all conditions reported by employees, passengers and others, regardless of severi ty or consequences. A lot of these injuries require no treatment, or only need first aid. I document every potential case, just in case it later b ecomes reportable. Does the requirement to record entries involving employ ees on the Form FRA F 6180.98 or an alternative railroad-designed form make it necessary for me to have two logs, one for \"accountable\" injuries to em ployees and a separate record for others? If possible, I woul d like to consolidate all of my records into a single file. A4. No, the alternative railroad-designed r ecord may be used to record the additional information described. The regulation onl y requires that you maintain certain information about your employees which FRA inspectors may ask to see in order to verify compliance. For example, th e regulation does not require that Form FRA F 6180.98 contain information about c ontractors or volunteers. You may include records for any class of person in your file, and you may also include additional information beyond what is requ ired. To avoid any confusion about those entries that are required by the regulation and additi onal records you may choose to include in your f ile, there must be a means of identifying the two categories incorporated in your system design. These same general guidelines also apply for alternative railroad-designed Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record, Form FRA F 6180.97, described in Chapter 5. Q5. Does this mean we can maintain this information electronically? If so, what are the requirements for centralized processing of this data? A5. Yes. FRA addresses electronic reco rd retention at \u00a7 225.27, where FRA sets forth minimum system requirements for the elec tronic retention of accident/incident records. Note the exception, however , with respect to FRA Form F 6180.55, \"Railroad Injury and Illness Summary.\" If a railroad submits FRA Form F 6180.55 to FRA electronically, the railroad must maintain a hard copy of the original signed form and the electronic no tification of receipt of the form. See \u00a7 225.27(c). FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 16 Definitions 2. Definitions Section 225.5 contains definitions as used in Part 225. Section 225.19 sets forth which accidents/incidents are reportable. The definition s and guidance listed below are supplemental to the definitions found in Part 225, and are provided to assist railroads in the context of accident/incident reporting. Casualty . A reportable death, injury, or illness arising from the opera tion of a railroad. Casualties may be classified as either fatal or nonfatal. Classification of Persons. Worker on Duty-Railroad Employee (Class A). An individual who receives direct monetary compensation from the railroad. Wh ether the worker is under pay will generally, but not always, be the deciding factor for dete rmining \"on duty\" status. An employee who is not under pay, but engaged in work-rel ated activity is \"on duty.\" Note: tation is considered an \"employee on duty,\" regardless of the mode of transportation. Dea dhead transportation occurs when an employee is traveling at the direction or authorization of the carrier to or from an assignment, or the employee is involved with a means of conveyanc e furnished by the carrier or compensated for by the carrier. Exception: If an employee is housed by the carrie r in a facility such as a motel, and part of the service provided by the motel is the transpor tation of the employee to and from the work site, any reportable injury to the employee during such transit is to be recorded as that of a Railroad Employee Not On Duty (Class B). Likewise, if the employee decides upon other means of transportation that is not authorized or provided, an d for which he would not have been compensated by the railroad, the in jury is not considered work-related. Railroad Employee Not On Duty (Class B). An individual who receives direct monetary compensation from the railroad and who is on railroad property for purposes connected with his or her employment or with other ra ilroad permission but is not \"on duty.\" Worker on Duty-Contractor (Class F). An employee of a contracting agency for a railroad who does not receive direct moneta ry compensation from the railroad and who, while on railroad property, is enga ged in either 1) the operation of on-track equipment, or 2) any other safety-sensitive function for the railroad as defined in \u00a7 209.303. Section 209.303 describes \"safety-sensitive functions\" as applying to the following individuals: FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 17 Definitions (a) Railroad employees who are assigned to perf orm service subject to the Hours of Service Act (45 U.S.C. 61-64b2) during a duty tour, whether or not the person has performed or is currently performing such se rvice, and any person who performs such service; (b) Railroad employees or agents who: (1) Inspect, install, repair, or maintain track and roadbed; (2) Inspect, repair, or maintain, locomotiv es, passenger cars, and freight cars; (3) Conduct training and testing of employees when the training or testing is required by the FRA's safety regulations; or (c) Railroad managers, supervisors, or agents when they: (1) Perform the safety-sensitive functions listed in paragraphs (a) and (b ) of this section; (2) Supervise and otherwise dire ct the performance of the sa fety-sensitive functions listed in paragraph (a) and (b) of this section; or (3) Are in a position to direct the commission of violations of any of the requirements of parts 213 through 236 of this title. Note: There have been amendments and additi ons to the set of railroad safety regulations found in the CFR; thus, the term \"safety-sens itive functions\" in \u00a7 209.303( c)(3) is interpreted to include railroad managers, supervisors, etc ., when they are in a position to direct the commission of violations of any of the re quirements of Parts 213 through 240 of 49 CFR. Hours worked by persons in the Class F, G, H, and I categories are not reported on any FRA form. Contractor-Other (Class G). A contractor employee for a ra ilroad who does not receive direct monetary compensation from the railroad and who is not engaged in either 1) the operation of on-track equipment, or 2) any othe r safety-sensitive function for the railroad. Hours worked by this person are not reported on any FRA form. Worker on Duty-Volunteer (Class H). A volunteer who does not receive direct monetary compensation from the railroad and who is e ngaged in either 1) th e operation of on-track equipment, or 2) any other safety-sensitive function for the railroad as defined in \u00a7 209.303. (See this list under \"Worke r on Duty-Contractor.\") 2 In 1994, the Hours of Service Act was repealed by Cong ress as part of a broad recodification of the Federal transportation laws. See Act of July 5, 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-272, 108 Stat. 745. The Act, which had been in Title 45, was repealed and recodified primarily as Chapter 211 of 49 U.S.C. Congress made clear that the recodification was not intended to make substantive changes in the affected laws, even though it altered their arrangement and language in certain respects. See Pub. L. No. 103-272, \u00a7 6(a), 108 Stat. Cong., 1st Sess. 1-5 (1993), reprinted in 1994 U.S. CODE CONG. & ADMIN. NEWS 818-822. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 18 Definitions Hours worked by a \"Worker on Duty-Volunteer \" (Class H) are not reported on any FRA form. Volunteer-Other (Class I). A volunteer who does not receive direct monetary compensation from the railroad and who is not engaged in either 1) the operation of on-track equipment, or 2) any other safety-sensitive function for the railroad as defined in \u00a7 209.303. Hours worked by this person also not reported on any FRA form. Passengers On Trains (Class C). Persons who are on, boarding, or alighting railroad cars for the purpose of travel. Nontrespassers-On Railroad Property (Class D). Persons lawfully on that part of railroad property that is used in railroad operation (o ther than those herein defined as employees, passengers, trespassers, volunteers, or cont ractor employees), and persons adjacent to railroad premises when they are injured as the re sult of the operation of a railroad. This class also includes other persons on vessels or buses , whose use arises from the operation of a railroad. Nontrespassers-Off Railroad Property (Class J). An injury \"off railroad property\" includes an injury resulting from an event, su ch as a derailment or collision, that begins on railroad property but ends on public or private non-railroad property, so long as the injury is incurred while the person is physically locat ed off railroad property. Similarly, if a derailment results in a release of hazardous materials onto public or private non-railroad property and the hazardous material injures a \"Nontrespasser\" located on public or private non-railroad property, the injury is reported as an injury to \"Nontrespassers-Off Railroad Property\" (Class J). Conversel y, injuries to nontrespassers occurring while on public or private railroad property are reported as injuri es to \"Nontrespassers-On Railroad Property\" (Class D). Trespassers (Class E). Persons who are on the part of railroad property used in railroad operation and whose presence is prohibited, fo rbidden, or unlawful. Employees who are trespassing on railroad propert y are to be reported as \"T respassers\" (Class E). Note: A person on a highway-rail grade crossi ng should not be classi fied Trespasser (Class E) unless: 1) the crossi ng is protected by gates or othe r similar barriers, which were closed when the person went on the crossing, or 2) the person attempted to pass over, under, or between cars or locomotives of a consist oc cupying the crossing. A person or vehicle that enters the crossing without a physical barrier (e.g., gates in a lowered position) is not classified as a trespasser, even when the hi ghway-rail grade crossing lights are activated or other warning systems are functi oning. The person would be clas sified as a nontrespasser. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 19 Definitions Closed Crossing . A closed crossing is a location where a crossing has been physically removed, or where rail operations, pathwa y traffic, or highway traffic is not possible. This does not include crossings that are temporarily closed for repa irs to the track structure, crossing surface, or roadway approaches. Examples are locations where the crossing has been permanently barricaded and crossing surf ace material removed; where the railroad tracks have been cut or barricaded or physica lly removed; where a connecting turnout has been removed; or where rail operations are not possible because the railroad tracks are paved over, etc. Crossings along such inactive railroad lines are closed . Temporary Barricaded Crossing. A highway-rail grade crossing that is temporarily closed to highway users by us ing temporary methods to bloc k highway traffic, such as barrels. A temporary barricaded crossing does not constitute a \"closed\" crossing. Consist Responsibility . The railroad employing the crew members operating the consist at the time of the accident normally determines the consist owner for reporting purposes. An exception to this rule is when a railroad is under contract to operate another railroad on an ongoing basis. This situation often exists in connection with commuter operations where the entity is known to the gene ral public as the commuter aut hority, not the railroad under contract (see Chapter 12 for additional guidance). Collision . A collision is defined as an impact between on-track equipment consists while both are on rails and where one of the consists is operating under train movement rules or is subject to the protection afforded to trains. This definition includes instances where a portion of a consist occupying a siding is fouling the mainline and is st ruck by an approaching train. It does not include impacts o ccurring while switching within yards, as in making up or breaking up trains, shifting or settin g out cars, etc. Impacts of this type are to be classified as \"Other Impacts\" accidents (Code \"12\" in It em 7 on Form F 6180.54), when all consists involved are part of the switching movement. The timetable, or schedule direction, should govern the classification of collisions when either one of the trains or the locomotives is at rest, or when its incidental movement temporarily differs from the schedule direction. Head-On Collision. A collision in which the trains or locomotives, or electric multiple- unit (EMU) or diesel multiple-unit (DMU) trains, involved are traveling in opposite directions on the same track, provided that both consists have a locomotive (or EMU or DMU trains). Rear-End Collision. A collision in which the trains or locomotives (or EMU or DMU trains) involved are traveling in the same di rection on the same track, provided that both consists have a locomotive (or EMU or DMU trains). FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 20 Definitions Side Collision. A collision at a turnout where one consist strikes the side of another consist. Raking Collision. A collision between parts or lading of a consist on an adjacent track, or with a structure such as a bridge. Broken Train Collision. A collision in which a moving train breaks into parts and an impact occurs between these parts, or when a portion of the broken train collides with another consist. Note: The several parts of a broken train are not to be treated as separate consists for reporting purposes. Information concerni ng such trains are to be reported on a single form. Railroad Crossing Collision. A collision between on-track railroad equipment at a point where tracks intersect. Costs and Reportable Damage . Reporting Threshold. The amount of total reportable damage resulting from a train accident which, if exceeded, requires the pr eparation and forwarding of Form FRA F 6180.54 by the railroads involved. For accide nts that occurred in calendar years 2002-2005, the reporting threshold was $6,700. For accidents that occurred in calendar year 2006, the reporting threshold is $7,700; fo r accidents that occur in calendar year 2007, the reporting threshold is $8,200; for accide nts that occur in calendar year 2008, the reporting threshold is $8,900; and, for accidents that occur in calendar year 2010, the reporting threshold is $9,200. Pursuant to \u00a7 225.19(e), the reporting threshold will be revised annually acco rding to the formula set forth in Appendix B to Part 225. Please refer to http://safetydata.fr a.dot.gov/OfficeofSafety and click on \"Click Here for Changes in Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting\" for updated information. Reportable Damage. Reportable damage includes labor costs and all other costs to repair or replace in-kind, damaged on-track e quipment, signals, track, track structures, or roadbed. Reportable damage does not include the cost of clearing a wreck; however, additional damage to the above-listed items caused while clearing the wreck is to be included in the damage estimate. Examples of other costs include d in reportable damage are: 1) rental and/or operation of machinery such as cranes, bulldozers, including the services of contr actors, to replace or repair the track right-of-way and associated structures; and 2) cost s associated with the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 21 Definitions repair or replacement of roller bearings on units that were derailed or submerged in water. (Replacement costs include the labor costs resulting from a wheelset change out.) Equipment Damage. All costs, including labo r and material, associated with the repair or replacement in-kind of on-track rail equipm ent. Trailers/containers on flatcars are considered to be lading and damage to these is not to be included in on-track equipment damage. Damage to a flatcar carrying a traile r/container is to be included in reportable damage. When on-track equipment is damaged beyond repair, the total repr oduction cost of the equipment, including betterments and additions , is to be calculated in accordance with Rule 107 of the current edition of the fiel d manual of the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Interchange Rules. The to tal reproduction cost may be depreciated to reflect the amount of usage to which the e quipment has been subj ected. Depreciation percentages will be determined at 3 per cent annually for a maximum of 30 years; equipment over 30 years old will be valued at 10 percent of the total reproduction cost. Replacement-in-kind costs for equipment damaged beyond repair is the result of these calculations. Track Damage. All costs, including labor and mate rial, associated with the repair or replacement in-kind of signals, track, track structures (including bridges or tunnels), damaged equipment detectors (e.g., hot box de tector), switches, or other electronic equipment; or roadbeds that were damaged in a collision, derailment, or other reportable event. When track, signals, structures , etc., are damaged beyond repair , the current cost of new materials is to be used. However, repl acement of secondhand rail with secondhand rail may be charged at the curre nt cost of such rail. When estimating damage costs, the labor cost s to be reported are only the direct labor costs to the railroad, e.g., hourly wages, tran sportation costs, and hotel expenses. The cost of fringe benefits is ex cluded when calculating direct la bor costs. Overhead is also excluded when calculating damage costs due to the unacceptable non-uniform treatment of overhead under the current process. For services performed by a contractor, a di rect hourly labor cost is calculated by multiplying the contractor's total labor hours charged to the railroad by the applicable direct hourly wage rate for a railroad worker in that particular cr aft. However, if a railroad cannot match the equivalent craft to the labor hours spent by a contractor, then the railroad must use the loaded rate, i.e., the cost by hour for labor, fringe benefits, and FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 22 Definitions other costs and fees for services charged by th e contractor for the tasks associated with the repair of the track, equipment, and structures due to a train accident. Derailment . A derailment occurs when on-track equipment leaves the rail for a reason other than a collision, explosion, highway-r ail grade crossing impact, etc. Direct Train Control . This is an FRA umbrella term and refers to modern-day derivatives of traditional timetable/train order methodology. These methods of control have greatly modernized and simplified train operations by eliminating timetabl e schedules, train registers, superiority, and the attendant array of complicated operating rules. These systems are predicated on the train dispatcher having di rect and continuous radio cont act with all trains; hence the informal name \"radio train dispatching.\" In place of the train order, th ere is a written document known variously as a track warrant , Direct Traffic Control (DTC ) clearance, Occupancy Control System (OCS) clearance, track permit, Form D, etc. There are two basic DTC systems presently in use on today's railroad s: one that uses fixed blocks (i.e., the limits are constant and are identified both in the timetable and by wayside signs); and one that uses variable blocks (i.e., the limits are not constant and are created by the train dispatcher for each train). These systems are variously identified in the industry as: 1. Track Warrant Control (TWC) 2. Direct Tr affic Control (called Direct Train Control on some roads) (DTC) 3. Form D Control System (DCS) 4. Occupancy Control System (OCS) 5. Manual Block System (MBS) ________________ ( Note: these could all be considered standa lone methods of operation and may be shown as such.) Drug/Alcohol Test . A drug/alcohol test pr oduces a physical or chemical reaction by which a substance may be detected or its properties as certained, and includes bo th Federal and employer- authorized tests to determine alcohol or drug us age. A test performed under FRA requirements is considered positive when the test result has been verified as positive by a medical review officer and reported to the employer. A test pe rformed under other author ization is considered positive when the employer will defend the results if legally challenged. (Refer to 49 CFR Part 219, Control of Alcohol and Drug Use, for additional information.) First-Aid Treatment . Treatment that is limited to simp le procedures used to treat minor conditions, such as abrasions, cuts, bruises, a nd splinters. First-aid treatment is typically confined to a single treatment and does not requ ire special skills or procedures. First aid treatment is specifically addressed in Chapter 6 of this Guide. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 23 Definitions Hazardous Material . A substance or material, including a hazardous substance, which has been determined by the Secretary of Tr ansportation to be cap able of posing an unr easonable risk to health, safety, and property when transported in commerce, and which has been so designated. See \u00a7 171.8. Hazardous Material Residue . The hazardous material remain ing in a packaging, including a tank car, after its contents have been unloaded to the maximum ex tent practicable and before the packaging is either refilled or cleaned of hazardous material and purged to remove any hazardous vapors. Additional guidance concerning Fede ral requirements as to the id entification and shipment of hazardous material can be found in 49 CFR Parts 100 to 180. Miles Traveled . Passenger-mile. The movement of a passenger for a distance of 1 mile. Train-mile. The movement of a train for a distance of 1 mile. Mileage is not to be increased because of the presence of multiple locomotives in the train. (See defi nition of \"train.\") Yard Switching Train-Mile. May be computed at the rate of 6 mph for the time actually engaged in yard switching service (or any othe r method that will yield a more accurate count) if actual mileage is not known. Operation of a Railroad . Inclusive term used to describe all activities of a railroad related to the performance of its rail transportation business. Other Accidents . Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident. Any impact between on-track railroad equipment and a highway user at a highway-rail grade crossing. Highway-rail grade crossing means: (1) a location where a public highway, ro ad, or street, or a pr ivate roadway, including associated sidewalks, crosses one or more railroad tracks at gr ade; or (2) a location where a pathway explicitly authorized by a public authority or a railroad carrier that is dedicated for the use of non-vehicular traffic, including pedest rians, bicyclists, and others, that is not associated with a public highwa y, road, or street, or a privat e roadway, crosses one or more railroad tracks at grade. The term \"sidewalk\" means that portion of a street between the curb line, or the lateral line of a roadway, and the adjacent property line or, on easements of private property, that portion of a street that is paved or improved and intended for use by pedestrians. (See figure one be low) The term \"highway user\" includes automobiles, buses, FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 24 Definitions trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, farm vehicles, pedestrians, and all other modes of surface transportation motorized and un-motorized. All crossing locations within industry and rail yards, ports, and dock areas are considered hi ghway-rail grade crossings within the meaning of the term. The below illustration is inte nded to provide additional clar ification regarding sidewalks associated with highway-rail grade crossings. Figure 1: Illustration of sidewalks a ssociated with highw ay-rail grade crossings. Obstruction Accident. An accident/incident in which a co nsist strikes: 1) a bumping post or a foreign object on the track right-of-way; 2) a highway vehi cle at a location other than a highway-rail grade crossing site; 3) derailed eq uipment; or 4) a track motorcar or similar work equipment not equipped with AAR coupler s and not operating under train rules. Explosion-Detonation. An accident/incident caused by the detonation of material carried or transported by rail. A detonation occurs wh en a shock wave exceeds the speed of sound. Explosions-detonations resulting from mishap s during loading or unloading operations, and those caused by fire aboard on-track equipm ent, are included in this definition. Fire or Violent Rupture. An accident/incident caused by combustion or violent release of material carried by or transported by rail. Exampl es of this type includ e fuel and electrical equipment fires, crankcase explosions, and viol ent releases of liquefied petroleum gas or anhydrous ammonia. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 25 Definitions Other Impacts. An accident/incident, not classified as a collision, that involves contact between on-track equipment. Generally, these i nvolve single cars or cuts of cars that are damaged during switching, train makeup, setting out, etc., operations. If both consists contain a locomotive, an EMU locomotive, or a DMU locomotive, the event should be classified as a collision between trains. Other Accidents/Incidents. Events not classified as one of the preceding types. On-Track Rail Equipment . Equipment Consist. An equipment consist is a train, lo comotive(s), cut of cars, or a single car not coupled to anothe r car or locomotive. Car.

See special instructions in Chapter 7 when re porting DMUs, EMUs, or cab car locomotives. Motorcar. A self-propelled unit of equipment designed to carry freight or passenger traffic. (Does not include track motor cars or similar work equipment.) Train. For purposes of accident/incident reporting, a train is a locomotive or locomotives coupled with or without cars, and with or without markers displayed. This definition includes trains consisting entirely of self-propelled units desi gned to carry passengers, freight traffic, or both. Yard Switching Trains. Trains operated primarily within yards for the purpose of switching other equipment. Examples include the making up or breaking up of trains, service industrial tracks within yard limits, storing or cla ssifying cars, and othe r similar operations. Note: Switching performed by a road crew that is incidental to the road operation is not included. Work train. Work trains are non-revenue trains used for the administration and upkeep service of the railroad. Examples are: offici al trains, inspection trai ns, special trains running with a company fire apparatus to save the rail road's property from destruction, trains that transport the railroad's employees to and from work when no transporta tion charge is made, construction and upkeep trains run in connect ion with maintenance and improvement work, and material and supply trains r un in connection with operations. Passenger Station Platform Gap . The horizontal space between the edge of the passenger boarding platform and the edge of the rail car do or threshold plate, and the vertical difference from the top of the passenger boarding platfo rm and the top of the rail car threshold. Passenger Station Platform Gap Incident. A reportable injury involving a person who, while involved in the process of boarding or alighting a passenger train at a rail car door threshold plate at a high-level passenger boarding platform (i.e., a platform that is 48\" or more a bove the top of the rail), has one or more body parts enter th e area between the carbody and the edge of the platform or traveling between passenger cars . The following are examples of a Passenger Station Platform Gap Incident: FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 27 Definitions While boarding or alighting a passenger trai n at a high-level passenger boarding platform a person misjudges the passenger station plat form gap, resulting in the person's leg entering the passenger station platform gap. While boarding or alighting a passenger train at a high-level passenger boarding platform, a person is struck by a closing door , resulting in the person's leg entering the passenger station platform gap. The following are not examples of a pa ssenger station platform gap incident: While boarding or alighting a passenger train at a high-level passenger boarding platform, a person misjudges the gap and falls into the vestibule or platform, without a body part entering the gap. While walking on a passenger station at a high-level passenger boarding platform, a person slips on the platform, at a location othe r than the rail car door threshold, resulting in the person's leg entering the gap. Passenger station platform gap injuries usually occur when the high-level platform station is concave, convex, or there is misalignment between the platform and passenger car, or when a person is traveling between cars an d has one or more body parts ente r the area between the cars. Person . Includes all categories of entities covere d under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, including, but not limited to a railroad; any manager, supervisor, official , or other employee or agent of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, tr ack, or facilities; any passenger; any trespasser or nontrespasser; any independent contractor providing go ods or services to a railroad; any volunteer providing goo ds or services to a railroad; and any employee of such owner, manufacturer, le ssor, lessee, or independent contractor.

Physician or Other Licensed He alth Care Professional (PLHCP) . A healthcare professional operating within the scope of his or her license, registration, or certification. In addition to licensed physicians, the term \"Other Licensed He alth Care Professional\" includes members of other occupations associated with patient care and treatment, such as chiropractors, podiatrists, physician's assistants, psyc hologists, and dentists. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 28 Definitions Remote Controlled Locomotive (RCL) . This term refers to on-track rail equipment that is controlled by an employee or contractor using a remote transmitter/receiver designed to control the locomotive, maintenance machine, or other ty pe of self-propelled on -track rail equipment. Special coding instructions are to be used when casualties to persons, rail equipment accidents/incidents, and highway-ra il grade crossing accidents/incidents occur when an RCL is in use. Tracks and Types of Tracks . Main Track.

FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 29 F 6180.55 3. Form FRA F 6180.55 - Railroad Injury and Illness Summary 3.1 Requirement Form FRA F 6180.55, titled \"Railroad Injury and Illness Summary,\" is used to summarize a railroad's accident/incident data for a given month. A report must be filed each month, even when no accidents/incidents occurred duri ng the reporting month. See \u00a7 225.21(b). 3.2 General Instructions and Interpretations If there were no accidents/incidents for the month being reported, this fact must be noted on the form. If actual operational data (mileage, hours worked, etc.) are not available when the report is due, then an estimate must be provided. An amende d report must be sent when actual figures are known. See \u00a7 225.13. If there are substantial fluctu ations in month-to-month operati onal data, the reason for such variations (seasonal operation, stri kes, consolidation, line abandonment , etc.) are to be explained. A late or amended report is not to be included in the counts fo r the current month. If such a report is forwarded with the re gular submission, it must have a separate cover letter indicating that it is an amended report, or, for late submission s, explaining why the report is being filed late. See \u00a7 225.13. Entries changed on amended re ports should be circled in red. If an Item, such as \"Passenger-Miles Operated,\" does not apply to your ra ilroad, enter \"N/A.\" Fractions and decimals are to be r ounded to the nearest whole number. 3.3 Instructions for Completing Form FRA F 6180.55 Item Instruction 1. Name of Reporting Railroad Enter the full name of the reporting railroad. 2. Alphabetic Code Enter the reporting railroad's code, found in Appendix A. 3. Report Month & Year Enter the month and year covered by the report. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 30 F 6180.55 4. State Alphabetic Code Enter the code for the State in which th e report was signed, found in Appendix B. 5. County Enter the name of the county or pari sh in which the report was signed. 6. Name of Reporting Officer Enter the reporting officer's name. 7. Official Title Enter the reporting officer's official title. 8. Address Enter the reporting officer's mailing address. 9. Telephone Enter the reporting officer's telephone number. 10. Date and sign as directed (not arization no longer required). Operational Data and Accident/Inc ident Counts for Report Month. In Items 11-14, do not duplicate mileage in more than one block. For example, do not include yard switching train miles in the total for either freight or passenger train-miles. For Items 11-17, report only the miles and hours associated with your operations. ****************************************************************************** Example for calculating Items 12 (Passenger Trai n Miles), 16 (Passenger Miles Operated), and 17 (Number of Passengers Transported): Enter miles and passengers into a spreadsheet, lis ted by date of each trip, and then enter totals into correct items in the FRA Form F 6180.55. Note: Be sure to first multiply each separate Transported\" by each separa each separate trip's \"Passenger-Miles Operated,\" and th en sum each of these resu lts to get the total. For the case of having multiple trips, DO NOT multiply \"Total\" \"Passengers Transported\" by \"Total\" \"Passenger Train-Miles\" FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 31 F 6180.55 See example below: Item 17: Item 12: Item 16: Date Pass. Transp. x Pass. Train Miles = Pass. Miles Oper. 07/01/2006 85 x 12 = 1,0 20 07/15/2006 121 x 8 = 968 07/21/2006 217 x 8 = 1,73 6 07/23/2006 177 x 8 = 1,416 Total 600 36 5,140 In this example, 600 would be entered into Item 17, 36 into Item 12, and 5140 into Item 16. ****************************************************************************** 11. Freight Train-Miles Enter the number of train-miles, in fr eight service, run during the month. Note: Be careful not to report freight train-miles that are being reported by another railroad. This may occur if one railroad's equipment is being operated over the track by a different railroad's crew. In this case, the railroad of the crew operating the equipment will enter the freight train-miles on their FRA Form 12. Passenger Train-Miles Enter the number of train-miles, in passenger service, run during the month. 13. Yard Switching Train-Miles Enter the number of yard switc hing miles run during the month. 14. Other Train-Miles Enter any other train-miles run that are not included in freight, passenger, or yard switching train-miles. 15. Railroad Worker [Employee] Hours Enter the number of hours worked by all railroad employees during the month. Include all employees in the occupation cat egories shown in Appendix D. Do not include time paid, but not actually worked, such as holidays or vacations. Only those hours worked by employees defined as \"Class A\" are to be counted. Hours worked by volunteers, contract ors, etc., are excluded. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 32 F 6180.55 16. Passenger-Miles Operated If your railroad operates a rail passenge r service, enter the number of passenger- miles run during the month. If passenger-miles are shown, the number of passengers transported must be entered in Item 17. Please take special care when recording information on passenger service. Our data verification procedures examin e the relationship among the number of passenger train-miles reported in Item 12, the number of passenger miles reported in Item 16, and the number of passengers tr ansported as reported in Item 17. If any of these items contains an entry great er than 0, then it is generally assumed that all three items must have a count . A simple example of a single train movement can demonstrate this: A pa ssenger train containing 250 passengers traveled from point A to point B for a distance of 100 miles. This would be recorded as 100 passenger train-mile s; 25,000 passenger miles (250 passengers x 100 miles); and 250 passengers transported. 17. Number of Passengers Transported Enter the number of passengers transporte d by rail for the month being reported. 18. Reported Casualties Reportable casualties to all types of pers ons are to be reported on this form and are to be categorized according to the t ype of person. All fatalities, including those due to illness, are to be recorded in the appropriate blocks under the \"Fatal\" column. All remaining cases, including nonf atal occupational illnesses, are to be shown under the \"Nonfatal\" column. If no reportable casualties occurred during the report month, enter the word \"None\" for the \"Grand Total.\" All casualties shown must also be reported i ndividually on Form FRA F 6180.55a. Each person is to be classifi ed as one of the following: a. Worker on Duty-Railroad Employee (Class A), b. Railroad Employee Not On Duty (Class B), c. Passengers on Trains (Class C), d. Nontrespassers-On Railroad Property (Class D), e. Trespassers (Class E), f. Worker on Duty-Cont ractor (Class F), g. Contractor-Other (Class G), h. Worker on Duty-Volunteer (Class H), FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 33 F 6180.55 i. Volunteer-Other (Class I), and j. Nontrespassers-Off Railroad Property (Class J). Casualties, due to suicides and attempted suicid es, that meet the gene ral reporting criteria shall also be included in the casualty count. Th ere is no special category for reporting suicide or attempted suicide counts. A casua lty due to a suicide or attempte d suicide is an incident that happens to a person. The injury to an employee on duty that attempts suicide should be counted as a Worker on Duty-Railroad Employee (Class A) . The fatality to a trespasser that commits suicide should be counted as a Trespasser (Class E). 19. Number of FRA Forms Attached List the number of FRA report form s completed during the month: F 6180.54 Enter the number of forms used to report collisions, derailments, and similar events when a rail equipment accident/incident is being reported. F 6180.55a Enter the number of forms used to record reportable casualties. If, during the report month, a person is injured and dies on the following day, or on any day prior to the end of the month, this should be reported as a fatality on Form FRA F 6180.55a. F 6180.56 Enter the number of forms used to report employee hours and casualties. This is usually \"0\"for each month, except for December, where \"1\" is normally entered. F 6180.57 Enter the number of forms used to report impacts between railroad and highway users at crossings. F 6180.81 Enter the number of Employee Human Factor Attachments which are attached. 20. Remarks Section Enter any remarks, including explanations for unusual fluctuations in train-miles operated; employee hours; passenger count s, etc.; or operati onal characteristics that result in contradict ory or confusing counts (for example, train-miles are reported, but there are no railro ad worker [employee] hours). FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 34 F 6180.55 3.4 Common Reporting Errors Missing Data. If the information required for an item is not available at the time a report is to be filed, an estimate should be used. Later, if it is determined that the actual value was substantially different from the estimated value, an amended report must be forwarded. Math Errors. The total number and distribution of cas ualties reported must agree with the sum of the individual casualties on Form FRA F 6180.55a. Contradictory Information. If employee casualties are reporte d, the number of railroad worker hours cannot be \"0.\" If Rail Equipment Accident /Incident Reports (Form FR A F 6180.54) or Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Reports (Form FRA F 6180.57) were prepared for accidents/incidents involving moving trains, th e total number of mile s run during the month cannot be \"0.\" If the entry in \"Passenger-Miles Operated\" is greater than \"0,\" the entry in \"Number of Passengers Transported\" cannot be \"0,\" and vice versa. If passenger casualties ar e reported, the entry in \"Number of Passengers Transported\" cannot be \"0.\" 3.5 Submission and Retention Railroads must submit a hard copy of the Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Form FRA F 6180.55), signed under pe nalty of perjury by the railroad's re porting officer. In lieu of the hardcopy, a railroad may su bmit to FRA, via email at aireports@frasafety.net , an electronic image of the completed and signed hardcopy form, in . pdf or .jpg format s only. See \u00a7 225.37(b)(3). If a railroad submits the form(s) to FR A electronically, vi a the Internet, the railroad must retain the original signed hardcopy submissi on for at least 5 years after the calendar year to which it pertains. See \u00a7 225.27. If the submission is made using th e Internet, the railroad must also re tain a hardcopy of FRA's acknowledgement of rece ipt for a period of 5 years. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 35 F 6180.98 4. Form FRA F 6180.98 - Railroad Empl oyee Injury and/or Illness Record 4.1 Requirement Each railroad shall maintain either the Railroa d Employee Injury and/or Illness Record (Form FRA F 6180.98) or an alternative railroad-designe d record of all reporta ble and all accountable injuries and illnesses of its employees. Include reportable and accountable injuries and illnesses of railroad employees (that is, Worker on Duty -Railroad Employee (Class A) or Railroad Employee Not On Duty (Class B)). See \u00a7\u00a7 225.25(a)-( b). Do not include injuries or illnesses of volunteers or contractors. See also \u00a7 225.3 regarding certain railro ads exempted from the duty to record \"accountables.\" Accountable injury or illness means any abnormal condition or di sorder of a railroad employee regardless of whether it meets the general re porting criteria listed in \u00a7 225.119(d)(1) through (d)(6), when such injury or il lness causes or requires the railr oad employee to be examined or treated by a qualified healthcare professional, and the railroad employee claims that, or the railroad otherwise has knowledge that, the a bnormal condition or disorder is work-related. The alternative railroad-designed record may be used in lieu of the Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record (Form FR A F 6180.98). Any such alternative record shall contain all of the information required on the Railroad Employ ee Injury and/or Illne ss Record. Although this information may be displayed in a different or der from that on the Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record, th e order of the information shall be co nsistent from one such record to another such record. The order chosen by the railroad shall be consistent for each of the railroad's reporting establishments. Railroads may list additional inform ation on the alternative record, beyond the information required on the Railro ad Employee Injury and/ or Illness Record. Furthermore, railroads may use their alternative record to collect inform ation on conditions that do not meet the \"accountable\" or \"reportable\" defi nitions, or to make entries for individuals other than employees of the railroad. (See que stion Q4 and corresponding answer in Chapter 1 for additional guidance.) It would be difficult, if not impossible, for a railro ad to monitor self-treatme nt of minor injuries. Thus, the type of injuries that are generally expected to be recorded on the Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record (Form FRA F 6180.98) are those that create a \"documentation trail.\" This documentation could include records such as incident reports, hea lthcare provider records, or any other records that may identify the fact that an empl oyee has sustained physical harm while in the work environment that required ex amination or treatment by a qualified healthcare professional. See \u00a7 225.5, definition of \"accountable injury or illness.\" This broad scope is necessary since all conditions, re gardless of severity, must be evaluated to determine if the requirements necessary for reporting th e injury/illness have been met. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 36 F 6180.98 A primary purpose for the recordi ng of accountable cases is to es tablish a standardized set of data that the reporting officer will use in deciding whether to repor t a case. It also serves as a tool for FRA Safety Assurance and Compliance officers to use dur ing reviews to determine if proper reporting decisions are being made. Once it ha s been determined that a particular case is reportable and has been forwarded on Form FRA F 6180.55a, it is no l onger necessary to continue to update this record ; however, the railroad should u pdate \"Was the case reported?\" on Form FRA F 6180.98 (or update, in th e alternative railroad-designe d record, if a Form FRA F 6180.55a has been filed with FRA). Changes to c ounts of days absent or restricted duty are to be made on Form FRA F 6180.55a , not Form FRA F 6180.98. Each railroad shall enter each reportable and each accountable injury and illness on the appropriate record as early as practicable, but no later than 7 working days after receiving information or acquiring knowledge that an inju ry or illness has occu rred. See \u00a7 225.25(f). Railroads must create a Form FRA F 6180.98 for employee fatalities an d injuries due to suicides and attempted suicides that are accountable or reportable. The records described above may be maintained at the local establishment or, alternatively, at a centralized location. If the r ecords are maintained at a centr alized location, but not through electronic means, then a paper copy of the records that is current within 35 days of the month to which it applies shall be available for that estab lishment. If the records are maintained at a centralized location through electronic means, then the record s for that establishment shall be available for review in a hardcopy format w ithin 4 business hours of FRA's request. FRA recognizes that circumstances outside the railro ad's control may preclude it from fulfilling the 4 business-hour time limit. In these circumstan ces, FRA will not assess a monetary penalty against the railroad for its failure to provide the requested documentation provided the railroad makes a reasonable effort to corre ct the problem. See \u00a7 225.25(g). Do not submit this form or an alternate railroad-d esigned record. If a case is determined to be reportable, it must be recorded on Form FRA F 6180.55a and included with the reports filed for that month. The information required to be recorded on Form FRA F 6180.98 is self-explanatory; therefore, specific instructions for completion are not neede d. However, it is important to note that the \"Case/Incident Number\" identified in Block 2 must be used on Form FRA F 6180.55a for any case determined to be reportable. The alternative record shall contain, at a minimum, the following information: 1. Name of railroad. 2. Case/incident number. 3. Full name of railroad employee. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 37 F 6180.98 4. Date of birth of railroad employee. 5. Gender of railroad employee. 6. Railroad employee identification (ID) number. 7. Date the railroad employee was hired. 8. Home address of railroad employee, including the street address, cit y, State, zip code, and home telephone number with area code. 9. Name of facility wh ere railroad employee normally reports to work. 10. Address of facility where railroad empl oyee normally reports to work, including the street address, city, State, and zip code. 11. Job title of railroad employee. 12. Department assigned. 13. Specific site where accident/incident/exposur e occurred, including the city, county, State, and zip code. 14. Date and time of occurrence, indicat ed using military time or a.m./p.m.. 15. Time employee's shift began, indicated using military time or a.m./p.m.. 16. Whether employee was on premis es when injury occurred. 17. Whether employee was on or off duty. 18.

Description of the genera l activity this employee was engaged in prior to the injury/illness/condition. 21. Description of all factors asso ciated with the case that ar e pertinent to an understanding of how it occurred. Include a discussion of the sequence of events leading up to it, and the tools, machinery, processes, material, environmental conditions, etc., involved (When appropriate, a railroad must indicate that an employee fatality or injury is considered \"suicide data\" in this the narrative section). 22. Description, in detail, of the injury/illness/condition that the employee sustained, including the body parts affected. If a recurrence, list the date of the last occurrence. 23. Identification of all persons and organizations used to eval uate or treat the condition, or both. Include the facility, provi der, and complete address. 24. Description of all procedures, medications, therapy, etc., used or recommended for the treatment of the condition. 25.

Each railroad shall indicate if the Railr oad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet) (FRA Form F 6180.55a) has been filed with FRA for the injury or illness. If FRA Form F 6180.55a was not filed with FRA, then the railroad shall pr ovide an explanation of the basis for its decision. 27. The railroad shall indicate if the injure d or ill railroad employee was provided an opportunity to review his or her file. 28. The railroad shall identify the preparer's name, title, te lephone number with area code, and the date the record was initially signed/completed. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 39 F 6180.97 5. Form FRA F 6180.97 - Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record 5.1 Requirement Each railroad shall maintain an Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record (Form FRA F 6180.97) or an alternative railroad -designed record as described in the following section, of all reportable and accountable rail equipment accidents/ incidents. An accountable rail equipment accident/incident means (1) any derailment rega rdless of whether it causes any damage or (2) any collision, highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident, obstruction accident, other impact, fire or violent rupture, explosion-de tonation, act of God, or other accident/incident involving the operation of railroad on-track equipment (standing or moving) that results in damage to the railroad on-track equipment (stand ing or moving), signals, track, track structures or roadbed and that damage impairs the functioni ng or safety of the rail road on-track equipment (standing or moving), signals, track, track structures or roadbed. See \u00a7\u00a7 225.21(i) and 225.25(d)-(g). See also \u00a7 225.3 regarding cert ain railroads exempted from recording \"accountables.\" The alternative railroad-designed record may be used in lieu of the Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record (Form FRA F 6180.97). A ny such alternative reco rd shall contain all of the information required on th e Initial Rail Equipment Acci dent/Incident Record. Although this information may be displayed in a different order from that on the Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record, the orde r of the information shall be c onsistent from one such record to another such record. The or der chosen by the railroad shall be consistent for each of the railroad's reporting establishments. Railroads ma y list additional informa tion in the alternative record beyond the information requi red on the Initial Rail Equipmen t Accident/Incident Record. Where there are joint operations, each railroad involved must contact al l parties involved to determine the extent of the damages for determini ng reportability. If the property of more than one railroad is involved in an accident/incide nt, the reporting threshold is calculated by including the damages sustained by all of the railroads involved. When total reportable damage to all railroads directly invol ved in an accident/incident exceeds the reporting threshold, the railroad must make a report even though its damages were below the threshold. Any railroad indicating the involve ment of another railroad in the accident on its Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident R ecord must promptly notify th e other carrier (FRA may be contacted to obtain telephone num bers) and exchange informati on concerning the accident and obtain the other carriers' reportable damage. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 40 F 6180.97 The alternative record shall contain, at a minimum, the following information: 1. Date and time of accident. 2. Reporting railroad, and accident/incident number. 3. Other railroad, if applicable, and othe r railroad's accident/incident number. 4. Railroad responsible for track maintenance, and that railroad's incident number. 5. The classification of a rail equipment accident/incident by type, which is determined by the first event in the accident/incident sequence. For example, if, following a derailment, a derailed car or locomotive strikes a consist on an adjacent track, the accident/incident would be classified as a derailment, not a collision or other impact. The valid clas sification of accidents/incidents are as follows: Derailment Highway-rail crossing collision Head-on collision Railroad grade crossing collision Rear-end collision Obstruction Side collision Explosion-detonation Raking collision Fire/violent rupture Broken train collision Other impacts Other (describe in narrative) 6. Number of cars carrying hazardous material s that derailed or were damaged, and number of cars carrying hazardous ma terials that released product. 7. Subdivision: The full name of the subdivision on whic h the accident occu rred, i.e. the track owner's subdivision name. If the railro ad is not so divided, enter the word \"system.\" In the event of a joint accident involving Amtrak, the host railroad's subdivision will apply. Note: If the accident occurred in a major terminal and subdivision is not applicable, enter \"Terminal/Yard Name.\" 8. Nearest city or town. 9. County (added in 2003). 10. State. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 41 F 6180.97 11. Milepost (to the nearest tenth). 12. Specific site. 13. Speed (indicate if ac tual or estimate). 14. Train number or job number. 15. Type of equipment (freight, pa ssenger, yard switching, etc.). 16. Type of track (main, yard, siding, industry). 17. Total number of locomotives in train. 18. Total number of locomotives that derailed. 19. Total number of cars in train. 20. Total number of cars that derailed. 21. Total amount of damage in dollars to e quipment for this accident/incident-based on computations as descri bed in this Guide: Enter the total amount of damage to a ll of the consists involved in this accident/incident, and if there are other ra ilroads involved in this accident/incident that have equipment damages, add this to the total. Then, in the narrative provide a breakdow n of the damages by each railroad. Note: For railroads that are using the AI RG software application to maintain their accident/incident data, AIRG will be modified to accept both sets of information (i.e., the tota l amount of damage to th e railroad's equipment, and the total amount of damage to th e railroad's equipment added to all other of the railroad's equipment damage). 22. Total amount of damage in dollars to track, signal, way, and structures based on computations as described in this Guide. Enter the total amount of damage, in dollars, to the track, signal, way, and structures for the accident/incident. If another railroad is responsible for maintaining the track on which the accident /incident occurred, contact this carrier to obtain the cost of damages to the trac k, signals, roadbed, track structures, etc., then keep this amount for the Initial Rail Equipment A ccident/Incident Record. 23. Primary cause. Enter into this field the most applicable cause code that describes the cause of the accident fr om Appendix C, \"Train Accident Cause Codes.\" The instructions for entry into this field ar e the same as for Item 38 of FRA Form F 6180.54, as shown in Chapter 7. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 42 F 6180.97 24. Contributing cause. Enter into this fiel d the most applicable cause code that describes the contributing cause of the accident from Appendix C, \"Train Accident Cause Codes.\" The instructions fo r entry into this field are the same as for Item 39 of FRA Form F 6180.54, as shown in Chapter 7. 25. Number of persons injured and person s killed, broken down into the following classifications: worker on duty-railroad employee, railroad employee not on duty, passenger on train, nontrespasser-on ra ilroad property, trespasser, worker nontrespasser\u2014off Note: fatalities, due to suic ides and attempted suicides, that meet the general reporting criter ia shall also be included in this field. 26. Narrative description of the accident: Enter a description of the accident, in cluding a list of the breakdown of the equipment damages incurred by each railroad for the accident/incident, and specify which consist this specific Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record is for. The breakdown is as follows: Railroad (Enter Code) - Each consis t's equipment damages (e.g., Consist A equipment damage, Consist B equipment da mage, etc.), and all other railroads (Enter Codes) and their equipment damages. Note: Where an accountable or reportabl e rail equipment accident/incident is caused by a suicide or attempted suicide, the ra ilroad shall indicate that fact in this field. 27. Whether the accident/incident was repor ted to FRA: If the rail equipment accident/incident exceeds the current threshold limit and a Form FRA F 6180.54 is being submitted, specify \"Yes.\" For highway-rail grade crossing accidents/incidents (which are always re portable), and other non-reportable rail equipment accidents/incidents, specify \"N o\"; however, if a highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident's damages exceed the current threshold, then specify \"Yes.\" 28. Preparer's name, title, telephone number with area code, and signature. 29. Date the record was in itially signed/completed. Each railroad shall enter each reportable and accountable rail equipment accident/incident on the appropriate record as early as practicable, but no later than 7 working days after receiving information or acquiring knowledge that a rail eq uipment accident/incident has occurred. See \u00a7 225.25(f). FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 43 F 6180.97 The records described above may be maintained at the local establishment or, alternatively, at a centralized location. If the r ecords are maintained at a centr alized location, but not through electronic means, then a paper copy of the records that is current, within 35 days of the month to which it applies, shall be available for that establishment. If the records are maintained at a centralized location through electronic means, then the record s for that establishment shall be available for review in a hardcopy format w ithin 4 business hours of FRA's request. FRA recognizes that circumstances outside the railro ad's control may preclude it from fulfilling the 4-business-hour time limit. In these circumstan ces, FRA will not assess a monetary penalty against the railroad for its failure to provide the requested documentation, provided the railroad makes a reasonable effort to corre ct the problem. See \u00a7 225.25(g). Do not submit this form or an alternate railroad-des igned record. If an inci dent is determined to be reportable, it must be recorded on Form FRA F 6180.54 and must be in cluded with the reports filed for that month. If there are any reportable casualties, they must be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a. Once a determination has been made that the rail equipment accident/incident has become reportable, any further updating s hould be done on the Form FRA F 6180.54, and you need not update Form FRA F 6180.97; however, you should go back and check off \"Yes\" for Item 32 (or equivalent item on alternative ra ilroad-designed record) of Form FRA F 6180.97 \"Was this accident reported to FRA?\" It is important to note that th e \"Case/Incident Number\" identified in Block 4 must be used on Form FRA F 6180.54 and/or Form FRA F 6180.57 for any case determined to be reportable. 5.2 Questions and Answers Q1. A coupler broke during a switching operation, and the cars behind the broken coupler hit the train it separate d from. Would this event mean that the railroad should complete the Init ial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record? A1. This event would qualify as a broken train co llision. As this is a collision, if there is damage and that damage impairs the functioning or safety of the railroad on- track equipment (standing or moving), signa ls, track, track stru ctures, or roadbed involved, then the railroad would be required to complete an Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Inciden t Record, Form FRA F 6180.97 . If the reportable damages exceed the annual reporting threshold, then Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report Form FRA F 6180.54 must also be completed and submitted to FRA. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 44 F 6180.97 Q2. Our switch crew had a minor derailme nt involving one set of wheels of one car. Would this event qualif y for the Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record? A2. This event would qualify as a derailment and, as such, it is an accountable rail equipment accident/incident. Therefore, an Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record, Form FRA F 6180.97, must be completed. If the reportable damages exceed the annual reporting threshold, then the Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report Form FRA F 6180.54 must be completed and submitted to FRA. Q3. What about highway-rail grade crossing accidents? Would these events qualify for the Initial Rail Equipm ent Accident/Incident Record? A3. All highway-rail grade cr ossing accidents/incidents mu st be reported to FRA on Form FRA F 6180.57. An Initial Rail E quipment Accident/Incident Record, Form FRA F 6180.97, must be completed if the highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident also results in an accountable or reportable rail equipment accident/incident. If the reportabl e damages exceed the annual reporting threshold, then the Rail Equipment A ccident/Incident Report Form FRA F 6180.54 must also be completed and submitted to FRA. Q4. Our mechanical department personne l reported that they fixed a broken trainline bracket on a box car. It a ppears that the bracket broke because of normal wear and tear, and was not the result of an accident. Would events like this qualify for an Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record? A4. No, if there is no evidence of an accident/incident, e.g., collision, derailment, fire, explosion/detonation, obstru ction incident, other impac t, etc., and the damage resulted from normal wear and tear, then an Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record, Form FRA F 6180.97, is not required. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 45 F 6180.55a 6. Form FRA F 6180.55a - Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet) 6.1 Requirement As set forth in \u00a7 225.11 and \u00a7 225.19(d), each death, in jury, or occupational i llness that is a new case and meets the general reporti ng criteria listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(6) of this Section shall be reported to FRA on Form FRA F 6180.55a, Ra ilroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet), if an event or exposure arising from the operation of a railroad is a discernable cause of the resul ting condition or a discernable cause of a significant aggravation to a preexisting injury or illness. The event or exposure arising from the operation of a railroad need only be one of the discernabl e causes; it need not be the sole or predominant cause. A new case is presumed work-related if an event or exposu re arising from the operation of a railroad is a contributing factor to the injury, illness, or significan t aggravation of a preexisting condition. If it is not obvious whether the precipitating even t or exposure arose from the operation of a railroad or elsewhere, the railroad must eval uate the circumstances surrounding the injury or illness (e.g., work duties, environment, etc.) to deci de whether it is more likely than not that one or more events or exposures arising from the ope ration of a railroad contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggrav ated a preexisting condition. The general injury/illness reporting criteria are as follows: (1) Death to any person; (2) Injury to any person that results in: (i) Medical treatment; (ii) Significant injury diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional even if it does not result in death, medical treatment or loss of consciousness of any person; or (iii) Loss of consciousness; (3) Injury to a railroad employee that results in: (i) A day away from work; (ii) Restricted work activ ity or job transfer; or (iii) Significant injury diagnosed by a physician or other li censed health care professional even if it does not result in death, medical treatment, loss of consciousness, a day away from work, restricted work activity or j ob transfer of a railroad employee; (4) Occupational illness of a rail road employee that results in: (i) A day away from work; (ii) Restricted work ac tivity or job transfer; (iii) Loss of consciousness; or (iv) Medical treatment; FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 46 F 6180.55a (5) Significant illness of a railroad employee diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional even if it does not result in death, a day aw ay from work, restricted work activity or job transfer, medical tr eatment, or loss of consciousness; (6) Illness or injury that: (i) Meets the application of any of the following specific case criteria: (A) Needlestick or sharps inju ry to a railroad employee; (B) Medical removal of a railroad employee; (C) Occupational hearing lo ss of a railroad employee; (D) Occupational tuberculosis of a railroad employee; (E) Musculoskeletal disorder of a railroad employee if this diso rder is reportable under one or more of the general re porting criteria; or (ii) Is a covered data case. 6.2 Reporting Exceptions In accordance with \u00a7 225.15(a), the following ac cidents/incidents are not reportable: (a) Persons other than railroad employees . A railroad is not to re port injuries that occur at highway-rail grade crossings that do not involve the presence or operation of on-track equipment, or the presence of railroad employees then engaged in the operation of a railroad; (b) Employees on Duty . A railroad is not to report the fo llowing injuries to or illnesses of a railroad employee as Worker on Duty - Employ ee (Class A), if any of the following conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3 ) of this section are met. This exception does not affect a railroad's obligation to report these injuries as other types of persons (i.e. Employee Not On Duty (Class B); Passengers On Trains (Class C); Nontresspassers - On Railroad Property (Class D)), or a railroad's obligation to maintain a \"Railroad Employee Injury/Illness Record\" (Form FRA F 6180.98 or alternative railroad-designed form). (1) The injury or illness occurred in or about living quarters not arising from the operation of a railroad; (2) At the time of the injury or illness, the employee was present in the work environment as a member of the general public rather than as an employee; or (3) The injury or illness is caused by a moto r vehicle accident and occurs on a company parking lot or company access road while th e employee is commuting to or from work. (c) Employees on or off Duty. A railroad is not to report the following injuries to or illnesses of a railroad employee, Worker on Du ty - Employee (Class A) or Employee Not On Duty (Class B), if any of the following conditions in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7 ) of this section are met. (1) The injury or illness involves signs or sy mptoms that surface at work but result solely from a non-work-related event or exposure th at occurs outside the work environment; FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 47 F 6180.55a (2) The injury or illness results solely fr om voluntary participati on in a wellness program or in a medical, fitness, or re creational activity such as blood donation, physical examination, flu vaccination shot, exercise class, racquetball, or baseball; (3) The injury or illness is solely the result of an employ ee eating, drinking, or preparing food or drink for personal consumption. Note: Ho wever, if the employee is made ill by ingesting food contaminated by workplace contaminants (suc h as lead), or gets food poisoning from food supplied by the employer, the case would be consid ered reportable if the case meets the general reporting criteria set forth at \u00a7225.19(d)(1)-(d)(6), and reported as either a Worker on Duty - Employee (Class A) or Employee not on Duty (Class B) depending on the employee's duty status; (4) The injury or illness is solely th e result of an employee doing personal tasks (unrelated to their employment) at the establis hment outside of the employee's assigned working hours; (5) The injury or illness is solely the re sult of personal grooming, self medication for a non-work-related condition, or is intentionally self-i nflicted (except that for FRA reporting purposes a railroad shall not exclude an accountable or reportable injury or illness that is the result of a suicide or attempted suicide); (6) The illness is the common co ld or flu (Note: contagious di seases such as tuberculosis, brucellosis, hepatitis A, or pl ague are considered work-related if the employee is infected at work); or (7) The illness is a mental illness. Ment al illness will not be considered work-related unless the employee voluntarily prov ides the employer with an opinion from a physician or other licensed health care professional with appropr iate training and experi ence (psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nur se practitioner, etc.) stating that the employee has a mental illness that is work-related. (d) Contractors and volunteers . A railroad is not to report injuries to contractors and volunteers that are listed in para graphs (b) and (c) of this secti on. For purposes of this paragraph only, an exception listed in paragraphs (b) and (c ) referencing \"work environment\" is construed to mean for contractors and volunteers only, on property owned, lease d, operated over or maintained by the railroad for railroad operations. (e) Rail equipment accident/incidents. The following exceptions do not impact the railroad's obligation to maintain records of accidents/incidents as required by \u00a7 225.25 (Form FRA F 6180.97, \"Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record\"), as applicable. A railroad is not to report the following rail equipment accidents/incidents: (1) Cars derailed on industry tracks by non-ra ilroad employees or non-railroad employee vandalism, providing there is no involv ement of railroad employees; and (2) Damage to out of service cars resu lting from high water or flooding (e.g., empties placed on a storage or repair track). This excepti on does not apply if such cars are placed into a moving consist and as a result of this damage a reportable rail equipment accident results. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 48 F 6180.55a 6.3 Suicide Data Suicides and attempted suicides are no longer exceptions to FRA's re porting requirements and must be reported to FRA as \"suicide data\" on Form FRA 6180.55a when the casualty meets the general reporting criteria. Therefore, a railroad must evaluate the injury or fatality to determine whether it needs to create a report. Although se lf-inflicted wounds not inflicted for the purpose of committing suicide are still excluded (i.e., an employee intentionally cuts his hand without intending to kill himself). See \u00a7 225.15(c)(5). Suicide data is data regarding the death of an indi vidual due to that individual's commission of suicide as determined by a coroner, public police officer or other publ ic authority; or injury to an individual due to that individual's attempted commission of suicide as determined by a public police officer or other public aut hority. A railroad police officer is not considered a public police officer within the meaning of the term. A pub lic authority is a Federal, State, or local governmental agency with the legal authority to declare a casualty a su icide or an attempted suicide. Only the death of or injury to th e individual who committed the suicidal act is considered to be suicide data. Therefore, an injury or fatality cause d to a person by another person who committed suicide or attempted to commit suicide is not suicide data. For example, if the impact between the railroad on-track e quipment and a highway user occurred because the highway user committed or attempted to commit suicide (as determined by a coroner, public police officer, or other public au thority), the death of or injury to that highway user must be reported to FRA. A railroad may accept verbal confirmation from the coroner, public police officer, or other public authority of the cause of the fatality or injury. Where a railroad receiv es verbal confirmation, it must document that confirmation in writing and create an audit trail so that FRA may confirm the cause of the casualty at a later time. The a udit trail should include, but is not limited to, documentation of the name of the public police officer, coroner, or other public authority determining cause of death, his or her title, th e date of confirmation, for whom the individual works, and the individual's telephone number and mailing address. When appropriate, railroads must report suicide data on Forms FRA F 6180.55a, FRA F 6180.54, and FRA F 6180.57, as follows: 1. Form FRA F 6180.55a-Place an \"X\" representative of \"suicide or attempted suicide\" in Block 5r. 2. Form FRA F 6180.54-Place the foll owing Miscellaneous Cause Codes, as applicable, in Block 38: (a) Code M309 \"Suicide (Highway -Rail Grade Crossing Ac cident)\"; (b) Code M310 \"Attempted Suicide (Highway-Rail Gr ade Crossing Accident )\"; (c) M509 \"Suicide (Other Misc.)\"; and (d) Code M510 \"Attempted Suicide (Other Misc.).\" These codes can be found in Appendix C, \"Train A ccident Cause Codes\" to this Guide. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 49 F 6180.55a 3. Form FRA F 6180.57-Mark in Block 41, \"Driver Action,\" the selection for \"Suicide or Attempted Suicide.\" Include the suicides and attempted suicides in the casualty counts in Blocks 46, 49, and 52, as applicable. When applicable, railroads must record/report suicide data on the below forms as follows: 1. Form FRA F 6180.97: A railroad shall include casualties that result from suicides and attempted suicides in the casualty count. In addition, where an accountable or reportable rail equipment accident/incident is caused by a suicide or attempted suicide, the railroad shall indicate that fact in the narrative field. 2. Form FRA F 6180.98: A railroad must indi cate in the narrative section that the accountable or reportable injury or fatality resulted from the person's suicidal act. In addition, railroads must include suicide da ta in the casualty count on Form FRA F 6180.55. FRA will maintain suicide data in a database that is not publically accessible. FRA will not include suicide data (as defined in \u00a7 225.5) in its periodic summ aries of data on the number injuries and illnesse s associated with railroad operations. See \u00a7 225.41, Suicide Data. Suicide data will not be available on FRA's Web site for individual reports or downloads. Suicide data will, however, be ava ilable to the public in aggregate format on FRA's website and via requests under the Fr eedom of Information Act (FOIA). For additional information on FOIA re quests, see FRA's Web site at http://www.fra.dot.gov/us/foia. FRA will not re port suicide data to DOL. Suicide data will also be available to FRA inspectors and St ate agencies participating in investigative activities under part 212. See \u00a7 225.31. States will also be able to obtain individual reports directly from the railroads pursuant to \u00a7 225.1. See \u00a7 225.1. 6.4 Covered Data Covered data is information that must be reported to FRA so that FRA's reporting requirements remain consistent with OSHA. Covered data c oncerns railroad employee injuries or illnesses that are reportable exclusively because a physician or other lice nsed health care professional: 1. Recommends in writing that: a. The employee take 1 or more days away from work when the employee instead reports to work (or would have reported had he or she been scheduled) and takes no days away from work in connection with th e injury or illness a nd returns to full duty (no restricted days); b. The employee work restricted duty for 1 or more days when the employee instead works unrestricted (or would have worked unr estricted had he or she been scheduled) and takes no days of restricted work activity in connection w ith the injury or illness; FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 50 F 6180.55a c. The employee take over-the-counter (OTC) medication at a dosage equal to or greater than the minimum prescription strength, wh ether or not the employee actually takes the medication; or 2. Makes a one-time topical application of a prescription-strengt h medication to the employee's injury. Although \"covered data\" cases will be retained in the files and will be accessible on FRA's Web site, these cases will not be incl uded in the casualty counts found in FRA's regular publications, e.g., Annual Report of Railro ad Safety Statistics. 6.5 Employee On-Duty Injury/Illness Reporting Basic Requirement. See Chapter 6.1 of this Guide. See also \u00a7 225.11 and \u00a7 225.19(d), 6.5.1 Questions and Answers on Employee On-Duty Injury/Illness Reporting Q1. What if the injury was caused by the employee's own negligence or was a result of events beyond the railroad's control, e.g., an employee was assaulted by a trespasser, or two employees were engaged in horseplay. Would this make a difference in terms of whether the injury or illness must be reported? A1. No. Responsibility or fault is not a consideration when deciding whether to report. FRA notes that many circumstances that lead to a reportable work-related injury or illness are \"bey ond the employer's control,\" at least as that phrase is commonly interpreted. Nevertheless, becau se such an injury or illness was caused, contributed to, or significantly aggr avated by an event or exposure arising from the operation of the railroad, it must be reported (assuming that it meets one or more of the reporting criteria and does not qualify for a reporting exception under \u00a7 225.15.) This approach is consis tent with the no-fault reporting system FRA has adopted, which includes work-relate d injuries and illnesses, regardless of the level of employe r control involved. The following do not affect reportability if there is evidence an employee was injured or made ill while in the work environment: 1. The event or exposure was not witnessed. 2. The employee did not immediat ely notify a supervisor. 3. The employee did not require medical treatment at the time of the condition. 4. The condition was the result of an employee's error. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 51 F 6180.55a 5. The condition was caused by outside fact ors, e.g., assault on an employee, an insect or animal bite, lighten ing strike, other act of nature. 6. The condition did not meet all the nece ssary conditions for reporting at the time of the initial event, activity, or exposure. 7. The condition was the culminati on of a series of activities. 8. The employee cannot specifi cally identify when or how he or she was injured. Q2. How do I decide whether a particular injury or illness of an employee on duty is reportable? A2. The following decision tree shows the basic steps involved in making this determination: Did the employee experience an injury or illness? Is the injury or illness work- related? Is the injury or illness a new case? No Update the previously reported injury or illness entry if necessary. Does the injury or illness meet the general reporting criteria or the application to specific cases? Do not report the injury or illness (may require Form FRA F 6180.98 ). No No Report the injury or illness on form FRA F 6180.55a. YesYes Yes YesNo FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 52 F 6180.55a 6.6 Determination of Work-Relatedness You must consider an injury or illness to be work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment discernibly caused or contributed to the resulting condition, or if an event or exposure occurring in the work envi ronment is a discernable cause of a significant aggravation to a preexisting injury or illness. The work event or exposure need only be one of the causes of, or contributors to, the resulting injury or illness; it need not be the sole or predominant cause or contributor. Work-relatedness is presumed for injuries and illnesses resulting from events or exposures occurring in the work environment, even if the injury or illn ess does not have a clear connection to a specific work activity or is not occupational in nature. Injuries and illnesses that occur at work may not have a clear connection to a specific work activity, condition, or substance that is peculiar to the employment environment. For example, an employee may trip for no apparent reason wh ile walking across a level factory floor; be sexually assaulted by a co-worker; or be injured accidentally as a result of an act of violence perpetrated by one co-worker agai nst a third party. In these and similar cases, the employee's job-related tasks or exposures did not create or contribu te to the risk that such an injury would occur. Nevertheless, these cases are work-relate d. The causal connection is established by the fact that the injury would not have occurred but for the c onditions and obligations of employment that placed the employee in the positi on in which he or she was injured or made ill. An injury or illness is not reportable if the inju ry or illness involves signs or symptoms that manifest themselves at work but result solely from a non-work-related event or exposure that occurs outside the work environment. See reporting exceptions listed at \u00a7 225.15. If it is not obvious whether the precipitating event or exposure that caused or contributed to an injury or illness occurred in the work environm ent or elsewhere, the employer must evaluate the employee's work duties and environment to decide whether one or more events or exposures in the work environment caused or contributed to the resulting condi tion, or significantly aggravated a preexisting condition. As long as the event or expos ure occurred at work and is a discernable cause of the injury or illness or is a discernable caus e of a significant aggravation to a preexisting injury or illness, the injury or illness is work-related. If an injury is within the presumption of work-relatedness, the employer can rebut work-relatedness only by showing that the case falls within an excepti on listed in \u00a7 225.15. This means that the employer must make a determination as to whether it is more likely th an not that work events or exposures were a discernable cause of the injury or illness, or a discernable cause of a significant aggravation to a preexisting condition. The evalua tion might include consultation with an ergonomics expert as well as a PLHCP. A review of the job descrip tion, alone, is not sufficient without reviewing all of the employee's collateral duties. If the em ployer decides the case is not work-related, and FRA subsequently issues a citation for failure to report, the Government would have the burden of proving that the injury or illness was work-related. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 53 F 6180.55a 6.6.1 Interpretations on Work-Relatedness Scenario 1: An employer asks if an injury or illness sust ained by an on-duty employee while he or she is engaged in an activity, such as walking or bendi ng, is considered work-related. The employer notes that a case is presumed to be work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment discernibly caused or contributed to the injury or illness. The work event or exposure need only be one of the causes or contribu tions to the injury or illness; it need not be the sole or predominant cause. Response 1: The question employers must answer is whether there is an identif iable event or exposure that occurred in the work environment and resulted in th e injury or illness. Th us, if an employee trips while walking across a level shop floor, the resulti ng injury is considered work-related because the precipitating event \u2014the tripping accident \u2014occurred in the workplace. The case is work- related even if the employer cannot determin e why the employee tripped, or whether any particular workplace hazard caused the accident to occur. The activity engaged in by the employee at the time of the injury \u2014walking \u2014is an \"event\" that would trigger application of the presumption. Other examples of events include sneezing, climbing, tripping, and bending down. In the abse nce of evidence to overcome the presumption, the injury is work-related. Thus, in the abse nce of evidence to overcome the presumption, an ankle injury caused by a trip that occurred while the employee was walking down a level seamless hallway at work is work-related, regardle ss of whether the accident is attributable to a defect in the hall. By the same reasoning, if the activity of walking down a hallway caused the employee's knee to buckle or to sprain the ankle, the injury is work-related. If an injury or illness did not result from an identifiable event or exposure in the work environment, but only manifested itself during work, the injury is not work-related. For example, if the employee had a non-occupational event or exposure, and there is no evidence of a work-related event or exposure that caused or contributed to the injury or illness, the injury should not be reported. There is also the issue of whether the determ ination of work-relatedn ess is affected by an employee's preexisting condition. For reporting purposes, a preexisti ng condition is an injury or illness resulting solely from a non-work-related even t or exposure. If an employee's preexisting condition is worsened as a result of an event or exposure at work, the case is work-related if the work event or exposure \"significantly aggrav ated\" the preexisting cond ition (i.e., discernibly caused the case to meet any of the general criteria). If an employee with a previous work-related injury to a body pa rt suffers a subsequent work- related injury of the same type to the same body part, the subsequent injury is reportable (assuming the general reporting criteria are met) if it is a \"new case\" as described in this chapter. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 54 F 6180.55a If the subsequent injury is not a \"new case,\" then the railroad is required to update the previously submitted injury or illness report if necessary. Scenario 2: An employee reported to work at 7:00 a.m. At 12:15 p.m., the employee reported that his toes on his left foot started swelling and his foot started hurting. The employee wanted to go to a doctor for evaluation. On the first report of injury that the employ ee completed before he went to the doctor, the employee indicated that the cau se of the illness was \"unknown.\" When answering the doctor's question: \"How did the injury occur?,\" the employee answered that the only thing he could think of was that his feet were wet al l the previous day due to work in the morning at a cooling tower. The cooling tower water is treated to remove bacteria and then used in process operations in the plant. The doctor described the illness/injury as foot edema/cellulitis. The doctor also diagnosed the injury as an occupational disease, prescribed an antibiotic, and the employee missed 1 day of work. The company sent the employee to a s econd doctor who said to continue using the antibiotic. Neither doct or could state conclusively that the foot edema/cellulitis was or was not due to the employee's feet being wet due to work at the cooling tower. Neither doctor is a specialist in skin disorders. During an incident review at the site, the employ ee again said he did not know if his feet being wet all day the previous day cause d the injury/illness. The employ ee also stated that he had not worn the personal protective equipment\u2014r ubber boots\u2014prescribed for this task. The company determined that this injury/illne ss was not work-related (did not occur in the course of or as a result of employment), si nce neither physician nor the employee could state with certainty that the injury/illness was caused by the employee's feet being wet all day due to work at the cooling tower. Si nce the injury/illness was determined to not be work-related, the company deemed the incident non-reportable. Response 2: A case is work-related if it is more likely than not that an identifiable event or exposure in the work environment was a discernabl e cause of the injury or illne ss. The work event or exposure need only be one of the causes; it need not to be the sole or predominant cause. In this case, the fact that neither the physician nor the employee could state with absolu te certainty that the employee's edema was caused by working with wet f eet is not dispositive. In these situations, the railroad should evaluate th e surrounding circumstances and relevant information (i.e., the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 55 F 6180.55a physician's description of the ed ema as an \"occupational disease, \" the employee's statement that working with wet feet was \"the only thing he could of\" as the cause, the employee's medical history and events surrounding the in jury/illness) to determine whethe r it is more likely that the identifiable event (working with wet feet) was a ca use. The fact that the employee did not wear proper protective equipment is irrelevant for repor ting purposes. If the railroad determines that the case it reportable, the case must be recorded on the Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record, Form FRA F 6180.98, and reported to FRA on Form FRA F 6180.55a. Scenario 3: An employee was to report to work by 8:00 a.m. The employee drove into the company parking lot at 7:30 a.m. and parked the car. The employ ee exited the car and proceeded to the office to report to work. The parking lot and sidewalks are privately owned by the facility and both are within the property line, but not the controlled access points (i.e., fence, guards). The employee stepped onto the sidewalk and slipped on the snow and ice. The employee suffered a back injury and missed multiple days of work. The company believes that the employee was still in the process of the commute to work since the employee had not yet checked in at the office. Since a work task was not being performed, the site pers onnel deemed the incident not work-related and therefore not reportable. Response 3: Company parking lots and sidewa lks are part of the employer's establishment for injury/illness reporting purposes. In this case, the employee sl ipped on an icy sidewalk while walking to the office to report for work. In addition, the even t or exposure that occurre d does not meet any of the work-related exceptions. The employee was on the sidewalk because of work not because the employee was a member of the general public or a trespasser. The event or exposure occurred in the work environment and caused or c ontributed to the resultan t injury. Therefore, the case is work-related, regardless of the fact that he had not actually ch ecked in, and must be reported as a case involving a Railroad Empl oyee Not On Duty (Class B). See reporting exceptions listed at \u00a7 225.15. Scenario 4: An employee reports to work. Several hours late r, the employee goes outs ide for a \"smoke break and to get a pair of sunglasses from his truck.\" The employee slips on ice and injures his back. Since the employee was not performing tasks rela ted to the employee's work, the company has deemed this incident non-work-rela ted and therefore not reportable. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 56 F 6180.55a Response 4: An injury or illness is not work-related if it is solely the result of an employee doing personal tasks (unrelated to their employ ment) at the establishment outside of the employee's assigned working hours. See reporting exceptions listed at \u00a7 225.15. In order for this exception to apply, the case must meet both of the stated conditions . The exception does not apply here because the injury or illness occurred w ithin normal working hours as \"breaks\" during normal working hours are considered within assigned working hours. Th erefore, this case is work-related, and must be recorded on the Railroad Empl oyee Injury and/or Illness Record, Form FRA F 6180.98, and reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a. Scenario 5: An employee drove into the company parking lot at 7:30 a.m., exited his car, and proceeded to cross the parking lot to clock in to work. A second employee, also on the way to work, approached the first employee, and the two indi viduals got into a physi cal altercation in the parking lot. The first employee broke an arm dur ing the altercation. Th e employee went to the doctor and received medical treatment for his injury. The company deemed this a non-work-related inci dent, and therefore non- reportable, since the employees had not yet reported to work and a work task was not being performed at the time of the altercation. Response 5: The reporting requirements contain no general exception for purposes of determining work- relatedness for cases involving acts of violen ce in the work environment. Company parking lots/access roads are part of the employer's pr emises and therefore part of the employer's establishment. Whether the employee had not cloc ked in to work does not affect the outcome for determining work-relatedness. Therefore, this ca se is work-related and must be recorded on the Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness R ecord, Form FRA F 6180.98, and reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a. Scenario 6: An employee injured a knee performing work-re lated activities in 2005. The accident was FRA-reportable. The employee had arthroscopic knee surgery 11 months later and was released to full duty a month and a half af ter the arthroscopic surgery. The employee had a second knee injury 3 months afte r the return to work re lease (after the first surgery). After the second surgery, the doctor prescribed Vioxx \u00ae as an anti-inflammatory drug. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 57 F 6180.55a Approximately 1\u00bd months after the second knee surgery, the employee was given another full release to return to work full duty, and returned to work. However, the doctor told the employee to continue to take Vioxx\u00ae as prescribed (as needed) and to re turn to the doctor as needed. The employee scheduled a followup appointment with th e doctor. The day before the appointment, the employee bumped his knee at work. During hi s scheduled doctor's appointment (which was to be the last followup visit), the employee men tioned the latest incident (bumping the knee) to the doctor and showed him where the pain was occurring due to bumping his knee. The doctor stated that the employee had an inflamed tendon (Gra de 1 lateral collateral ligament sprain) that was not part of the initial surger y (patellar tendonitis). The doctor stated in the diagnosis that the original injury that required knee surgery was resolved. The doctor told the employee to continue taking Vioxx\u00ae for the inflamed tendon. Since the employee was already taking the medication prescribed (Vioxx\u00ae), the railroad does not believe this is reportable as a second incident. Response 6: In the accident/incident regulation and reporting guidelines, the employer is required to follow any determination a physician or other licensed h ealthcare professional has made about the status of a new case. The inflamed tendon is a new case because the employee had completely recovered from the previous injury and illness an d a new event or exposure had occurred in the work environment. Scenario 7: An employee knits a sweater for her daughter du ring a lunch break. She lacerates her hand and needs sutures. She is engaged in a personal task. Are lunch br eaks or other breaks considered \"assigned working hours?\" Is the case reportable? Response 7: This case must be reported because it does not meet the exception to work-relatedness for injuries that occur in the work environment but are solely due to personal tasks. For the \"personal tasks\" exception to apply, the injury or illness must: 1) be solely the result of the employee doing personal tasks (unrelated to their employment) and 2) occur outside of the employee's assigned working hours. The exception doe s not apply to injuries and illnesses that occur during breaks in the normal work schedule. Here, the exception does not apply because the injury occurred during the employee's lunch break. Scenario 8: Does an employee become a part of the general public once they have timed out? Or, are they considered part of the workforce from the time th ey get out of their car coming in to work to the time they step into their car to go hom e at the end of their work day? FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 58 F 6180.55a Response 8: For purposes of FRA recordkeeping, injuries, and illnesses occurring in the work environment are considered work-related. Punching in and ou t with a time clock (or signing in and out) does not affect the outcome for determining work-rela tedness. If the employee experienced a work- related injury or illness th at meets the requirement for recording on a Form FRA F 6180.98 record, then the paperwork must be retained on file. If it satisf ies one or more of the general reporting criteria, it must be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a. The only di stinction is whether to report it as a Railroad Employee On Duty (C lass A) or Railroad Employee Not On Duty (Class B). Employees are considered members of th e general public when they are present in the work environment for reasons solely unconnected with their employment or without their employer's permission. Again, an employee does not become a member of the general public solely by being present in the work environment outside of assigned work hours. For example, an employee of a passenger railroad maybe consid ered a member of the general public in the work environment when they are a passenger on the train for personal reason unconnected to work (i.e., personal vacation). Scenario 9: An employee times out and chooses to linger in the plant. Then, she goes to her locker to lock up her personal items, and falls. Is the injury work-related? Response 9: Since the resultant injury occurred in the work environment, it is work-related, unless a specific exception applies. There are not enough factual details provided in the scenario for FRA to fully evaluate whether an exception under \u00a7 225.15 applie s in the circumstances described. However, if employees normally keep personal items in a locker at the plant, FRA would not consider the employee's actions in going to her locker before leaving the plant to be a personal task, unrelated to employment, for purposes of the exception. 6.6.2 Questions and Answers on Employees\u2014 Determination of Work-Relatedness Q3. Are there situations in which an injury or illness occurs to an employee while in the work environment, but would no t be reported as an injury to, or illness of, an employee on duty? A3. Yes. An injury or illness occurring in the work environment that falls under one of the reporting exceptions set forth at \u00a7 225.15(b) woul d not be reported as one to an employee on duty. These situations must be evaluated to determine if the employee's condition is reportable using th e criteria for individuals who are not employees on duty, e.g., employee not on duty, nontrespasser. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 59 F 6180.55a Q4. What activities are considered \"personal grooming\" for purposes of the exception to the geographic presumption of work-relatedness for employees on duty? A4. Personal grooming activities are activities directly related to personal hygiene, such as combing and drying hair, brushing teeth, clipping fingernails, and the like. Bathing or showering at the workplace, when necessary, because of an exposure to a substance at work, is not within the personal groom ing exception. Thus, if an employee slips and falls while showering at work to remove a contaminant to which he has been exposed at work, and su stains an injury that meets one of the general reporting criteria, the case is reportable. Q5. What are \"personal tasks\" for purpo exception under \u00a7 225.15? A5. \"Personal tasks\" are task s that are unrelate d to the employee's job. For example, if an employee uses a company break to perform work on his or her personal automobile that is not part of his or he r job duties, he or she is engaged in a personal task. However, this example woul d still be reportable as the employee is performing a personal task during a lunch break, which is within assigned work hours. Note that a case is reportable unle ss it meets both prongs of the exception under \u00a7 225.15: the case must involve firs t, personal tasks at the establishment; and second, must have occurred outside of the employee's assigned working hours. See Q7 and A7, below. Q6. If an employee stays at work after normal work hour s to prepare for the next day's tasks and is injured, is the wo rker considered to be an employee on duty? For example, if an employee st ays after work to prepare equipment and is injured, is the case work-related? A6. Yes. This individual's in jury is considered to be work-related. A case is work- related any time an event or exposure in the work environment either causes or contributes to an injury or illness, or significantly aggravates a preexisting injury or illness, unless one of the specific excep tions in this section applies. The work environment includes the establishment a nd other locations where one or more employees are working or are present as a condition of their employment. The case in question would be work-related if the employee was injured as a result of an event or exposure at work, regardless of whether the inju ry occurred after normal work hours and regardless of whet her the employee was in pay status. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 60 F 6180.55a Q7. An employee was injured in the workpl ace while performing a personal task (unrelated to their employment) outsid e of the employee's assigned working hours; is the injury reportable? A7. In order to correctly apply the reporti ng exception, the case must meet both of the following conditions. The case must i nvolve first, personal tasks at the establishment; and second, must have occurred outside of the employee's assigned working hours. In this case, th e conditions are met. Thus, this case would not be reportable as an injury to a Railroad Employee On Duty (Class A). Q8. How do I handle a case if it is not obvious whether the precipitating event or exposure occurred in the work enviro nment or occurred away from work? A8. You must evaluate the employee's wo rk duties and environment to decide whether it is more likely than not that one or more events or exposures in the work environment either caused or cont ributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a preexisting condition. The evaluation might include consultation with an ergonomics expert as well as a PLHCP. A review of the job description alone is not sufficient without reviewing all of the employee's collateral duties. Q9. How do I know if an event or exposure in the work environment \"significantly aggravated\" a preexis ting injury or illness? A9. A preexisting injury or illness has been significantly aggravated, for purposes of FRA injury and illness recordkeeping, when: With respect to any person: (1) Death, provided that the preexisting inju ry or illness would likely not have resulted in death but for the o ccupational event or exposure. (2) Loss of consciousness, provided that the preexisting injury or illness would likely not have resulted in loss of cons ciousness but for the occupational event or exposure. (3) Medical treatment in a case where no medical treatment was needed for the injury or illness before the workplace event or exposure, or a change in medical treatment was necessitated by the workplace event or exposure. With respect to a railroad employee: (1) One or more days away from work, da ys of restricted work, or days of job transfer that otherwise w ould not have occurred but for the occupational event or exposure. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 61 F 6180.55a Q10. Which injuries and illnesses are considered preexisting conditions? A10. An injury or illness is a preexisting condition if it resulted solely from a non- work-related event or exposure that occurr ed outside the work environment, e.g., diabetes. Q11. An employee-on-duty was injured at work and received medical treatment. The employee was also tested for alcohol and drugs. The test was positive for alcohol. The employee admitted that he had been previously treated for alcohol abuse. An investigation det ermined that this event or exposure would not have occurred except for the alcohol impairment. Since the employee already had an existing problem with alcohol abuse, would this injury meet the reporting exception that the injury or illness involves signs or symptoms that manifest themselves at work but result solely from a non- work-related event or exposure that occurs outside the work environment? A11. The positive drug/alcohol history is no t a qualifying reporting exception. There are some medical conditions, such as ep ilepsy, that cannot be controlled by the employee. The Americans with Disabil ities Act, Public Law 101-336, prohibits discrimination on the basis of epilepsy in employment. That is why OSHA has excluded injuries occurring as a result of epilepsy from injury reporting with the revised regulation, if the workplace envi ronment did not trigger the epileptic seizure. This exception allows the empl oyer to exclude cases where a loss of consciousness is due solely to a persona l health condition, su ch as epilepsy, diabetes, or narcolepsy. This concept cannot be extended to alc ohol dependency or the use of legal or illegal drugs. Impairment by drugs or alcohol is a serious problem in the workplace; however, it is not classified as a preexisti ng condition for purposes of reporting injuries. The employer is exp ected to keep the workplace drug-free and to report all injuries that meet FRA's reporting criteria, including those that are associated with a positive drug/ alcohol test result. Q12. How do I decide whether an injury or illness is work-related if the employee is on travel status at the time the injury or illness occurs? A12. Injuries and illnesses that occur while an employee is on travel status are work- related if, at the time of the injury or illness, the employee was engaged in work activities \"in the interest of the employer .\" Examples of su ch activities include travel to and from customer contacts, conducting job tasks, and entertaining or being entertained to transact, discus s, or promote business (work-related FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 62 F 6180.55a entertainment includes only entertainment activities being engaged in at the direction of the employer). Injuries or illnesses that occur when th e employee is on travel status should be evaluated as follows: (1) An employee checks into a hotel or motel for 1 or more days. When a traveling employee checks into a hotel, motel, or other temporary residence, he or she establishes a \"home away fr om home.\" You must evaluate the employee's activities after he or she ch ecks into the hotel, motel, or other temporary residence for their work-r elatedness in the same manner as you evaluate the activities of a non-traveling employee. When the employee checks into the temporary residence, he or she is considered to have left the work environment. When the employee begins work each day, he or she re-enters the work environment. If th e employee has established a \"home away from home\" and is reporting to a fixe d worksite each day, you also do not consider injuries or illnesses work-relat ed if they occur wh ile the employee is commuting between the temporary re sidence and the job location. Note: An employee in deadhead transportation is considered an \"employee on duty\" regardless of the mode of transportation. Deadhead transportation occurs wh en an employee is traveling at the direction or authorization of the carrier to or from an assignment, or the employee is involved with a means of conveyance furnished by the carrier or compensated by the carrier. - Exception: If an employee is housed by the ca rrier in a facility such as a motel, and part of the service provided by the motel is the transportation of the employee to and from the worksite, any reportable injury to the employee during such transit is to be reported as that to a Railroad Em ployee Not On Duty (Class B). If the employee had decided upon other means of transportation that had not been authorized or provide d, such as a ride from a friend, and for which he would not have been compensated by the railroad, the injury is not considered work-related. (2) An employee takes a detour for personal reasons. Injuries or illnesses are not considered work-related if they occu r while the employee is on a personal detour from a reasonably direct route of travel (e.g., has taken a side trip for personal reasons). Q13. This question involves the following sequence of events: Employee A drives to work, parks her car in the company parking lot, and is walking across the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 63 F 6180.55a lot, when she is struck by a car driven by Employee B, who is commuting to work. Both employees are seriously inju red in the accident. Is either worker considered to be an employee on duty? A13. Neither employees' injuri es are reportable as occu rring to a Railroad Employee On Duty (Class A). While the employ ee parking lot is part of the work environment, injuries occurring there would be classified as injuries to Railroad Employees Not On Duty (Class B). Q14. How do I decide if a case is work-r elated when the employee is working at home or telecommuting from another location? A14. Injuries and illnesses that occur while an employee is working at home, including work in a home office, will be considered work-related if the injury or illness occurs while the employee is performing work for pay or compensation in the home, and the injury or illness is direc tly related to the performance of work rather than to the general home environm ent or setting. For example, if an employee drops a box of work documents and injures his or her foot, the case is considered work-related. If an employee is injured because he or she trips on the family dog while rushing to answer a work phone call, the case is not considered work-related. If an employee working at home is electrocuted because of faulty home wiring, the injury is not considered work-related. Q15. If an employee voluntarily takes work home and is injured while working at home, is the case reportable? A15. No. Injuries and illnesses occurring in the home environment are only considered work-related if the employee is being paid or compensated for working at home and the injury or illness is directly rela ted to the performance of the work rather than to the general home environment. 6.7 Determination of New Cases You must consider an injury or illness to be a \"new case\" if: 1. The person has not previously experienced a repo rted injury or illness of the same type that affects the same part of the body; or 2. The person previously experienced a reported in jury or illness of the same type that affected the same part of the body but had re covered completely (all signs and symptoms had disappeared) from the previous injury or illness; and an event or exposure in the work environment discernibly caused th e signs or symptoms to reappear. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 64 F 6180.55a The following criteria are used for determini ng whether any injury or illness, including a musculoskeletal disorder, is to be treated as a new case or as the continuation of an \"old\" injury or illness. First, if the employee has never had a reported injury or illnes s of the same type and affecting the same part of the body, the case is au tomatically considered a new case and must be evaluated for reportability. This provision will handle the vast majority of injury and illness cases, which are new cases rather than recurr ences or case continua tions. Second, if the employee has previously had a reported injury or illness of the same type and affecting the same body part, but the employee has completely recovered from the previous injury or illness, and a new workplace event or exposure causes the injury or illness (or its signs or symptoms) to reappear, the case is a recurrence that the employer must evaluate for reportability. When an employer has determined that an employ ee injury or illness is an old case, the employer should review any additional or new informati on and amend the old records or reports when appropriate. If it is a new case, it mu st be reviewed for reportability. 6.7.1 Questions and Answers on New Cases Q16. How is an employer to determin e whether an employee has \"recovered completely\" from a previous injury or illness such that a later injury or illness of the same type affecting the same part of the body resulting from an event or exposure at work is a new case? If an employee's signs and symptoms disappear for a day and then resurface the next day, should the employer conclude that the later signs and symptoms represent a new case? A16. An employee has recovered completely fr om a previous injury or illness, for purposes of this section, when he or she is fully healed or cured. The employer must use his best judgment based on factor s such as the passage of time since the symptoms last occurred and the physical appearance of the aff ected part of the body. If the signs and symptoms of a prev ious injury disappear for a day only to reappear the following day, that is strong evidence the injury has not properly healed. The employer may, but is not requ ired to, consult a PLHCP. Where the employer does consult a PLHCP to determ ine whether an employee has recovered completely from a prior injury or illness, it must follow the PLHCP's recommendation. In the event the employe r receives recommendations from two or more PLHCPs, the employer may deci de which recommendation is the most authoritative and report the case based on that recommendation. Q17. When an employee experiences the si gns or symptoms of a chronic work- related illness, do I need to consider each recurrence of signs or symptoms to be a new case? A17. No. For occupational illnesses wher e the signs or symptoms may recur or continue in the absence of an exposure in the workplace, the case must only be FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 65 F 6180.55a reported once. Examples may include occ upational cancer, asbestosis, byssinosis, and silicosis. Q18. When an employee experiences the signs or symptoms of an injury or illness as a result of an event or exposure in the workplace, such as an episode of occupational asthma, must I trea t the episode as a new case? A18. Yes. Since the episode or recurrence was caused by an event or exposure in the workplace, the incident must be treated as a new case. Q19. May I rely on a PLHCP to determine whether a case is a new case or a recurrence of an old case? A19. You are not required to seek the advice of a PLHCP to determine whether a case is new or a recurrence of an old one. However, if you do seek such advice, you must follow the PLHCP's recommendation about whether the case is a new case or a recurrence. If you re ceive recommendations from two or more PLHCPs, you must make a decision as to which recommendation is the most authoritative (best documented, best reasoned, or most pe rsuasive), and report the case based upon that recommendation. If a subsequent physician determines that the condition does not exist or is not work-related following a review of the examining physician's tests, notes, diagnosis, etc., th en it must be clearly documented why the subsequent physician's findings di ffer from the original physician. 6.8 General Reporting Criteria FRA's general reporting criteria fo r death, injury, or o ccupational illness is set forth in Chapter 6.1 of this Guide. 6.8.1 Questions and Answers on General Reporting Criteria Q20. How do I decide if a case meets one or more of the genera l reporting criteria? A20. A work-related injury or illness must be re ported if it results in one or more of the following: 1. Death. 2. Days away from work. 3. Restricted work or transfer to another job. 4. Medical treatment beyond first aid. 5. Loss of consciousness. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 66 F 6180.55a 6. A significant injury or illne ss diagnosed by a PLHCP. 7. Needlestick or sharps injury. 8. Medical removal. 9. Occupational hearing loss. 10. Occupational tuberculosis. 11. Musculoskeletal disorder if this disord er is reportable under one or more of the general reporting criteria. 12. Covered data case. 6.8.2 Questions and Answers on Days Away from Work Q21. How do I report a work-related injury or illness that results in day(s) away from work? A21. When an injury or illness involves 1 or more days away from work, you must report the injury or illn ess on Form FRA F 6180.55a and report the number of calendar days away from work in Column 5o. (See definition of \"day away from work\" and the section on counting days away from work and days of restriction.) If the employee is out for an extended pe riod of time, you must enter a best faith estimate of the day(s) that the employ ee will be away, and update the day count when the actual number of days is known. Q22. Do I count the day on which the in jury occurred or the illness began? A22. No. You begin counting days away from work on the da y after the injury occurred or the illness began. Q23. How do I report an injury or il lness when a PLHCP recommends that the worker stay at home, but the em ployee comes to work anyway? A23. You must report these injuries and illnesses on Form FRA F 6180.55a. If a PLHCP recommends days away, you shoul d encourage your employee to follow that recommendation. However, a minimum of 1 day away from work must be reported when the injured or ill employee does not follow the PLHCP's recommendation and returns to work. If you receive recommendations from two or more PLHCPs, you may make a decisi on as to which recommendation is the most authoritative, and report the case based upon that recommendation. Q24. How do I handle a case when a PL HCP recommends that the worker return to work, but the employee stays at home for a day anyway? FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 67 F 6180.55a A24. A decision by an employee concerning the care or treatment of his or her own condition is not to be considered when d eciding to report. If an employee has an injury that meets none of the standard criteria for reporting, then an employee's action, e.g., taking OTC medication at pr escription strength without proper authorization, would not make the injury reportable even if he or she informed his or her employer that this level of dosage was used. In the situation described, a report would not be made unless the day absent from work was approved by the employer as necessary for recovery from an otherwise reportable injury, e.g., prescription medi cation was recommended by a PLHCP. If the employee contacted the appropriate o fficial in the company and this official authorized the time off because of the injury, then a day away from work is to be counted. Authorization may also come from a PLHCP, e.g., he sees his own physician the day after the injury and the employer is aware that the doctor recommends that the employee ta ke time off to recover. Q25. An employee who sustained a work-relat ed bruise on his knee was told by a physician not to return to work until undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The employee remained off work for some days before the procedure could be performed. The MRI showed that no FRA-reportable injury occurred. Since no injury occurred, should this case be reported to FRA? A25. Results of an MRI do not negate the reportability of a physician's recommendation. The case is FRA-reportable based on the physician's recommendation that the employee not retu rn to work before undergoing an MRI for his bruised knee. Railroads are instru cted on how to record days-away cases when a physician or PLHCP recommends that the injured or ill worker stay at home or return to work but the empl oyee chooses not to do so. FRA requires employers to follow the physician's or PLHCP's recommendation when reporting a case. For purposes of FRA recordkeepi ng, the case met the criteria for reporting because the employee had sustained a work-related injury \u2014a bruised knee \u2014 involving 1 or more days away from wo rk. The subsequent MRI results do not change these facts. Accordingly, the ne gative results from the MRI results do not change the fact that the employee was instructed not to return to work. Q26. If an employee who sustains a work-r elated injury requiring days away from work is terminated for drug use based on the results of a post-accident drug test, how is the case reported? May the employer stop the day count upon termination of the employee for drug use? For another injury, it was later establis hed during a hearing that the injury was the result of a rules violation on the part of the employee. The employee FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 68 F 6180.55a was terminated because of the rules viol ation. When do we discontinue the counting of days away from work? A26. The purpose of counting days away fr om work is to provide an additional measure of the severity of an injury. The employer may stop counting days away from work if an employee who is away from work because of an injury or illness leaves the company for some reason unrelated to the injury or illness, such as retirement or scheduled seasonal layoff. However, when the employer conducts a drug test based on the occurrence of an accide nt resulting in an injury at work and subsequently terminates the injured employee, the termination is related to the injury. The same is true for disciplin e involving suspension of duty for a rule violation that is imposed following an injury. Therefore, you must estimate the number of days in cases such as these where the employee would have otherwise been away from work due to the injury, and enter that number on Form FRA F 6180.55a. Q27. Once I have reported a case involving days away from work, restricted work, or medical treatment and the employee has returned to his or her regular work or has received the course of reco mmended medical treatment, is it permissible for the me to delete the case based on a company physician's recommendation that the days away from work, work restriction or medical treatment were not necessary? A27. The initial decision about the need for days away from work, a work restriction, or medical treatment is based on the information available, including any recommendation by a physician or other li censed health care professional at the time the employee is examined or treat ed. At this time, if you receive contemporaneous recommendations from two or more physicians or other licensed health care professionals ab out the need for days away, a work restriction, or medical treatment, the employer may decide which recommendation is the most authoritat ive and report the case based on that recommendation. However, once the days away from work or work restriction has occurred or medical treatment has been given, the employer may not delete the case because of a later physician's conc lusion that the days away, restriction or treatment was unnecessary. Q28. How long must a modification to a jo b last before it can be considered a permanent modification? A28. You may stop counting days of restricted work or transfer to another job if the restriction or transfer is ma de permanent. A permanent restriction or transfer is one that is expected to last for the rema inder of the employee's career. Where the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 69 F 6180.55a restriction or transfer is determined to be permanent at the time it is ordered, you must count at least 1 day of the restri ction and enter \"Y\" for termination or permanent transfer on Form FRA F 6180.55a in Block 5r. If the employee whose work is restricted, or who is transferred to another job, is expect ed to return to his or her former job duties at a later date, th e restriction or tran sfer is considered temporary rather than permanent. Q29. If an employee loses his arm in a work -related accident and can never return to his job, how is the case reported? Is the day count capped at 180 days? A29. If an employee never returns to wo rk following a work-related injury, the employer must enter an estimate of the number of days the employee would have required to recuperate from the injury, up to 180 days. Q30. How do I count weekends, holidays, or other days the employee would not have worked anyway? A30. You must count the number of calendar days the employee was unable to work as a result of the injury or illness, regard less of whether the employee was scheduled to work on those day(s). Weekend days, ho lidays, vacation days or other days off are included in the total number of days reported if the employee would not have been able to work on those days because of a work-related injury or illness. Q31. How do I report a case in which a worker is injured or becomes ill on a Friday and reports to work on a Mond ay, and was not scheduled to work on the weekend? A31. You need to report this case only if you receive information from a PLHCP indicating that the employee should not ha ve worked, or should have performed only restricted work, during the weekend. If so, you must report the injury or illness as a case with days away from wo rk or restricted work, and enter the day counts, as appropriate. Q32. How do I report a case in which a wo rker is injured or becomes ill on the day before scheduled time off such as a holiday, a planned vacation, or a temporary plant closing? A32. You need to report a case of this type only if you receive information from a PLHCP indicating that the employee shoul d not have worked, or should have performed only restricted work, during the scheduled time off. If so, you must report the injury or illness as a case with days away from work or restricted work, and enter the day counts, as appropriate. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 70 F 6180.55a Q33. Is there a limit to the number of d ays away from work I must count? A33. Yes. You may \"cap\" the total days away at 180 calendar days. You are not required to keep track of the number of calendar days away from work if the injury or illness resulted in more than 180 calendar days away from work and/or days of job transfer or restriction. In such a case, entering 180 in the total days away column will be considered adequate. Q34. May I stop counting days if an empl oyee who is away from work because of an injury or illness reti res or leaves my company? A34. Yes. If the employee leaves your co mpany for some reason unrelated to the injury or illness, such as retirement, a plant closing, or to take another job, you may stop counting days away from work or da ys of restriction/job transfer. If the employee leaves your company because of th e injury or illness, you must estimate the total number of days away or days of restriction or job transfer and enter the day count on Form FRA F 6180.55a. Q35. If a case occurs during 1 year but results in days away during the next calendar year, do I report the case in both years? A35. No. You only report the injury or il lness once. You must enter the number of calendar days away for the injury or illness on Form FRA F 6180.55a for the year in which the injury or illness occurred. If the employee is st ill away from work because of the injury or illness at the time you are doing your initial closing out of the calendar year (by April 15), you must pr ovide a best faith estimate of the total number of calendar days you expect the em ployee to be away from work, and file a corrected copy of Form FRA F 6180.55a if the 180-day cap has not been reached. 6.9 Restricted Work An employee's work is considered restricted when, as a result of a work-related injury or illness, 1) a PLHCP recommends that the employee not perf orm one or more of the routine functions of his or her job (job functions that the employee regularly performs at least once per week ), or not work the full workday that he or she would othe rwise have been scheduled to work; or 2) the employer keeps the employee from performing one or more of the routine functions of his or her job, or from working the full workday that he or she would otherwise have been scheduled to work. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 71 F 6180.55a 6.9.1 Questions and Answers on Restricted Work Q36. How do I report a work-related injury or illness that re sults in restricted work or job transfer? A36. When an injury or illness involves re striction of routine work functions as a described in (1) of the first paragraph of this section, the case is reportable as one resulting in restriction, and a count of rest ricted days must be maintained. If the injury or illness was not reportable under (1), but met any othe r reporting criteria, i.e., medical treatment; then, any restricted days that result as described in (2) must be recorded, unless th e count of these days is subject to other limitations, e.g., see Q42 and A42 in this section. Y ou must report the nu mber of qualifying restricted or transferred days in the restricted workdays, Column 5p. Q37. How do I decide if the injury or illness resulted in restricted work? A37. Restricted work occurs when, as the re sult of a work-related injury or illness: 1. You keep the employee from performing one or more of the routine functions of his or her job, or from working th e full workday that he or she would otherwise have been scheduled to work; or 2. A PLHCP recommends that the employee not perform one or more of the routine functions of his or her job, or not work the full workday that he or she would otherwise have been scheduled to work. An employee's routine functions are thos e work activities the employee regularly performs at least once per week. Q38. An employee hurts his or her left arm a nd is told by the doctor not to use the left arm for a week. The employee is able to perform all of his or her routine job functions using only the right ar m (though at a slower pace and the employee is never required to use both arms to perform his or her job functions). Would this be considered restricted work? A38. No. If the employee is able to perf orm all of his or her routine job functions (activities the employee regul arly performs at least once per week), the case does not involve restricted work. Loss of producti vity is not considered restricted work for FRA's reporting purposes. Q39. Do I have to report restricted work or job transfer if it applies only to the day on which the injury occu rred or the illness began? FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 72 F 6180.55a A39. No. You do not have to report restricted work or job transfers if you, or the PLHCP, imposes the restriction or transf er only for the day on which the injury occurred or the illness began. Q40. If the railroad or a PLHCP recommends a work restriction, is the injury or illness automatically reportable as a \"restricted work\" case? A40. No. A recommended work restriction is reportable only if it affects one or more of the employee's routine job functions. To determine whether this is the case, the employer must evaluate the restriction in light of the routine functions of the injured or ill employee's job. If the re striction from you or the PLHCP keeps the employee from performing one or more of his or her routin e job functions, or from working the full workday that the injured or ill employee would otherwise have worked, the employee's work has b een restricted and the employer must report the case. For example, if the PLHCP restricts the employee from lifting heavy objects, but the employee's job neve r requires the lifting of heavy objects, then there has been no restriction impos ed that involves the employee's routine job functions. (An employee's routine f unctions are those wo rk activities the employee regularly performs at least once per week.) Q41. What do I do if a PLHCP recommends a job restriction meeting FRA's definition, i.e., limits routine job functi ons, but the employee does all of his or her routine job functions anyway? A41. You must report the in jury or illness on Form FR A F 6180.55a as a restricted work case. If a PLHCP recommends a job restriction, you should ensure that the employee complies with that restriction. (This language is purely advisory and does not impose an enforceable duty upon employers to ensure that employees comply with the recommended restriction. ) If you receive recommendations from two or more PLHCPs, you may make a d ecision as to which recommendation is the most authoritative, and report th e case based upon that recommendation. In the absence of conf licting opinions from two or more health care professionals, the employer ordinarily must record the case if a health care professional recommends a work restriction involving the employee's routine job functions. See Section 6.4, of this Guide, on Covered Data. Q42. One of our employees experienced minor musculoskeleta l discomfort. The health care professional who examined the employee only provided first aid treatment. In addition, it was determin ed that the employee is fully able to perform all of her routine job functions. When the employee returned to work, we decided to limit the duties of the employee for the purpose of preventing a more serious co ndition from developing. Is this a restricted work case? FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 73 F 6180.55a A42. No. Since the minor musculoskeletal discomfort has not met any of the general criteria, e.g., medical treatment; the employer's decision to impose a work restriction following such minor musculoske letal discomfort would not make this a restricted work case. Q43. Will the determination of whether or not a case involves restriction always be made by the medical professional who examines an employee? A43. No. Day(s) of restrict ion also occur if the employer restricts one or more of the employee's routine job functions in connec tion with an otherwise reportable case. For example, an employee sustains an inju ry and is given a pr escription to take for a few days. The doctor tells the employee that he can return to work. The employee's routine job duties involve ope rating equipment. The employer does not allow the employee to operate the m achinery he normally would because of concerns about the effects of the me dication, and instead has the employee perform an inventory. This woul d be a restricted work case. Q44. Do I have to report a day of restr iction if an employee fails to follow a PLHCP's recommended work restriction? A44. You should ensure that the employee co mplies with the recommended restriction. In the absence of conflicti ng opinions from two or more health care professionals, the employer must report 1 day of restrict ion if a professional recommends a work restriction involving th e employee's routine job functi ons, and if a day away from work has not already occurred. See Section 6.4, of this Guide, on Covered Data. Q45. How do I report a case where the wo rker works only for a partial work shift because of a work-related injury or illness? A45. A partial day of work is reported as a day of job transfer or restriction for recordkeeping purposes, except for the day on which the injury occurred or the illness began. Q46. If the injured or ill worker produces fewer goods or services than he or she would have produced prior to the injury or illness, but otherwise performs all of the routine functions of his or her work, is the case considered a restricted work case? A46. No. The case is considered restricted work only if the worker does not perform all of the routine functions of his or her job or does not work the full shift that he or she would otherwise have worked. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 74 F 6180.55a Q47. How do I handle vague restrictions from a PLHCP, such as that the employee engage only in \"light dut y\" or \"take it easy for a week?\" A47. If you are not clear about the PLHC P's recommendation, you may ask that person whether the employee can do all of his or he r routine job functions and work all of his or her normally assigned work shift. If the answer to both of these questions is \"Yes,\" then the case does not involve a work restriction and does not have to be reported as such. If the answer to one or both of these questions is \"No,\" the case involves restricted work and must be reported as a restri cted work case. If you are unable to obtain this additional information from the PLHCP who recommended the restriction, report the inju ry or illness as a case involving restricted work. Q48. If an employee who routinely wo rks 10 hours a day is restricted from working more than 8 hours following a work-related injury, is the case reportable? A48. Generally, the employer must report a ny case in which an employee's work is restricted because of a work-related injur y. A work restriction occurs when the employer keeps the employee from performing one or more routine functions of the job, or from working the full wor kday the employee would otherwise have been scheduled to work. The case in question is reportable if the employee presumably would have worked 10 hours had he or she not been injured. Q49. An employee was injured at work a nd work-relatedness is established for reporting purposes. The employee was no t able to drive himself to work. The employee may have had a cast or splint on, arm in a sling, using crutches, or leg immobilized, etc. Th e railroad had work the employee could have done, if the employee could have gotten to work. The employee stated he was not able to drive. Prior to the injury, the employee drove himself to work every day. He was not in a car pool and didn't catch a ride with co-workers, etc. Would this case be a d ays-away-from-work case or a restricted work activity case? If the railroad provided transportation (even though not required by the regulation to do so), could the company count the days as restricted or must they still count the days as days away from work? Would the answer be the same if the employee' s doctor wrote a restriction of \"no driving\" but the company says \"the em ployee can get a ride with someone else; we have work available\"? What if an employee is injured and is placed under a work restriction by a physician; however, the railroad does not have any available restricted work for a period of time? FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 75 F 6180.55a A49. If the employee does not make it to wor k, the case must be reported as a case involving days away from work. If th e employee is driven to work by the railroad, or anyone else, and the employee performs restricted work, the case must be reported as a case involving restricted work activity. If a PLHCP places the employee under a work restriction, but th e employer has no available restricted work, then this would be reported as a case involving days away from work. Q50. How do I decide if an injury or i llness involved a transfer to another job? A50. If you assign an injured or ill employee to a job other than hi s or her regular job for part of the day, the case invol ves transfer to another job. Note: This does not include the day on which the injury or illness occurred. Q51. Are transfers to another job reported in the same way as restricted work cases? A51. Yes. Both job transfers and restri cted work cases are reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a. For example, if you assign, or a PLHCP recommends that you assign, an injured or ill work er to his or her routine j ob duties for part of the day and to another job for the rest of the day, the injury or i llness involves a job transfer. You must report an injury or illness that involves a job transfer by placing a \"Y\" (for yes) in th e box for job transfer, 5r. Q52. How do I count days of job transfer or restriction? A52. You count days of job transfer or rest riction in the same way you count days away from work. The only difference is that if you permanently assign the injured or ill employee to a job that has been modified or permanently changed in a manner that eliminates the routin e functions the employee was restricted from performing, you may stop the day count when the modification or change is made permanent. You must count at least 1 da y of restricted work or j ob transfer for such cases. 6.9.2 Counting Days Away from Work and Days of Restriction FRA needs a count of the days an employee is away from work and/or restricted while at work because of an injury or occupational illness for cl assification of the severi ty of the injury/illness and for other purposes. Day away from work is defined at \u00a7 225.5. Day of restricted work activity is defined at \u00a7 225.5. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 76 F 6180.55a Frequently, an employee's condition is such that it will result in lo st or restricted days extending beyond the 30-day filing deadline. If this occurs , you must make a good faith estimate of the additional number of days that may accrue for the case and record this on the initial Form FRA F 6180.55a. A record of the actual count of thes e days must be maintained for the affected employee. After the employee returns to work at full capacity, or the actual days exceeds the original estimate, a corrected re port must be submitted that show s the actual count of days if these are significantly different from the origin al estimate. A significant difference in this context is a variance of 10 percen t or more between the number of days that has been reported and the count that you mainta in in your records. When reporting the count of days, the fo llowing guidelines are to be followed: 1. The day of the accident/incident is no t to be included in either count. 2. If it is necessary, during a workday, fo r an employee to have a followup examination or receive additional medical care, etc., the time spent going to and coming from such an appointment is not considered restricted time. If the employee was not already on restricted duty prior to going to or upon returning from such visits a day of restriction need not be charged. If the em ployee does not report to work at all on such days, a day away from work has occurred. 3. If an employee takes off to see a physician fo r an initial evaluation after the day of an injury/illness, and provided that none of the reportability criter ia is met, a day away from work is not to be charged, since th ere has not been a reportable condition. 4. Damage to an employee's personal effects, such as eye glasses, hear ing aids, or dentures, is not by itself reportable. If a reportable injury did not also occur, the work days lost while awaiting repair or repl acement of these articles are not to be charged. 6.10 Exceptions to Medical Treatment (First Aid) \"Medical treatment\" is the management and care of a patient to combat disease or a disorder. For the purposes of Part 225, medica l treatment does not include: 1. Visits to a PLHCP solely for observation or counseling; 2. The conduction of diagnostic procedures, such as x-rays and blood tests, including the administration of prescription medications us ed solely for diagnostic purposes (e.g., eye drops to dilate pupils); or 3. \"First aid treatment.\" The following is a compre hensive list of first aid treatment.\" If the treatment given is not on this list, it is cons idered to be \"medical treatment.\" For the purposes of Part 225, \"First aid\" means the following: FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 77 F 6180.55a a. Using a nonprescription medicati on at nonprescription strength. (For medications available in both prescription and non-prescription form, a recommendation by a PLHCP to use a non-prescription medication at prescripti on strength is considered medical treatment for recordkeeping and reporting purposes.) b. Administering tetanus immunizations. (Other immunizations, such as Hepatitis B vaccine or rabies vaccine, are considered medical treatment.) c. Cleaning, flushing, or soaking wounds on the surface of the skin. d. Using wound coverings such as bandages, Band- Aids, gauze pads, etc.; or using butterfly bandages or Steri-Strips. (Other wound-closing devices, su ch as sutures, staples, or surgical glues, are considered medical treatment.) e. Using hot or cold therapy, e.g., heating pads or ice packs. f. Using any non-rigid means of support such as elastic bandages, wraps, non-rigid back belts, etc. (Devices with rigid stays or other systems designed to immobilize parts of the body are considered medical treatment for recordkeeping and reporting purposes.) g. Using temporary immobilization devices while transporting an accident victim (e.g., splints, slings, neck collars, back boards, etc.) . h. Drilling of a fingernail or toenail to relieve pressure, or draining fluid from a blister. i. Using eye patches. j. Removing foreign bodies from the eye using only irrigation or a cotton swab. k. Removing splinters or foreign material from areas other than the ey e by irrigation, tweezers, cotton swabs, or other simple means. l. Using finger guards. m. Using massages. (Any other physical therapy, other than that identified as first aid, provided by a PLHCP or administered under the supervision of a PLHCP, and chiropractic treatment are considered medical treatment for recordkeeping and reporting purposes. Examples include acupuncture and electronic stimulation.) n. Drinking non-prescription fluids for relief of heat-related conditions. o. Pre-hospital protocol. (During transport, the injured person may be restrained with a body board or neck brace, they may receive oxygen, or they may have an IV needle inserted. These pre-hospital protocol pro cedures are generally considered to be first aid as long as they are performed with out symptoms being exhibited that would specifically require such treatment. See \"Q&A\" 65 and 66, below, for additional guidance.) Note: A case involving first-aid treatment must be further evaluated to determine if any of the other reporting criteria are met. For example, for some employees, th e application of an FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 78 F 6180.55a eye patch may restrict the employees' ability to perform their routine job functions. The case then becomes reportable on the basis of restriction of work or transfer to another job. 6.10.1 Questions and Answers on First Aid Q53. Is a physical therapist considered a \"health care professional\" under the definition of health care professional? A53. Yes. A physical therapist's license a llows him or her to independently perform, or be delegated the responsibility to perform, physical therapy. Q54. Are any other procedures included in first aid? A54. No. This Guide has provided a complete list of all treatments considered to be first aid for Part 225 purposes. Q55. An extra gang laborer was clearing an overgrown area of soil, gravel, and weeds. In doing so, he disrupted a yellow jacket nest, receiving multiple stings to the hand, arm, ear, neck , and back areas. The employee was immediately driven to a local clinic and seen by a physician. The employee received injections of Benadryl and Ke nalog and was advised to apply ice packs, drink fluids, and rest. In two separate communications, a s econd physician, while admitting that the treating physicians' use of Bena dryl and Kenalog injections was \"within the standard of care\" for the in jury suffered, went on to state that \"many providers would have instead offered oral diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and topical triamcinalon e (Kenalog).\" In other words, the second physician stated that the injury could have been treated by administering first aid, and, therefore could have resulted in a non-reportable injury. Since the second physician said the em ployee could have been effectively treated by first aid treatment, do we need to report? In addition, some of our employees ca rry a bee-sting kit and do their own injections. When this occu rs, do we need to report? A55. A work-related injury or illness must be recorded on the Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record, Form FRA F 6180.98, and reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a, if it results in death, days away fr om work, restricted work or transfer to another job, medical treatment beyond first aid, loss of consciousness, or diagnosis of a serious injury or illness. Medical treat ment is generally recognized FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 79 F 6180.55a to be \"the management and care of a patient to combat disease or disorder.\" First aid (see section, of this FRA Guide, on First Aid and Medical Treatment) does not fall within the definition of medical treatment. However, all prescription medications, even those given as a single dose, are medical treatment. In certain circumstances, FRA's requireme nts permit a railroad to choose between two conflicting or differing medical reco mmendations. When employees receive contemporaneous recommendations (at the same time) from two or more PLHCPs about the need for medical treatme nt, employers may decide which recommendation is the most authoritat ive and report the case based on that recommendation. However, once medical treatment is provided for a work- related injury or illness, the case is reportable. In regard to the question of self-injection, the answer is \"Yes,\" this must be reported. If prescription medication is authorized for use by a PLHCP, it makes no difference who administ ers the medication. Q56. Are surgical glues used to treat lacerations considered \"first aid?\" A56. No. Surgical glue is a wound-closing device. All wound-closing devices, except for butterfly bandages and Steri-Strips, are by defin ition \"medical treatment\" because they are not include d on the first-aid list. Q57. The PLHCP used liquid bandages on a wound; is this medical treatment or first aid? A57. The concept that underlies the medical treatment vs. first ai d distinction made between this type of tr eatment centers around the ba sic difference between wound coverings and wound closures using OTC vs. wound closur es that are typically performed by a PLHCP. Using wound c overings, such as bandages (including liquid bandages), Band-Aids, gauze pads, butterfly bandages or Steri-Strips are deemed to be first aid treatment. The use of sutures, staples, and special bonding glues used by a PLHCP are c onsidered medical treatment. Q58. Is the use of a rigid finger guard considered first aid? A58. Yes. The use of finger guards is always first aid. Q59. If prescription medications are pres cribed as \"PRN\" (per required need), is it reportable if the patient does not ta ke or use the prescribed medicine? A59. FRA has decided to retain its longsta nding policy of requiring the reporting of cases in which a healthcare professiona l issues a prescrip tion, regardless of FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 80 F 6180.55a whether that prescription is filled or actually taken by the employee. A patient's refusal of the medication does not alter the fact that, in the healthcare professional's judgment, the case warrants me dical treatment. In addition, a rule that relied on whether a prescription is f illed or taken, rather than on whether the medicine was prescribed, would create administrative difficulties for employers, because such a rule would mean that the employer would have to investigate whether a given prescription had been fille d or whether the medicine had actually been used. Also, many employers and employees may consider an employer's inquiry about the filling or taking of a prescription to be an invasion of the employee's privacy. Q60. The employee visited a PLHCP due to an on-the-job injury. The PLHCP issued a single dose medication an d no prescription was written. The medication was to be taken only if n eeded (PRN). The employee chose not to take the medication. Is this case FRA-reportable? A60. Prescription medications, wh ether given once or over a longer period of time, are not included in the list of first-aid treatments. FRA believes that the use of prescription medications is not first ai d, because prescription medications are powerful substances that can only be prescr ibed by a PLHCP. The availability of these substances is carefully controlled and limited, because they must be prescribed and administered by a highly trained and knowledgeable professional. Medications classified as first aid ar e only when employees use a nonprescription medication at nonprescription strength. (For medications available in both prescription and non-prescription form, a recommendation by a PLHCP to use a non-prescription medication at prescripti on strength is considered medical treatment for recor dkeeping purposes). FRA maintains its longstanding policy of requiring the reporting of cases in which a healthcare professional issues a prescrip tion or dispenses a single dose, whether that prescription is filled or not. Medical treatment incl udes treatment that is used as well as those that should have been used. The patient's acceptance or refusal of the treatment does not alter the fact that, in the healthcare professional's judgment, the case warranted a script for the issuance of prescription medicine. For these reasons, the new recordkeepi ng rule continues FRA's longstanding policy of considering the recommendation of prescription medication as medical treatment, regardless of the reason it is prescribed. Q61. For medications such as Ibuprofen th at are available in both prescription and non-prescription form, what is considered to be prescription strength? How is an employer to determine whet her a non-prescription medication has been recommended at prescription strength? FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 81 F 6180.55a A61. The prescription strength of such medications is determined by the measured quantity of the therapeutic agent to be ta ken at one time, i.e., a single dose. The single dosages that are considered pr escription strength for four common OTC drugs are: Ibuprofen (such as Advil) - Greater than 467 mg Diphenhydramine (such as Benadryl) - Greater than 50 mg Naproxen Sodium (such as Aleve) - Greater than 220 mg Ketoprofen (such as Orudus KT) - Greater than 25 mg To determine the prescription-strength dosag es for other drugs that are available in prescription and non-prescription formul ations, the employer should contact the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a local pharmacist, or a physician. Q62. \"Removing splinters or foreign materi al from areas other than the eye by irrigation, tweezers, cotton swabs, or other simple means...\" What are \"other simple means\" of removing splinte rs that are considered first aid? A62. \"Other simple means\" of removing sp linters, for purposes of the definition of \"first aid,\" means methods th at are reasonably comparable to the listed methods. Using needles, pins, or small tools, e.g., nail clippers or manicure scissors, to extract splinters would generally be included. Q63. Does the professional st atus of the person providi ng the treatment have any effect on what is considered fi rst aid or medical treatment? A63. No. FRA considers the tr eatments listed above to be first aid regardless of the professional status of the person provid ing the treatment. Even when these treatments are provided by a PLHCP, th ey are considered first aid for the purposes of Part 225. Similarly, FRA cons iders treatment beyond first aid to be medical treatment even when it is provi ded by someone other than a PLHCP. Q64. If an employee is exposed to chlorine or some other substance at work and oxygen is administered as a precautionary measure, is the case reportable? A64. It is often a standard procedure of emergency rescue teams to administer preventive treatment, such as oxygen, or apply an intravenous (IV) saline solution while a patient is being tran sported to a medical facil ity for further evaluation. Such preventive treatment does not make the incident reportable. If oxygen is administered as a purely precautionary measure to an employee who does not exhibit any signs or symptoms of an injury or illness, th e case is not reportable. If FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 82 F 6180.55a the employee exposed to a substance exhibits symptoms of an injury or illness, the administration of oxygen ma kes the case reportable. Q65. During transport to the hospital, the Emergency Medical Team may perform some precautionary procedures that co uld be considered beyond first aid. Is this reportable? A65. Emergency transport is considered firs t aid. During transport, the injured person may be restrained with a body board, neck brace, receive oxyge n, or have an IV needle inserted. These pre-hospital protoc ol procedures are generally considered to be first aid as long as they are pe rformed without signs or symptoms being exhibited that would specifically require such treatment. As in the previous question, if the person is not being treate d for dehydration or some other condition that requires a saline IV, then simply receiving a saline IV as a precautionary measure is considered to be first aid. The use of casts, splints, or orthopedic de vices designed to immobilize an injured body part to permit it to rest and recover is considered medical treatment. The use of temporary immobilization devices while transporting an accident victim (e.g., splints, slings, neck collars, back boards) is precautionary in nature, and their use is to avoid exacerbation of a condition th at may or may not exist. In these specific situations, a splint or other device is used as temporary first-aid treatment, may be applied by non-licensed personnel using common materials at hand, and often does not reflect the severity of the injury. If following an examination it is determined that continued use of the i mmobilization device is warranted, then the case is reportable. Q66. Item (n) on the first aid list is \"drink ing non-prescription fluids for relief of heat-related conditions.\" Does this include administering IV fluids? A66. No. IV administration of fluids to tr eat work-related heat-related conditions is medical treatment. Q67. What makes a heatstroke or heat exhaus tion reportable? How is it reported? A67. Heatstroke is similar to heat cramps and heat exhaustion, but can have much more severe consequences. It is one of the h eat-related problems that often result from heavy work in hot environments, usually accompanied by inadequate fluid intake. Older adults, people who are obese, and pe ople born with an impaired ability to sweat are at high risk of heatstroke. Other risk factors includ e dehydration, alcohol use, cardiovascular disease, and the use of certain medications. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 83 F 6180.55a What makes heatstroke much more severe and potentially life-threatening is that the body's normal mechanisms for dealing wi th heat stress, such as sweating and temperature control, are lost. The main si gn of heatstroke is a markedly elevated body temperature\u2014generally greater than 104\u00b0 F\u2014with changes in mental status ranging from personality changes to conf usion and coma. Skin may be hot and dry, although in heatstroke caused by exertion, the skin is usually moist. Different people may have di fferent signs or symptoms of heatstroke and other heat-related disorders, e.g., heat e xhaustion due to dehydration. But common signs or symptoms include: Rapid heartbeat Absence of sweating Hot red or flushed dry skin Rapid and shallow breathing High body temperature Rapid pulse Elevated or lowered blood pressure Headache Irritability Confusion Unconsciousness In cases of mild dehydration, simple rehydration is recommended by drinking fluids. Many sports drinks on the ma rket effectively restore body fluids, electrolytes, and salt balan ce. Drinking non-prescription fl uids for relief of heat- related conditions is first-aid treatment. For moderate to severe dehydration, IV fl uids may be required. Cases of serious dehydration should be treated as medical emergencies, and hospitalization, along with IV fluids, is necessar y. Immediate action should be taken. IV administration of fluids to treat heat-re lated conditions is medical treatment and reportable. As in any evaluation of a workplace injury or illness, a determination must be made as to work-relatedness. If the injury or illness is work-r elated, then to be reportable it must meet the one of the requirements set forth in \u00a7 225.19. Heatstroke/sunstroke is reported in Bloc k 5i of Form FRA F 6180-55a as Code 1141, and heat exhaustion as Code 1144; see Injury and I llness Codes in Appendix E to this Guide. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 84 F 6180.55a Q68. What if a PLHCP recommends medical treatment but the employee does not follow the recommendation? A68. If a PLHCP recommends medical treatm ent, you should encourage the injured or ill employee to follow that recommendation. However, you must report the case even if the injured or ill employee doe s not follow the PLHCP's recommendation; the fact that there was a recomme ndation triggers the duty to report. Q69. Is every work-related injury or illne ss case involving a loss of consciousness reportable? A69. Yes. You must report a work-related injury or illness if the worker becomes unconscious, regardless of the length of time the employee remained unconscious. Q70. What is a \"significant\" diagnosed inju ry or illness that is reportable under the general criteria even if it does no t result in death, days away from work, restricted work or job transfer, medical treatment beyond first aid, or loss of consciousness? A70. Work-related cases involvi ng cancer, chronic irreversible disease, a fractured or cracked bone, or a puncture d eardrum must always be reported under the general criteria at the time of diagnosis by a PLHCP. Q71. We had a case of an employee on-dut y who fell approximately 4 feet from a platform and landed on his back on a concrete area. He was immediately taken to the emergency room, and th e doctor prescribed a prescription medication for pain, making a notati on on the medical documentation. Before writing out the actual pres cription, the employee refused the prescription medication. The doctor ma rked out the prescription medication on the medical documentation with th e notation \"employee refused.\" The doctor then prescribed an OTC medi cation for the employee. Would medical treatment, and thus reportability, be involved in this case? A71. In conformity with OSHA, FRA believes that the use of prescription medications is not first aid because prescription medi cations are powerful substances that can only be prescribed by a PLHCP. The availability of thes e substances is carefully controlled and limited because they must be prescribed and administered by a highly trained and knowledgeable professi onal. OSHA and FRA maintain their longstanding policy of requiring the record ing and reporting of cases in which a healthcare professional issues a prescripti on, whether that prescription is filled or not. Medical treatment include s treatment that is used as well as those that should have been used. The patient's acceptan ce or refusal of the treatment does not alter the fact that, in th e healthcare professional's judgment, the case warranted a FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 85 F 6180.55a script for the issuance of prescription medicine. For these reasons, FRA continues to be in conformity with OSHA's long standing policy of considering the use of prescription medication as medical treat ment, regardless of the reason it is prescribed. 6.11 Reporting Requirements for Significant Injury or Illness to Railroad Employees A significant injury to or significant illness of a railr oad employee diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional must be repor ted even if the injury or illness does not result in death, a day away from work, restricted work activity or job transfer, medical treatment, or loss of cons ciousness. See \u00a7 225.19(d)(2)(ii) and (d)(5). FRA believes that most significant injuries and illnesses will result in one or more of the following: For any person: 1. Death. 2. Medical treatment beyond first aid. 3. Loss of consciousness. For railroad employees: 1. Days away from work. 2. Restricted work or transfer to another job. However, there are some significant injuries, such as a punctured eardrum or a fractured toe or rib, for which neither medical treatment nor work restrictions may be recommended. In addition, there are some significant progressive diseases, su ch as byssinosis, silicosis, and some types of cancer, for which medical treatment or work restri ctions may not be recommended at the time of diagnosis but are likely to be recommended as the disease progresses. FRA believes that cancer, chronic irreversible di seases, fractured or cracked bones, and punctured eardrums are generally considered significant injuries and illnesses, and must be reported at the initial diagnosis even if medical treatment or work restrictions are not recommended, or are post poned, in a particular case. See \u00a7 225.5 \"Signi ficant Illness\" and \"Significant Injury.\" 6.12 Reporting Requirements for Specific Case Criteria An illness or injury that meets the application of any of the following specific case criteria is reportable: (i) A needlestick or sharps in jury to a railroad employee; (ii) Medical removal of a railroad employee; FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 86 F 6180.55a (iii) Occupational hearing lo ss of a railroad employee; (iv) Occupational tuberculosis of a railroad employee; or (v) A musculoskeletal disorder of a railroad employee if this disorder is independently reportable under one or more of the general repor ting criteria. See \u00a7 225.19(d)(1)-(6). 6.12.1 Reporting Criteria for Needlestick and Sharps Injuries You must report all work-related needlestick in juries and cuts from sharp objects that are contaminated with another person 's blood or other potentially inf ectious material (as defined by 29 CFR 1910.1030). \"Sharps\" are any contaminat ed objects that can penetrate the skin, including, but not limited to: needles, scalpe ls, broken glass, broken capillary tubes, and exposed ends of dental wires. You must repor t the case on Form FRA F 6180.55a as an injury. Questions and Answers on Needlesticks and Sharps Q72. What does \"other potentially infectious material\" mean? A72. Other potentially infectio us material (OPIM): For purposes of employee injury illness reporting, this term has the sa me meaning as in OSHA's bloodborne pathogens standard at 29 CFR \u00a7 191 0.1030, as amended, which on the date of issuance of this Reporting Guide defines OPIM as: (1) The following human body fluids: seme secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericar dial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva in dental pr ocedures, any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids in situati ons where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids; (2) Any unfixed tissue or organ (other th an intact skin) from a human (whether living or dead); and (3) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-c ontaining cell or tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV- or hepati tis B virus (HBV)-containing culture medium or other solutions; and bl ood, organ, or other tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV or HBV. Q73. Does this mean that I must repor t all cuts, lacerations, punctures, and scratches? A73. No. You need to report cuts, lacerati ons, punctures, and scratches only if they are work-related and involve contamination with another person's blood or other potentially infectious material. If the cut, laceration, or sc ratch involves a clean object, or a contaminant other than blood or other potentially in fectious material, FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 87 F 6180.55a you need to report the case only if it meet s one or more of the general reporting criteria. Q74. If I report an injury and the employee is later diagnosed with an infectious bloodborne disease, do I need to update Form FRA F 6180.55a report? A74. Yes. You must update the classifica tion of the case on a corrected Form FRA F 6180.55a if the case results in death, days away from work, restricted work, or job transfer. You must also update the description to iden tify the infectious disease and change the classification of th e case from an injury to an illness. Q75. What if one of my employees is splashed or exposed to blood or other potentially infectious material without be ing cut or scratched? Do I need to report this incident? A75. You need to report such an incident on Form FRA F 6180.55a as an illness if: (1) It results in the diagnosis of a bloodborne illness, such as HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; or (2) It meets one or more of the general reporting criteria. 6.12.2 Reporting Criteria for Cases Involving Medical Removal If an employee is medically removed under the me dical surveillance requir ements of an OSHA standard, you must report the case. You must report each medical rem oval case as either a case involvi ng days away from work or a case involving restricted work activity, depending on how you decide to comply with the medical removal requirement. If the medical re moval is the result of a chemical exposure, you must report the case as one involving \"poisoning.\" Questions and Answers on Medical Removal Q76. Do all of OSHA's standards have medical removal provisions? A76. No. Some OSHA standards, such as the standards covering bloodborne pathogens and noise, do not have medi cal removal provisions. Many OSHA standards that cover specific chemi cal substances have medical removal provisions. These standards include, but are not limited to, lead, cadmium, methylene chloride, formaldehyde, and benzene. Q77. Do I have to report a case where I voluntarily removed the employee from exposure before the medical removal criteria in an OS HA standard are met? FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 88 F 6180.55a A77. No. If the case involves voluntary me dical removal before the medical removal levels required by an OSHA standard are reached, you do not need to report the case. 6.12.3 Reporting Criteria for Cases Involving Occupational Hearing Loss Basic requirement . If an employee's hearing test (a udiogram) reveals that the employee has experienced a work-related standard threshold shif t (STS) in hearing in one or both ears, and the employee's total hearing level is 25 dB or mo re above audiometric zero (averaged at 2,000; 3,000; and 4,000 Hz) in the same ear(s) as the ST S, the case must be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a. Questions and Answers on Occupational Hearing Loss Q78. How do I determine whether an STS has occurred? A78. An STS is defined in the occupationa l noise exposure standard at 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.95(g)(10)(i), as a change in heari ng threshold, relative to the baseline audiogram for that employee, of an averag e of 10 dB or more at 2,000; 3,000; and 4,000 Hz in one or both ears. STS. If the employee has never previously experienced a reportable hearing loss, you must compare the employee's current audiogram with that employee's baseline audiogram. If the employee ha s previously experienced a reportable hearing loss, you must compare the em ployee's current audiogram with the employee's revised baseline audiogram (the audiogram reflecting the employee's previous reportable hearing loss case). 25-dB loss. Audiometric test results refl ect the employee's overall hearing ability in comparison to audiometric zero. Therefore, using the employee's current audiogram, you must use the av erage hearing level at 2,000; 3,000; and 4,000 Hz to determine whether the employ ee's total hearing level is 25 dB or more. Q79. May I adjust the audiogram results to reflect the effects of aging on hearing? A79. Yes. When you are determining wh ether an STS has occurred, you may age- adjust the employee's current audiogram results by using Tables F-1 or F-2, as appropriate, in Appendix F of 29 CFR 1910.95. You may not use an age adjustment when determining whether the empl oyee's total hearing le vel is 25 dB or more above audiometric zero. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 89 F 6180.55a Q80. Do I have to report the hearing loss if I am going to retest the employee's hearing? A80. No. If you retest the employee's heari ng within 30 days of the first test, and the retest does not confirm the reportable ST S, you are not required to record the hearing loss case on the log. If the retest confirms the reportable STS, you must record the hearing loss illness on your log within 7 calendar days of the retest and include it on your monthly re port. If subsequent audiometric testing performed under the testing requirements of the 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.95 noise standard indicates that an STS is not persistent, you may delete the case from Form FRA F 6180.55a. Q81. Are there any special rules for determ ining whether a hearing loss case is work-related? A81. No. It is possible for a worker who is exposed at or a bove the 8-hour 85 dBA action levels of the noise standard to experience a non- work-related hearing loss, and it is also possible for a worker to experience a work-related hearing loss and not be exposed above those levels. Th erefore, there are no special rules for determining work-relatedness. You s hould follow the overall approach to determining work-relatedness -that a case is work-related if one or more events or exposures in the work environment either caused or contributed to the hearing loss, or significantly aggravated a preexisting hearing loss. Q82. If a PLHCP determines the hearing loss is not work-related, do I still need to report the case? A82. If a PLHCP determines that the heari ng loss is not work-related and has not been significantly aggravated by occupational noi se exposure, you are not required to consider the case work-related or to report the case on Form FRA F 6180.55a. 6.12.4 Reporting Criteria for Work-Related Tuberculosis Cases If any of your employees has been occupationa lly exposed to anyone with a known case of active tuberculosis (TB), and that employee subsequen tly develops a TB infection, as evidenced by a positive skin test or diagnosis by a PLHCP, you must report the case on Form FRA F 6180.55a. Questions and Answers on Tuberculosis Q83. Do I have to report a positive TB skin test result for an employee that was obtained at a pre-employment physical? A83. No. You do not have to report it be cause the employee was not occupationally exposed to a known case of active tu berculosis in your workplace. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 90 F 6180.55a 6.12.5 Reporting Criteria for Cases Involving Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders If any of your employees experiences a reportabl e work-related musculoskeletal disorder (MSD), you must report it on Form FRA F 6180.55a. Questions and Answers on Musculoskeletal Disorders Q84. What is a \"musculoskeletal disorder\" or MSD? MSDs are disorders of the muscles, ne rves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage and spinal discs. MSDs do not include disorders caused by slips, trips, falls, motor vehicle accidents, or other similar a ccidents. Examples of MSDs include: carpal tunnel syndrome, rotator cuff syndrom e, De finger, tarsal tunnel syndrome, sciatic a, epicondylitis, tendinitis, Raynaud's phenomenon, carpet layers knee, herniate d spinal disc, and lower back pain. Q85. How do I decide which MSDs to report? A85. There are no special crite ria for determining which musculoskeletal disorders to report. An MSD case is reported using the same process you would use for any other injury or illness. If a musculoske letal disorder is work-related, is a new case, and meets one or more of the gene ral reporting criteria , you must report the musculoskeletal disorder. Q86. Are there any special rules regarding injuries and illnesses to soft tissues? A86. No. Work-related inju ries and illnesses involving muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage and spinal discs are reportable under the same requirements applicable to any other type of injury or illness. There are no special rules for reporting these cases: if the case is work-related and involves medical treatment, days away, job transfer or restricted work, it is reportable. Q87. An employee is diagnosed with a mild case of carpal tunnel syndrome. The illness is work-related, but there is no treatment prescribed other than a change in office equipment. Is this reportable? A87. This case would not be considered repor table since none of the requirements for reportability are shown to have occurre d, i.e., no day(s) away from work; no restriction of work activity or job tran sfer; no loss of consciousness; and no medical treatment. The railroad has th e requirement to establish an accountable record on Form FRA F 6180.98 within 7 days of receiving knowledge that an accountable case has occurred, and to mon itor that case for a period of 180 days FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 91 F 6180.55a from the date of diagnosis of the illne ss. Should any of the requirements be met for reportability within that 180-day m onitoring period, the case would become reportable. Q88. If a work-related MSD case involves only subjective symptoms like pain or tingling, do I have to report it as a musculoske letal disorder? A88. The symptoms of an MSD are treated the same as symptoms for any other injury or illness. If an employee has pa in, tingling, burning, numbness or any other subjective symptom of an MSD, and the symptoms are work-related, and the case is a new case that meets the reporting crit eria, you must report the case on Form FRA F 6180.55a as a musculoskeletal disorder. 6.12.6 Miscellaneous Questions and Answers Q89. What should I do if an employee deat h occurs in the workplace and it is not immediately known if it is work-related? A89. Under \u00a7 225.9, you by toll-free number (800-424-0201 or 800-424-8802) whenever an employee dies while in the work environment. You do not need to prepare a Form FRA F 6180.55a if it is later established that the death is not work-related. Q90. Does an employee report of an injury or illness establish the existence of the injury or illness for reporting purposes? A90. No. In determining whether a case is reportable, the employer must first decide whether an injury or illness, as defined earlier, has occurred. If the employer is uncertain about whether an injury or illn ess has occurred, the employer may refer the employee to a PLHCP for evaluation and may consider the healthcare professional's opinion in determining whether an injury or illness exists. [Note: If a PLHCP diagnoses a significant injury or illness within the meaning of this section, and the employer determines that the case is work-related, the case must be reported.] Q91. Must a railroad report a case if an em ployee alleges that an injury or illness has occurred but refuses to release any medical records related to the alleged injury or illness? A91. Medical verification is not required for reportability. However, a railroad has the responsibility to make good faith repor ting determinations, and these decisions must be based upon whatever documentation is available. If a railroad questions the validity of an employee's alleged inju ry or illness and there is no substantive FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 92 F 6180.55a or medical documentation to support the al legation, the railroad need not report the case. However, if at a later date th e appropriate information is received that supports the employee's allegation of injury or illness, then a late report must be made. Q92. If a maintenance employee is cleaning the parking lot or an access road and is injured as a result, is the case work-related? A92. Yes. The case is work-related because the employee is injured as a result of conducting company business in the work environment. If the injury meets the general reporting criteria (death, days away, etc.), the case must be reported. Q93. Are cases of workplace violence cons idered work-related under the reporting criteria? If an employee dies or is injured or in fected as a result of terrorist attacks, should it be recorded on the FRA Form F 6180.98, and reported to FRA on FRA Form F 6180.55a? A93. The criteria contain no general excep tion, for purposes of determining work- relatedness, for cases involving acts of viol ence in the work environment. Injuries and illnesses that result from a terro rist event or exposure in the work environment are considered work-relate d for FRA recordkeeping purposes. FRA does not provide an exclusion for violence-related injury and illness cases, including injuries and illnesses re sulting from terrorist attacks. Q94. If an employee's preexisting medical co ndition causes an incident that results in a subsequent injury, is the case work-related? For example, if an employee suffers an epileptic seizure, fa lls on the track, and breaks his arm, is the case reportable? A94. Neither the seizure nor the broken arm is reportable, so long as nothing in the work environment caused or contributed to th e seizure. Injuries and illnesses that result solely from non-work-related even ts or exposures are not reportable. Epileptic seizures are a symptom of a di sease of non-occupati onal origin, and the fact that they occur at work does not ma ke them work-related. Because epileptic seizures are not work-related, injuries resu lting solely from the seizures, such as the broken arm in the case in que stion, are not reportable. Q95. Does the size or degree of a burn determine reportability? FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 93 F 6180.55a A95. No. The size or degree of a work-related burn does not determine reportability. If a work-related first-, sec ond-, or third-degree burn resu lts in days absent from work, work restrictions, medical treatm ent, etc., the case must be reported. Q96. If an employee dies during surgery ma de necessary by a work-related injury or illness, is the case reportable? What if the surgery occurs weeks or months after the date of the injury or illness? A96. If an employee dies as a result of surgery or other complications following a work-related injury or illness, the case is reportable. If the underlying injury or illness was reported prior to the employee's death, the employer must submit a corrected Form FRA F 6180.55a to change the injury classification from nonfatal to fatal. Q97. Our railroad has a program that a llows employees who have been involved in an accident to take a p ersonal day(s) off if they indicate they were \"shaken up,\" i.e., they expressed some need to have time off to recover from being involved in an accident. These employees often do not have physical injuries, but may have experienced emotional tr auma. How should we handle these cases? A97. The situation would generally not be repor table, especially if there are no injuries to be evaluated for reportability. You ar e not required to seek out information on mental illnesses from your employees. Mental illness cases are only to be considered when an employee voluntarily presents you with an opinion from the healthcare professional that the employee ha s a mental illness and that it is work- related. You are to record only those mental illnesses verified by a healthcare professional with appropriat e training and experience in the treatment of mental illness, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or psychiatric nurse practitioner. In the event that the employer does not belie ve the reported mental illness is work- related, the employer may refer the case to a PL HCP for a second opinion. Q98. How long should we monitor an inju ry of an employee on duty? What about situations where the initial determination following an incident is that injury is not reportable, e.g., first aid only, but the employee notifies you after an extensive amount of time has elapsed th at later medical treatment received is connected to the initial incident? What about illnesses for which it is uncertain when the initial exposure took place? A98. The employer is required to monitor a reportable employee injury for at least 180 calendar days following the date of th e event or exposure causing the injury. This will ensure that the most serious fi nal result for the case is reported, e.g., a nonfatal condition is upgraded to a fatality if the employee dies subsequent to the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 94 F 6180.55a filing of the initial report. The 180-day timeframe is also necessary to determine if the cap for the sum of days absent and/or restricted has been met. It has been FRA's experience that a reportable injury will meet one or more of the reporting criteria, e.g., medical treat ment, within 180 days following the employer's notification that a workplace in cident has occurred. If an employee alleges that additional treatment was rece ived following the conclusion of this 180-day period for a case that was not repor table, you are requir ed to review any documentation you receive and evaluate if th e later consequences are the result of a new incident. If it is determined that the later consequences are a result of new incident, then a report must be made. Because illnesses may go undetected for extensive periods of time following a work place exposure, the 180-day tracking for these begins with the most recent diagnosis, or recognition that the condition exists. The 180-day monitoring period does not aff ect the requirement to submit a late report if it is determined that a qualifying condition was not reported to FRA. Q99. Does going to a hospital for obs ervation make a work-related injury reportable? A99. Visits to a PLHCP solely for obser vation or counseling, and the conduct of diagnostic procedures, such as x rays a nd blood tests, including the administration of prescription medications used solely fo r diagnostic purposes (e.g., eye drops to dilate pupils) is first aid, and by itself not reportable. Q100. Is an injury that results in a chipped or broken tooth reportable? A100. FRA believes that fractured or crack ed bones and broken teeth are generally considered significant injuries and must be reported at the initial diagnosis even if medical treatment or work restrictions are not recommended, or are postponed, in a particular case. (See section on re porting requirements for specific cases.) Q101. If an employee has a minor scratch but the physician gives him a tetanus shot anyway, does this constitute medi cal treatment and make the case reportable? A101. A tetanus shot is first-aid treatment a nd not reportable. If the employee suffered some reaction or complication from the in jection, requiring medical treatment or resulting in other reporting crit eria being met, then the case would be reportable. (Other immunizations, such as hepat itis B vaccine or rabies vaccine, are considered medical treatment.) FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 95 F 6180.55a Q102. Our employees are frequently tested for drug or alcohol use after an accident/incident. Company policy proh ibits an employee from returning to work until the results of the tests are known and it is established that there is no risk factor due to im pairment. Must we make a report because of the days the employee was held out of s ervice while awaiting test results? A102. These cases are to be evaluated sole ly on the basis of the condition and its consequences. If the condition would have caused the employee to be absent from work had there been no testing, then a report must be made. Q103. I was hurt on the job, and my superv isor accompanied me to the clinic. My supervisor gave the nurse a card to give to the doctor that would be examining me. Our railroad uses a card that describes various treatments or therapies that require a report be made to the FRA. The card appears to encourage or suggest that the doctor consider treatment of a nonreportable nature. I feel this may unduly influence the medical facility and could affect the treatment I would have otherw ise received had the card not been presented. Since my employer pays fo r the medical expenses, I am concerned that employees will be taken to treatment centers where this practice exists. The intent seems more to reduce reportab le cases, rather than ensuring that the healthcare professional provides t reatment that he or she believes is appropriate for the injury. Does FRA authorize the use of such cards or other communications of this nature to healthcare providers? A103. No. FRA is extremely concerned that injured work ers receive proper medical treatment. We do not condone the use of any form or medical card that could adversely influence treatment by encouragi ng the use of nonreportable treatment. Such practices are not on ly discouraged by FRA, but may also in certain circumstances constitute a vi olation of Part 225, subject to a civil penalty against the carrier or supervisor w ho engages in such practices. Q104. An employee was injured on the job a nd taken to a local hospital emergency room. The supervisor felt that the in jury was not serious and was concerned that the case might be reportable. The employee requested that the supervisor stay out of the examining r oom. The attending physician in the emergency room prohibited the su pervisor from being present. What is considered appropriate conduct for a supervisor to engage in when an employee is injured and the superv isor is concerned the employee has exaggerated the extent of the injury? FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 96 F 6180.55a A104. FRA is very concerned that, when accompanied by a supervisor, an injured employee may be discouraged or otherwis e prevented from reporting an accident, incident, injury or illness. Similarly, a supervisor may influence the type or extent of medical treatment afforded the employee in an effort to affect the reportability of that injury. As an initial matter, it would be inappr opriate and a violation of Part 225 for a supervisor to request that a physician r ecommend that an injured employee take only OTC drugs sold at lowe r-than-prescription strength. In addition, FRA published a Notice of Interpretation in the Federal Register (FR) on March 30, 2009, regarding its applicati on and enforcement of the harassment and intimidation provisions contained in Part 225, specifi cally relating to situations in which a supervisor or othe r railroad official accompanies an injured employee into an examination room. See 74 FR 14091. FRA includes that Interpretation here, as follows: A. General Principle Harassment and intimidation occur in violation of \u00a7 225.33(a)(1) when a railroad supervisor accompanies an injured employee into an examination room, unless one or more of the exceptions listed below exists. B. Exceptions FRA recognizes that there are limite d circumstances in which it is appropriate, and indeed preferable, for a supervisor to accompany an injured employee into an examin ation room. Consequently, FRA recognizes the following limited exceptions: (1) The injured employee issues a voluntary invitation to the supervisor to accompany him or her in the examination room. The injured employee must issue th is invitation freely, without coercion, duress, or intimidation. For example, an injured employee may seek the attendance of a supervisor where the supervisor is a friend. This exception does not encompass invitations issued by third partie s, including physicians, unless the invitations are made pursuant to the request of the injured employee. (2) The injured employee is unconsci ous or otherwise unable to effectively communicate material information to the physician and the supervisor's input is need ed to provide such material information to the physician. In these circumstances, the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 97 F 6180.55a supervisor is assisting the injured employee in providing information to the physician so that the injured employee may receive appropriate and re sponsive medical treatment. Q105. An employee on duty suffers a fatal he art attack. Is the case reportable? A105. You must make immediate notificati on of a worker's death, regardless of suspected cause or circumstances (see Telephonic Reports of Certain Accidents/Incidents in Chapter 1 of this FRA Guide). The FRA investigates all deaths reported by this notification requi rement. However, if an event or exposure is not a discernable cause of the in jury or illness, th en a report is not required. Therefore, the railroad must i nvestigate the death and determine whether it is more likely than not th at an event or exposure was a discernable cause of the death. Q.106. A track worker stumbled on a rotten tie near the right-of-way and rolled down the embankment. Two other railr oad employees observed the event. The worker was taken to a local PLHCP. After the examination, the PLHCP declared the employee fit for full duty ; no medical treatment was provided. The employee chose not to report to work the next day, and took a day \"sick\" leave as provided for under the collective bargaining agreement. The railroad completed the Form FR A F 6180.98-Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record. However, sin ce the employee did not report to work the next day, does this qualify as an FRA-reportable event? A.106. This case would not be reportable to FRA, because the employee injury did not meet the general reporting criteria. However, because the employee was examined by a PLHCP, this does qualify as an accountable injury and the railroad must complete a Form FRA F 6180.98. Note, however, that if the employee called in sick because the PLHCP subs equently recommends time away from work or restricted duty, then the injury would be reportable. For example, after being examined by the PLHCP and being declared fit for full duty, the employee's condition worsens; the empl oyee contacts the PLHCP the day after being examined to discuss the injury and the PLHCP then recommends time away from work or restricted duty, thus making the case reportable. Q.107. A car cleaner strains his/her back during the performance of duty. The car cleaner calls the supervisor the next mo rning complaining of a very sore back and requests to stay home for a couple of days. The supervisor agrees to put the employee on administrative time. After 2 days, the supervisor instructs the employee to see a PLHCP. The doct or declares the employee fit for full duty. What is the reporting obligation of the railroad? FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 98 F 6180.55a A.107. The supervisor should have instructed the employee to seek medical attention when called. If the supervisor instruct s the employee to stay home, but pays the employee as if he were on duty or on administrative leave, the supervisor's actions indicate an admission by the rail road that the injury/illness is work- related. Likewise, if a railroad supervisor decides to restrict an employee's duties due to a claimed employee work-related in jury/illness, the supervisor's actions indicate an admission by the railroad that the injury/illness is work-related. Accordingly, the railro ad must complete the Form FRA F 6180.98-Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record, and submit to FRA a completed Form FRA F 6180.55a-Railroad Inju ry and Illness Summary. 6.13 Reporting of Injuries to Pers ons Other Than Railroad Employees A report must be made for each fatality and e ach injury that requires medical treatment beyond first aid, results in loss of consciousness, or m eets the definition of signi ficant injury, that is discernibly caused by an event or exposure arising from the operation of the railroad. There is a general presumption that any deat h or injury that occurs on a ra ilroad's premises, more likely than not, is related to the operation of the railro ad. Other cases become reportable if they are connected to an event or exposure that occurred on the railroad's premises but affected persons not on the premises, e.g., a plume from a hazardous material release. A highway user, who is involve d in a highway-rail grade cro ssing accident/incident and is transported from the scene of a highway-rail gr ade crossing accident/incident to a medical facility via ambulance or other fo rm of medical conveyance, is presumed to have sustained an FRA reportable injury. Absent ev idence to rebut this presumpti on, the railroad must report the injury to FRA on Form FRA F 6180.55a and sh ow the injury on Block 46 on Form FRA F 6180.57, \"Highway-Rail Crossing Accident/Incident Repor t.\" If the railroad later discovers that the highway user did not sustain a reportable injury, the railroad must notify FRA in accordance with the late reporting instructi ons. This presumption does not re lieve railroads of their duty to make reasonable inquiry, as described below a nd in depth in Chapter 10 of this Guide, to determine the nature and severity of highway-rail grade crossing injuries and to accurately report such injuries. A description of first-aid treatments can be found in the earlier section describing the requirements for reporting rail road employee reporting. Determination of Nature and Severity of Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Injuries : In order to fulfill its responsibilities in dete rmining the nature and severity of highway-rail grade crossing injury and to accurately report such injury, a rail road must try to contact any potentially injured highway user, or their representative, in writi ng and, if unsuccessful in obtaining the needed information, by telephone. If a highway user di ed as a result of the highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident, a railroad must not send this form to any person. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 99 F 6180.55a The railroad should contact poten tially injured highway users i nvolved in a highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident, in wr iting, by sending each potentially injured highway user a Form FRA F 6180.150, \"Highway User Injury Inquiry Form,\" and, if unsuccessful, by phone. See Guide, Chapter 10, for complete instructions. If a highway user died as a result of the highway- rail grade crossing acciden t/incident, a railroad must not send this form to any person. The Form FRA F 6180.150 should also include a cover letter explaining the form's purpose and containing instructions on how to complete the form in addition to a prepai d, preaddressed return envelope so that the highway user can easily return the comp leted form to the railroad if he or she opts to complete the form. See FRA Guide, Chapter 10, for complete instructions. The Form FRA F 6180.150 and cover letter should be completed, dr afted, and mailed in accordance with the instructions found in \u00a7 225.21 and th e FRA Guide at Chapter 10. A sa mple cover letter has been provided in Appendix N to this FRA Guide. FRA acknowledges that there will be situations in which a highway user cannot be reached, even though a railroad contacts the pe rson by telephone and in writing. Other times, a highway user will refuse to provide any information, even though a railroad clearly explains the Federal reporting requirements and the reason for soliciting in formation. In those cases , a railroad is still responsible for deciding whether, considering all of the circumstances, the highway user suffered a reportable injury. The railroad must reconsider that determ ination if new or additional information is later acquired. Moreover, if a highway user completes Part II of Form FRA F 6180.150, or provides additional information during a telephone call, the railroad will be responsible for determining whether, base d on the circumstances, the person suffered a reportable injury or illness. See Guide, Chapter 6, for complete instructions. The railroad must use any respons e it receives when contacting the potentia lly injured highway user to determine whether any Part 225 records or reports should be created, and to complete those records and reports. The railroad must keep a record of its efforts to make such contact including, but not limited to, retaining a copy of the Form FRA F 6180.150 sent to the highway user and the accompanying cover letter, any response from the highway user and, when appropriate, a record documenting the date, time, and content of the followup ca ll. This record and documentation of any information obtained must be retained for a peri od of 5 years and be available for review and copying by an FRA representative under the same criteria as set forth in \u00a7 225.35 (b). Determination of Nature of Trespasser Fatality: In order to fulfill its responsibilities in determining the nature of a trespasser fatality a nd to accurately report such fatality, a railroad must try to obtain documentation indicating the cause of death by contac ting a coroner, public police officer or other public official by tele phone and, if unsuccessful in obtaining the needed information, in writing. The railroad must contin ue its efforts to obtain this documentation for a period of 6 months following the month in which the fatality occurred. The railroad must keep a record of its efforts to obtain such documenta tion. This record and any documentation obtained FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 100 F 6180.55a must be available for review and copying by an FR A representative under the same criteria as set forth in \u00a7 225.35(b). 6.13.1 Questions and Answers on Injuries to Persons Other Than Railroad Employees Q108. When you refer to an event or expo sure arising from the operation of a railroad, would this include a motor vehicle incident between one of our employees and another person, e.g., a moto rist lost control, crossed median strip, and struck a truck being driven by a railroad employee on railroad property? A108. An event or exposure arising from the operation of the railro ad includes, for a non-employee, (i) if the person is on pr operty owned, leased, maintained, or operated by the railroad, an event or exposur e that is related to the performance of the railroad's rail transpor tation business; or (ii) if the person is off property owned, leased, maintained, or operated by th e railroad, an event or exposure that directly results from certain limited even ts or exposure. An example would be a hazardous material release from a railcar in the possession of the railroad, where the fumes drifted to an adjacent commun ity and caused death or other reportable conditions. Since these persons were harm ed while on the railroad's property and the event was related to the performance of the railroad's rail transportation business, then the railroad is responsibl e for reporting any casualties associated with this event. Q109. Is there any difference in reporting re quirements for the following cases? A trespasser was walking over a trestl e when a train suddenly came in sight. He jumped from the trestle to avoid being struck, and broke a leg. A child was trespassing on a railroad bridge and fell to his death. There was no evidence that a train or rail road employees were present at the time of the accident. A109. No. Both situations ar e reportable since both the tres tle and train are directly associated with the operation of the railroad. Q110. A body was found along our right-of-w ay. It was determined that death was a result of being struck by a train; however, several railroads operate over this segment of track. Who is responsible for reporting? A110. If known, the railroad operat ing the consist involved must report. If that railroad cannot be determined, then the railroad responsible for the track maintenance must report. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 101 F 6180.55a Q111. A car was driving on a public overp ass when the driver, who was not a railroad employee, lost control and the vehicle fell to our property below. The driver was seriously injured. Do we need to report this incident? A111. No. Unless there was some involvement of the railroad that was a cause of or contribution to the incident, then the injury to the driver woul d not be reportable. Q112. Can you provide some examples of si tuations involving reportable injuries suffered by a \"Worker on Duty -Volunteer,\" a \"Volunteer -Other,\" a \"Worker on Duty -Contractor,\" and a \"Contractor -Other\" in the course of different types of work performed? A112. Example 1. A volunteer operates a loco motive for an excursion railroad. Operation of a locomotive clearly falls within the realm of \"operation of on-track equipment.\" If the volunteer sustains a reportable injury (i.e., an injury resulting in death or requiring medical treatment) during operati on of the locomotive, then the incident is reported as an injury to a \"Worker on Duty -Volunteer\" (Class H), with the appli cable job code series. Example 2. A volunteer sits in a booth se lling tickets for train rides on a tourist railroad that operates on the ge neral system and also clears vegetation adjacent to its roadbed. Under 49 CFR \u00a7 213.37, vegetation is to be cleared from the roadbed for safe rail operations; vegetation clearing is, th us, an aspect of maintaining the roadbed under \u00a7 209.303(b)(1) an d is therefore considered a \"safety-sensitive function.\" Any injury sustained by the volunteer during the vegetation clearing is cl assified as one to a \"Worker on Duty-Volunteer\" (Class H). If any reportable injury is sustained by the volunteer during the proce ss of selling tickets, then such injury is classified as one to a \"Volunteer -Other\" (Class I). If, however, the volunteer sells tickets and then clears vegetation during the same tour, then all in juries are considered as those attributable to a \"Worker on Duty -Volunteer\" (Class H). Therefore, when a volunteer is e ngaged in \"mixed service,\" the railroad must report all reportabl e injuries for that volunteer as those to a \"Worker on Duty -Volunteer\" (Class H) on Form FRA F 6180.55a. Conversely, when a contractor employee is engaged in such \"mixed service\" on railro ad property, the railroad must report all reportable injuries for th at contractor employee as those to a \"Worker on Duty -Contractor\" (Class F) on Form FRA F 6180.55a, with the applicable job code series of the service FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 102 F 6180.55a performed. Also note that if th e volunteer in this example is working for a tourist railroad that operates exclusively off the general system, and if the incide nt that causes his injury is classified as a non-train incident that doesn't involve operational on-track equipment, then Part 225 does not require the tourist railroad to report the injury at all. See \u00a7 225.3. Example 3. The employee of a contractor performs payroll as well as time-and- attendance functions for a railroad on railroad property. Such functions are not considered \"saf ety-sensitive\" because they are not related to the continued safety of the railroad and do not fall under the definition of any safety-sensitive function as defined in \u00a7 209.303. Thus, an injury sustained by this contractor performing those tasks is reported as that to a \"Contractor -Other\" (Class G). Example 4. A contractor employee inspect s and replaces roller bearings for the reporting railroad on the railroad's property. Injuri es sustained by this contractor are reported as those to a \"Worker on Duty - Contractor\" (Class F) on Fo rm FRA F 6180.55a. Under \u00a7 215.113, cars with defective roller bearings should not be in service, thus any injury associated with repl acement of roller bearings is a \"safety-sensitive function\" qualifying as an injury attributable to a \"Worker on Duty -Contractor\" (Class F). In contrast, if this same injury was sustained by a contract or employee at the contractor's facility off railroad property, then such injury would not be reported to FRA. 6.14 Miscellaneous Guidance Casualties to persons on trains or other on-track equipment, except for employees of another railroad, are to be reported by the railroad responsible for the consist at the time of the accident/incident. Casualties to persons not on trains or other on-tr ack equipment are to be reported by the railroad whose consist or operation was most directly involved, e.g., casualties away from railroad property resulting from a releas e of hazardous materials. Any person found unconscious or dead on or adjacent to a railroad's premises or right-of-way is reportable by the railroad responsible for track ma intenance if it is determined that the casualty resulted from the operation of a railroad a nd the identity of the railroad causing the accident/incident cannot be established in areas of joint operation. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 103 F 6180.55a When a person dies as a result of an accident/i ncident after the month in which the case was initially reported, the case will be reclassified as a fatality. Any death occurring under these circumstances is to be identified by correcting the original casualty record to change the casualty from nonfatal to fatal, and the corrected report mu st be submitted with changes circled in red. An entry for each casualty must be made on a separate line. Each accident/incident must have an identifying nu mber that is unique for the report month. All forms used by a railroad to report a single event or exposure must use the same accident/incident number. For example, if a highway-rail grade crossing accident injures more than one person, a separate line entry is used on Form FRA F 6180.55a to report each injury. A Form FRA F 6180.57 must also be completed. The same accide nt/incident identification number must be the same for all records. 6.14.1 Coding Instructions Injuries Due to Passenger Station Plat form Gap Incidents A \"passenger station platform gap incident\" is a reportable injury invol ving a person who, while involved in the process of boarding or alighting a passenger train at a rail car door threshold plate at a high-level passenger boarding platform (i.e., a platform that is 48\" or more above the top of the rail), has one or more body parts enter th e area between the carbody and the edge of the platform or traveling between passenger cars. The following are examples of a passenger station platform gap incident: While boarding or alighting a passenger train at a high-level passenger boarding platform, a person misjudges the passenger stati on platform gap, resul ting in the person's leg entering the passenger station platform gap. While boarding or alighting a passenger train at a high-level passenger boarding platform, a person is struck by a closing door , resulting in the person's leg entering the passenger station platform gap. The following are not examples of a pa ssenger station platform gap incident: While boarding or alighting a passenger train at a high-level passenger boarding platform, a person misjudges the gap and falls into the vestibule or platform, without a body part entering the gap. While walking on a passenger station at a high-level passenger boarding platform, a person slips on the platform at a location othe r than the rail car door threshold, resulting in the person's leg entering the gap. Passenger station platform gap injuries usually occur when the high-level platform station is concave or convex, when there is misalignmen t between the platform and passenger car (see FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 104 F 6180.55a diagram), or when a person is traveling between cars and has one or mo re body parts enter the area between the cars. Figure 2: Diagram of coordination of vehicle floor with boarding platform These passenger station platform gap injuries ha ve special coding instructions, and new codes were added to the Circumstance Codes (Appendix F). When an injury is a result of a person being in jured due to a \"passenger station platform gap\" incident as defined above, the railroad must use, in Block 5n (\"Cause\"), \"Probably Reason for Injury/Illness Circumstance Code,\" Code Number 18, \"Slipped, fe ll, stumbled due to Passenger Station Platform Gap\" regardless of wh ether other codes may be applicable. The following codes would typically be used to de scribe a passenger station platform gap event on Form Railroad Injury and Illness Summar y (Continuation Sheet) - Form FRA F 6180.55a.

Name of Reporting Railroad Enter the full name of the reporting railroad. 2. Alphabetic Code Enter the reporting railroad's code found in Appendix A. 3. Report Month Enter the month covered by this report. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 106 F 6180.55a 4. Report Year Enter the year covere d by this report. 5a. Accident/Injury Number Enter the identifying number assigned to the accident/incident causing the casualty. If multiple casualties resulted from a single event, each casualty must have exactly the same report number. If the casualty was a result of a rail equipment accident/incident or a highway-rail grade crossing impact, the entry must be the same as that shown on the other forms completed for the accident/incident. 5b. Day Enter the day of the accident/incident. Use number day of the month, e.g., 01-31. 5c. Time of Day Enter the time of the accident/incident, in cluding \"a.m.\" or \"p.m.\" Do not use military time. 5d. County Enter the county/parish in whic h the accident/incident occurred. 5e. State Identify the State in which the casualty occurred, using th e appropriate code found in Appendix B. 5f. Type Person/Job Code Identify the type of person whose injury or illness is being reported by using the following codes (refer to classification of persons found in the definitions in Chapter 2): A - Worker on Duty -Railroad Employee; B - Railroad Employee Not On Duty; C - Passengers on Trains; D - Nontrespassers -On Railroad Property; E - Trespassers; F - Worker On Duty -Contractor; G - Contractor -Other; H - Worker on Duty -Volunteer; I - Volunteer -Other; and J - Nontrespassers -Off Railroad Property. If the report is for a \"Worker On Duty,\" i. e., type person/job codes A, F, or H; or the person is an \"Employee Not On Duty,\" type person code \"B;\" you must enter the code from Appendix D that be st identifies the individual's occupation/responsibilities. 5g. Age Enter the age of person whose injury or illness is being reported. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 107 F 6180.55a 5h. Drug/Alcohol Test If any employee was tested for alcohol use in connection with this accident, enter the number of positive tests in the box title d \"A.\" If any employee was tested for drug use in connection with this accident, enter the number of positive tests in the box titled \"D.\" A test is a physical or chemical reaction by which a substance may be detected or its properties asce rtained, and includes both Federal and employer-authorized tests to determine alcohol or drug usage. A test performed under Federal (FRA) requirements is consid ered positive when the test result has been verified as positive by a Medica l Review Officer and reported to the employer. A test performed under other au thorization is considered positive when the employer will defend the results if legally challenged. (Refer to 49 CFR Part 219, Control of Alcohol and Drug Us e, for additional information.) If there were positive tests, but impairment is not reported as a cause of the accident, then provide a brief explanation in the narrative of the basis for this determination. The narrative is to be us ed to provide addi tional clarification, particularly in instances where there are positive test results, but impairment was not determined to have been causal. You are required to identify all accidents /incidents where testing was performed. The recording of this data on a record does not mean that the injured person was the individual tested. This situation could occur when the employee(s) tested for the use of these substances was not harmed in the accident/incident. Under these circumstances, since there was no injury to the tested employee, there would be no entry for this employee on Form FRA F 6180 .55a. Therefore, it is critical to record the information con cerning tests on all reports fi led in connection with the accident/incident. Note: The same drug and alcohol code s should be reported on all corresponding Forms FRA F 6180.54 and Forms FRA 6180.55 a's that are filed under the same accident/incident number. This situation could arise, for exampl e, when a non-employee (e.g., a passenger), sustains the only reportable in jury in an incident that resulted in testing of employee(s). In order to identify th e connection between the injury being reported and possible alcohol or drug use by an employee, it is mandatory that the information concerning the alcohol or drug us e be recorded on the reports made in connection with the a ccident/incident. 5i. Injury/Illness Code Select from the codes in Appendix E th e combination that best describes the condition being reported. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 108 F 6180.55a 5j. Physical Act From Appendix F, select the code that be st describes what the injured person was doing just before the injury occurred. If the code you have selected does not sufficiently describe the \"physical act, \" provide further description in the Narrative. 5k. Location The location comprises three sets of codes as described below. PART I: Was the person on the right-of-way, off the right-of-way, or on on- track equipment? Identify the appropriate categor y describing where the casualty occurred, and enter th e appropriate code lis ted in Appendix F. When using \"Other,\" a narrative must be provided in Item 5s. PART II : If the casualty involved on-track eq uipment, select the code that best describes the type of on-tr ack equipment involved, and enter appropriate code listed in Appe ndix F. When using \"Other,\" a narrative must be provided in Item 5s. PART III: Select the appropriate code that best identifies the location of the casualty being reported listed in A ppendix F. When using \"Other,\" a narrative must be provided in Item 5s. 5l. Event From Appendix F, select the code that best describes the event or exposure that caused the injury. If the code selected does not sufficiently describe the \"Event,\" provide further descripti on in the narrative. 5m. Tools From Appendix F, select the code that best describes additional information about the tools, machinery, appliances, structur es, surfaces, etc., associated with the injury. You should try to use codes th at provide additional information. For example, if the event or exposure code id entified using \"hand tools,\" the entry in this block could be used to identify that the tool was a \"gripping\" type tool. If the code selected does not sufficiently describe the tools, provide further description in the Narrative. 5n. Cause From Appendix F, select the code that best describes what caused the event or exposure entered in Item 51. If the code you have selected does not sufficiently describe the \"Cause,\" provide furthe r description in the Narrative. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 109 F 6180.55a 5o. Number of Days Away from Work See Chapter 6.8.2, Questions and Answers on Days Away from Work, and section on counting days absent from work and days of restriction. If the person reported is an employee of the reporting railroad, enter the number of days subsequent to the da y of the injury or the diagnosis of the illness that a railroad employee does not report to wo rk, or was recommended by a PLHCP not to return to work, as applicable, for reasons associated with the employee's condition even if the employee was not sche duled to work on that day. If there were no such days, or a fatality is being reported, enter \"0.\" If the person is not a railroad employee, enter \"N/A.\" 5p. Number of Days Restricted See Chapter 6.9.1, Questions and Answ ers on Restricted Work, and corresponding section on counting days absent from work and days of restriction. If the person being reported is an em ployee of the reporting railroad, enter the number of days that an employee is restri cted in his or her routine job functions following the day of the injury or th e diagnosis of the illness, or was recommended by a PLHCP not to return to full-time work, as applicable. An employee's routine job functions are t hose work activities that the employee regularly performs at least on ce per week. If there were no such days, or a fatality is being reported, enter \"0.\" If the pers on is not a railroad em ployee, enter \"N/A.\" 5q. Exposure to Hazmat Enter \"Y\" (for \"yes\") if an exposure to hazardous material caused, or was a contributing factor to, th e condition being reported for this individual. 5r. Special Case Codes (Classification of Certain Injuries and Illnesses for FRA and/or OSHA Purposes) FRA's agreement with OSHA to conform with the new criteria (see Q&A 71 in Chapter 6.10.1, Questions and Answers on Firs t Aid) that went into effect in calendar year 2002 means that some nonfat al cases that were not previously reportable to FRA will now be reportable. Prior to calendar year 2003, only those nonfatal conditions that resulted in actual days away from work, actual work restriction, medical treatment beyond first ai d, or loss of consciousness were to be reported. These cases that are now reporta ble, have been defined as \"covered data\" cases. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 110 F 6180.55a Because of the need to track trends that de termine if the safety record for railroad employees is changing, it is necessary to have a means for identifying these previously unreported cases so that the data collected under the new requirements can be accurately compared with earlier years. If the only reason that a nonfatal condition is being reported is because 1) a physician or PLHCP prescribed time off, but no days were actually taken; 2) a PLHCP prescribed restriction of routine work duties, but restriction of routine work did not occur; or 3) the PLHCP pr escribed OTC medication to be taken at prescription strength, then one of the follo wing codes is to be entered in Item 5r on Form FRA F 6180.55a: A - PLHCP prescribed time off, but no days were actually taken, and returned to full duty (no re stricted days). R - PLHCP prescribed restriction of r outine work duties, but restriction of routine work did not occur. P - PLHCP prescribed OTC medication to be taken at prescription strength, or there was a single external application of prescription medication, e.g., antibiotic ointments or eye drops. Conditions that result in a si ngle dose of medication that is injected or ingested are not \"covered data\" cases. When deciding which code to use when a case involves more than one of the situations above, A takes precedence over R and P, and R takes precedence over P. For example, if the PLHCP reco mmended days absent from work and restriction of work after retu rning to the job, then code A is to be used. If code A or R is used, you must record, at a mi nimum, a count of \"one\" in either Block 5o or 5p, which are used for the counting of days. Suicide Data (Suicide or Attempted Suicide Cases) X - Death of an individual due to that individual's commission of suicide as determined by a coroner, public police offi cer or other public au thority; or injury to an individual, which meets reporting crite ria, due to that individual's attempted commission of suicide as determined by a public authority. Only the death of, or injury to, the individual who committed the su icidal act is considered to be suicide data. When reporting the fatality or injury, enter X in Block 5r. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 111 F 6180.55a Termination or Permanent Transfer If an employee is terminated or perm anently transferred because of physical, medical, or other reasons associ ated with the reported inju ry or illness, then enter Y in Block 5r. Do not enter Code Y if the employee is terminated transferred solely for other reasons, e.g., disciplinary, unless the em ployee's condition was such, e.g., leg amputated, that it would have resulted in termination or transfer regardless of whether disciplinary action was taken. 5s, 5t Latitude and Longitude Block 5s and Block 5t are for recording th e latitude and longitude of the location where the incident occurred. These two blocks are mandatory for any reportable casualty to a trespasser. These bloc ks are optional for Worker On Duty -Railroad Employee (Class A) fatalities. Such longitude and latitude information may be satisfied by either using Global Positioning System equipment to determin e the actual longitude and latitude, or by using Internet technology to determin e an estimated longitude and latitude. FRA is using the World Geodetic System (WGS) 84 Standard for recording the event's latitude and longitude. As such, it is requested that the information follow the WGS 84 standard. Although FRA would prefer decimal degr ees (on hardcopy only, please follow value with \" o\" to specify decimal degrees), FRA will accept latitude and longitude in degrees, minutes, and seconds (with o, ', \" to indicate units used are degrees, minutes, seconds) if submitted on hardcopy (electronic submissions should be in decimal degrees). The latitude should use the following format +xx.xxxxxx. The longitude should use the following format -xxx.xxxxxx in decimal degrees. Use an explicit plus or minus sign and an explicit decimal point followed by six decimal places for both latitude and longitude. Latitude, in decimal degrees: explicit decimal, explicit +/- (WGS 84) (e.g., +35.301486) Longitude, explicit decimal, explic it +/- (WGS 84) (e.g., -085.280201) FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 112 F 6180.55a 5u. Narrative The railroad may further explain unusu al circumstances surrounding a worker's injury or illness using up to 250 charact ers. Completion of this narrative is mandatory for the reporting railroad unless th e injury or illness can be adequately described using all other en tries (information blocks) on the form. Do not record in the narrative personal id entifiers, e.g., names, Social Security numbers, or payroll identifications. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 113 F 6180.54 7. Form FRA F 6180.54 - Rail Equi pment Accident/Incident Report 7.1 Requirement. As set forth in \u00a7 225.19(c), rail equipment accidents /incidents are collisions, derailments, fires, explosions, acts of God, or othe r events involving the operation of railroad on-track equipment (standing or moving) and causing re portable damages greater than the reporting threshold for the year in which the accident/incident occurred, mu st be reported using Form FRA F 6180.54, \"Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report.\" 7.1.1 Reporting Threshold The reporting threshold is updated annually. The reporting threshold for calendar years 2002-2005 is $6,700. The reporting threshold for calendar year 2006 is $7,700. The reporting threshold for calendar year 2007 is $8,200. For accidents that occurred in calendar year 2008, the reporting threshold is $8,900; and, for accidents that occur in calendar year 2010, the reporting threshold is $9,200. See \u00a7 225.19(e). In subs equent years, the railr oad reporting officer should check the FRA Safety Data Web site for th e most current year's re porting threshold (refer to http://safetydata.fra .dot.gov/OfficeofSafety and click on \"Click Here for Changes in Accident/Incident Recor dkeeping and Reporting.\") 7.1.2 Employee Human Factor Reporting and Notification Requirements If the rail equipment accident/incident is attri buted to an employee human factor, then the railroad must complete, \"Employee Human Factor A ttachment.\" This form must be attached to the Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report, Form FRA F 6180.54, and submitted to FRA within 30 days after the expira tion of the month in which the accident/incident occurred. See 225.21(f). Here, \"employee\" includes pers ons classified as Worker On Duty -Employee, Employee not on Duty, Worker on Duty -Contractor, or Worker on Duty -Volunteer. See \u00a7 225.5 (\"Employee Human Factor\") and Chapter 8 of this Guide. When a railroad alleges, in Form FRA F 6180.81, \"Employee Human Factor Attachment,\" that a specific employee caused or contributed to the rail equipment accident/incident, the railroad must complete FRA Form F 6180.78, \"Notice to Railroad Employee Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee Hu man Factor; Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report\" must also be comple ted with notice being given to the employee and submission made to FRA and the alleging railroad. See \u00a7 225.21(g) and Chapter 9 of this Guide. 7.1.3 Coexistent Reporting Requirements All casualties resulting from a rail equipment accide nt, in addition to being recorded on Form FRA F 6180.54, must be reported individually on Form FRA F 6180.55a . If the accident was a highway-rail grade crossing impact, a Form FRA F 6180.57 must also be completed by the railroad responsible for the consist. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 114 F 6180.54 7.2 General Instructions and Interpretations An accident is frequently the culmination of a sequence of related events, and a variety of conditions or circumstances may cont ribute to its occurrence. A co mplete record of all of these would be beneficial in a ccident-prevention analysis. However, it is not practical, even if it were possible, to develop forms and codes that woul d capture every detail that may be associated with the causes and resulting consequences of each accident. Therefore, the most appropriate combination of available codes that best iden tifies the likely primary and any contributing cause, and other factors, is to be used. The limitations imposed by standardized reporting forms make it critical that the narrative portion of the report provide a dditional information concerning those items that cannot be adequately described on the coded portions of th e form. The wide variation in the causes and circumstances of accidents limits our ability to pr epare a comprehensive list of items to include in your discussion. We have attempted to iden tify some of these in the instruction for completing the narrative portion of the report (Item 52). In additi on to these, you should include any information that increases our knowledge of the underlying reasons why the accident occurred and its consequences. 7.2.1 Identification of Train Accident/Incident Each accident/incident must have an identifyi ng number unique within the reporting month. All forms used by a carrier to report a single event mu st use the same accident/incident number. Do not append additional numbers or letters on differe nt forms for the same accident/incident. For example, if a railroad has two consists involve d in an accident, do not report one consist using the reporting number \"12345,\" and the other cons ist using the reporting number \"12345-A.\" The reporting number must be exactly the same on both reports. 7.2.2 Classification of Tr ain Accident/Incident The classification of a train accident by type (c ollision, derailment, other) is determined by the first reportable event in the accident sequence. All reports for a single accident are to use the same designation. For example, if, following a derailment, a train strikes a consist on an adjacent track, the report for this additional cons ist will indicate that the accident type was a derailment, not a collision. 7.2.3 Calculating Costs When final cost figures are not av ailable, estimated values are to be used. If an estimated value was significantly in error, an amended report mu st be forwarded. A signi ficant difference is a 10-percent variance between the damage amount re ported to FRA and curre nt cost figures. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 115 F 6180.54 7.2.4 Joint Operations If the property of more than one railroad is involved in an accide nt/incident, the cost of damages is calculated by including the damages suffe red by all of the railroads involved. When total reportable damage to all railroads di rectly involved in an accident/incident exceeds the reporting threshold, you must make a report, even though your railroad's damages were below the threshold. In joint operations, if the railroad having track maintenance responsibilit y did not also have on- track rail equipment involved, th e railroad having track maintena nce responsibility must submit to FRA a Form FRA F 6180.54 repor t containing track informati on. The items concerning the equipment consist are to be ma rked \"N/A.\" See \u00a7 225.23(c). Any railroad indicating the involve ment of another railroad in the accident on its report must promptly notify the other carrier (FRA may be contacted to obtain telephone numbers). You must exchange information concerning the acc ident and verify, at a minimum, that: 1. The other railroad has a reporting responsibility. 2. Total reportable damage exceeded the threshold. 3. Information contained in both reports is consistent. When there is disagreement concerning the items being reported, particul arly the cause of the accident, each railroad will include a discussion of these in the narrative portion of its report. The back of the form or a separate sheet of paper is to be used when the front of the form is not adequate for this purpose. 7.2.5 Responsibility for Reporting Multiple Consist Accidents A form must be completed for each consist (see Chap ter 2 for definition) involved in an accident. The railroad responsible for the on-track equipmen t at the time of the accident, and only that railroad, will report the consis t information. See \u00a7 225.23(c). 7.2.6 Responsibility for Reporting Accidents on Industry Track Track information for accidents occurring on industr y track of a non-reporting company is to be reported by the railroad operating the on-track equipment. Damages to industry track and on- track equipment are included in re portable damage. The word \"industry\" is to be entered in Item 3b to identify an accident of this type. 7.2.7 Reporting Exceptions The following exceptions do not impact the railr oad's obligation to ma intain records of accidents/incidents as required by \u00a7 225.25 (F orm FRA F 6180.97, \"Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record\"), as applicable. A railroad need not report the following: FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 116 F 6180.54 1. Cars derailed on industry tracks by nonrai lroad employees or nonrailroad employee vandalism, providing there is no invo lvement of railroad employees. 2. Damage to out-of-service cars resulting from high water or flooding, e.g., empties placed on storage or repair track. This exclusion does not apply if such cars are placed into a moving consist and as a result of this da mage, a reportable rail equipment accident results. Suicides and attempted suicides are not exceptions to FRA's reporting requirements and must be reported to FRA as \"suicide data.\" Accidents and incidents cause d by suicide or attempted suicide are NOT excepted from FR A's reporting requirements. Suicide data is data regarding the death of an individual due to that individual's commission of suicide as determined by a coroner or other public authority; or injury to an individual due to that individual's attempted commission of suicide as determined by a public authority. Only the death of, or injury to, the individual who committed the suicidal act is considered to be suicide data. See instructions for completing Blocks 38, 46-48, and 52 of Form FRA F6180.54 under Section 7.3 below. 7.3 Instructions for Completing Form FRA F 6180.54 Note: Enter \"N/A\" for those items that do not appl y to an accident, or for those items describing on-track equipment that is the reporting responsibili ty of another railroad. All items must have an entry; do not leave items blank. If \"none\" is th e proper response to an it em (for example, the number of cars releasing hazardous materi al), then enter \"0,\" not \"N/A.\" Item Instruction 1.

People Evacuated If the accident/incident resulted in an ev acuation of the area because of an actual or a potential exposure to hazardous material, enter the number of persons evacuated. This number is to be reported only by the railroad responsible for the equipment consist involved. If there were multiple consists involved in the accident, the total number of people evacuated is to be shown on the report for the consist most directly responsible for the evacuation. Precautionary evacuations and instances where it was later established that a release of hazardous mate rial did not occur are to be reported. 12. Subdivision Enter the full name of the subdivision on which the accident occurred, i.e. the Track owner's subdivision name. If the ra ilroad is not so divided, enter the word \"System.\" In the event of a joint accident involving Amtrak, the host railroad's subdivision will apply.

County Enter the full name of the county or pa rish in which the accident occurred. 17. Temperature Enter the temperature (Fahrenheit) at the acci dent site at the time of the accident. If the temperature was below zero, preface the temperature number with a minus (-) symbol. 18. Visibility Select the most appropriate entry, and place in the code box. Make sure this entry does not contradict the time given in Item 6. For example, if the time of the accident was 1:30 p.m., it would be incorrect to code the visibility as \"Dawn.\" 19. Weather Select the most appropriate weather c ondition at the time and location of the accident, and enter the code in the box provided. 20. Type of Track The host railroad (railroad respons ible for track maintenance) will determine/provide the type of track. A ny other railroad should consult with the host railroad when completing this block. Se lect the code that identifies the type of track on which the accident occurred, a nd enter it in the box provided. Branch lines should be reported as mainline, code \"1.\" 21. Track Name/Number Enter the name or number used to identify the track on which the accident occurred. If it is a main track of a singl e-track line, enter \"s ingle main track.\" 22. FRA Track Class Enter the class of track on which the reported consist was located at the time of the accident. Classes of track are define d in the Federal Track Safety Standards (49 CFR Part 213).

Type of Equipment Consist Select the code that best identifies th e consist for which this report is being prepared, and enter in the box provided. Be su re that this entry is consistent with the values given in Items 34 and 35. For example: the codes \"1,\" \"2,\" \"3,\" \"7,\" \"8,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" are used for consists that contain a locomotive unit. Therefore, line 1 of Item 34 must show at least one locomotive in a box. If the code for a freight train is used , then line 1 of Item 35 must show loaded and/or empty frei ght cars. If the c onsist is a single car or cut of cars, there cannot be locomotives shown in Item 34 and there must be a car count shown in Item 35. Many such co mparisons exist; be sure to check the interrelationship of information contained in all items related to the equipment consist. The codes for \"Type of Equipment Consist\" are as follows: 1. Freight train 2. Passenger train - Pulling 3. Commuter train - Pulling 4. Work train FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 121 F 6180.54 5. Single car 6. Cut of cars 7. Yard/switching 8. Light loco(s) 9. Maint./Inspect. Car A. Spec. MoW Equip B. Passenger train - Pushing C. Commuter train - Pushing D. EMU E. DMU 26. Was Equipment Attended? If the equipment consist was attended by an employee, enter \"1\"; otherwise, enter \"2.\" 27. Train Number/Symbol If the equipment consist can be identified by means of a train number, enter that train number. Otherwise, enter the numb er of the locomotive unit from which the engineer was controlling the consist. If the consist for which this report is being prepared did not contain a locomotive, enter \"N/A.\" 28. Speed List the speed (mph) at which the consist was traveling at the time of its involvement in the accident. Enter \"E\" in the code box to in dicate if this is estimated; or enter \"R\" for a recorded spee d. If this consist was stopped, enter a speed of \"0.\" 29. Trailing Tons If the equipment consist reported on this fo rm is a freight train, work train, etc., enter the gross tonnage, excl uding locomotives, of the tr ain. Enter \"N/A\" if the consist was a passenger train (pulling/pus hing), commuter train (pulling/pushing), light locomotive(s), car(s), EMU, DMU, or a locomotive handling cars in switching operations. 30. Type of Territory The host railroad (railroad respons ible for track maintenance) will determine/provide the type of territory. Any other ra ilroad should consult with the host railroad when completing this bl ock. Identify the method(s) of railroad operation at the accident location by entering the appropriate code(s) in the boxes. The back of the form may be used if necessary. The specific instructions for completing this block are dependent on Block 20 (Type of Track). There are up to five codes available to be used. Refer to Appendix J for specific instructions. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 122 F 6180.54 30a. Remotely Controlled Locomotive? If this consist is NOT a part of a remo te controlled operation or is NOT being controlled by a remote control locomotive (RCL), enter code \"0.\" For accidents involving consists controlled by RCL, ente r one of the following three available codes that best describes the type of remotely controlled operation involved: 1 - Remote control portable transmitter 2 - Remote control tower operation 3 - Remote control portable transmitter - more than one remote control transmitter. The use of codes \"1,\" \"2,\" or \"3\" is not dependent upon whether the RCL operation caused or contributed to the acci dent, only that the RCL was in use. Further explanation can be provided in the narrative. There are special instructions for Bl ocks 40-45 for coding if the consist was under RCL operations. 31. Principal Car/Unit 31a. Initial and Number In the upper box (\"First Invol ved\"), list the initial and number of the first locomotive or car in the consist being reported. If the consist was moving at the time of the accident, and the accident was caused by a mechanical or an electrical failure on this consist (cause codes beginning with \"E\"), enter the initial and numbe r of the car or lo comotive having the defective equipment in the lower box (\"Caus ing\"). If a mechanical or electrical failure on a locomotive or car in this consist did not cause the accident, enter \"N/A.\" The same entry will frequently appear in both upper and lower boxes, since the locomotive or car with the mechanical or el ectrical failure will also be the first involved. If the locomotive or car that caused the accident was contained in a different consist than the one described in this report, do not identify it on the report for this consist. A reference to the unit causing the accident may be made in the narrative porti on of the report. 31b. Position in Train In the upper box, enter the posit ion within the consist of the locomotive unit or car identified in the upper box of Item 31a. When the consist contains a locomotive, count from and include the first locomotiv e unit. If the consist was a moving cut of cars, count from the leading end of th e consist. If the consist was a single locomotive or moving car, enter \"1.\" If the consist was a standing car or a FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 123 F 6180.54 standing cut of cars, enter \"N/A.\" If a locomotive unit or car is identified in the lower box of Item 31a, enter its position in the lower box. Use th e procedure described above. Note: When entering the position of the car or locomotive in either box, be sure that this value does not exceed the total length of the consist. This is determined by adding the total number of locomotives in line 1 of Item 34 to the total number of cars shown in line 1 of Item 35. 31c. Loaded When the entry in the upper box of Item 31a identifies a car, i ndicate if this car was loaded or unloaded by entering \"Yes\" or \"No\" in the upper box. If a car is not identified in Item 31a, enter \"N/A.\" If a car is identified in the lower box of Item 31a, indica te if this car was loaded or unloaded by entering \"Yes\" or \"No\" in th e lower box. Otherwise, enter \"N/A.\" 32. Railroad employees tested for drug/alcohol use. If any employee was tested for alcohol us age in connection with this accident, enter the number of positive tests in the first block. If any employee was tested for drug usage in connection with this acci dent, enter the number of positive tests in the second block. If testing was perf ormed and the results were negative, enter \"0.\" If there were positive tests, but impairment is not reported as a cause of the accident, then provide a brief explan ation in the narrative of the basis for this determination. You are required to identify all accidents/incidents where either Federal- or employer-author ized tests were performed. Note: The same drug and alcohol code should be reported on all corresponding Form FRA 6180.54's and Form FRA 6180.55a's that are filed under the same accident/incident number. 49 CFR 225.18(a)(2) specifies that for any train accident with in the requirement for post-accident testing under \u00a7 219.201, the railroad shall append to the Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Repo rt any report required by \u00a7 219.209(b) (pertaining to failure to obtain samples for post-accident toxicological testing). 33. Was this consist transporting passengers? Enter \"Y\" (for \"yes\") if the consist be ing reported on was transporting passengers; otherwise enter \"N \" (for \"no\"). FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 124 F 6180.54 34. Locomotive Units [Number of] (Exclude EMU, DMU, and Cab Car Locomotives) On line 1 (\"Total in Train\"), enter in the appropriate box( es) the number of locomotive units in this consist. If there were no locomotives in this consist, enter \"0\" in each of the boxes. Refer to the definition for \"Locomotives\" in Chapter 2 (Definitions). For the locomotives shown in line 1, list on line 2 (\"Total Derailed\") the number of these that were derailed in the accid ent. Include locomotives that derailed following a collision, explosion-detonati on, etc., as well as those accidents identified as derailments in Item 7. 35. Cars [Number of] (Include EMU, DMU, and Cab Car Locomotives) On line 1 (\"Total in Equipment Consist\"), enter in the appropriate box(es) the number of cars contained in the consist. A passenger car is cons idered loaded if it contains one or more passengers. Enter \"0\" in all boxes if the consist did not contain cars. (Refer to the definition for \"EMU, DMU, and Cab Car Locomotives in Chapter 2 (Definitions). For the cars shown in line 1, list on lin e 2 (\"Total Derailed\") the number of these that were derail ed in the accident. Special Instruction: When the consist contains articulated cars, the count for these is to be the number of platforms/units in such a car. This is necessary in order to maintain comparability of train lengths. The narrative is to contain a reference that articulated cars were included in the consist. 36. Equipment Damage This Consist Enter the amount of reportable damage sustained by the equipment consist for which this report is being prepared. If this consist did not have reportable damage, enter \"0.\" When multiple forms are being used, do not show the damage to this consist on other reports. When estimating damage costs, the labor costs to be reported are only the direct labor costs to the railroad, e.g., hourly wages, transportation costs, and hotel expenses. The cost of fringe benefits is excluded when calculating direct labor costs. Overhead is also excluded when calculating damage costs due to the unacceptable, non-uniform treatment of ove rhead under the current process. If the railroad chooses to have employees work overtime, then the overtime direct labor charges must be used. For services performed by a contractor, a direct hourly labor cost is calculated by multiplying the contractor's total labor hours charged to the railroad by the applicable direct hourly wage rate for a railroad worker in that particular craft. However, if a railroad cannot match the equivalent craft to the labor hours spent by a contractor, then the railroad must us e the loaded rate, i.e., the cost by hour FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 125 F 6180.54 for labor, fringe benefits, and other cost s and fees for serv ices charged by the contractor for the tasks associated with the repair of the track, equipment, and structures due to the train accident. The current method used to calculate ma terial costs, i.e., depreciated value estimates, will continue to be used by all railroads. See Chapter 2, Definitions, Costs and Reportable Damage , for methodology of calculations. If a railroad chooses to use parts from older equipment to repair a damaged car from an accident, then fair market value for the old part should be used and documented as to fair market value ( documentation should be publicly available source for refurbished equipment). FRA is concerned that the railroad pay special attention to using refurbished pa rts that might affect safety. 37. Track, Signal, Way & Structure Damage The railroad responsible for maintaining the track on which the accident/incident occurred will enter the cost of dama ges to the track, signals, roadbed, track structures, etc. (A report must be prov ided even when the track damage is zero (0).) Other railroads will enter \"N/A.\" If the railroad res ponsible for the track maintenance is filing reports for multiple consists involved in the accident, only one of these reports will contai n the total damage incurred. If a railroad uses rail salvaged from an abandoned track or track no longer in use, then the cost of the rail and ties salvaged are zero; however, the direct labor costs for savaging the rail and tie s, building the panels, and replacing the rail (including subsequent welding costs if continuous welded rail (CWR) must be used in calculating the costs of the accident. 38. Primary Cause Code Proper entry of the correct primary cause code is of criti cal importance, not only for the accident being reported, but also for FRA's analyses conducted for accident prevention purposes. Because of the extensive use made of primary cause code entries, careful attention mu st be given to making correct entry for all accidents. From the cause descriptions found in Appe ndix C, enter the cause code that best describes the primary cause of the accident . All reports by a single railroad for a single accident must use the same cause code. When multiple railroads are reporting the same accident, they should attempt to resolve any differences concerning the cause prior to reporting. When this cannot be accomplished, each railroad will identify what it considers to be the primary cause of the accident. If none of the more specific available cause codes are appropriate, you may enter Cause Code M599 , \"Other Miscellaneous Causes ,\" and fully describe the circumstances in the narrative. By its very nature, M599 is a vague cause code that is intended to allow for a cause code entry for accidents that involve FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 126 F 6180.54 extremely unusual circumstances, and t hus are not described elsewhere in Appendix C. Railroads should avoid unnece ssary usage of this vague cause code as it detracts from FRA's ability to acco mplish proper train accident cause trend analysis for accident prevention purposes. Often, the use of Cause Code M599 can be avoided by using both the primary and contributing cause fields to enter the most appropriate specific available cause codes. (Example: For an accident caused by a worn flange (E64C) and a wo rn switch point (T31 4), rather than using M599, the railroad should make a determination as to which was the primary cause and which was the contributing cause, and make entry of these specific cause codes.) If the cause of the accident is still under active investig ation by the railroad when the report is due, you may enter M505 . Active investigation by the railroad means that the railroad's investigation of the accide nt is still ongoing, and the cause has not been fully determined. An example of an accident still under active investigation by the railro ad would be that the ra ilroad is still awaiting metallurgical results for a suspected broke n rail. Often, FRA and/or the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) may also be performing their own independent investigations of this same accident, and their final reports may not be published for a considerable time period after the accident. The railroad must not wait for either the FRA or the NTSB to publish their findings and their assessment as to cause(s) of the accident to amend Cause Code M505. Once the railroad has completed its active inve stigation and determined the probable cause(s), the best available appropriate cause code(s) must be provided to FRA on an amended report for the accident pursua nt to 225.13. The fact that NTSB or any other governmental agency has not re leased their findings as to probable cause is not a valid reason for railroad s to allow cause code M505 to remain assigned to an accident. Cause Code M507 is used to denote accidents/incidents in which the investigation is complete but the cause of the accident/i ncident could not be determined. If a railroad uses this code, the railroad is re quired to include in th e narrative block an explanation for why the cause of the accident/incident could not be determined. Suicide and attempted suicide. Place the following miscellaneous cause codes, as applicable, in Block 38: (i) Code M309 \"Suicide (H ighway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident)\"; Code M310 (Highway-Rail (iii) (Other .)\"; and (iv) Code M510 \"Attempted Suicide (Other Misc.)\". These codes can be found in Appendix C, \"Train Accident Cause Codes,\" to this Guide. When entering th e code for suicide and attempted suicide (M309, M310, M509, M510), as determined by a coroner or public authority, such as a public police offi cer, if there is also alcohol or other drug involvement, then enter, as the primary cause code, either M309, M310, M509, or M510, as applicable; and also indicate other appli cable codes in the contributing code box. For example, if causes of a highway-r ail grade crossing accident are both FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 127 F 6180.54 attempted suicide and drug or alcohol im pairment, enter \"M310\" for the primary cause code, and enter \"M301\" for the contributing cause. If an accident is caused by a bond wire attachment issue (See Appendix C, Train Accident Cause Codes), information on the methods and locations of these attachment(s) are to be provided in the narrative (Block 52). There is a 5-year limit on the railroads to send in an amended report to change a cause code. See Chapter 1 of this Guid e. Once FRA or NTSB has published its findings on an accident, the railroad ma y choose to send in another amended report to reflect the primary cause code as determined by FRA or NTSB. The railroad is not bound by the findings of either FRA or NTSB, as long as the railroad has made a \"good faith\" dete rmination that the results of their investigation and analysis are accurate. 39. Contributing Cause Code If there were one or more contributing causes, enter the code for the foremost contributing cause. Otherwise, enter \"N/A.\" An accident is frequently the culmination of a sequence of related ev ents, and a variety of conditions or circumstances may contribute to its occurren ce. A complete record of all of these would be beneficial in acci dent prevention analysis. Ho wever, it is not practical, even if it were possible, to develop fo rms and codes that would capture every detail that may be associated with the causes and resulting consequences of each accident. Therefore, the most appropriat e combination of available codes that best identifies the likely primary and any contributing cause, and other factors, is to be used. Railroads are encouraged to use the contributing cause code. When the events cannot be adequately descri bed using the primary and contributing cause, the railroad must use the narrative block to complete the causes of the accident. 40-43. Number of Crewmembers Enter in the appropriate boxes the total number of crewmembers on the consist for which this report is being filed. If the item does not apply, enter \"N/A.\" The operator of on-track maintenance machines is to be included in the \"Engineer\" count. A switch foreman is to be includ ed in the \"Conductor\" count. Switch helpers are to be include d in the \"Brakeman\" count. Utility employees who were attached to th e crew at the time of the accident are to be included in the count for the most appropriate type of crewmember (normally brakeman.) FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 128 F 6180.54 If, through contractual agreements, a rail road has eliminated the job title of conductor, and those respons ibilities previously disc harged by a conductor are being fulfilled by another job title on the cons ist, then an entry is to be included in the \"Conductor\" count. If Block 30a, \"Remote Control Locomotives ,\" has a code of 1 or 2, and the consist was under RCL operations, then record the RCL operator in the \"Engineer/Operator\" count, regardless of the operator's craft. If Block 30a, \"Remote Control Locomotives,\" has a c ode of 3, and the consist was under RCL operations, then record all of the RCL ope rators in the \"Engin eer/Operator\" count, regardless of the operator's craft. 44-45. Length of Time on Duty Show the length of time that the engineer/operator and c onductor in charge of the equipment consist had been on duty at the time the accident/incident occurred. If Block 30a, \"Remote Control Locomotives,\" has a code of 1 or 2 and the consist was under RCL operations, then record th e RCL operator's length time on duty in the \"Engineer/Operator\" block, rega rdless of the operator's craft. If Block 30a, \"Remote Control Locomotives ,\" has a code of 3, \"Remote control portable transmitter - more than one remote control transmitter,\" and the consist was under RCL operations, then record all of the RCL operators in the \"Engineer\" and \"Conductor\" fields, regardless of the opera tors' craft. If there are more than two RCL operators, then choose the two ope rators that have the longer tour of duty to record in the \"Engin eer\" and \"Conductor\" blocks. 46-48. Casualties Enter the total number of reportable casualtie s (fatalities and nonfatalities) on this consist. If none, enter \"0.\" Enter the total number of persons who sustained reportable injuries while on board, or as a result of striking, being struck by, or who are otherwise hurt in connection with the operation of this consist. This would include injuries to individuals who jumped from the consist prior to the accident. Do not report employees of another railroad. Include reportable casualties that result fr om suicides and attempted suicides, as determined by a coroner, public police offi cer or other public authority, in Boxes 46-48, as applicable. (Prior the effective date of this guide, suicides were not included in Items 46-48). Note: All nonfatal casualties, including those being reported as occupational illnesses, in the case of hazardous materi al releases, are to be included. Each casualty reported on this form , regardless of whether fatal or FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 129 F 6180.54 nonfatal, must be reported indivi dually on Form FRA F 6180.55a using the same accident/incident report number in Item 1b. Enter the number of fatal and nonfatal casualties to the railroad's employees, train passengers, and others. 49. Special Study Block A \"Special Study Block\" (SSB) is for collection of information on specific accident issues over a specified time peri od in response to particular hazards or associated railroad risks that are of safe ty concern. FRA will notify the railroads, in writing or, if appropriate, through public ation in the Federal Register, of the purpose and the type of informa tion that is to be collected SSB for Item 49 will be broken down in to SSB A (49a) and SSB B (49b). 49a. Special Study Block A Use this block to indicate what type of track an accident/incident occurred on by using the codes \"CWR\" for continuous we lded rail track, or \"OTH\" for other. Item 49a cannot be blank. 49b. Special Study Block B Special Study Block B will be used to collect information on specific accident issues as explained above, and if appr opriate, through publica tion in the Federal Register. Please refer to http://safetydata.fra .dot.gov/OfficeofSafety and click on \"Click Here for Changes in Accident/Incid ent Recordkeeping and Reporting\" for updated information. 50-51. Latitude and Longitude Blocks 50 and 51 are for recording the la titude and longitude of the location where the accident occurred. These two blocks are mandatory. This requirement may be satisfied by either using GPS equipment to determine the actual longitude and latitude or by usi ng Internet technology to determine an estimated longitude and latitude. FRA is using the World Geodetic System (WGS) 84 standard for recording the event's latitude and longitude. It is re quested that the information follow the WGS 84 standard. Although FRA would prefer decimal degr ees (on hardcopy only, please follow value with \u00b0 to specify decimal degree s), FRA will accept latitude and longitude in degrees, minutes, and seconds (with \u00b0, ', \" to indicate units used are degrees, minutes, seconds) if submitted on hardcopy (electronic submissions should be in decimal degrees). The latitude should use the following format +xx.xxxxxx. The longitude should FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 130 F 6180.54 use the following format -xxx.xxxxxx in decimal degrees. Use an explicit plus or minus sign and an explicit decimal point followed by six decimal places for both latitude and longitude. Latitude, in decimal degrees: explicit decimal, explicit +/- (WGS 84) (e.g., +35.301486) Longitude, explicit decimal, explic it +/- (WGS 84) (e.g., -085.280201) 52. Narrative Description A detailed narrative is basic to FRA's unde rstanding of the fact ors leading to, and the consequences arising from, an accident. While many minor accidents can be described in a few brief comments, others are more complicated and require further clarification. An adequate description of most accident s cannot be made in the limited space available in Block 52. The narrative can be continued on a separate sheet of paper attached to the report. Because of the variety of fact ors associated with accidents, it is not possible to give a comprehensive list of items you should include in your discussion. However, the following are to be covered when appropriate: Drug/alcohol involvement . Include a discussi on of any drug/alcohol use connected with this accident. If positive tests were made, but usage/impairment was not determined to be a causal factor, explain the basis of this determination. Cause . Discuss any events or circ umstances occurring prior to the accident that has relevance to the accident. Provide additional information concerning the reasons for the accident when the causes found in Appendix C do not sufficien tly explain why the accident occurred. Diesel Fuel Tank . Identify any leakage of locomotive diesel fuel resulting from the accident. Identify the unit(s) by initial and number, the manufacturer and model designation, the capacity of the fuel tank, the quantity of fuel released, and any consequence of the release. (Was there a fire, environmental consequences, etc.?) Hazardous Materials . Identify the initial and number of any car releasing hazardous materials. List the name and indicate the quantity of hazardous material re leased. Report the number of fatalities and injuries resulting from a direct exposure to the released substance. If there was an evacuation, estimate the size of the affected area and the le ngth of the evacuation. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 131 F 6180.54 Train Information . Identify any special characteristics of the consist being reported, e.g., unit coal train; comprising articulated cars. Unusual Types of Territory . Include any unusual types of territory that could not be described in Block 30. Other Railroads . Describe how and to what extent the on-track equipment of other railroads became involved in the accident. Bond Wire Attachment(s) : If an accident is cau sed by a bond wire attachment issue, provide information on the methods and locations of these attachment(s). Do not record in the narrative personal identifiers, e.g., names, Social Security numbers, payroll identifications. 53. Typed/Printed Name and Title of Preparer Type or print the name and title of the person responsible for preparing this report form. 54. Signature Signature of the person shown in Item 53. Note: If Form FRA F 6180.54 is to be submitted electronically, signature (Item 54) and date of signatur e (Item 55) are not required. 55. Date Date the signature was made in Item 54 (i.e., the date the form was initially completed). 7.4 Questions and Answers on Rail Equipment Accident Reporting Q1. Another railroad derailed some cars on our track. The damage to our track did not exceed the threshold; however, their cars had extensive damage and the cost to repair/repla ce these exceeded the thres hold. Do we need to complete a report for our railroad since we did not have significant damage to the track? A1. Yes. The criterion for reporting is whethe r or not the total reportable damages for all railroads having on-track equipment, track, signals, etc. involved in the accident exceeded the threshold. You i ndicated that the equipment damage by itself exceeded this amount; therefore, you must complete a report, but limit the damage you record to the amount required to repair/replace your damaged track. FRA uses the information received from all railroads to obtain a clearer picture of what caused the accidents and what the consequences were. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 132 F 6180.54 Q2. A passenger train was en route between stations. A component failure and the resulting electrical arching between the third rail and a collector plate caused a traction motor to burn out. The train came to a stop as smoke and fumes entered the passenger compartment. The passengers were evacuated; however, there were no rep orts of injury. The repair and replacement of damaged components will exceed the threshold. Is this a reportable train accident? A2. Yes. The regulation requires that an y event involving the operation of on-track equipment and resulting in damage above the reporting threshold is to be reported. However, a component failur e is not reportable when the physical damage is confined to the component a nd there are no other consequences of a reportable nature. Take, for example, the following scenario: a traction motor problem is detected by the engineer. Sh e is able to cut out that motor and proceeds to the next terminal where th e unit is removed fr om service and the traction motor replaced at a cost exceeding the threshold. Crankcase explosions, turbo charger failu res, and incidents involving catenaries must meet this same general criterion to be reportable. For example, a crankcase explosion extensively damages the block, crankshaft, and oil pan. A subsequent fire causes additional damage to other components in the engine compartment. The train is unable to proceed, and crew members suffer from smoke inhalation. An event such as this, or a turbo char ger explosion with similar consequences, will generally be reportable. Q3. Sometimes damage to equipment is discovered during an inspection, but it cannot be determined how the damage occurred, or it may simply be the result of routine wear and tear. If th e cost of repairing or replacing the component(s) exceeds the threshold, do we need to make a report? A3. No. The equipment in this example was not in operation when the damage was detected. In addition, it is unlikely that a factual report could be prepared that would adequately describe how the damage occurred. Such a report, missing vital information, would be of little use in accident analysis. Q4. A shipment of cars was dropped o ff and secured at an industry siding. Employees of the industry were attempting to move one of the cars when it got away from them, struck a derail, rolled over on its side, and sustained substantial damage. The industry's rail road operations are confined to its own installation, which is completely off general system. The car did not leave the industry's property or foul th e track maintained by my railroad. Do we need to report this event? A4. No. The event described was not caus ed by, nor did it involve, the operation of your railroad. The industry does not have to report the event to FRA because the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 133 F 6180.54 industry is considered a plant railroad that operates entirely off the general system. Part 225 does not apply to plant railroads that operate entirely off the general system. See \u00a7 225.3. Q5. A unit coal train was returning with 115 empties when it was delayed due to a heavy downpour that stopped all rail operations. The crew was removed from the train because of the extrem e weather conditions. Heavy flooding from the rain washed out a portion of the main track that the train was occupying. The next morning, 28 cars w ere on their sides. The preliminary estimate of equipment damage alon e is over $100,000. Is this a reportable train accident? A5. Yes. The regulation requires that any event, including acts of God, involving the operation of on-track equipment (standing or moving), and causing damage above the threshold for train accidents. must be reported. Q6. Our switch crew was switching an indus try when the wind blew the industry gate into the side of a car being shove d. The industry gate was destroyed. Would this be considered as a trac k structure? Please elaborate more specifically concerning which structures would or would not be included in railroad track damage. A6. The damages to an industry-owned gate would not be considered as railroad track damage. Additionally, if an accide nt resulted in damages to the door of a roundhouse, diesel shop, or repair s hop, none of these would be considered as track structures, and thus would not be considered as track damage. Should a train strike and damage a plat form used for loading and unloading passengers, this type of structure is not an integral part of the track structure, and also would not be considered as track damage. On the other hand, should a derailment re sult in damages to a signal bungalow located adjacent to a track, this would be considered as track damage, as it is an adjunct to the track. For this same re ason, damage to tunnels, bridges, snow sheds, or other track-related structures would be considered as track damage. Q7. Do costs for re-railing equipment contribute to the total costs of the rail- equipment accident? A7. This cost is part of the \"cost of clearing wrecks,\" which is generally excluded from the calculation of \"reportable damage .\" Chapter 2, page 20 of this Guide explains reportable damage. Q8. A rail-equipment derailment occurred on railroad property in July. Only one car was damaged, with less than $50 of track damage. The railroad made a good faith estimate that the damage to the car was $4,000. FRA Form F 6180.97 was completed. The damaged railroad car was taken to a FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 134 F 6180.54 repair facility, but no repairs were made until 14 months later. During the repair, other damage related to the derailment was discovered, and now the event is reportable. Should the railr oad file the late rep ort? What other considerations should be made? Does the requirement fo r completing and mailing FRA Forms F6180.81 and F6180.78 for cases involving a human factor cause still apply? A8. The derailment should be reported to the FRA regardless of when the determination was made using the FRA Form F6180.54, \"Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report.\" In the case of rail equipment accidents/incidents, the determination of whether the combined railroad equipment and track damage costs exceed the current threshold limit can be determined relatively promptly, and in most cases, sufficiently accurate . Typically, this is accomplished by estimates provided by qualified mechanical and track department supervisors on the individual railroads. However, FRA does recognize that in some cases, the actual costs to repair a damaged piece of railroad equipment may greatly exceed the estimated cost, and this may elevate a previously non-reportable rail equipment accident over the threshold and become reportable at a later da te. This is most likely to occur when a privately owned freight car is damaged and is sent back to the owner for repairs. In these cases, a report must still be prep ared by the railroad company regardless of the time between date of the accident/incident, and th e date when knowledge is received rendering the accident/incident reportable. A letter of explanation as to why the report is filed late must be submitted. There are no provisions in the FRA Guide th at would allow a railroad to dispense with the requirement for completing and mailing FRA Forms F6180.81 to FRA, and Part I of FRA Form F6180.78 to th e appropriate employee(s) for cases involving a human factor cause that are late reporte d. The regulation and FRA Guide are clear with respect to the necessi ty that these forms be completed for all cases involving a human fact or primary and/or contribu ting cause code. The fact that a rail equipment accident/incident is reported late does not in any way relieve the railroad from complia nce with these provisions. Even if you should find, through mistake or otherwise, a reportable rail equipment accident/incident occurred 2 or even 3 years ago, and had not been previously re ported, a late report is required by FRA. If that accident/i ncident involved a human factor primary and/or contributing cause code, then the completion of FRA Forms F6180.81 and F6180.78 would also still be required. Although the employee(s) involved may question the delay involved, the named em ployee(s) still will have the opportunity to offer any statement(s) concerning the vali dity of the railroad's report. This is the intent of the regulation; that is, that the employee's statement is made a part of the accident reporting process. Q9. Our railroad had some historical equipment damaged, which cannot be repaired or replaced in-kind. The e quipment is worth substantially more FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 135 F 6180.54 than the depreciated value. What should be used for the estimated equipment costs? A9. Antique value of passenger rail cars is ve ry difficult to estimate. Railroads should attempt to discern a fair market price fo r the equipment that cannot be replaced. Q10. If a system car is destroyed and the car is under 30 years of age, what method should be used to report damage s: 1) the straight depreciated value of the car, or 2) the depreciated value, minus the scrap value, plus the dismantling costs? A10. Only Item (1) can be used. Chap ter 2 shows a straight-line method for depreciating destroyed equipment. Even with equipment that is 30 years old, there is a 10 percent value that would include the scrap value. Q11. Our crew was shoving 29 cars into a yard track, and a member of the crew was on the ground for the purpose of protecting the shove. The crewmember failed to note that a switch was improperly lined. The lead car entered the adjacent track, striking a standing car, derailing it and the lead car of the shoving movement. What would be the proper method of cause assignment for this type of accident? A11. There are detailed instructions found in Chapter 7 for completing Item 38, \"Primary Cause Code,\" and Item 39, \"C ontributing Cause Code ,\" on FRA Form F 6180.54, Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Re port. These instructions are also applicable to entries into Item 28, \"P rimary Cause,\" and Item 29, \"Contributing Cause,\" on FRA Form F 6180.97, Initial Ra il Equipment Accident/Incident Report. Because the reporting of the pr oper cause codes is very important to accident analysis, the basic philosophy is that the best available cause code(s) must be used to describe the cause(s) of an accident. In your case, it would app ear that there are two ca use codes that should be recorded. First, it would appear that the primary cause should be entered as H306, \"Shoving movement, absence of man on or at leading end of movement,\" or H307, \"Shoving movement, man on or at leading end of movement, failure to control,\" whichever is most applicable. Additionally, as a contributing cause, it would appear that Cause Code H702, \"Switch improperly lined,\" would be applicable to this accident. As you descri be this accident, it would appear that an accident would not have occurred had th e leading end of the movement been properly protected by the employee, and this would be the primary cause of the accident. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 136 F 6180.54 7.5 Common Reporting Errors Duplication of Information. A railroad whose involvement in an accident is limited to track maintenance responsibility should mark all items re lating to the equipment consist \"N/A.\" These items are numbers 8, 9, 10, 11, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, and 47. This information will be reported by the railroad responsible for the individual consist(s). A railroad that did not have track invo lved in the accident must not list the damage to the track. Do not send in reports concerning a consis t for which another railroad has reporting responsibility. Missing or Incomplete Reports. Do not leave blank items on the form. If the value is unknown, an estimate should be used. If the item does not apply, \"N/A\" should be en tered. If the correct response is \"none,\" a \"0\" should be inserted in the item. An accident report must be made by all railroads involved, regardless of the extent of damage sustained by individual railroads. When filing multiple reports for a single accid ent/incident, be sure to verify that the information contained on the various reports does not contradict itsel f. Of particular importance are such items as: Item Contents 5 Date of Accident/Incident 6 Time of Accident/Incident 7 Type of Accident/Incident 15 State Abbr. [where the accident occurred] 16 County [where th e accident occurred] 38 Primary Cause Code If a Form FRA F 6180.55a or Form FRA F 6180.57 is also required for the accident, be sure to compare similar items between these additional forms. If there were reportable casualties resulting fr om the accident, a line entry must be made on Form FRA F 6180.55a for each casualty. In highwa y-rail grade crossing accidents, the railroad responsible for the equipment consist that struck or was struck by the highway user must file a Form FRA F 6180.57. Avoid contradictions on a single form by comparing related items. For example, it would be incorrect for a report to show more locomotives or cars derailed in a consist than were actually contained in that consist, as shown in Items 34 and 35. Sim ilarly, if the report showed no conductors in Item 42, it would be inconsistent to show the conductor's time on duty in Item 45. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 137 F 6180.81 8. Form FRA F 6180.81 - Employee Human Factor Attachment 8.1 Requirement If, in reporting a rail equipment accident/incid ent on Form FRA F 6180.54, a railroad cites an employee human factor as the primary cause or a contributing cause of the accident; then the railroad that cited such employee human fact or must complete the Form FRA F 6180.81, which is titled \"Employee Human Factor Attachment.\" The Employee Human Factor Attachment is to be attached to the Rail Equipment Accident/Inciden t Report to which it pertains. For purposes of completing this form, \"employee\" is defined as a Worker on Duty -Railroad Employee (Class A), Railroad Employee not on Duty (Class B), Worker on Duty -Contractor (Class F), and Worker on Duty -Volunteer (Class H). See \u00a7\u00a7 225.5, 225.12. This form is only used in connection with a reportable rail equipment accident/incident where the Form FRA F 6180.54 submitted to FRA identifies an employee human factor as either the primary or contributing cause of the accident. 8.2 General Instructions and Interpretations Each employee identified on Form FRA F 6180.81 must be notified according to the instructions found in the sect ion for preparing Form FRA F 6180.78 and on the back of that form. If a reporting railroad makes allegations concerning the empl oyee of another railroad, the employing railroad must promptly provide the na me, job title, address, and medical status of any employee reasonably identified by th e alleging railroad, if requested. If a railroad is initially unable to identify a particular railroad employee responsible for causing the accident, but subsequently makes such iden tification, the railroad shall prepare a revised Form FRA F 6180.81 and forward it to FRA. In addition, a notifica tion (Form FRA F 6180.78) must be sent to the identified employee within 15 days of the date the revised Employee Human Factor Attachment was prepared. A railroad has reasonable disc retion to defer notification of implicated employees on medical grounds. If an implicated employee has died as a resu lt of the accident, a notice addressed to that employee must not be sent to any person. If an implicated employee has died of any cause by the time that the notice is ready to be sent, no notice addressed to that employee is required. If the reporting railroad has sche duled or is conducting a formal i nvestigation of a rail equipment accident/incident to determine whether it was caused by an employee human factor. and if the investigation has not concluded prior to the filin g of the regular monthly report, the railroad must, nonetheless, attach a Form FRA F 6180.81 to the Form FRA F 6180.54 to which it pertains. The following instructions apply in these situations: FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 138 F 6180.81 1. In the \" Description\" area of Fo rm FRA F 6180.81, you are to explain that employee(s) have not been named because the railroad is awai ting results of the formal investigation. Indicate whether th e formal investigation is currently in progress or the date that it is scheduled to begin. 2. After transmittal of such Form FRA F 6180.81, and when th e formal investigation has been concluded for that rail equipment accid ent, the reporting railroad must promptly provide a \"corrected copy\" of FRA Form F 6180.81 for each implicated employee. Implicated employees are to be notified in accordance with instructions found in Section 8.2 of this Chapter. The above provisions apply only when a formal i nvestigation is scheduled or in progress and where the naming of an employee(s) on FRA forms pr ior to a railroad's formal inquiry may give the appearance of \"pre-judging\" the guilt or innocen ce of the affected employ ee(s). If a railroad does not schedule a formal inquiry for a rail equipment accident/incident caused by an employee human factor, the standard provisions described in this chapter apply. 8.3 Submission Form FRA F 6180.81 is to be attached to Form FRA F 6180.54 (when applicable). Form FRA F 6180.81 may be submitted via optical media (CD-RO M) or electronically, via the Internet, but must also be submitted in .pdf or .jpg file format. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 139 F 6180.78 9. Form FRA F 6180.78 - Notice to Railroad Employee Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attri buted to Employee Human Factor: Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report 9.1 Requirement For each employee whose act, omission, or physical condition was alleged by the railroad as the employee human factor that was the primary cause or a contributing cause of a reportable rail equipment accident/incident (as reported on Form FRA F 6180.54) and whose name was listed in the Employee Human Factor Attachment (For m FRA F 6180.81) for the accident, and for each such railroad employee of whose identity the rail road has actual knowledge, the alleging railroad shall: 1. Complete Part I, \"Notice to Railro ad Employee,\" of Form FRA F 6180.78 with information regarding the accident, in accordance with the following instructions and those on the form; and 2. Hand-deliver or send by first- class mail (postage prepaid) the following to that employee within 45 days after the end of the month in which the ra il equipment accident/incident occurred: a. A copy of Form FRA F 6180.78, \"Notice to Railroad Employee Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee Human Factor: Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Re port,\" with Part I completed as to the applicable employee and accident. b. A copy of the railroad's Rail Equipmen t Accident/Incident Report and Employee Human Factor Attachment on the rail equipment accident/incident involved. c. If the accident was also reportable as a highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident, a copy of the railroad's Highway-Rail Gr ade Crossing Accident/Incident Report on that accident. See \u00a7 225.12. An \"employee human factor\" includ es any of the accident causes signified by the train accident cause codes listed under \"Train Operation-Human F actors\" in the current FRA Guide, except for those train accident cause codes pertaining to non-rail road workers. For purposes of Form FRA F 6180.78 and for purposes of the definition of \"e mployee human factor,\" \"employee\" includes the following classifications: 1. Worker on Duty-Railroad Employee 2. Railroad Employee Not on Duty 3. Worker on Duty-Contractor 4. Worker on Duty-Volunteer See \u00a7 225.5 for definition of employee human factor and \u00a7 225.12 for definition of employee and for substantive requirements. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 140 F 6180.78 This form is only used in connection with a reportable rail equipment accident/incident where the Form FRA F 6180.54 submitted to FRA identifies an employee human factor as either the primary or contributing cause of the accident. 9.1.1 Employee Action upon Receipt of Notification Employee statements supplementing railroad ac cident reports are vol untary, not mandatory . The nonsubmission of a supplement does not imply that the employee admits or endorses the railroad's conclusions as to cause or a ny other allegations. See \u00a7 225.12(g)(1). Although a supplement is completely optional and not requ ired, if an employee wishes to submit a supplement and ensure that, af ter receipt, it will be properly pl aced by FRA in a file with the railroad's Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report a nd that it will be require d to be reviewed by the railroad that issued the no tice, the supplement must be ma de on Part II of Form FRA F 6180.78 (titled \"Notice to Railroad Employee I nvolved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee Human Factor; Employ ee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report\"), following the instructi ons printed on the form. These in structions require that, within 35 days of the date that the notice was hand-deli vered or sent by first-class mail to the employee (except for good cause shown), the original of the supplement be filed with FRA and a copy be hand-delivered or sent by first-cl ass mail to the railroad that issu ed the notice. The railroad will have to reassess its conclusions as to the cause of the accident and other circumstances, and file corrected reports with FRA c oncerning the accident, when ap propriate. See \u00a7 225.12(g)(2). Information that the employee wishes to withhold fr om the railroad must not be included in this supplement. If an employee wishes to provide confidential informati on to FRA, the employee should not use the supplement form (Part II of Form FRA F 6180.78), but rather provide such confidential information by other means, such as a letter to the employee's collective bargaining representative, or to the Federa l Railroad Administration, Office of Safety Assurance and Compliance, RRS-11, 1200 New Je rsey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. The letter should include the name of the railro ad making the allegations, the date and place of the accident, and the rail equipment accide nt/incident number. See \u00a7 225.12(g)(3). If an employee chooses to submit a supplement to FRA, all of the employ ee's assertions in the supplement must be true and correct to the be st of the employee's knowledge and belief. See \u00a7 225.12(h). FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 141 F 6180.57 10. Forms FRA F 6180.57 - Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report & FRA F 6180.150 - Highway User Injury Inquiry Form 10.1 Requirement Any impact, regardless of severity, between railro ad on-track equipment and a highway user at a highway-rail grade crossing site, is to be reported on Form FR A F 6180.57. The term \"highway- rail grade crossing\" means: (1) a location wher e a public highway, road, or street, or a private roadway, including associated sidewa lks, crosses one or more railro ad tracks at grade; or (2) a location where a pathway explicitly authorized by a public authority or a railroad carrier that is dedicated for the use of non-vehicula r traffic, including pedestrians, bicyclists, and others, that is not associated with a public highway, road, or st reet, or a private roadway, crosses one or more railroad tracks at grade. The term \"sidewalk\" means that portion of a street between the curb line, or the lateral line of a roadway, and the adjacent property line or, on easements of private property, that portion of a street that is paved or improved and in tended for use by pedestrians. See \u00a7 225.5. The term \"highway user\" includes automobiles, buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, farm vehicles, pedestri ans, or any other mode of su rface transportation motorized and un-motorized. In addition, the te rm highway user encompasses users of pathways explicitly authorized by a public authority or a railroad carrier that is dedi cated for the use of non-vehicular traffic, and that is not associated with a public highway, road, or street, or a private roadway. All crossing locations within industry and rail yards, ports and dock areas are considered highway- rail crossings within the meaning of the term. 10.2 Additional Requirements Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report, Form FRA F 6180.54 . If a highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident results in reportable damage gr eater than the current reporting threshold used for Rail Equipment Accident/Incid ent reporting, the railroad must also submit to FRA a Form FRA F 6180.54, \"Rail Equipment Acci dent/Incident Report.\" The reporting threshold for calendar years 2002-2005 is $6,700. The reporting threshold for calendar year 2006 is $7,700. The reporting threshold for calendar year 2007 is $8,200. The reporting threshold for calendar year 2008 is $8,900; and, for accidents that occur in calendar year 2010, the reporting threshold is $9,200. In these situati ons, the type of accident is to be coded as \"Hwy-rail crossing\" in Block 7 of Form FRA F 6180.54. See \u00a7 225.19(c). Refer to http://safetydata.fra .dot.gov/OfficeofSafety and click on \"Click Here for Changes in Accident/Incident Recordkeeping an d Reporting\" for updated information. Railroad Injury and Illness (Con tinuation Sheet), Form FRA F 6180.55a . If a highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident results in a report able casualty, the railroad must also file a Form FRA F 6180.55a. See \u00a7 225.19 (d). A highway user who is involved in a highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident and is transpor ted from the scene of a highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident to a medical facility via ambulance or other form of medical conveyance is presumed to have sustained an FR A reportable injury. Absent evidence to rebut this presumption, the railroad must report the injury to FRA on Form FRA F 6180.55a, \"Railroad FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 142 F 6180.57 Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet) ,\" and show the injury on Block 46 on Form FRA F 6180.57. If the railroad late r discovers that the highway us er did not sustain a reportable injury, the railroad must notify FRA in accordance with the late report ing instructions. See \u00a7 225.13. Suicide . If the impact between the railroad on-trac k equipment and a highway user occurred because the highway user committed or attemp ted to commit suicide (as determined by a coroner, public police officer, or other public authority) the highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident must be re ported on Form FRA F 6180.57 and the death of or injury to, if reportable, that highway user must be reported to FRA on FRA Form F 6180.55a. See instructions for completing Blocks 41, 46, 49, and 52 under Section 10.4 below. Determination of Nature and Severity of a Highway-Rail Crossing Injuries : In order to fulfill its responsibilities in determining the nature and severity of a highway-ra il grade crossing injury and to accurately report such injury, a railroad must try to contact any potentially injured highway user involved in a highway-rail grade cr ossing accident/incident, or their representative, in writing and, if unsuccessful in obtaining the needed informa tion, by telephone. If a highway user died as a result of the highway-rail grad e crossing accident/incident, a railroad must not send this form to any person. In addition, the letter must be accompanied by a cover letter and prepaid/preaddressed envelope. See 10.7 below for complete inst ructions and Appendix N for a sample cover letter. 10.3 General Instructions and Interpretations Any impact (including an impact due to the commi ssion or attempted commission of a suicide, as determined by a coroner, public police officer , or other public author ity), regardless of severity, between railroad on-track equipment and any highway user of a highway-rail grade crossing, is to be reported on Form FRA F 6180.57. Highway users include, but are not limited to, automobiles, buses, trucks, motorcycles, bi cycles, recreational vehicles, farm vehicles, construction vehicles, roadway maintenance vehicles , pedestrians, and any other mode of surface transportation motorized or un-motorized. Location of Actual Impact. Incidents involving highway us ers who have unsuccessfully attempted to avoid striking or be ing struck by railroad on-track e quipment at a crossing site are to be reported, regardle ss of where the actual impact between the consist and the highway user occurred. U.S. DOT Grade Crossing Identification Numbers . A Form FRA F 6180.57 must be completed for collisions/impacts between on-track equipm ent and users of highw ay-rail grade crossing sites, including crossing locations within industries or rail yards, ports and dock areas. The grade crossing must be identified on Form FRA F 6180 .57 by its identification number, which is its U.S. DOT Grade Crossing Inve ntory Number. The U.S. DOT Grade Crossing Identification Number means and is referring to the U.S. DOT Grade Crossing Inventory Number. The U.S. DOT Grade Crossing Identification Nu mber recorded in block 4 of Form FRA F 6180.57 is a key element of this report and must be provided. If you are unable to obtain this FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 143 F 6180.57 number from your railroad track or signal departments, or thr ough the State Inventory Contact, then assistance may be obtained by contacting an FRA highway grade crossing manager at any of the regional offices found in Appendi x G, or by calling (202) 493-6299 (refer to http://safetydata.fra .dot.gov/OfficeofSafety and click on \"Click Here for Changes in Accident/Incident Recordkeep ing and Reporting\" for updated information). The same procedures are to be followed when an accident occu rs at a crossing that is not a part of the U.S. DOT Crossing Inventory. In the event of a highway-rail grade crossing accident at a ne w crossing without a U.S. DOT Grade Crossing Identification Number, a new nu mber must be obtaine d from FRA by calling (202) 493-6299 (refer to http://safetydata.fra .dot.gov/OfficeofSafety and click on \"Click Here for Changes in Accident/Incident Recordkeeping and Reporting\" for updated information). Involvement of Other Highway Use rs in the Accident/Incident. It is not necessary to complete additional FRA Form F 6180.57 reports for other highway users that become subsequently involved in an accident when they are on the sa me crossing approach. Report the first highway user involved in the accident. Briefly describe the accident and note any additional casualties or other vehicle damage in the narrative. A ne w Form FRA F 6180.57 report is required only if another highway user approaches the crossing from the opposite side and strikes or is struck by on-track equipment. Responsibilities of the Railroad Whose Invol vement is Limited to Track Maintenance. FRA Form F 6180.57 . A railroad whose involvement in a highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident is limited to track maintenance re sponsibilities is not to complete Form FRA F 6180.57. When the reporting railroad is different than the railroad maintaining the track, the railroad responsible for the track must be identif ied in Item 3a. Report number \"XXX\" is to be entered in Item 3b in these instances. FRA Form F 6180.54. If the accident/incident satisfies the reporting requirements for rail equipment accidents (e.g., reportable railroad damage exceeds threshold), Form FRA F 6180.54 must also be completed by all railroads involved, including the railroad with track maintenance responsibility. See \u00a7 225.23(c). Unique Identifier. Each accident/incident must have an identifying number that is unique for the report month. All forms used by a carrier to report a single event must use the same accident/incident number. Do not append addition al characters on different forms for the same accident/incident. For example, if a railroad has two casualties resulting from an accident, do not report one casualty using the reporting number 12345, and the number 12345-A for the second. The reporting number must be exac tly the same for both reports. If actual data is not available when the report is due, estimated values are to be used. If it is later determined that an estimated value was signifi cantly in error, a corr ected report must be forwarded. See \u00a7 225.13. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 144 F 6180.57 All items must be filled in; do not leave items blank. Enter \"N /A\" for those items that do not apply to an accident. If \"none\" is the proper re sponse for an item, for example, the number of cars in a consist, enter \"0,\" do not enter \"N/A.\" Closed Crossing. If a highway-rail grade crossing is closed (see Chapter 2, Definitions, for the definition of a closed crossing), then the impact would not be cl assified as a highway-rail grade crossing accident, and the Form FRA F 6180.57 must not be submitted or completed. However, if the monetary threshold was exceeded, the Ra il-Equipment Accident/Incident Report Form FRA F 6180.54 would be required. The \"Type of Accide nt\" is classified as an \"Obstruction\" if a vehicle travels on a road where the pavement has b een removed (the road is closed) and attempts to cross the tracks and is st ruck by on-track equipment. Barricaded Crossing or Tem porarily Closed Crossing. Any impact at a barricaded or temporarily closed crossing is still re portable per Form FRA F 6180.57 requirements. 10.4 Instructions for Completing Form FRA F 6180.57 Item Instruction 1. Name of Reporting Railroad Enter the full name of the reporting railroad. 1a. Alphabetic Code Enter the reporting railroad's code, f ound in Appendix A. (Railroads whose involvement in the accident/incident is lim ited to track maintenance responsibility are not to complete a Form FRA F 6180.57.) 1b. Railroad Accident/Incident [Number] Enter a unique identifying number for the accident/incident being reported. All reports connected with this accident/incid ent must use the same reporting number. The report number may contain up to 10 nu meric and/or alphabetic characters. 2. Name of Other Railroad or Other Entity Filing for Equipment Involved in Train Accident/Incident If an equipment consist operated by another railroad or other entity was involved in the accident, enter the fu ll name of that railroad. If more than one other railroad had a consist involved, list only one name. 2a. Alphabetic Code Enter the code of the railr oad identified in Item 2. 2b. Railroad Accident/Incident No . Enter the reporting number used by the railroad shown in Item 2 to identify this accident/incident. 3. Name of Railroad or Other Entity Responsible for Track Maintenance FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 145 F 6180.57 Enter the name of the railroad or other en tity responsible for maintaining the track on which the accident/incident occurred. 3a. Alphabetic Code Enter the code of the railr oad identified in Item 3. 3b. Railroad Accident/Incident No. Enter the reporting number used by the railroad shown in Item 3 to identify this accident/incident. If the railroad shown in Item 3 differs from the reporting railroad, and if the accid ent does not require that a Form FRA F 6180.54 be filed, then enter \"XXX\" as the accident/incident number. However, if the accident also requires that Form FRA F 6180.54 be comp leted, enter the number used on the rail equipment form by the railroad responsible for track maintenance. 4. U.S. DOT Grade Crossing Identification Number Enter the U.S. DOT National Highway-Rail Crossing Identification Number assigned to the crossing involved. The U.S. DOT Grade Crossing Identification Number means and is referring to th e U.S. DOT Grade Crossing Inventory Number. This field must contain this number before submitting the incident report. This number must be provided by the reporti ng railroad, regardless of who actually owns or maintains the track or the crossing site. This is also required for a crossing location within i ndustries and rail yards, ports and dock areas, such as in a plant area owned by a private corporation or a railroad. Contact the operating railroad to obtain the number. (It is strongly recommended that the Accident/Incident Report be co mpared with the U.S. DOT Inventory Report on FRA's Web site to ensure that the correct crossing number has been identified and that the other data elem ents match.) Entering the term \"NOT ASSIGNED\" is not acceptable and the Form will be returned for completion with the correct information. In the event that the subject crossing was never assigned a number, a new valid crossing number must be obtained from FR A. If an identification number has not been assigned to the crossing, a complete d Inventory Report Form must be filed with the incident report. The new U. S. DOT Crossing Inventory Form can be obtained from FRA's Office of Safety Web site ( http://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/ OfficeofSafety ) or by calling (202) 493-6299. (For updated information refer to http://safetydata.fra .dot.gov/OfficeofSafety and click on the \"Crossing\" tab to query inventory. Existing crossing nu mbers can be obtained by contacting the FRA Washington Headquarters or s earching FRA's Web site. There is only one exception for which an incident report will be accepted without an assigned number in this field. This is where the crossing was created to serve specific temporary activities for less than 6 months (such as for construction). In this case, enter \"TEMP.\" 5. Date of Accident/Incident FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 146 F 6180.57 Enter the date the accident/incident occurred. 6. Time of Accident/Incident Enter the time the accident/incident occurr ed, in the local time of the location where the accident/incident occurred, and check the appropriate \"a.m.\" or \"p.m.\" box. Do not use military time. 7. Nearest Railroad Station Enter the name of the neares t timetable station. In ev ent of accidents involving Amtrak, the host railroad's nearest station will apply. 8. Subdivision Enter the full name of the subdivision on which the accident occurred, i.e. the track owner's subdivision name. If the ra ilroad is not so divided, enter the word \"System.\" In the event of a joint accident involving Amtrak, the host railroad's subdivision will apply. Note: If the accident occurred in a major terminal and subdivision is not applicable, enter \"terminal/yard name\" 9. County Enter the full name of the county or parish in which the accident/incident occurred. 10. State Abbr. Code Enter the appropriate State code, found in Appendix B, for the State in which the accident occurred. 11. City If the accident occurred within the jurisdic tion of a city, town or hamlet, enter the full name of this location; otherwise, enter \"N/A.\" 12. Highway Name or Number Enter the name or number of the highwa y or street involved. If the impact occurred at a public crossing, place an \"X\" or checkmark in the block titled \"Public.\" If at a private crossing, place an \"X\" or checkmark in the block titled \"Private.\" 13. Type [of Highway User Involved] Select the code that best identifies the type of highway user involved in the accident/incident. Note: If a pedestrian is identified in this item, then Items 14, 42, 44, 45, and 47 are to be coded \"N/A.\" 14. Vehicle Speed [of Hi ghway User Involved] FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 147 F 6180.57 List the estimated speed (mph) that the hi ghway user was traveling at the time of impact. If the highway user was not a ve hicle, enter \"N/A\". If the vehicle was stopped on the crossing at the time of imp act, enter \"0.\" The inclusion of a vehicle speed of 0 mph when the form el sewhere indicates that the vehicle was moving over the crossing or ar ound the gate is prohibited. 15. Direction [of Highw ay User Involved] Select the code that best describes the geographical direction in which the highway user was moving, and enter it in the box provided. If the highway user was stopped, identify the in tended direction of travel. Note: It is possible in some circumstances for the geographical direction of the highway user to be the same as the timetable direction of the railroad consist given in Item 31. 16. Position [of the Highway User Involved] Select the code that best describes the pos ition of the highway user at the time of impact, and enter in the code box. The c odes are as follows: (1) Stalled or stuck on crossing; (2) Stopped on Crossing; (3 ) Moving over crossing; (4) Trapped on crossing by traffic; and (5 ) Blocked on crossing by gate s. The fifth option, (5) \"Blocked on crossing by gates,\" applies to those situations in which a highway- user is prevented from leaving the cro ssing because the highway user is blocked- in by crossing gates. Note: If the highway vehicle was stoppe d or stalled on the crossing at the time of impact, the speed give n in Item 14 must be \"0.\" 17. Equipment [Rail Equipment Involved] Select the code that best identifies the ra ilroad equipment consist involved in the accident/incident and enter it in the box provided. (See definitions of types of rail equipment given in Chapter 2.) Note th at on-track work equipment such as ballast tampers are classified as cars and, therefore, shoul d be identified by using code \"4\" or \"5.\" When completing this item, pay particular attention to its re lationship to other items on the form to avoid contradicti ons. Some examples of contradictory responses are as follows: a. If the description of a railroad equi pment includes a reference to \"pulling,\" \"pushing,\" or \"moving,\" then train sp eed (\"Consist Speed\") in Item 30 cannot be \"0.\" b. If the description states that the cons ist was \"standing,\" then speed in item 30 must be \"0,\" and Item 19 cannot i ndicate that the consist struck the highway user. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 148 F 6180.57 c. If a train is identified, there must be a count of the number of locomotives given in Item 28. If the equipment c onsist was a single car or cut of cars, then Item 28 must be \"0,\" and the co unt of cars must be entered in Item 29. The values of the codes are: 1. Train (units pulling) 2. Train (units pushing) 3. Train (standing) 4. Car(s) (moving) 5. Car(s) (standing) 6. Light loco(s) (moving) 7. Light loco(s) (standing) 8. Other (specify) A. Train pulling - RCL B. Train pushing - RCL C. Train standing - RCL D. EMU Locomotive(s) E. DMU Locomotive(s) 18. Position of Car Unit in Tr ain [Rail Equipment Involved] Identify the position within the consist of the first locomotive unit or car that struck or was struck by the highway user . The position is determined by counting from (and including) the lead ing locomotive unit or car to the position of the first car or locomotive involved in the accident. The leading unit is the first car or locomotive to enter the crossing, regardless of the location of the locomotive(s). For example, in a pushing movement involving a cut of cars and a single locomotive, the count would begin from the car that first entered the crossing. Special Instruction: When the consist c ontains articulated ca r(s), the count for these is to be the number of platforms/units in such a car. This is necessary in order to maintain comparability of train lengths. The narrative is to contain a reference that articulated cars were included in the consist. Note: If a single railroad car or locomo tive was involved, or if the railroad consist struck the highway user (as s hown in Item 19), then the entry in this item must be \"1.\" FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 149 F 6180.57 19. Circumstance [Rail Equipment Involved] Specify whether the railroad consist struck the highway user or was struck by the highway user. If the railroad equipment st ruck the highway user, be sure that item 17 does not refer to \"standing\" equipment, and that the speed of the on-track equipment is given in Item 30. If the highw ay user struck the railroad consist, be sure that the estimated speed of the highw ay vehicle given in Item 14 is greater than \"0\" and that the position of the hi ghway user was coded \"3\" in Item 16. 20a. Was the highway user and/or rail equi pment involved in the impact transporting hazardous materials? Enter the code that identifies whethe r or not the rail equipment and/or the highway user was transporting hazardous ma terial as cargo at the time of the impact. For the rail equipment, this includes any car containing hazardous material cargo within the consist, regardless of lo cation, but not generally the locomotive because diesel fuel used by the locomotive and fusees carried by the locomotive are not considered to be cargo. Highway users are to be identified only when the hazardous material is being transported as cargo; the gasoline or diesel fuel used by the vehicle's engi ne is not considered to be cargo. 20b. Was there a hazardous materials (HAZMAT) release by Enter the code into the box that shows if there was a hazmat release by the highway user and/or rail equipment. If there was no hazmat release by either of these, enter the code for \"neither.\" A rel ease of gasoline or diesel fuel used by the vehicle's engine is not considered a hazmat release for the purposes of this item. (Describe such occurrences in the narrative.) 20c. State here the name and quantity of the hazardous material released, if any Enter the name of the hazardous materi al released, followed by the quantity released. State the measure, for example, 50 gal[lons], 20 tons. Describe the hazardous material released in the narrative by name or the Standard Transportation Commodity Code (STCC). (Note: Any release of hazardous material must also be reported on DO T form F 5800.1. See 49 CFR \u00a7 171.15 and \u00a7 171.16 for requirements.) 21. Temperature Enter the temperature (Fahrenheit) at the acci dent site at the time of the accident. If the temperature was below zero, preface the temperature number with a minus (-) sign. 22. Visibility Select the most appropriate entry, and place it in the code box. Make sure that the entry does not contradict the time given in Item 6; for example, if the time of the accident was 1:30 p.m., it would be inappr opriate to code the visibility as \"Dawn.\" FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 150 F 6180.57 23. Weather Select the most appropriate weather c ondition at the time and location of the accident, and enter the code in the box provided. 24.

See special instruction for Item 18 on counting articulated cars. 30. Consist Speed List the speed (mph) at which the consist was traveling when the impact occurred. Enter \"E\" in the code box to indicate if this is estimated; or enter \"R\" for a recorded speed. If the cons ist was not moving, enter \"0.\" 31. Timetable Direction If the consist was either moving or te mporarily stopped, enter the code that describes the timetable or schedule di rection in the box provided. If this equipment consist was a car or a cut of cars standing on the track, enter \"N/A.\" 32. Type of Crossing Warning Identify the warning devices by entering th e appropriate code(s) in the box(es). For codes \"2\" and \"3,\" \"FLS\" means \"flash ing signal.\" Enter a code of \"5\" (\"Highway Traffic Signals\") whenever such a signal is present at the crossing site and is used for controlling hi ghway traffic over the crossing. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 152 F 6180.57 33. Signaled Crossing Warning Only if Codes 1-6 in Item 32 (Type of Crossing Warning) are selected, enter in this item the status of the warning devi ces at the crossing at the time of impact, using the following: 1. Provided minimum 20-second warning. 2. Alleged warning time greater than 60 seconds. 3. Alleged warning time less than 20 seconds. 4. Alleged no warning. 5. Confirmed* warning time greater than 60 seconds. 6. Confirmed* warning time less than 20 seconds. 7. Confirmed* no warning. * Confirmed means that there is a physica l record (e.g., event r ecords, video tape or other tangible documentation). Conf irmed warning time of more than 60 seconds is classified as a false activation. If status code 5, 6, or 7 was entered, you must append a code from the following: A. Insulated rail vehicle. B. Storm/lightning damage. C. Vandalism. D. No power/batteries dead. E. Devices down for repair. F. Devices out of service. G. Warning time greater than 60 seconds attributed to accident- involved train stopping short of the crossing, but within track circuit limits, while warning devi ces remain continuously active with no other in-mo tion train present. H. Warning time greater than 60 seconds attributed to track circuit failure (e.g., insulated rail joint or rail bonding failure, track or ballast fouled). J. Warning time greater than 60 seconds attributed to other train/equipment within track circuit limits. K. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to signals timing out before train's arrival at the crossing/island circuit. L. Warning time less than 20 sec onds attributed to train operating counter to track circuit design direction. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 153 F 6180.57 M. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to train speed in excess of track circuit's design speed. N. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to signal system's failure to detect train approach. P. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to violation of special train operating instructions. R. No warning attributed to signal sy stem's failure to detect the train. S. Other cause(s). Explain in Narrative Description. Note: If the crossing site was not protected by train-activated warning devices, enter \"N/A.\" 34. Roadway Conditions Enter the code that best de scribes the condition of the roadway at the crossing at the time of the incident. This differs from weather conditions. For example, while the weather may be clear at the tim e of the incident, the roadway may have snow or ice that could impact the highway user. Roadway Conditions - Codes A. Dry B. Wet C. Snow/slush D. Ice E. Sand, Mud, Dirt, Oil, Gravel F. Water (Standing, Moving) 35. Location of Warning Select the code that identifies the locati on of the crossing warnings shown in Item 32, and enter it in the code box. If there was no protecti on at the crossing, enter \"N/A,\" and enter a code of \"12\" in Item 32 for \"None\" (i.e., no warning). 36. Crossing Warning Interconnected with Highway Signals If highway traffic signals within 500 feet of the crossing site are interconnected with the train detection circuitry, such th at they restrict hi ghway users from the crossing whenever a rail consist occupies or is about to occu py the crossing, enter \"1.\" If the highway traffic signals on the approach to the crossing are within 500 feet of the crossing but are not interconnected with th e train detection circuitry, enter \"2.\" Enter \"3\" (un known) in the code box only after consultation with the signal department responsible for track maintenance and a determination could not be made whether the highway traffic signals are interconn ected. If highway signals are not present within 500 fe et of the crossing, enter \"N/A\". FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 154 F 6180.57 Note: Item 32 identifies warning devices actually present at, or in the near vicinity of, the crossi ng. Therefore, it is possible to show highway traffic signa ls interconnected with train detection circuitry in this item, but not to enter a code of \"5\" in Item 32. 37. Crossing Illuminated by Stre et Lights or Special Lights If street lights or other sp ecial lights used to illuminate the crossing site were on at the time of the accident/incident, enter \"1.\" If there were no such lights or if they were not illuminated at the time of the accident, enter \"2.\" While code \"3\" (unknown) is authorized, it can only be used after the railroad has made a diligent effort to discern this fact, and a determination could not be made. 38. Highway User's Age Enter the age of the highwa y user. This block is mandatory, unless the age is unknown as a result of the accident/incident being a hit and run . 39. Highway User's Gender Enter \"1\" if the highway user was a ma le, or \"2\" if the highway user was a female. This block is mandatory, unless the gender is unknown as a result of the accident/incident being a hit and run . 40. Highway User Went Behind or in Front of Train and Struck or was Struck by Second Train Enter the appropriate entry in the code box. 41. Highway User Action Enter the appropriate entry in the code box. If code \"3\" (\"Did not stop\") is used, the vehicle must be shown as moving ove r the crossing in Item 16, and traveling at a speed greater than \"0\" in Item 14. In the event of a suicide, or attempted suicide, use code 8 regardless of whethe r other choices may be applicable. 1. Went around the gate 2. Stopped and then proceeded 3. Did not stop 4. Stopped on crossing 5. Other (specify) 6. Went around/thru temporary barricade 7. Went through the gate 8. Suicide or attempted suicide Note: If 6, Went around/thru temporar y barricade, is se lected due to the temporary closure of the crossing, explain in the narrative the circumstance of the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 155 F 6180.57 closure, e.g. the roadway was closed for repair of crossing surface, maintenance/testing of automated warn ing devices, or for other purposes. Additionally, explain how the closure wa s accomplished e.g.: roadway closed to traffic with jersey barriers (concrete traffic barriers) on both approaches, or roadway closed with construction barrel s on easterly approach, etc. Code 5, Other (specify), should be selected, for example, for highway users who were shoved onto the track and who were then in a collision. Such accidents/incidents may be described in the narrative section. 42. Driver Passed Sta nding Highway Vehicle Identify whether the highway user, immedi ately before the accident, had passed another vehicle that had st opped short of the crossing. Note: If a pedestrian is identifie d in Item 13, then enter \"N/A.\" 43. View of Track Obscured by If the highway user's view approaching the crossing was obstructed to the extent that he or she may have been unaware th at a rail consist was about to occupy or was occupying the crossing, enter the code that identifies the primary obstruction. If the highway user had a cl ear view of an approachi ng consist which had not yet occupied the crossing, enter code \"8.\" 44. Driver was [Condition After Accident/Incident] Select the code that describes the extent of harm to the driver. If the driver was fatally injured or injured to the extent of requiring medical treatment, a line entry on Form FRA F 6180.55a must also be comple ted for this accident/incident. See \u00a7 225.19(d). If the driver committed or attempted to commit suicide (as determined by a coroner, public police offi cer, or other public authority) then the fatality or injury to that individual must be reported as a suicide data case, and Item 44 should also be comp leted for this case. 45. Was Driver in the Vehicle? If the driver of the highway vehicle was in the vehicle at the time of impact, enter \"1\" in the code box. If the driver had le ft the vehicle prior to the impact, enter \"2.\" 46. [Casualties to] Highway-Rail Crossing Users Enter the total number of reportable deaths and injuries (including suicides and attempted suicides). All deaths and injuri es must also be reported individually on Form FRA F 6180.55a. A highway user who is involved in a highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident and is trans ported from the scene of a highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident to a medical facility via ambulance or other form of medical conveyance is presumed to ha ve sustained an FRA reportable injury. See instructions on Railroad Injury and Illness (Continuation Sheet), Form FRA F 6180.55a at the beginning of this chapter. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 156 F 6180.57 Note: If the driver committed suicide, as determined by a coroner or other public authority, and the passenger was not a pa rty to the suicide, then the driver should be shown as a suicide case, but the passenger injury would be reported as a regular case.) Reportable casualties that resulted from suicides and attempted suicides, as determined by a coroner, public police offi cer, or other public authority, must be included in the casualty counts in bo xes 46, 49, and 52, as applicable. 47. Highway Vehicle Property Damage Enter the estimated cost of damages sust ained by the highway vehicle involved. The amount given should reflect the cost of repairs. If th e vehicle is beyond repair, the cost is the replacement value of the vehicle. If there was no damage to the vehicle, enter \"0.\" Do not make entries such as \"totaled.\" 48. Total Number of Vehicle Occupants (including driver) Enter the total number of vehicle occupant s involved in the incident (including driver, if applicable). Vehicle includes automobiles, buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, farm vehicles, and all other modes of surface transportation, motorized and unmotorized. The vehicle occupants are those people in the vehicle at the time of impact. 49. [Casualties to] Railroad Employees See instructions for block 46. For purposes of this form, \"Railroad Employees\" includes only those persons classified as Worker on Duty-Railroad Employee (Class A). Reportable casualties that resulted from suicides and attempted suicides, as determined by a coroner, public police offi cer, or other public authority must be included in the casualty counts in bo xes 46, 49, and 52, as applicable. 50. Total Number of People on the Train Enter the total number of people on the trai n at the time of the incident (including passengers and train crew). 51. Is a Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report Being Filed? If the accident resulted in reportable railroad damage above the threshold established for reporting rail equipment acc idents/incidents, en ter \"1\" in code box, and complete Form FRA F 6180.54. 52. [Casualties to] Passengers on Train See instructions for block 46. Passengers on tr ains are those identified as Class C. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 157 F 6180.57 Reportable casualties that resulted from suicides and attempted suicides, as determined by a coroner, public police offi cer, or other public authority, must be included in the casualty counts in bo xes 46, 49, and 52, as applicable. 53a. Special Study Block - Recording of Accident/Incident Indicate whether the highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident was recorded by a locomotive video recorder, by checking off either the \"Yes\", or \"No\" check box (for ken? is \"Yes\", indi cate if the recording was used by the railroad (i.e., informati on gathered in viewin g the recording was used) to complete the FRA Highway-R ail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report, by checking either the \"Yes or \"N o\" check box (for \"Video used?\"). For additional information on requirements rela ted to locomotive event recorders, see 49 CFR 229.135 \"Event Recorders.\" 53b. Special Study Block The \"Special Study Blocks\" (SSB) in this it em are for collection of essential data as the need arises. The FR A will notify the railroads in writing, or if appropriate, through publication in the Fe deral Register, of the purpose and the type of information that is to be collected. In conjunction with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), FRA will publis h in the Federal Register any announcement affecting highway users, thus allowing motor carriers the opportunity to provide FRA pertinen t special study information. 54. Narrative Description An accident is frequently the culminati on of a sequence of related events, and a variety of conditions or circumstances may contribute to its occurrence. A complete record of all of these is bene ficial in accident prevention analysis. However, it is not practical, even if it were possible, to develop forms and codes that would capture every de tail that may be associated with the causes and resulting consequences of each accident . Therefore, the most appropriate combination of available codes that best identifies the likely primary and any contributing cause and other factors, is to be used when completing the railroad's report. The limitations imposed by standardized repor ting forms make it critical that the narrative portion of the re port provide additional information concerning those items that cannot be adequately describe d on the coded portions of the form. The wide variation in the causes and circum stances of accidents makes it impractical to prepare a comprehensive list of items to include in any discussion. The railroad should include any informati on that increases our knowledge of the underlying reasons why the accident occurr ed and its consequences. Simply entering, for example, \"train struck ve hicle at crossing xxx\" does not provide additional insight into the causal factors of the incident. In addition, a narrative descri ption should not incl ude personal identifiers, such as names, social security numbers, or payroll identification numbers. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 158 F 6180.57 55. Typed Name and Title Type or print the name and title of the pe rson responsible for pr eparing this report form. 56. Signature Signature of the person shown in Item 55. Note: If Form FRA F 6180.57 is to be submitted electronically, signature (Item 56) and date of signature (It em 57) are not required. 57. Date Date the signature was made in Item 56. This is the date the form was initially completed. 10.5 Questions and Answers Q1. A man driving a truck did not see a train occupying a highway-rail grade crossing and lost control of his vehicle when he slammed on the brakes to avoid a collision. His truck ended up in the ditch with considerable damage, and he broke his arm. What reports need to be prepared? A1. Since an impact did no t occur between a highway us er and railroad on-track equipment at a highway-rail grade cr ossing, you do not need to prepare a highway-rail accident/inc ident report (Form FRA F 6180.57). However, the motorist did sustain a reportable injury arising from the operation of a railroad. Therefore, an injury report (Form FR A F 6180.55a) must be completed. If the motorist had struck the consist at the cr ossing using this example, a Form FRA F 6180.57 would be required even though the impact did not occur on the crossing site. If an injury repo rt (Form FRA F 6180.55a) is completed for this case, the Event Circumstance Code should not be \"32\" Highway-rail collision/impact. Q2. Say that a highway user struck a signal stand at a highway-rail grade crossing and was injured, but there was no on-track equipment present, nor were employees of the railroad in th e vicinity. Is this reportable? A2. No. Section 225.15(a) exempts the reporting of motor vehicle accidents at highway-rail grade crossings when they do not involve the presence of on-track equipment or railroad employees. Q3. A motorist in an off-road vehicle was waiting behind several automobiles at a crossing site where the gates were down and a standing train was occupying the track. He apparently became im patient and drove his vehicle off the highway and parallel to the track to a point where he could cross over the track behind the train. His vehicle stal led on a parallel set of tracks, and he was unable to start it. He exited his truck just before a train on the adjacent FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 159 F 6180.57 track hit it. Should this be repor ted as a highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident or any other type? A3. An event such as this w ould not qualify as a highway-rail grade crossing collision since the motor vehicle operator had left the highway of his own choosing and his vehicle was struck at a location other th an a designated crossing site. The event would be reportable as an obstruc tion accident on Form FRA F 6180.54 if reportable damage was in excess of the threshold. If the motorist had been hurt in connection with this event, then an injury report (Form FRA F 6180.55a) would need to be completed. Q4. There was a collision between a train and an automobile at a highway-rail grade crossing. The driver was injured and taken by ambulance to a local hospital. Neither the hospital nor the driver would reveal the injuries to the railroad. Without knowing the injuries, the railroad cannot determine if the injury met the FRA's reportability cri teria. Is this injury reportable to FRA? A4. FRA realizes that this type of case is difficult to report under these circumstances. However, when an injury occurs at a highway-rail grade crossing, due to a collision with a highway user and on tr ack equipment, and the injured highway- user is taken from the accident scene by an ambulance, then the injury is reportable unless there is documentation to prove that the injury did not meet the FRA's reportability criteria. The inju ry must be shown on Highway-Rail Grade-Crossing Accident/Incident Repor t Form FRA F 6180.57 and an injury report must be reported on the Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet) Form FRA F 6180.55a. If no injury in formation is available then the code \"999\" should be placed in block5i - Injury -Illness Code. The railroad would still be required to contact the highway user in writing (Form FRA F 6180.150) and by phone. 10.6 Common Reporting Errors The most common reporting error is when cr ossing data reported on the Form FRA F 6180.57 does not match the information on file in the U. S. DOT National Crossing Inventory File. The reporting railroad should alwa ys check FRA's Web site at http://safetydata.fra .dot.gov/OfficeofSafety , and click on \"Crossing\" tab to query Inventory file to ensure that the information matches and is consistent. If the location, type of crossing, warning devices, etc., are different, the railroad reporting officer should check to see if the accident was reported at the correc t crossing. If it was and the cu rrent Inventory information is outdated or incorrect, then an updated Crossi ng Inventory Report (Form FRA F 6180.71) should be filed with the Highway-Ra il Crossing Accident Report. Contradictory Information. The following is a partial listing of some common errors resulting from contradictory information. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 160 F 6180.57 If a highway vehicle was moving at the time of the impact, vehicle speed in Item 14 cannot be \"0,\" and the vehicle's position on the crossing shown in Item 16 must be \"3\" (\"Moving over crossing\"). If the highway vehicle was not moving, the vehicle speed must be \"0\"; the position code in Item 16 cannot be \"3\" (\"Moving over crossing\"), and Item 19 must be \"1,\" indicating that the rail consist struck the highway user. If the rail consist was moving at the time of the imp act, Item 17 must be either \"1,\" \"2,\" \"E \") and the speed in Item 30 cannot be \"0.\" If the rail consist was not moving, then Item 17 must cont ain \"3,\" \"5,\" \"7,\" or \"8\" (or \"C,\" \"D,\" or \"E\"); the consist speed in Item 30 must be \"0\"; and Item 19 must be coded \"2,\" indicating that the highway user struck the rail consist. If the rail consist struck the hi ghway user, code \"1\" must be en tered in Item 19, and the position of the car/unit in the consist given in Item 18 must be \"1.\" This position is determined by counting from the leading car/unit in the consist, identified as the firs t car/unit to enter the crossing. Therefore, whenever a rail consist st rikes the highway user, it will always be the leading unit that makes the initial contact. Item 41 cannot indicate that a highway user we nt around or through gates if gates were not present at the crossing, as shown in Item 32. Failure to File Other Accident/Incident Form s or Filing Contradictory Data On Different Reports . When Part 225 requires that a single accident be re ported on more than one kind of form, be sure to verify that similar information contained on the various reports is co nsistent. The following are a few of the items that should be review ed prior to forwarding the monthly reports. If reportable casualties occurred in the accident , these must be reported individually on Form FRA F 6180.55a. If reportable damage (rail equipment and track) exceeded the threshold for train accidents, Form FRA F 6180.54 must be completed. Carefully co mpare all related information between these forms to ensure consistency. The casualties reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a must have the same State code as that shown on Form FRA F 6180.57. 10.7 Requirements for Form FRA F 6180.150 The railroad is required to c ontact any highway user potentially injured in a highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident, or their representative, in writing and, if unsuccessful in obtaining the needed information, by telephone. Except that a ra ilroad is not required to contact a highway user who has died as a result of the accident . The written correspondence should contain the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 161 F 6180.57 Form FRA F 6180.150, \"Highway User Injury Inquiry Form,\" a cover letter (see Appendix N for a sample cover letter) and a return envelope with postage and return address. The railroad shall complete Part I of Form FRA F 6180.150 and send th e form with a cover lett er to the potentially injured highway user. With regard to the cover letter, the instructions co ntained in the final rule require that the letter contain the following: An explanation of why the railroad is contacting the highway user; An explanation of part 225's accident/incident reporting requirements; An explanation of how the form and any response will be used for part 225's accident/incident reporting requirements; An explanation that the highway user is not required to respond and that an response is voluntary; An opportunity to correct incorr ect information in Part I; Identify and provide contact information fo r a person at the railroad who can answer questions with regard to the form; Provide instructions on how to complete Part II; and An explanation of how any medical reco rds, if requested, personal identifying information or information will be handled. The cover letter and Form FRA F 6180.150 are meant to be tools that allow the railroad to gather information and comply with part 225's accident/i ncident reporting and re cording requirements. As such, a railroad shall not require the highw ay user to provide any medical or personal information in order to report a casualty. The co ver letter may ask the highway user to provide additional information but the cove r letter should not mandate that the individual provide certain information in order for a railroad to comply with Federal reporting re quirements. The purpose of this letter and the form is to collect enough information for th e railroad to determine whether an individual suffered a reportable injury. Moreov er, the cover letter a nd any communication for the purposes of part 225 shall remain separate from and not reference the railroad's claims process in order to avoid confusion. The railroad shall hand deliver or send by firs t class mail the letter and form (along with a prepaid and preaddressed return envelope) within a reasonable time period following the date of the highway-rail grade crossing accide nt/incident. A railroad shall keep a record of its efforts to contact a highway user and this record and doc umentation of any information obtained shall be available for review and copying by an FRA representative u nder the same criteria as set forth in \u00a7 225.35(b). This record includes, but is not li mited to, retaining a copy of the Form FRA F 6180.150 and the accompanying cover letter, any response from the highway user and, when appropriate, a record documenting the date, time and c ontent of the follow-up call. Moreover, the railroad must retain a copy of this record for a period of 5 years. See \u00a7 225.27. For the highway user, Form FRA F 6180.150 is voluntary, not mandatory. FRA acknowledges that there will be situ ations in which a passe nger cannot be reached even though a railroad contacts the person in writing and by telephone. Other times a passenger will refuse to provide FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 162 F 6180.57 any information even though a rail road clearly explains the Fe deral reporting requirements and the reason for soliciting information. In those cas es, a railroad is still responsible for deciding whether, considering all of the circumstances, the passenger suffered a re portable injury. The railroad's ability to make a reporting decision is not cont ingent upon the highway user's response. The railroad must reconsider that de termination if new or a dditional information is later acquired. Moreover, if a highway user comp letes Part II, or provide s additional information during a telephone call, the railro ad will be responsible for determining whether based on the circumstances that the person suffered a reportable injury or illness. A railroad may terminate their investigation afte r calling and mailing the i ndividual. The inquiry requirement does not place a timeframe on the amount of follow-up the railroad is required to perform. Except that the railroad should initiate the inquiry with in a reasonable time period after the highway-rail grade cro ssing accident/incident. 10.8 Instructions for Completing Form FRA F 6180.150 Item Instruction PART I - Highway Rail-Grade Crossing Accident/Incident 1a.

FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 166 Commuter and Other Passenger Rail Operations 12. Supplemental Information: Co ntractors; Commuter and Other Passenger Rail Operations 12.1 General Title 49 CFR Part 225 accident/incident repo rting regulations apply to all railroads (including commuter and other passenger rail op erations) unless specif ically excepted under \u00a7 225.3. FRA has a specific need to know of accidents, in juries, accident rates and injury rates of passenger and commuter operations. This has cr eated a special recordkeeping environment to allow FRA to determine the safety record of each commuter railroad. 12.2 Contractors 12.2.1 Contractors - non-railroad employees Often a railroad will hire a contractor to perform certain tasks for the railroad. FRA identifies two types of Contractor: Worker On Duty-Cont ractor, and Contractor-Other. Both of these categories are for persons who are not employed by any railroad and are not covered by the Railroad Retirement System. If a contractor is injured performing safety-sensitive functions, then the contractor injury is to be reporte d to FRA on Form FRA F 6180.55a as Worker On Duty-Contractor (Class F). If a contractor is injured performi ng non-safety sensitive functions, then the contractor injury is to be reporte d to FRA on Form FRA F 6180.55a as Contractor- Other. For example, an employee of a contractor is performing safety-sen sitive functions for a passenger railroad. The employee sustains an FR A reportable injury. The passenger railroad must report this injury (under the passenger ra ilroad's unique code/identifier) to FRA on Form FRA F 6180.55a as an injury to a Worker on Duty-Contractor. However the hours worked by contracted empl oyees are not reported on Form FRA 6180.55, in Block 15, \"Railroad Worker Hours.\" Reportable inju ries to contractor em ployees are reported to FRA by the contracting railroad and to OSHA by the employing contractor. 12.2.2 Contractors - railroad employees FRA identifies two types of railroad employees: Worker on Duty (Class A) and Employee not on Duty (Class B). Both of these categories ar e for persons who are employed by a railroad and are covered by the Railroad Retirement System. Contracted employees w ho are employees of a contracted railroad and are cove red by the Railroad Retirement System are considered railroad employees of the contracting railroad for purposes of FRA accident/incident reporting. For example, an employee of a contracted rail road who is performing service for a passenger railroad is considered a Worker on Duty (Class A) of the passenger railroad for the purpose of accident/incident reporting, even though the work er is actually employed by the contracted railroad. Accordingly, the passenger railroad mu st report to FRA, under the passenger railroad's FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 167 Commuter and Other Passenger Rail Operations code/identifier, the hours the contracted railroad employee worked in block 15, \"Railroad Worker Hours,\" of the passenger railroad's Form FRA F 6180.55 report to FRA as Worker on Duty - Employee (Class A). Acco rdingly, the hours worked by, and any injury to, the contracted railroad employee are not to be reported to the FRA by the employing railroad under Part 225. Note that when determining whet her a railroad qualifies for partia l relief from the recordkeeping requirements under \u00a7 225.3(c)(1), a railroad should not include contract employees (railroad or non-railroad) when determining if the railroad has 15 or fewer employees covered by the hours of service law. 12.3 Train Operations 12.3.1 Performed by Railroad Many passenger railroads perform their own train operations; thes e railroads should report their accidents and incidents using the normal procedures in this Guide. \"Passenger railroad\" includes commuter, excursio n, tourist, or any ot her form of railroad transporting passengers. 12.3.2 Performed by Contractor When a railroad's operations are performed by a contractor (e.g., a nother railroad or transportation company), the contracting railroa d still must report to FRA all accidents and incidents discernibly caused by an event or exposure arising from the operation of the contracting railroad, on the appropriate FRA forms, as well as report to FRA train-miles, railroad worker hours, passenger train-miles, and othe r applicable informa tion on the FRA Form F 6180.55, even though railroad operations conducted in pa rt or wholly by cont racted employees. Example. Commuter Railroad A has contracted with Freight Ra ilroad B to have Freight Railroad B perform all of Commu ter Railroad A's train operations . Commuter Railroad A must report to FRA, under Commuter Railroad A's name and railroad code/iden tifier, all accidents and incidents arising from Commuter Railro ad A's railroad operations, even though the operations are actually conducted by employees of Freight Railroad B. This includes the reporting of injuries and illnesses to Freight Rail road B's employees that are discernibly caused by events or exposures arising out of the Co mmuter Railroad A's opera tions, since Freight Railroad B's employees are railroad employees and are covered by the Railroad Retirement System. Note that Commuter Railroad A must report the contracted hours worked by Freight Railroad B employees on its monthly Form FRA 6180.55 report, in block 15 \"Railroad Worker Hours.\" Example . Commuter Railroad A has contracted with Company X to perform certain safety- sensitive service. Commuter Railroad A must report to FRA, under Commuter Railroad A's name and railroad code/identifier, all accidents and incidents arising from Commuter Railroad A's railroad operations, even though some of the operations are actually conducted by employees of Company X. This includes the re porting of injuries to Company X's employees that are discernibly caused by an event or expos ures arising out of Co mmuter Railroad A's FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 168 Commuter and Other Passenger Rail Operations operations. Note that Commuter Railroad A mu st not report the contracted hours worked by Company X employees on its monthly Form FR A 6180.55 report, in block 15 \"Railroad Worker Hours.\" Example. Commuter Railroad A has contracted with Freight Railroad B to have Freight Railroad B perform all of Commu ter Railroad A's train operati ons, including the filing of Commuter Railroad A's accident/incid ent reports with FRA. Freight Railroad B must report to FRA, under Commuter Railroad A's name and ra ilroad code/identifier, all accidents and incidents discernibly caused by an event or e xposure arising from Co mmuter Railroad A's railroad operations, even though the operations ar e actually conducted by employees of Freight Railroad B. Note that under such circumstan ces, the contracting rail road (Commuter Railroad A) is ultimately responsible to ensure that its operations comply with Part 225. Accordingly, any enforcement action taken by FRA for noncomplian ce with Part 225's requirements (reporting or otherwise) will be against the contracting railroad (Commuter Railroad A), even if the incident of noncompliance was due to an act or omission of th e contracted railroad (Freight Railroad B). 12.3.3 Form 6180.55 As a railroad subject to Part 225, each passenge r railroad must submit to FRA monthly a Form FRA 5180.55 report using an identifi er unique to that passenger ra ilroad operation. If you are a contractor who is has been contracted to pe rform operations for a passenger railroad, all accident/incident information asso ciated with the opera tion of the passenger railroad must be reported to FRA under the reporting code/identifier of the passenger railroad. This includes all operational data, e.g., train miles, railroad work er hours, passengers tran sported, passenger train- miles of the passenger railroad. \"Railroad worker hours\" (Block 15 on Form FRA 6180.55) must include hours worked by railroad employees . This includes hours worked by employees of the passenger railroad and hours worked by empl oyees of other railroads (who are covered by the Railroad Retirement System) as contractors for the passenger railroad. Hours worked by contractors who are not railroad employees are not included. Trackage Maintenance and Repair - Reporting \"R ailroad Worker Hours,\" Block 15 on Form FRA F 6180.55. If the trackage over which a passenger railroad operates is owned by the passenger railroad and maintained by employees of the passenger railro ad, then railroad worker hours related to the repair and maintenance of the track must be re ported to FRA under the reporting code/identifier of the passenger railroad. If the trackage over which a passenger railroad operates is owned by the passenger railroad, but maintained by non-railroad employees of a contract or to the passenger railroad, then the railroad worker hours related to the repair and maintenance of the track are not to be reported to FRA. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 169 Commuter and Other Passenger Rail Operations If the trackage over which a passenger railroad operates is owned by the passenger railroad, but maintained by railroad employees of another ra ilroad, who perform the track maintenance for the passenger railroad under contract, th en the railroad worker hours (of the contracted railroad employees) related to the repair and maintenance of the track must be reported to FRA under the reporting code/identifier of the passenger railroad. If the trackage over which the pass enger railroad operates is owne d and maintained by a railroad other than the passenger railroad, th en worker hours related to the maintenance of the track is not to be reported to FRA by the passenger railroad. (See the discussion on Contractors, in section 12.2 of this Guide.) If the track is solely for the purpose of the commuter/passenger system, then all hours associated with the repair and maintenance must also be included under the \"Employee Hours\" category. 12.3.4 Form 6180.55a In addition to other reportable injuries, railroads are required to report to FRA deaths, injuries, and occupational illness of railr oad employees. Railroad employe es are those employees that work for a railroad and are covered by the Ra ilroad Retirement System. In the case of contracted railroad employees, c ontracting railroads must include in their Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet) FRA Form F 6180.55a reports to FRA deaths, injuries, and occupational illnesses of all railroad employees, this means both the contracting railroad's employees as well as the contracted railroad's employees. The railro ad employees should be reported as Worker On Duty - Railroad Empl oyee (Class A) and Railroad Employee Not On Duty (Class B). It is the contra cting (i.e., reporting) railroad's responsibilit y to insure that the contracted railroad notif ies the contracting railro ad of all reportable a nd accountable injuries to its employees. 12.3.5 Form 6180.54 If a railroad carrier contracts the performance of its operations out to another railroad, the contracting railroad carrier st ill must report all reportable ra il equipment accidents/incidents on Form FRA F 6180.54, \"Rail Equipment Accident /Incident Report\" under the contracting railroad's unique identifier/code. The contr acting railroad is respon sible for insuring that the contracted railroad notifies the contracting railroad of the occurrence of all reportable rail equipment accidents/incidents. If the contracting railroad has the contract ed railroad perform its accident/incident reporting function, the contracti ng railroad is still responsible for ensuring accurate reporting. 12.3.6 Form 6180.57 If a railroad carrier contracts the performance of its operations out to another railroad, the contracting railroad carrier st ill must report all reportable highway-rail grade crossing accidents/incidents on Form FRA F 6180.57, \"Highw ay-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report,\" under the contracting rail road's own unique identifier/code. The contracting railroad is responsible for insuring that th e contracted railroad notifies th e contracting railroad of the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 170 Commuter and Other Passenger Rail Operations occurrence of all highway-rail grade crossing accidents/incidents. If the contracting railroad has the contracted railroad perform its accident/incident reporting function, the contracting railroad is still responsible for ensuring accurate reporting. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 171 F 6180.107 13. Form FRA F 6180.107 - Alternative R ecord for Illnesses Claimed to be Work-Related 13.1 Purpose The purpose of this form is to report railroad em ployee-claimed occupational illness where the process of gathering the information is not avai lable in traditional proc essing, e.g., a class action law suit or other unusual circumstances. The Form FRA F 6180.98 should be used for recording occupational illness whenever the normal flow of information is available to complete the form, regardless of determination of work relations hip. The narrative of the Form FRA F 6180.107 can state that the case is in dispute w ith the germane facts and qualified reasons. FRA requires the recording of these cases to es tablish an audit trail for employee occupational illness cases that come to the attention of the railroad through blind lawsuits and have insufficient information to complete a Form FR A F 6180.98. It also serves as a tool for FRA Safety Assurance and Compliance officers to use dur ing reviews to determin e if proper reporting decisions are being made. 13.2 Provision Each railroad may maintain a Form FRA F 6180 .107, or alternate railroad -designed record in place of a Form FRA F 6180.98, only for those clai med occupational illnesses for which the railroad has not received, from the employee or their representative, information sufficient to determine whether the occupational illness is work-related. When a railroad does not receive information sufficient to determine whether a claimed occupational illness case is accountable or reportabl e, the railroad shall make a good faith effort to obtain the necessary information by Decem ber 1 of the next calendar year. The alternative railroad-designed record may be used in lieu of the Alternative Record for Illnesses Claimed to Be Work -Related (Form FRA F 6180.107). Any such alternative record shall contain all of the informa tion required on the Alternative Record for Illnesses Claimed to Be Work-Related. Although this information may be displayed in a different order from that on the Alternative Record for Illne sses Claimed to Be Work-Relate d, the order of the information shall be consistent from one such record to anot her, and the order chosen by the railroad shall be consistent for each of the railroad's reporting establishments. Railroads may list additional information on the alternative r ecord beyond the information requi red on the Alternative Record for Illnesses Claimed to Be Work-Related. Time limit to record initial claim of occupational illness. Each railroad shall enter each illness claimed to be work-related on Form FRA F 6180.107 (or alternative record) as early as practicable, but no later than 7 working days after receiving in formation or acquiring knowledge that an employee is claiming they ha ve incurred an occupational illness. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 172 F 6180.107 Time limit to record additional information regarding a claim of occupational illness. Within fifteen calendar days of receiving additional inform ation regarding a claimed occupational illness case, each railroad shall document receipt of the information, includ ing date received and type of document/information received, in narra tive block 19 of Form FRA F 6180.107. Time limit to re-evaluate record initial claim of occupational illness after receiving additional information. Within forty-five calendar days of receiving additional information regarding a claimed occupational illness, each railroad shall re-evaluate the claimed occupational illness to determine work-relatedness, ta king into account the new information, and document any findings resulting from the re-evaluation in narrative block 19 of Form FRA F 6180.107. Cases determined to be reportable. Once it has been determined that a particular case is accountable or reportable, the railroad must record the in formation on Form FRA F 6180.98 within 7 days of the date the determination is made; retain the Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record in acco rdance with \u00a7 225.27; and re port the occupational illne ss, as applicable, in accordance with \u00a7 225.11. Once a case is reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a, it is no longer necessary to continue to upda te the Form FRA F 6180.107 or the Form FRA 6180.98. If the case is reported, changes to counts of days absent or restricted are to be made on Form FRA F 6180.55a, not on Form FRA F 6180.107 or Form FRA F 6180.98. Cases determined NOT to be reportable. Once it has been determined that a particular case is not accountable or reportable, the railroad shall include the following information in narrative block 19 of Form FRA F 6180.107: 1) why the case does not meet reporting criteria; 2) the basis upon which the railroad made this determination; and 3) the most authoritative information the railroad relied upon to make the determination. Alternative record. The alternative record sha ll contain all of the following information, to the extent that it is reasonably available: 1. Name of Reporting Railroad 2. Case/Incident Number (The Case/Incident Nu mber identified in block 2 must be used on Form FRA F 6180.98 and Form FRA F 6180.55a for any case determined to be accountable or reportable) 3. Employee's Name (first, middle, last) 4. Employee's Date of Birth (mm/dd/yy) 5. Employee's Gender 6. Employee Identification Number 7. Date Employee was Hired (mm/dd/yy) 8. Employee's Home Address (Include street address, city, State and Zip code) 9. Employee's Home Telephone Number (with area code) 10. Name of Facility Where Railroad Employee Normally Reports to Work FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 173 F 6180.107 11. Location, or Last Known Facilit y, Where Employee Reports to Work 12. Job Title of Railroad Employee 13. Department to Which Employee is Assigned 14.

Nature of Claimed Illness 18. Supporting Documentation 18a. Custodian of Documents (Name, Title, and Address) 18b. Location of Supporting Docume ntation (Although the Alterna tive Record for Illnesses Claimed to be Work-Related, or the altern ate railroad-designed form, may not include all supporting documentation, such as medical records, the record shall note the custodian of those documents and where the supporting documents ar e located so that they are readily accessible to FRA upon request) 19. Narrative 20. Preparer's Name 21. Preparer's Title 22. Preparer's Telephone Nu mber (with area code) 23. Date the record was initia lly signed/completed (mm/dd/yy) 13.3 Questions and Answers Q1. The only information provided to th e railroad was the employee's name and Employee ID Number. Further attempts to complete the other data elements were rejected by the employee and/or his or her attorney. Does this meet FRA requirements? A1. Yes. The railroad should continue to complete all the data elements when the information becomes available and should make a good faith effort to obtain the information. However, the railroad is not expected to continue this effort past December 1 of the year that follows the date on which the railroad first received a claim of the illness. Q2. The employee reported that he/she has some pain in hand/arm area due to carpal tunnel syndrome and that the job environment caused and/or aggravated the condition. The comp any's PLHCP has determined the employee does not have carpal tunnel, and that the employee's condition was not related to railroad employment. Should the Form FRA F 6180.107 be used? FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports 174 F 6180.107 A2. No. The Form FRA F6180.98 should be us ed with an appropriate explanation of the PLHCP's diagnoses. This case shoul d be treated no differently than a reported injury that the PLHCP determined to be not reportable.

A derailment occurs which is attributable to the defective track condition. Example: A railroad employee (o r a contracted employee), while using a bulldozer to rerail cars, caused damage to the rail on an adjacent main track. A train passing on this adjacent main track derailed due to the damage caused by the bull dozer operated by the railroad employee (or an employee contracted by the railroad). H994 Human Factor - Signal installation or ma intenance error (field) Example: A signal mainta iner was servicing the sign al system. It was lat er determined during the investigation of a rear-end collision that the sign al maintainer made an installation/maintenance error resulting in an incorrect as pect being displayed in the w ayside signal or cab signal.

Note: The definition of a \"Fixed Signal\" covers such signals as switch, train order, block, interlocking, semaphore, disc, stop board, yard limit boards, direct traffic control signs, or other means for displaying indications that govern the movement of a train or engine. Codes H219 and H220 have been designed to ca pture accidents/incide nts that result from fixed signals other than automatic block or interlocking signals . Events of this type would result from the improper display of, or fa ilure to comply with, switch targets; train order signals that are not a part of the au tomatic block or interlocking signal system; semaphore signals; discs; stop boards at railroad crossings or other loca tions; and/or yard limit boards. Code H219 is to be used for improper display, and Code 220 for failure to comply.

An STS is a change in hearing noise- induced hearing loss. If an employee's hearing test (audiogram) reveals that the employee has experienced a work-related STS in h earing in one or both ears, and the employee's total hearing level is 25 decibels (dB) or more above audiometric zero (averaged at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz) in the same ear(s) as the STS, you must report the case on Form FRA F 6180.55a. A standard threshold shift, or STS, is define d in the occupational noise exposure standard at 29 CFR 1910.95(g)(10)(i) as a change in hearing threshold, re lative to the baseline audiogram for that employee, of an average of 10 dB or more at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz in one or both ears. STS. If the employee has never previously experienced a recordable hearing loss, you must compare the employee's current audiogram with that employee's baseline audiogram. If the employee has previously experienced a recordable hearing loss, you must compare the employee's current audiogram with the employee's revised baseline audiogram (the audiogram reflecting the employee's previous recordable hearing loss case). 25-dB loss. Audiometric test results reflect the employee's overall hearing ability in comparison to audiometric zero. Therefore, using the employee' s current audiogram, you must use the average hearing level at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz to determine whether or not the employee's total hearing level is 25 dB or more. See additional instructions in Chapter 6. 1152 Synovitis - inflammation of the membrane around a joint or other musculoskeletal element 1153 Tenosynovitis - inflammation of the tendon (fibrous tissue that connects the muscle to a bone) or the membrane that surrounds it, e.g., epicondylitis or tendinitis. 1154 Bursitis - inflammation of the bursa (a membranous pouch that is used for cushioning the joints FRA Guide for Preparing A ccident/Incident Reports APPENDIX E - Continued Appendix E - 5 Injury and Illness Codes 1155 Raynaud's phenomena - a symptom complex usually related to poor circulation of an extremity characterized by loss of feeling, bl anching (whitening) and coolness of the part, typically a finger, toe, hand, or foot 1156 Carpal tunnel syndrome 1157 Other conditions associated with repeated moti on, vibration, pressure, or repeated trauma. 1159 DEATH resulting from repeated trauma Other Occupational Illnesses Not Listed above 1191 Anthrax - bacterial diseas e, typically spread from infected animals to humans 1192 Brucellosis - an infectious bacterial disease spread by contact with the tissues, blood, urine or fetuses of contaminated animals 1193 Infectious hepatitis (also known as hepatitis A) - infection of the liver, characterized by fever, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and in severe cases, jaundice 1194 Malignant tumors - tumors which spread beyond their original boundaries to distant organs and will generally result in death if not treated 1195 Benign tumors - tumors that do not spread beyond the original tumor mass except through local growth and do not pose the same risk of distant spread, disease, and death as seen in malignant tumors 1196 Stress related (determined by a qualified health care professional) 1197 Histoplasmosis/Coccidiomycosis - fungal infectious diseases 119E Emotional Trauma/nervous shock 1198 All other occupational illnesses other than those classified above 1199 DEATH resulting from other occupational illnesses FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports Appendix F - 1 Circumstance Codes APPENDIX F Circumstance Codes 1.

Did the employee die as a result of the accident/incident? Yes No Typed Name and Title Signature DateINSTRUCTIONS FOR CO MPLETING FORM FRA F 6180.81 \"EMPLOYEE HUMAN FACTOR ATTACHMENT\" FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSRequirements If, in reporting a rail equipment accident/incident on Form FRA F 6180.54, a railroad cites an empl oyee human factor as the pri mary cause or a contributing cause of the accident, the railroad that cited such employee human factor must complete Form FRA F 6180.81, entitl ed \"Employee Human Factor Attachment.\" The Form FRA F 6180.81 must be attached to its related Rail Equipment Accident/Incident report.This Form is only used in c onnection with a reportable rail equipment accident/inc ident where Form FRA F 6180.54 submitted to F RA identifies an employee human factor as either the primar y cause or contributing cause of the accident. General InstructionEach employee identified on Form FRA F 6180.81 must be notified that he or she has been identified as a possible primary or a c ontributing cause of an accident. That notification is to be given on Form FRA F 6180.78. Instructions for completing Form FRA F 6180.78 are noted on the attachment to that form. You also may wish to refer to the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports , or FRA's website at www.FRA.DOT.GOV for completion of that form. Q. Under what circumstances must the reporting railroad complete a Form FRA F 6180.81? A. This form should be completed only when a railroad, in r eporting a rail equipment accident/inc ident to FRA assigns any of t he cause codes listed under \"Train Operation\"-Human Factors as listed in Appendix C to the FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports as the primary cause or a contributing cause of the ra il equipment accident/incident. Q. What is the definition of a \"railroad employee\" for purposes of completing this form? A. \"Railroad Employee\" means Worker on Duty -Railroad Employee (Class A), Railroad Empl oyee not on Duty (Class B), Worker on Du ty- Contractor (Class F), and Worker on Duty-Volunteer (Class H). See 49 C.F.R. 225.5, 225.12. Q. What is the definition of \"the primary cause or a contributing cause\"? A. The \"primary cause or a contributing cause\" is an act, om ission, or physical condition such as alcohol intoxication, fatigu e, or legal or illegal drug use that was the main cause or a contri buting cause of the accident/incident. If an employee was intoxicated or fatigued, but the accident would have happened anyway and with the same degree of severity, then the intoxication, fatigue is not the primary or a contributing cause. If the employee's act, omission, or phys ical condition only remotely contributed to t he accident/incident, this is still a contributin g cause of the accident. Q. Should I send a Form FRA F 6180.78 to an employee's home if the employee died as a result of the accident? A. No. A Notice for an employee must not be sent if that em ployee has died as a result of that accident. A Notice is not req uired and is not recommended for an employee who has died due to any cause by the time that Notice is ready to be sent. Q. What should I do if the railroad alleges an employee from another railroad is the primary cause or a contributing cause of the accident ? A. You should notify the employee's railroad that the reporti ng railroad alleges that the primar y or a contributing cause of t he accident was that employee. The employee's railr oad should then promptly provide to the reporti ng railroad the name, title, address, and medical status of that employee. Q. What if the reporting railroad cannot initially identify an employee as the primary cause or a cont ributing cause of an accident but subsequently does identify such employee? A. The reporting railroad should prepare a revised form FRA F 6180.81 and forward it to FRA. In addition, the reporting railr oad, will have 15 days from the date of the revised form to send an FRA F 6180.78 to that employee. Q. May a reporting railroad ever defer notice to an employee? A. Yes. Particularly if the employee was seriously injured, a railroad may defer notice to the employee. Q. Must the reporting railroad attach a Form FRA F 6180.81 to the Form FRA F 6180.54 if the reporting railroad has scheduled o r is conducting a formal investigation of the accident to determine if it was caused by human factor , but the investigation is not concluded before the filing of the regular monthly report? A. Yes. The reporting railroad must nevertheless attach the FRA F 6180.81 to the Form FRA F 6180.54. Moreover, when completi ng the 6180.81 in this situation, the reporting railroad should in the \"Brief Description\" block, explain t hat the employees have not been nam ed because the railroad is still conducting a formal investigation. Indicate whether th e formal investigation is currently in progress or the date tha t it is scheduled to begin. Once the investigation is completed, the reporting railroad must file a \"corrected copy\" of the Form FRA F 6180.81 for each imp licated employee. Q. When must the reporting railroad notify the implicated employee?A. A Notice for an employee must be sent within 45 days from the end of the month in which the accident occurred, unless the employee has died, or in the reporting railroad's discreti on, the reporting railroad should defer notice.DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION (FRA)INITIAL RAIL EQUIPMENT ACCIDENT/INCIDENT RECORD 3.

FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports Appendix I - 1 Model Internal Control Plans APPENDIX I Model Internal Control Plans, Including Model Statement of Policy Against Harassment and Intimidation and Model Complaint Procedures Explanatory Note The Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) safety regulations require railroads to adopt and comply with a written Internal Control Plan (I CP) on accident/incident reporting. (See Chapter 1 of Guide.) The intent of the ICP requirement is to ensure that the railroad's Reporting Officer has the required information to prepare accurate accident/incident reports to FRA and that employees are not afraid to provide relevant information. Section 225.33(a) of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations (49 CFR \u00a7 225.33(a)) specifies the components to be included in an ICP. All railroads subject to 49 CFR Part 225 must have an ICP with either: two components (corresponding to \u00a7 225.33(a)(1)-(2); or 11 components (corresponding to \u00a7 225.33(a)(1)-(11). Certain small railroads need h ave only a two-component ICP. In particular, railroads that operate or own track on the general railroad sy stem of transportation that have 15 or fewer employees covered by the hours of service stat ute (Title 49 U.S. C ode, Chapter 211) and non- insular tourist and historic railroads that operate or own track exclusivel y off the general system must have a two-component ICP. (See \u00a7 225.3(b), 61 Fed. Reg. 67490 (Dec. 23, 1996).) The first component involves adopting, disseminating, and complying with a policy statement against harassment and intimidation, including a statement of the disciplinary action to be imposed for violation of this policy. The second compone nt entails (i) having both a procedure for processing complaints of violations and a policy not to retaliate against complainants and (ii) disclosing such procedure and policy. Other railroads subject to Part 225 must have a full-scale ICP that includes all 11 components specified in \u00a7 225.33(a)(1)-(11). Primarily to assist small railroads in developi ng their ICPs, FRA is pres enting in this appendix two model ICPs that can be used. Each cont ains blanks to be completed by the railroad. For railroads required to have only a two-component ICP, Model 1 is a suggested two- component ICP. For railroads required to have an 11-component ICP, Model 2 is a suggested ICP for such railroads with fewer than 200 employees. FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports APPENDIX I - Continued Appendix I - 2 Model Internal Control Plans These models are only suggestions. A railroad's trade organiza tion may have its own model ICP. There is no definitive ICP. Large railroads, because of their complexity, may prefer to develop an ICP quite different from Model 2, and yet still be consistent with the regulation. Smaller railroads may also decide to depart from the suggested models. Details, such as the structure, forms, lines of communication, and instru ctions, are left to the railroad's discretion to design and implement. FRA recommends that rail roads structure their ICPs in the same manner that the CFR shows the components, e.g., 49 CFR 225.33(a)(1), then 225.33(a)(2), then 225.33(a)(3), etc. A railroad may develop some synthe sis between plans and develop its own plan so long as it is consistent with the regulation. Railroads may fo llow any applicable mode l ICP provided in the Guide and are also encouraged to tailor their ICP based upon their particular operation, structure, or situation. After the ICP is put in place, if any significant changes to the railroad's internal reporting procedures occur, the ICP must be amended.

Other railroads invol ved should consult with the host railroad when completing this block. The codes used to complete the Type of Territory block are dependent on the Type of Track (block 20) on the Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report, Form FRA F 6180.54. The railroad completing the report must first determine the type of track. Once the type of track is determined, then the Type of Territory codes can be complete d. Each spreadsheet is labeled by the Type of Track and has its own allowable uses. Block 30 \"Type of Territory\" of the Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report, Form FRA F 6180.54, has five positions for five codes. Only use the Type of Territory that was in effect at the time of the accident. The first position\u2014required\u2014will indicate th e type of territory (signaled or nonsignaled). The second position\u2014required\u2014will indicate the authority for movement. The third, fourth, and fifth positions\u2014op tional\u2014are supplemental/adjunct codes. (They are mandatory to the extent that a ll applicable codes are entered). When used, they must be entered in hierarchi cal sequence, i.e., by order of precedence. For ease of reading, the supplemental/adj unct methods are listed in alphabetical order, followed by the code. Other\u2014Narrative Required. This should be used when the situation cannot be adequately described with the existing codes. The railroad responsible for track maintenance will determine/provide the Type of Track and Type of Territory that were in effect at the time of the accident. Direct Train Control . This is an FRA umbrella term a nd refers to modern-day derivatives of traditional timetable/train order methodology. Th ese methods of control have greatly modernized and simplified train operations by eliminating timetab le schedules, train registers, superiority, and the attendant array of complicated operating rul es. These systems are predicated on the train dispatcher having direct and continuous radio cont act with all trains; hence the informal name \"radio train dispatching.\" In place of the train order, there is a written document known variously as a track warrant, DTC clearance, OCS clearance, track permit, Form D, etc. There are two basic direct train control systems presently in use on today's railroads: one that uses fixed blocks (i.e., the limits are constant and are identified both in th e timetable and by wayside signs); and one that uses variable blocks (i.e., the limits are not constant and are created by the train dispatcher for each train). FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports Appendix J - 2 Instructions for Type of Territory Block 30 on Form FRA F 6180.54 These systems are variously iden tified in the industry as: 1. Track Warrant Control (TWC) 2. Direct Traffic Control (DTC) 3. Form D Control System (DCS) 4. Occupancy Control System (OCS) 5.

1 Electronic Submission of Reports APPENDIX K Electronic Submission of Reports to FRA The instructions in this Guide are limited to i ssues associated with r ecordkeeping and reporting. Railroads may transmit their monthly reports to FR A by alternative means, as an electronic file on optical media or submitted over the Internet. The technical information needed for doing this is not described in this Guide, since it is no t necessary for reporting decisions. A separate manual is available, upon request, that contains the specifications for doing this, and is titled \"Companion Guide: Guidelines for Submitting Accident/Incident Reports by Alternative Methods.\" To assist railroads in maintaining and submitti ng records and reports required by this rule, FRA developed the software package Accident/Inc ident Report Generator (AIRG) for personal computers that have Windows-based operating sy stems. FRA will provide you with a copy of this software free of charge, upon request by the reporting officer. You can find an AIRG Accident Incident Report Ge nerator Request Form at: http://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/Offi ceofSafety/publicsite/Forms.aspx Railroads submitting electronically can either submit a printed copy of the signed Form FRA F 6180.55, or alternatively send in a scanned copy of the signed form in .pdf or .jpg format. The railroad must maintain the original comp leted FRA Form F 6180.55 and the electronic notification of receipt of the form, per 49 CFR 225.27.

Published: May 23, 2011. \u00a7 225.1 Purpose. The purpose of this part is to provide the Federal Railr oad Administration with accurate information concerning the hazards and risks that exist on the Na tion's railroads. FRA needs this inform ation to effectively carry out its regulatory responsibilities under 49 U.S.C. chapters 201-213. FRA also uses this information for determining comparative trends of railroad safety and to develop hazard elimination and risk reduction programs that focus on preventing railroad injuries and accidents. Any Stat e may require railroads to submit to it copies of accident/incident and injury/illness reports filed with FRA under this part, for accidents/incidents and injuries/illnesses which occur in that State. \u00a7 225.3 Applicability. (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), this part applies to all railroads except-- (1) A railroad that operates freight trains only on track in side an installation which is not part of the general railroad system of transportation or that owns no track ex cept for track that is inside an installation that is not part of the general railroad system of transportation and used for freight operations. (2) Rail mass transit operations in an urban area that are not connected with the general railroad system of transportation. (3) A railroad that exclusively hauls passengers inside an installation that is insular or that owns no track except for track used exclus ively for the hauling of passengers inside an installation that is insular. An operation is not considered insular if one or more of the following exists on its line: (i) A public highway-rail grade crossing that is in use; (ii) An at-grade rail crossing that is in use; (iii) A bridge over a public road or wa ters used for commercial navigation; or (iv) A common corridor with a railroad, i.e., its operations are within 30 feet of those of any railroad. (b) The Internal Control Plan requirements in \u00a7 225.33(a)(3) through (a)(11) do not apply to-- (1) Railroads that operate or own track on the genera l railroad system of transportation that have 15 or fewer employees covered by the hours of service law (49 U.S.C. 21101-21107) and (2) Railroads that operate or ow n track exclusively off the general system. (c) The recordkeeping requirements regarding accountab le injuries and illnesses and accountable rail equipment accidents/incidents found in \u00a7 225. 25(a) through (g) do not apply to-- (1) Railroads that operate or own track on the genera l railroad system of transportation that have 15 or fewer employees covered by the hours of service law (49 U.S.C. 21101-21107) and (2) Railroads that operate or ow n track exclusively off the general system. (d) All requirements in this part to record or report an injury or illness incurred by any classification of person that results from a non-train incident do not apply to railroads that operate or own track exclusively off the general railroad system of transportation, unless the non-trai n incident involves in- service on-track equipment. \u00a7 225.5 Definitions. As used in this part\u2014 2 Accident/incident means: (1) Any impact between railroad on-track equipment and a highway user at a highway-rail grade crossing. The term \"highway user\" includes automobiles, buses, trucks, mo torcycles, bicycles, farm vehicles, pedestrians, and all other modes of surface transportation motorized and un-motorized; (2) Any collision, derailment, fire, explosion, act of God, or other event involvi ng operation of railroad on-track equipment (standing or moving) that results in reportable damages greater than the current reporting threshold to railroad on-track equipment, signals, track, track structures, and roadbed; (3) Each death, injury, or occupational illness that is a new case and meets the general reporting criteria listed in \u00a7 225.19(d)(1) through (d)(6) if an event or exposure ar ising from the operation of a railroad is a discernable cause of the resulting condition or a discernable cause of a significan t aggravation to a pre-existing injury or illness. The event or exposure arising from the operation of a railroad n eed only be one of the discernable causes; it need not be the sole or predominant cause. Accountable injury or illness means any abnormal condition or disorder of a railroad employee that causes or requires the railroad employee to be examined or treated by a qualified health care professional, regardless of whether or not it meets the general reporting criteria lis ted in \u00a7 225.19(d)(1) through (d)(6), and the railroad employee claims that, or the railroad otherwise has knowle dge that, an event or exposure arising from the operation of the railroad is a discernable cause of the abnormal condition or disorder. Accountable rail equipment accident/incident means (1) Any derailment regardless of whether or not it causes any damage or (2) Any collision, highway-rail grade crossing acciden t/incident, obstruction accident, other impact, fire or violent rupture, explosion-de tonation, act of God, or other accident/incident involving the operation of railroad on- track equipment (standing or moving) that results in damage to the railroad on-track equipment (standing or moving), signals, track, track structures or roadbed and that damage impairs the functioning or safety of the railroad on-track equipment (standing or moving), si gnals, track, track structures or roadbed. Covered data means information that must be reported to FR A under this part concerning a railroad employee injury or illness case that is reporta ble exclusively because a physician or other licensed health care professional-- (1) Recommended in writing that-- (i) The employee take one or more days away from wo rk when the employee instead reports to work (or would have reported had he or she been scheduled) a nd takes no days away from work in connection with the injury or illness, (ii) The employee work restricted duty for one or mo re days when the employee instead works unrestricted (or would have worked unrestricted had he or she b een scheduled) and takes no days of restricted work activity in connection with the injury or illness, or (iii) The employee take over-the-counter medication at a dosage equal to or greater than the minimum prescription strength, whether or not the employee actually takes the medication; or (2) Made a one-time topical application of a prescription-strength medication to the employee's injury. Day away from work means a day away from work as described in paragraph (1) of this definition or, if paragraph (1) does not apply, a day away from work solely for reporting purposes as described in paragraph (2) of this definition. For purposes of this de finition, the count of days includes a ll calendar days, regardless of whether the employee would normally be scheduled to work on t hose days (e.g., weekend days, holidays, rest days, and vacation days), and begins on the first calendar day after the railroad employee has been examined by a physician or other licensed health care professional (PLHCP) and diagnosed with a work-rela ted injury or illness. In particular, the term means-- (1) Each calendar day that the employee, for reasons associ ated with his or her condition, does not report to work (or would have been unable to report had he or sh e been scheduled) if not reporting results from: (i) A PLHCP's written recommendation not to work, or (ii) A railroad's instructions not to work, if the injury or illness is otherwise reportable; or (2) A minimum of one calendar day if a PLHCP, for reasons associated with the employee's condition, recommends in writing that the employee take one or more days away from work, but the employee instead reports to work (or would have reported had he or she been scheduled). This paragraph is intended to take into 3account ``covered data'' cases and also those non-covered da ta cases that are independently reportable for some other reason (e.g., ``medical treatment'' or ``day of rest ricted work activity''). The requirement to report ``a minimum of one calendar day'' is intended to give a railr oad the discretion to report up to the total number of days recommended by the PLHCP. Day of restricted work activity means a day of restricted work activit y as described in paragraph (1) of this definition or, if paragraph (1) does not apply, a day of restricted work activity solely for reporting purposes as described in paragraph (2) of this defi nition; in both cases, the work restric tion must affect one or more of the employee's routine job functions (i.e., those work activities regularly performed at least once per week) or prevent the employee from working the full workday that he or she would otherwise have worked. For purposes of this definition, the count of days includes all calendar days , regardless of whether the employee would normally be scheduled to work on those days (e.g., weekend days, holid ays, rest days, and vacation days), and begins on the first calendar day after the railroad employee has been ex amined by a physician or other licensed health care professional (PLHCP) and diagnosed with a work-related in jury or illness. In particular, the term means-- (1) Each calendar day that the employee, for reasons associated with his or her condition, works restricted duty (or would have worked restricted duty had he or sh e been scheduled) if the restriction results from: (i) A PLHCP's written recommendation to work restricted duty, or (ii) A railroad's instructions to work restricted duty, if the injury or illness is otherwise reportable; or (2) A minimum of one calendar day if a PLHCP, for reasons associated with the employee's condition, recommends in writing that the employee work restricted duty for one or more days, but the employee instead works unrestricted (or would have worked unrestricted had he or she been scheduled). This paragraph is intended to take into account ``covered data'' cas es and also those non-covered data cases that are independently reportable for some other reason (e.g., \"medical treatment\" or \"day of restricted work activity\"). The requirement to report \"a minimum of one calendar day'' is intende d to give a railroad the discretion to report up to the total number of days recommended by the PLHCP. Discernable cause means a causal factor capable of being recognized by the senses or the understanding. An event or exposure arising from the operation of a railr oad is a discernable cause of (i.e., discernably caused) an injury or illness if, considering the circumstances, it is mo re likely than not that the event or exposure is a cause of the injury or illness. The event or ex posure arising from the operation of a railroad need not be a sole, predominant or significant cause of the injury or illness, so l ong as it is a cause (i.e., a contributing factor). Employee human factor includes any of the accident causes signified by the train accident cause codes listed under ``Train Operation--Human Factors' ' in the current ``FRA Guide for Prep aring Accidents/Incidents Reports,'' except for those train accident cause codes pertaining to non-railroad workers. For purposes of this definition ``employee'' includes the classifications of Worker on Du ty--Employee, Employee not on Duty, Worker on Duty-- Contractor, and Worker on Duty--Volunteer. Establishment means a single physical location where work ers report to work, where railroad business is conducted, or where services or operations are performed. Ex amples are: a division office, general office, repair or maintenance facility, major switching yard or terminal. For employees who are engaged in dispersed operations, such as signal or track maintenance work ers, an ``establishment'' is typically a location where work assignments are initially made and oversight responsibility exists, e.g., the establishment where the signal supervisor or roadmaster is located. Event or exposure includes an incident, ac tivity, or occurrence. Event or exposure arising from the operation of a railroad means\u2014 (1) With respect to a person who is not an employee of the railroad: (i) A person who is on property owned, leased, maintained or operated by the railroad, an event or exposure that is related to the performance of the railroad's rail transpor tation business; or (ii) A person who is not on property owned, leased, maintained or operated over by the railroad, an event or exposure directly resulting from one or mo re of the following railroad operations: (A) A train accident or a train incident involving the railroad; or 4(B) A release of a hazardous material from a railcar in the possession of the railroad or of another dangerous commodity that is related to the performance of the railroad's rail transportation business. (2) With respect to a person who is an employee of the ra ilroad, an event or exposure that is work-related. FRA representative means the Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA; the Associate Administrator's delegate (including a qualified State inspector acting under part 212 of this chapter); the Chief Counsel, FRA; or the Chief Counsel's delegate. General reporting criteria means the criteria listed in \u00a7 225.19(d)(1) through (6). Highway-rail grade crossing means: (1) A location where a public highway, road, or str eet, or a private roadway, in cluding associated sidewalks, crosses one or more railroad tracks at grade; or (2) A location where a pathway explicitly authorized by a public authority or a railroad carrier that is dedicated for the use of non-vehicular traffic, including pedestrians, bi cyclists, and others, that is not associated with a public highway, road, or street, or a private roadway, crosses one or more railroad tracks at grade. The term \"sidewalk\" means that portion of a street between the curb line, or the lateral line of a roadway, and the adjacent property line or, on easements of private property, that portion of a str eet that is paved or improved and intended for use by pedestrians. Injury or illness means an abnormal condition or disorder. Inju ries include cases such as, but not limited to, a cut, fracture, sprain, or amputation. Illnesses include bot h acute and chronic illnesses, such as but not limited to, a skin disease, respiratory disorder, or pois oning. A musculoskeletal disorder is al so an injury or illness. Pain is an injury or illness when it is sufficiently severe to meet the general reporting cr iteria listed in \u00a7 225.19(d)(1) through (6). Joint operations means rail operations conducted on a track used jo intly or in common by two or more railroads subject to this part or operation of a train, locomotive, car, or other on-track equipment by one railroad over the track of another railroad. Medical removal means medical removal under the medical surve illance requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard in 29 CFR part 1910 in effect during calendar year 2002, even if the case does not meet one of the general reporting criteria. Medical treatment means any medical care or treatment beyond \"first aid\" regardless of who provides such treatment. Medical treatment does not include diagnostic procedures, such as X-rays and drawing blood samples. Medical treatment also does not include counseling. Musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) means a disorder of the muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage, and spinal discs. The term does not include disorders caused by slips, trips, falls, motor vehicle accidents, or other similar accidents. Examples of MSDs include: Carpal tunnel syndrome, Rotator cuff syndrome, De finger, Tarsal tunnel syndrome, Sciatica, Epicondylitis, Tendinitis, Ra ynaud's phenomenon, Carpet layers knee, Herniated spinal disc, and Low back pain. Needlestick or sharps injury means a cut, laceration, puncture, or scratch from a needle or other sharp object that involves contamination with another person's blood or othe r potentially infectious material, even if the case does not meet one of the general reporting criteria. New case means a case in which either the injured or ill pers on has not previously experienced a reported injury or illness of the same type that affects the same part of the body, or the injured or ill person previously experienced a reported injury or illness of the same type that affected the same part of the body but had recovered completely (all signs and/or symptoms disappeared) from the previous injury or illness, and an event or exposure arising from the operation of a railroad discernably caused the signs and/or symptoms to reappear. 5 Non-train incident means an event that results in a reportable casualty, but does not involve the movement of on- track equipment nor cause reportable damage above the threshold established for train accidents. Occupational hearing loss means a diagnosis of occupational hearing lo ss by a physician or other licensed health care professional, where the employee's audiogram reveals a work-related Standard Threshold Shift (STS) (i.e., at least a 10-decibel change in hearing threshold, relative to the baseline audiogram for that employee) in hearing in one or both ears, and the employee's total hearing level is 25 decibels or more above audiometric zero (averaged at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz) in the same ear(s) as the STS. Occupational illness means any abnormal condition or disorder, as diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional, of any person who falls under th e definition for the classification of Worker on Duty-- Employee, other than one resulting from injury, discernably caused by an environmental factor associated with the person's railroad employment, including , but not limited to, acute or chronic illnesses or diseases that may be caused by inhalation, absorption, ingestion, or direct contact. Occupational tuberculosis means the occupational exposure of an employee to anyone with a known case of active tuberculosis if the employee subsequently develops a tuberculosis infection, as evidenced by a positive skin test or diagnosis by a physician or other licensed health care professional, even if the case does not meet one of the general reporting criteria. Privacy concern case is any occupational injury or illness in the following list: (1) Any injury or illness to an intimate body part or the reproductive system; (2) An injury or illn ess resulting from a sexual assault; (3) Mental illnesses; (4) HIV infection, hepatitis, or tuberculosis; (5) Needlestick and sharps injuries; and (6) Other injuries or illnesses, if the employee inde pendently and voluntarily request s in writing to the railroad reporting officer that his or her injury or illness not be posted. Person includes all categories of entities covered under 1 U.S.C. 1, including, but not limited to, a railroad; any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or facilities; any passenger; an y trespasser or nontrespasser; any independent contractor providing goods or services to a railroad; any volunteer pr oviding goods or services to a railroad; and any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor. Qualified health care professional is a health care professional operating within the scope of his or her license, registration, or certification. In addition to licensed ph ysicians, the term includes members of other occupations associated with patient care and treatment such as chiropract ors, podiatrists, physicians assistants, psychologists, and dentists. Railroad means a railroad carrier. Railroad carrier means a person providing railroad transportation. Railroad transportation means any form of non-highway ground transportation that run on rails or electro- magnetic guideways, including commuter or other shor t-haul railroad passenger service in a metropolitan or suburban area, as well as any commuter railroad service that was operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation as of January 1, 1979, and high speed gr ound transportation systems that connect metropolitan areas, without regard to whether they use new technologies not asso ciated with traditional railroads. Such term does not include rapid transit operations within an urban area that are not connected to the general railroad system of transportation. Significant aggravation of a pre-existing injury or illness means aggravation of a pre-existing injury or illness that is discernably caused by an event or exposure aris ing from the operation of a railroad that results in: 6 (1) With respect to any person: (i) Death, provided that the pre-existing injury or illness would likely not have resulted in death but for the event or exposure; (ii) Loss of consciousness, provided that the pre- existing injury or illness would likely not have resulted in loss of consciousness but for the event or exposure; or (iii) Medical treatment in a case where no medical treatment was needed fo r the injury or illness before the event or exposure, or a change in the course of medical treatment that was being provided before the event or exposure. (2) With respect to a railroad employee, one or more da ys away from work, or days of restricted work, or days of job transfer that otherwise would not ha ve occurred but for the event or exposure. Significant change in the damage cost s for reportable rail equipment accidents/incidents means at least a ten- percent variance between the damage amount reported to FRA and current cost figures. Significant change in the number of reportable days away from work or days restricted means at least a ten- percent variance in the number of actual reportable days away from work or days restricted compared to the number of days already reported. Significant illness means an illness involving cancer or a chronic irreversible disease such as byssinosis or silicosis, if the disease does not result in death, a day away from work, restricted work, job transfer, medical treatment, or loss of consciousness. Significant injury means an injury involving a fractured or cr acked bone or a punctured eardrum, if the injury does not result in death, a day away from work, restricted work, job tran sfer, medical treatment, or loss of consciousness. Suicide data means data regarding the death of an individua l due to the individual's commission of suicide as determined by a coroner, public police officer or other pub lic authority or injury to an individual due to that individual's attempted commission of suicide as determined by a public police office or other public authority. Only the death of, or injury to, the individual who committed the suicidal act is suicide data. Therefore, casualties to a person caused by the suicidal act of a nother person are not considered suicide data. Train accident means any collision, derailment, fire, explosion, act of God, or other event involving operation of railroad on-track equipment (standing or moving) that r esults in damages greater than the current reporting threshold to railroad on-track equipment, si gnals, track, track structures, and roadbed. Train incident means any event involving the movement of on- track equipment that results in a reportable casualty but does not cause reportable damage above th e current threshold established for train accidents. Work environment means the establishment and other locations where one or more railroad employees are working or present as a condition of their employment. The work environment includes not only physical locations, but also the equipment or ma terials processed or used by an employee during the course of his or her work, and activities of a railroad employee associated w ith his or her work, whether on or off the railroad's property. Work related means related to an event or exposure occurring w ithin the work environment. An injury or illness is presumed work-related if an event or exposure occurring in the work environment is a discernable cause of the resulting condition or a discernable cause of a significant a ggravation to a pre-existing injury or illness. The causal event or exposure need not be peculiarly occupational so long as it occurs at work. For example, a causal event or exposure may be outside the employer's control, such as a lightning strike; involve activities that occur at work but are not directly productive, such as horseplay; or involve activities that are not peculiar to work, such as walking on a level floor, bending down, climbing stairs or sneezing. Such activities, along with other normal body movements, are considered events. So long as the event or exposure o ccurred at work and is a discernable cause of the injury or illness, the injury or illness is work-relate d. It does not matter whether there are other or bigger causes as well, or 7that the activity at work is no different from actions perfo rmed outside work. If an injury is within the presumption of work-relatedness, the employer can rebut work-rela tedness only by showing that the case falls within an exception listed in \u00a7 225.15. In cases where it is not obviou s whether a precipitating event or exposure occurred at work or outside work, the employer must evaluate the employee's work duties and environment and decide whether it is more likely than not that an event or exposure at work was at least one of the causes of the injury of the injury or illness. \u00a7 225.6 Consolidated reporting. A parent corporation may request in writing that FRA treat its commonly controlled railroad carriers, which operate as a single, seamless, integrated United States rail system, as a single railroad carrier for purposes of this part.

(a) Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report alleging employee human factor as cause; completion of Employee Human Factor Attachment. If, in repor ting a rail equipment accident/incident to FRA, a railroad cites an employee human factor as the primary cause or a contributing cau se of the accident; then the railroad that cited such employee human factor must complete, in accordance with instructions on the form and in the current ``FRA Guide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports,'' an Employee Human Factor Attachment form on the accident. For purposes of this section, ``employee'' is defined as a Wo rker on Duty--Employee, Employee not on Duty, Worker on Duty--Contractor, or Worker on Duty--Volunteer. (b) Notice to identified implicated employees. Except as provi ded in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, for each employee whose act, omission, or physical condition was al leged by the railroad as the employee human factor that was the primary cause or a contributing cause of a rail equi pment accident/incident and whose name was listed in the Employee Human Factor Attachment for the accident a nd for each such railroad employee of whose identity the railroad has actual knowledge, th e alleging railroad shall-- (1) Complete part I, ``Notice to Railroad Empl oyee Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee Human Factor,'' of Form FR A F 6180.78 with information regarding the accident, in accordance with instructions on th e form and in the current ``FRA Gu ide for Preparing Accident/Incident Reports''; and (2) Hand deliver or send by first class mail (postage prep aid) to that employee, within 45 days after the end of the month in which the rail equipment accident/incident occurred-- (i) A copy of Form FRA F 6180.78, ``Notice to Railroad Employee Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee Human Factor; Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report,'' with part I comple ted as to the applicable employee and accident; (ii) A copy of the railroad's Rail Equipmen t Accident/Incident Report and Employee Human Factor Attachment on the rail equipm ent accident/incident involved; and (iii) If the accident was also reportable as a highw ay-rail grade crossing accident/incident, the railroad's Highway-Rail Grade Crossi ng Accident/Incident Report on that accident. (c) Joint operations. If a reporting railroad makes allegations under paragraph (a) of this section concerning the employee of another railroad, the employing railroad must promptly provide the name, job title, address, and medical status of any employee reasonably identified by the alleging railroad, if requested by the alleging railroad. 10 (d) Late identification. Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, if a railroad is initially unable to identify a particular railroad employee whose act, omissi on, or physical condition was cited by the railroad as a primary or contributing cause of the acci dent, but subsequently makes such id entification, the railroad shall submit a revised Employee Human Factor Attachment to FRA i mmediately, and shall submit the Notice described in paragraph (b) of this section to that employee within 15 days of when the revised report is to be submitted. (e) Deferred notification on medical grounds. The reporti ng railroad has reasonable discretion to defer notification of implicated employees on medical grounds. (f) Implicated employees who have died by the time that the Notice is ready to be sent. (1) If an implicated employee has died as a result of the accident, a Notice under paragraph (b) addressed to that employee must not be sent to any person. (2) If an implicated employee has died of whatever causes by the time that the Notice is ready to be sent, no Notice addressed to that employee is required. (g) Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report (Supplements or Employee Supplements). (1) Employee Statements Supplementing Railroad Ac cident Reports are voluntary, not mandatory; nonsubmission of a Supplement does not imply that the employee admits or endorses the railroad's conclusions as to cause or any other allegations. (2) Although a Supplement is completely optional and not required, if an employee wishes to submit a Supplement and assure that, after receipt, it will be proper ly placed by FRA in a file with the railroad's Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report and that it will be re quired to be reviewed by the railroad that issued the Notice, the Supplement must be made on part II of Form FRA F 6180.78 (entitled ``Notice to Railroad Employee Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Inciden t Attributed to Employee Human Factor; Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report''), follo wing the instructions printed on the form. These instructions require that, within 35 days of the date that the Notice was hand delivered or sent by first class mail (postage prepaid) to the employee (except for good cause shown), the original of the Supplement be filed with FRA and a copy be hand delivered or sent by first class mail (postage prepaid) to the railroad that issued the Notice so that the railroad will have an opp ortunity to reassess its reports to FRA concerning the accident. (3) Information that the employee wishes to withhold from the railroad must not be included in this Supplement. If an employee wishes to provide confidential information to FRA, the employee should not use the Supplement form (part II of Form FRA F 6180.78, \"Notice to Railroad Employee Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee Human Factor; Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report\"), but rather provide such confidential information by other means, such as a letter to the employee's collective bargaining representativ e, or to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration, Office of Safety Analysis, RRS-22, Mail Stop 25 West Building 3rd Floor, Room W 33-306, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. The letter should include the name of the railroad making the allegations, the date and place of the accident, and the rail equipment accident/incident number. (h) Willful false statements; penalties. If an employ ee chooses to submit a Supplement to FRA, all of the employee's assertions in the Supplement must be true a nd correct to the best of the employee's knowledge and belief. (1) Under 49 U.S.C. 21301, 21302, and 21304, any pers on who willfully files a false Supplement with FRA is subject to a civil penalty. See appendix A to this part. (2) Any person who knowingly and willfully files a false Supplement is subject to a $5,000 fine, or up to two years'' imprisonment, or both, under 49 U.S.C. 21311. \u00a7 225.13 Late reports. Whenever a railroad discovers that a report of an accident/incident, through mistake or otherwise, has been improperly omitted from or improperly re ported on its regular monthly acciden t/incident report, a report covering 11this accident/incident together with a letter of explana tion must be submitted immediately. Whenever a railroad receives a partially or fully completed Employee Statem ent Supplementing Railroad Accident Report (part II of Form FRA F 6180.78), in response to a Notice to Railroad Employee (part I of Form FRA F 6180.78) issued by the railroad and mailed or hand delivered to the employee, the railroad must promptly review that Supplement; based on that review, reassess the accuracy and validity of the ra ilroad's Rail Equipment Accide nt/Incident Report and of any other reports and records required by this part co ncerning the same accident, including the Employee Human Factor Attachment; make all justified revisions to each of those reports and records; submit any amended reports to FRA; and submit a copy of any amended Rail Equipmen t Accident/Incident Report, Employee Human Factor Attachment, and Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Acciden t/Incident Report on the accident to the employee. A second notice under \u00a7 225.12 is not required for the employee. If an employee who was never sent a notice under \u00a7 225.12 for that accident is implicated in the revised Em ployee Human Factor Attachment, the railroad must follow the procedures of \u00a7 225.12(d). \u00a7 225.15 Accidents/incidents not to be reported. The following accidents/incidents are not reportable: (a) With respect to persons other than railroad employees . A railroad need not report injuries that occur at highway-rail grade crossings that do not involve the presence or operation of on-track equipment, or the presence of railroad employees then engaged in the operation of a railroad; (b) With respect to railroad employees on duty . A railroad is not to report the following injuries to or illnesses of a railroad employee as Worker on Duty - Employee (Class A), if any of the conditions in this paragraph (b) are met. (These exceptions apply only to Worker on Duty - Employ ee (Class A) and do not affect a railroad's obligation to report these injuries and illnesses as other types of persons (Employee Not On duty (Class B); Passenger on Trains (Class C); Nontrespassers-On Railroad Property (Class D); Tr espassers (Class E)), or a railroad's obligation to maintain a \"Railroad Employee Injury /Illness Record\" (Form FRA F 6180.98 or alternative railroad-designed form)). (1) The injury or illness occurred in or about living qu arters and an event or exposure not arising from the operation of a railroad was the cause; (2) At the time of the injury or illness, the employee was present in the work environment as a member of the general public rather than as an employee; or (3) The injury or illness is caused by a motor vehicle accident and occurs on a company parking lot or company access road while the employ ee is commuting to or from work. (c) With respect to railroad employees on or off duty. A railroad is not to report the following injuries to or illnesses of a railroad employee, Worker on Duty - Employee (Class A) or Employee Not On duty (Class B), if any of the following conditions in this paragraph (c) are met: (1) The injury or illness involves signs or symptoms th at surface at work but result solely from a non-work- related event or exposure that occurs outside the work environment; (2) The injury or illness results solely from voluntary participation in a wellness program or in a medical, fitness, or recreational activity such as blood donation, physical examination, flu shot, exercise class, racquetball, or baseball; (3) The injury or illness is solely th e result of an employee eating, drinking, or preparing food or drink for personal consumption. However, if the employee is made ill by ingesting food contaminated by workplace contaminants (such as lead), or gets food poisoning from food supplied by the employer, the case would be considered work-related and reported as either a Wo rker on Duty - Employee (Class A) or Employee Not On duty (Class B) depending on the employees duty status; (4) The injury or illness is solely the result of an employee doing pe rsonal tasks (unrelated to their employment) at the establishment outside of the employee's assigned working hours; 12(5) The injury or illness is solely the result of pe rsonal grooming, self medication for a non-work-related condition, or is intentionally sel f-inflicted (except that for FRA reporting purposes a railroad shall not exclude an accountable or reportable injury or illness that is the result of a suicide or attempted suicide); (6) The illness is the common cold or flu (Note: c ontagious diseases such as tuberculosis, brucellosis, hepatitis A, or plague are considered work-relate d if the employee is infected at work); or (7) The illness is a mental illness. Mental illness will not be considered work-related unless the employee voluntarily provides the employer with an opinion from a physician or other licensed health care professional with appropriate training and experien ce (psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nurse practitioner, etc.) stating that the employee has a mental illness that is work-related. (d) With respect to contractors and volunteers . A railroad is not to report injuries to contractors and volunteers that are listed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph only, an exception listed in paragraphs (b) and (c) refere ncing \"work environment\" is construed to mean for contractors and volunteers only, on property owned, leased, operated over or maintained by the railroad. (e) With respect to rail equipment accident/incidents. A railroad is not to report rail equipment accidents/incidents if the conditions in this paragraph are met. (This exception do es not affect a railroad's oblig ation to maintain records of accidents/incidents as required by \u00a7 225.25 (Form FRA F 6180.97, \"Initial Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Record\")). (1) Cars derailed on industry tracks by non-railr oad employees or non-railroad employee vandalism, providing there is no involvement of railroad employees; and (2) Damage to out of service cars resulting from high water or flooding (e.g ., empties placed on a storage or repair track). This exception does not apply if such cars are placed into a moving consist and as a result of this damage a reportable rail equipment accident results. \u00a7 225.17 Doubtful cases. (a) The reporting officer of a railroad will ordinarily determine the reportability or nonreportability of an accident/incident after examining all evidence available. The FRA, however, cannot delegate authority to decide matters of judgment when facts are in dispute. In all such cases the decision shall be that of the FRA. (b) Even though there may be no witness to an accident/inci dent, if there is evidence indicating that a reportable accident/incident may have occurred, a report of that accident/incident must be made. (c) All accidents/incidents reported as \"claimed but not ad mitted by the railroad\" are given special examination by the FRA, and further inquiry may be ordered. Accident s/incidents accepted as reportable are tabulated and included in the various statistical statements issued by the FR A. The denial of any knowledge or refusal to admit responsibility by the railroad does not exclude those accide nts/incidents from monthly and annual figures. Facts stated by a railroad that tend to refute the claim of an injured person are given consideration, and when the facts seem sufficient to support the railroad's position, th e case is not allocated to the reporting railroad. (d)[Redesignate as \u00a7 225.18(a)] \u00a7 225.18 Alcohol or drug involvement. (a) In preparing a Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Repor t under this part, the railroad shall make such specific inquiry as may be reasonable under the circumstances into the possible involvement of alcohol or drug use or impairment in such accident or incident. If the railr oad comes into possession of any information whatsoever, whether or not confirmed, concerning alleged alcohol or drug use or impairment by an employee who was involved in, or arguably could be said to have been involved in, the accident/incident, the railroad shall report such alleged use or impairment as provided in the current FRA Guide. If the railroad is in possession of such information but does not believe that alcohol or drug impairment was th e primary or contributing cause of the accident/incident, 13then the railroad shall include in the narrative statement of such report a brief explanation of the basis of such determination. (b) For any train accident within the requirement for pos t-accident testing under \u00a7 219.201 of this chapter, the railroad shall append to the Rail Equi pment Accident/Incident Report any re port required by 49 CFR \u00a7 219.209(b) (pertaining to failure to obtain samples for post-accident toxicological testing). (c) For any train or non-train incident, the railroad sha ll provide any available information concerning the possible involvement of alcohol or drug use or impairment in such accident or incident. (d) In providing information required by this paragraph, a railroad shall not disclose any information concerning use of controlled substances determined by the railroad's Medical Review Offi cer to have been consistent with 49 CFR 219.103. \u00a7 225.19 Primary groups of accidents/incidents. (a) For reporting purposes reportable railroad accide nts/incidents are divided into three Grade Crossing; Group II--Rail Equipment; Group III--Death, Injury and Occupational Illness. (b) Group I--Highway-rail grade crossing . Each highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident must be reported to the FRA on Form FRA F 6180.57, regardless of the extent of damages or whether a casualty occurred. In addition, whenever a highway-rail grade crossing accident/incident r esults in damages greater than the current reporting threshold to railroad on-track equipment, signals, track, track structures, or roadbed, that accident/incident shall be reported to the FRA on Form FRA F 6180.54. For reporti ng purposes, damages include labor costs and all other costs to repair or replace in kind damaged on-track equipm ent, signals, track, track structures, or roadbed, but do not include the cost of clearing a wreck. (c) Group II--Rail equipment . Rail equipment accidents/incidents are collis ions, derailments, fires, explosions, acts of God, and other events involving the operation of on-t rack equipment (standing or moving) that result in damages higher than the current reporting threshold (i.e., $6,700 for calendar years 2002 through 2005, $7,700 for calendar year 2006, $8,200 for calendar year 2007, $8,500 for cale ndar year 2008, $8,900 for calendar year 2009, $9,200 for calendar year 2010 and $9,400 for calendar year 2011) to railroad on-track equipment, signals, tracks, track structures, or roadbed, including labor costs and the costs for acquiring new equipment and material. Each rail equipment accident/incident must be reported to the FR A on Form FRA F 6180.54. If the property of more than one railroad is involved in an accident/in cident, the reporting threshold is calcu lated by including the damages suffered by all of the railroads involved. See \u00a7 225.23, Join t Operations. The reporting th reshold will be reviewed periodically, and, if necessary, will be adjusted every year. (d) Group III--Death, injury, or occupational illness . Each death, injury, or occupa tional illness that is a new case and meets the general reporting criteria listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (6) of this section shall be reported to FRA on Form FRA F 6180.55a, \"Railroad Injury and Illn ess Summary (Continuation Sheet)\" if an event or exposure arising from the operation of a railroad is a di scernable cause of the resulting condition or a discernable cause of a significant aggravation to a pre-existing inju ry or illness. The event or exposure arising from the operation of a railroad need only be one of the discernable causes; it need not be the sole or predominant cause. The general injury/illness reporting criteria are as follows: (1) Death to any person; (2) Injury to any person that results in: (i) Medical treatment; (ii) Significant injury diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional even if it does not result in death, medical treatment or loss of consciousness of any person; or 14 (iii) Loss of consciousness; (3) Injury to a railroad employee that results in: (i) A day away from work; (ii) Restricted work activity or job transfer; or (iii) Significant injury diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional even if it does not result in death, medical treatment, loss of consciousness, a day away from work, restricted work activity or job transfer of a railroad employee; (4) Occupational illness of a railroad employee that results in: (i) A day away from work; (ii) Restricted work activity or job transfer; (iii) Loss of consciousness; or (iv) Medical treatment; (5) Significant illness of a railroad employee diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional even if it does not re sult in death, a day away from work, restricted work activity or job transfer, medical treatment, or loss of consciousness; (6) Illness or injury that: (i) Meets the application of any of the following specific case criteria: (A) Needlestick or sharps injury to a railroad employee; (B) Medical removal of a railroad employee; (C) Occupational hearing loss of a railroad employee; (D) Occupational tuberculos is of a railroad employee; (E) Musculoskeletal disorder of a railroad employee if this disorder is reportable under one or more of the general reporting criteria; or (ii) Is a covered data case. (e) The reporting threshold is $6,700 for calendar year s 2002 through 2005, $7,700 for calendar year 2006, $8,200 for calendar year 2007, $8,500 for calendar year 2008, $8,900 for calendar year 2009, $9,200 for calendar year 2010 and $9,400 for calendar year 2011. The procedure for determining the reporting threshold for calendar years 2006 and beyond appears as paragraphs 1- 8 of appendix B to part 225. \u00a7 225.21 Forms.

This cover memorandum shall be signed by the preparer and shall have attached to it a duplicate copy of each establishment's list of monthly reportable injuries and illnesses. The preparer of the monthly lists of reportable injuries and illnesses shall mail or send by facsimile each establishment's list to the establishment in the time frame prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section.); and (13) Date the record was completed. (14) When there are no reportable injuries or occ upational illnesses associated w ith an establishment for that month, the listing shall make reference to this fact. (15) The railroad is permitted not to post information on an occupational injury or illness that is a privacy concern case. (i) Claimed Occupational Illnesses. (1) Each railroad may maintain a Form FRA F 6180.107, \"Alternative Records for Illnesses Claimed to be Work-Related,\" or an alternate railroad-designed record as described in paragraph (j) of this section, in place of Form FRA F 6180.98, \"Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record,\" only for those claimed 20occupational illnesses for which the railroad has not recei ved information sufficient to determine whether the occupational illness is work-related. (2) Each railroad shall enter each illness claimed to be work-related on the appropriate record, as required by paragraph (i)(1) of this section, as early as prac ticable, but no later than seven working days after receiving information or acquiring knowledge that an employee is claiming they have incurred an occupational illness.

(8) Although Form FRA 6180.107, \"Alte rnative Record for Illnesses Claime d to be Work-Related\" (or the alternate railroad-designed form), may not include a ll supporting documentation, such as medical records, the alternative record shall note the custodian of those documents and where the supporting documents are located so that they are readily accessible to FRA upon request. (j) An alternative railroad-designed record may be used in lieu of the Alternative Record for Illnesses Claimed to be Work-Related (Form FRA F 6180.107). Any such alternativ e record shall contain all of the information required on the Alternative Record for Illnesses Claimed to be Work-R elated. Although this information may be displayed in a different order from that on the Alternative Reco rd for Illnesses to be Work-Related, the order of the information shall be consistent from one such record to a nother such record. The order chosen by the railroad shall be consistent for all of the railroad 's reporting establish ments.

The Administrator reserves the right to assess a penalty of up to $100,000 for any viola tion where circumstances warrant. See 49 CFR part 209, appendix A. A failure to comply with \u00a7 225.23 constitu tes a violation of \u00a7 225.11. For purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 225.25 and 225.27 of this part, each of the following constitutes a single act of noncompliance: (1) a missing or incomplete log entry for a particular employee's injury or illness; or (2) a missing or incomplete log record for a particular rail equipment accident or incident. Each day a violation continues is a separate offense. 2 The penalty schedule uses section numbers from 49 CFR part 225. If more than one item is listed as a type of violation of a given section, each item is also designated by a \"penalty code,\" which is u sed to facilitate assessment of civil penalties, and which may or may not corresp ond to any subsection designation(s). For convenience, penalty citations will cite the CFR section and the penalty code, if any.
