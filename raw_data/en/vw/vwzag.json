Prevalence and Incidence of HIV Bulletin September 9, 2013. An HIV/AIDS vaccine candidate being developed by researchers at Oregon Health and Science University appears to have the ability to completely clear an AIDS-causing virus from the body. \"To date, HIV infection has only been cured in a very small number of highly publicized but unusual clinical cases in which HIV-infected individuals were treated with antiviral medicines very early after the onset of infection or [were given] a stem cell transplant to combat cancer. This latest research suggests that certain immune responses elicited by a new vaccine may also have the ability to completely remove HIV from the body,\" according to Louis Picker, associate director of the Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute at OHSU. (See Module 6.)In 2011 the United Nations estimated 34 million people worldwide were living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and about 2.5 million became newly infected with HIV . Progress against the disease o ver the past ten y ears has been unev en. Since 2001 there has been a 50% or greater drop in new infections in twent y-five countries and there w as a 42% drop in new infections in the Caribbean, which is the second most affected region in the world. Unfortunately , over the same period, in the Middle East and North Africa the number of new infections has increased b y more than 35%, and Eastern Europe and Centr al Asia ha ve also seen an increase (UNAIDS , 2012). Worldwide, AIDS-related deaths ha ve decreased b y 24% since 2005, and in 2011 were appro ximately 1.7 million. Howev er, increases in those deaths ha ve occurred in the same regions that ha ve experienced an increase in new HIV infections: the Middle East, North Africa, Eastern Europe, and Centr al Asia (UNAIDS , 2012). In the United States, there are appro ximately 1.2 million people living with HIV . The majorit y of cases are among men, accounting for about 73% of cases. Minorities are disproportionately affected b y HIV , with African Americans accounting for 46% and Hispanics 18% of newly diagnosed HIV or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases in 2008 (UNAIDS , 2009). Through the end of 2010, Florida r anked third in the nation in the number of cumulativ e AIDS cases with 121,161 cases. In 2011 Florida w as second among the states in numbers of new cases of HIV infection diagnosed, and third in the number of AIDS cases. Florida has fiv e large metropolitan areas that ha ve more AIDS cases individually than man y states do as a whole. In 2012, 5,388 cases of HIV infection and 2,775 AIDS cases were reported among adults. Both numbers reflected a small drop o ver those from 2011, which were 5,408 and 3,440 respectiv ely. Women accounted for 22% of the 2012 HIV cases and 29% of the AIDS diagnoses, and the percentage of cases among females has been decreasing o ver the past ten years. The new AIDS cases were 54% black, 24% white, and 21% Hispanic, and these proportions ha ve changed little o ver ten y ears (FDOH, 2012). Hispanics, who mak e up 22% of Florida' s adult population, comprise 23% of the HIV cases and 21% of the AIDS cases. Although blacks are only 14% of Florida' s adult population, they account for 44% of the adult HIV infection cases and 53% of the adult AIDS cases reported in 2012. Black men, and especially black women, are significantly o ver- represented; the HIV case r ate among black women 15 times that among white women (FDOH, 2012).HIV Virus The physical structure of HIV is characterized by a protein shell that surrounds the genetic information and enzymes of the virus; a lipid membrane that circles the protein capsule; and glycoproteins that dot the surface of the virus, which aid in processes such as entry into macrophages and T-helper cells of the host. Illustration provided by 3DScience.com.Since the peak y ear of 1995 there has been a 79% decline in deaths of Florida residents due to HIV . The number has continued to decline since 2007, and in 2012 there were 923 HIV-related deaths. Howev er, HIV is still the sixth leading cause of death for 25 to 44 y ear olds. F or blacks it is the fourth leading cause of death, but in 2010 that fell for the first time since 1988 from number 1 (FDOH, 2012.) Identifying HIV Infection The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) kills or impairs the cells of the immune system and progressiv ely destro ys the body' s abilit y to protect itself . Over time a person with a deficient immune system ( immunodeficiency ) may become vulner able to infections b y disease-causing organisms such as bacteria or viruses. These infections can become life- threatening. The term AIDS is an acron ym for \"acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, \" and it refers to the most adv anced stage of HIV infection. Medical treatment can dela y the onset of AIDS , but HIV infection ev entually results in a syndrome (combination) of symptoms, diseases, and infections. The diagnosis of AIDS requires evidence of HIV infection plus the appear ance of some specific conditions or diseases. Only a licensed medical pro vider can mak e an AIDS diagnosis. HIV Infection in the Body HIV enters the bloodstream and seeks out T -helper lymphocytes, white blood cells essential to the functioning of the immune system. One of the functions of these T -cells is to regulate immune response in the ev ent of attack from disease-causing organisms such as bacteria or viruses. When the virus infects the T -helper lymphocyte, the cell sends signals to other cells, which produce antibodies. This T -helper lymphocyte cell ma y also be called the T4 or the CD4 cell. HIV Entry into T CellThe top panel shows the HIV virion finding and attaching to a T cell. The second and third panels show HIV viruses (dotted with red glycoproteins) attaching to the T cell and depositing the HIV virus particle into it.

A person with untreated HIV infection experiences sev eral stages of infection: Viral transmission Primary HIV infection lasts 1 to 2 weeks as the virus establishes itself in the body . Seroconversion occurs when antibodies to the HIV virus become detectable b y current tests. Asymptomatic HIV infection . At this stage, a person is infectious but looks and feels health y; howev er the virus is activ e and continuing to damage the immune system. Symptomatic HIV infection . Symptoms such as skin r ash, night sweats, mouth ulcers, weight loss, and fungal infections appear .AIDS . The Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention (CDC) define AIDS as an HIV - positiv e person who has a CD4+ T -lymphocyte count of <200 cells/\u00b5L or CD4+ T - lymphocyte percentage of total lymphocytes of <14, or documentation of an \" AIDS- defining condition. \" These stages as sometimes referred to as the \"natur al history\" of disease progression. The natur al history of HIV infection has been altered dr amatically in dev eloped countries because of new medications. In countries where there is no access to these expensiv e medications, or in cases where people do not become a ware of their HIV infection until very late, the disease progresses as described abo ve (WSDOH, 2007). HIV Antibody Tests The first HIV antibody test became a vailable in 1985. Since then, new HIV antibody tests have been dev eloped and appro ved by the F ood and Drug Administr ation (FDA). Currently , these antibody tests in volve a two-step process comprising a screening test and, when the screening test is reactiv e (positiv e), a confirmatory test. Step 1: Screening Test The first test done on a specimen is a screening test called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, or EIA) . This t ype of test screens for the presence of antibodies to HIV in blood, urine, or or al fluid. Screening tests are inexpensiv e and highly accur ate. Most HIV antibody screening tests are con ventional, in that the specimen is collected from the client and sent to a labor atory for testing. If a screening test is negativ e (no antibodies detected), the results can be released to the client. If the screening test is reactiv e (positiv e) at the labor atory, a confirmatory Western Blot test is conducted on the same sample. Rapid tests are also screening tests, but they are conducted at the test site, often with the client present, and negativ e results are a vailable in under an hour . Reactiv e (antibodies detected) results from a r apid test must be confirmed. This is because there is a small chance that an HIV screening test ma y detect proteins related to other autoimmune diseases and react to those proteins with a positiv e result. Step 2: Confirmatory Testing If a rapid test is reactiv e, an additional specimen must be dr awn from the client and sent to the lab for confirmatory W estern Blot testing. The HIV W estern Blot detects antibodies to the individual proteins that mak e up HIV . This test is much more specific, and more costly , than the ELIS A screening test.HIV Rapid Test Kit Contents of the CAPI LLUS HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Test Kit that tests whole blood, serum, or plasma. Source: CD C.Rapid HIV Test The rapid test is an immunoassa y used for screening and it produces quick results, in 20 minutes or less. R apid tests use blood or or al fluid to look for antibodies to HIV . If an immunoassa y (lab test or r apid test) is conducted during the window period (ie, the period after exposure but before the test can find antibodies), the test ma y not find antibodies and ma y give a false-negativ e result. All immunoassa ys that are positiv e need a followup test to confirm the result (CDC, 2013b). Information about FDA - appro ved tests and their use in v arious settings is available through the CDC website. Home HIV Test Kits Currently there are only two home HIV tests: Or aQuick In-home HIV test and the Home Access HIV -1 Test System. If y ou buy y our home test online mak e sure it is FDA -appro ved (CDC, 2013b). The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test provides r apid results in the home. The testing procedure in volves sw abbing the mouth for an or al fluid sample and using a kit to test it. Results are a vailable in 20 minutes. If y ou test positiv e, you will need a follow -up test. The manufacturer pro vides confidential counseling and referr al to followup testing sites. Because the lev el of antibody in or al fluid is lower than it is in blood, or al fluid tests find infection later after exposure than do blood tests. Up to 1 in 12 people ma y test false- negativ e with these tests (CDC, 2013b). The Home HIV Access HIV-1 Test System is a home collection kit, which in volves pricking y our finger to collect a blood sample, sending the sample to a licensed labor atory, then calling in for results a few da ys later . If the test is positiv e, a followup test is performed right a way. This test is anon ymous. The manufacturer pro vides confidential counseling and referr al to treatment. The tests conducted on the sample collected at home find infection later than most lab-based tests offered b y providers (CDC, 2013b). A positiv e test result means y ou are HIV -positiv e and can infect others who come in contact with y our blood, semen, or v aginal fluids. A negativ e result means there are no antibodies to HIV in y our blood at the time of the test. A negativ e test does not mean y ou are HIV negativ e\u2014you ma y be infected but be in the \"window period\"\u2014 a period lasting up to 6 months in which an infected person has no detectable antibodies in their blood.Transmission of HIV HIV is a relativ ely fragile virus that is not spread b y casual contact. HIV is not easy to \"catch\"\u2014it must be acquired. In order for HIV to be tr ansmitted, three conditions must occur: There must be an HIV source . There must be a sufficient dose of virus . There must be access to the bloodstream of another person . One of the predictors of the infectious lev el of an HIV -positiv e person is viral load \u2014how much HIV is present in the bloodstream. Studies show a clear connection between higher viral load in the blood and increased tr ansmissibilit y of HIV . HIV is tr ansmitted through: Unprotected anal, v aginal, and or al intercourse Sharing needles or other injection equipment A mother passing the virus to her bab y either before or during birth An infected woman breastfeeding her infant Accidental needlestick injuries, or infected bodily fluid coming into contact with the broken skin or mucous membr anes of another person (as with healthcare work ers) A transfusion prior to 1986 of HIV -infected blood or blood products In extremely r are cases, HIV can be tr ansmitted b y sharing r azors or toothbrushes, if infected blood from one person w as deposited on the toothbrush or r azor and the blood entered the bloodstream of another person. In settings such as hospital oper ating rooms, other fluids\u2014cerebrospinal fluid, syno vial fluid, pleur al fluid, pericardial fluid, amniotic fluid\u2014ma y be considered infectious if the source is HIV -positiv e. These fluids are gener ally not found outside the hospital setting. Therefore, the most common body fluids considered potentially infectious for HIV are blood, semen, v aginal secretions, and breast milk. HIV tr ansmission ma y occur during pr actices such as tattooing, blood-sharing activities such as \"blood brother \" rituals or an y other t ype of ritualistic ceremonies where blood is exchanged, or when unsteriliz ed equipment contaminated with blood is shared. HIV transmission ma y also occur in occupational settings. Hepatitis Co-InfectionMany people who become infected with HIV from injecting drug use are already infected with hepatitis C (HCV). Some estimate that 40% of HIV -infected people in the United States are also infected with HCV . People who are co-infected with both viruses and ha ve immune system impairment ma y progress faster to serious, chronic, or fatal liv er damage. Most new HCV infections in the United States are among injection drug users. The majorit y of hemophiliacs who receiv ed blood products contaminated with HIV also are infected with HCV. Treating HIV in someone with HCV ma y be complicated because man y of the medicines that are used to treat HIV ma y damage the liv er; howev er, treatment for co-infection is possible in some cases with close ph ysician supervision. People Unaware of Their Positive Status People who are infected with HIV come from all r aces, countries, sexual orientations, genders, and income lev els. Globally , most of the people who are infected with HIV ha ve not been tested and are una ware that they are living with the virus. The CDC estimates that, in 2006, 21% of those in the United States who had HIV were una ware that they were living with the virus. This is a decline from the 25% measured in 2003 and is a positiv e sign because research shows that most individuals who know they are infected with HIV will reduce beha viors that could tr ansmit the virus (CDC, 2010). It is important to note that the great majorit y of people with HIV infection do not tr ansmit HIV to others. The CDC estimates that in 2006 there were 5 tr ansmissions per 100 people living with HIV infection. This means that at least 95% of those living with HIV infection did not tr ansmit the virus to others that y ear. This represents an 89% decline in the estimated rate of tr ansmission since the peak lev el of new infections in the mid-1980s. It is believ ed that the decline is due to effectiv e prev ention efforts and the a vailabilit y of impro ved testing and treatments for HIV (CDC, 2010). Pregnant Women An HIV -infected woman ma y transmit the virus to her bab y during pregnancy , during the birth process, or following pregnancy b y breastfeeding. One of the predictors of how infectious the woman will be to her bab y is her vir al load (how much HIV is present in her bloodstream). W omen with new or recent infections or people in the later stages of AIDS tend to ha ve higher vir al loads and ma y be more infectious.HIV is tr ansmitted from an HIV -infected woman to her bab y in about 25% of pregnancies if interv ention with antiretro viral medications does not occur . The perinatal tr ansmission r ate has dropped dr amatically in the United States due to the widespread use of the drug AZT by HIV -infected pregnant women. When a woman' s health is monitored closely and she receiv es a combination of antiretro viral ther apies during pregnancy , the risk of HIV transmission to the newborn drops below 2%. In some pregnancies, cesarean section (C -section) ma y be recommended to reduce the risk of tr ansmission from mother to bab y. Advice about medications and C -section should be giv en on an individual basis b y a medical pro vider with experience in treating HIV - positiv e pregnant women. Most states, including Florida, require pregnant women to be counseled regarding risks of HIV and be offered v oluntary HIV testing. HIV Infection Control in Healthcare Facilities Universal Precautions w as a system designed to prev ent tr ansmission of bloodborne pathogens in healthcare and other settings. Under Univ ersal Precautions, blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM) of all patients should alw ays be considered potentially infectious for HIV and other pathogens. Standard Precautions is the preferred, newer system because it considers all body fluids ex cept sweat to be potentially infectious. Standard Precautions (and Univ ersal Precautions) in volve the use of protectiv e barriers\u2014 defined in the following section\u2014to reduce the risk of exposure of the emplo yee's skin or mucous membr anes to OPIM. It is also recommended that all healthcare work ers tak e precautions to prev ent injuries caused b y needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments or devices. Both Standard and Univ ersal Precautions apply to blood and OPIM. Personal Protective Equipment Gloves, masks, protectiv e eyewear , and chin-length plastic face shields are examples of personal protective equipment (PPE) . PPE shall be pro vided and worn b y emplo yees in all instances where they will or ma y come into contact with blood or OPIM. This includes but is not limited to dentistry , phlebotom y, or processing of an y bodily fluid specimen, and postmortem (after death) procedures.Traditionally , latex glo ves ha ve been advised for use when dealing with blood or OPIM. Howev er, some people are allergic to latex. In most circumstances, nitrile, vin yl, and other glove alternativ es meet the definition of \"appropriate\" glo ves and ma y be used in place of latex glo ves. Emplo yers are required to pro vide non-latex alternativ es to emplo yees with latex and other sensitivities. R eusable PPE must be cleaned and decontaminated, or laundered, b y the emplo yer. Lab coats and scrubs are gener ally considered to be worn as uniforms or personal clothing. When contamination is reasonably lik ely, protectiv e gowns should be worn. If lab coats or scrubs are worn as PPE, they must be remo ved as soon as pr actical and laundered b y the emplo yer. Hand Hygiene Hand h ygiene (soap- and-water w ashing or use of a w aterless alcohol-based hand rub) must be performed: After remo val of glo ves or other protectiv e equipment. Immediately after hand contact with blood or OPIM. Upon lea ving the work area. It is also strongly recommended that hand h ygiene be performed before and after patient contact and after using restroom facilities. Soap- and-water hand w ashing must be performed whenev er hands are visibly contaminated or there is a reasonable lik elihood of contamination. Proper soap- and-water hand w ashing technique in volves the following: Using soap , warm (almost hot) w ater, and good friction, scrub the top , back, and all sides of the fingers. Lather well and rinse for at least 10 seconds. When rinsing, begin at the fingertips, so that the dirt y water runs down and off the hands from the wrists. It is prefer able to use a pump-t ype of liquid soap instead of bar soap . Dry hands on paper towels. Use the dry paper towels to turn off the faucets (don' t touch them with clean hands). It is advisable to k eep fingernails short, and to wear a minimum of jewelry . Additional information on hand h ygiene can be found in the CDC Guideline for Hand Hy giene in Healthcare Settings, 2002. Sharps DisposalBiohazard Symbol Needles are not to be recapped, purposely bent or brok en, remo ved, or otherwise manipulated b y hand. After they are used, disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp items are to be immediately placed in puncture-resistant, labeled containers for disposal. Phlebotom y needles must not be remo ved from holders unless required b y a medical procedure. The intact phlebotom y needle/holder must be placed directly into an appropriate sharps container .

Tags or Labels Tags or labels must be used to protect emplo yees from exposure to potentially hazardous biological agents. All required tags must ha ve the following: Tags must contain a signal word or symbol and a major message. The signal word shall be BIOHAZARD , or the biological hazard symbol. The major message must indicate the specific hazardous condition or the instruction to be communicated to the emplo yee. The signal word must be readable at a minimum of fiv e feet or such greater distance as w arranted b y the hazard. The tag' s major message must be presented in either pictogr aphs, written text, or both. The signal word and the major message must be understandable to all emplo yees who ma y be exposed to the identified hazard.All emplo yees will be informed as to the meaning of the v arious tags used throughout the workplace and what special precautions are necessary . Personal Activities Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm, and handling contact lenses are prohibited in work areas that carry occupational exposure. F ood and drink must not be stored in refriger ators, freez ers, or cabinets where blood or OPIM are stored, or in other areas. Managing Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure to a bloodborne pathogen is defined as a percutaneous injury (eg, a needlestick or cut with a sharp object) or contact of mucous membr ane or non- intact skin (eg, exposed skin that is chapped, abr aded, or afflicted with dermatitis) with blood, tissue, or OPIM. The CDC states that the risk of infection v aries case b y case. F actors influencing the risk of infection include: whether the exposure w as from a hollow -bore needle or other sharp instrument; w as to non-intact skin or mucous membr anes (eg, ey es, nose, and/or mouth); the amount of blood that w as involved; and the amount of virus present in the source' s blood. Risk of HIV Transmission The risk of HIV infection to a healthcare work er through a needlestick is less than 1%. Appro ximately 1 in 300 exposures through a needle or sharp instrument result in infection. The risks of HIV infection though splashes of blood to the ey es, nose, or mouth is ev en smaller \u2014appro ximately 1 in 1,000. There ha ve been no reports of HIV tr ansmission from blood contact with intact skin. There is a theoretical risk of blood contact to an area of skin that is damaged, or from a large area of skin co vered in blood for a long period of time. Through December 2001, the CDC reports 57 documented cases of occupational HIV transmission to healthcare work ers in the United States, and no confirmed cases since 1999 (CDC, 2011a). Risk of Hep atitis B a nd C Transmission The risk of getting HBV from a needlestick is 22% to 31% if the source person tests positiv e for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). If the source person is HBsAg-positiv e and HBeAg-negativ e there is a 1% to 6% risk of getting HBV unless the person exposed has been v accinated.The risk of getting HCV from a needlestick is 1.8%. The risk of getting HBV or HCV from a blood splash to the ey es, nose, or mouth is believ ed to be v ery small. As of 1999, about 800 healthcare work ers a y ear are reported to be infected with HBV following occupational exposure. There are no exact estimates on how man y healthcare work ers contr act HCV from an occupational exposure, but the risk is considered low . Treatment After a Potential Exposure Follow the protocol of y our emplo yer. As soon as possible, w ash the affected area(s) with soap and w ater. Application of antiseptics should not be a substitute for w ashing. It is recommended that an y potentially contaminated clothing be remo ved as soon as possible. It is also recommended that y ou familiariz e yourself with existing protocols and the location of emergency ey ewash or showers and other stations within y our facilit y. Mucous Membrane Exposure If there is exposure to the ey es, nose, or mouth, flush thoroughly with w ater, saline, or sterile irrigants. The risk of contr acting HIV through this t ype of exposure is estimated to be 0.09%. Sharps Injuries Wash the exposed area with soap and w ater. Do not \"milk\" or squeez e the wound. There is no evidence that shows using antiseptics (eg, h ydrogen pero xide) will reduce the risk of transmission for an y bloodborne pathogens; howev er, the use of antiseptics is not contraindicated. In the ev ent that the wound needs suturing, emergency treatment should be obtained. The risk of contr acting HIV from this t ype of exposure is estimated to be 0.3%. Bite or Scratch Wounds Exposure to saliv a is not considered substantial unless there is visible contamination with blood or the saliv a emanates from a dental procedure. W ash the area with soap and w ater and co ver with a sterile dressing as appropriate. All bites should be ev aluated b y a healthcare professional. Did you know . . . For human bites, the clinical ev aluation must include the possibilit y that both the person bitten and the person who inflicted the bite were exposed to bloodborne pathogens. Exposure to Urine, Vomitus, or FecesExposure to urine, feces, v omitus, or sputum is not considered a potential bloodborne pathogens exposure unless the fluid is visibly contaminated with blood. F ollow y our emplo yer's procedures for these fluids. Reporting the Exposure Follow the protocol of y our emplo yer. After cleansing the exposed area as recommended above, report the exposure to the department or the individual at y our workplace who is responsible for managing exposure. Obtain medical ev aluation as soon as possible. Discuss with a healthcare professional the extent of the exposure, treatment, followup care, personal prev ention measures, and the need for a tetanus shot or other care. Your emplo yer is required to pro vide an appropriate post exposure management referr al at no cost to y ou. In addition, y our emplo yer must pro vide the following information to the evaluating healthcare professional: A description of the job duties the exposed emplo yee was performing when exposed Documentation of the routes of exposure and circumstances under which exposure occurred Results of the source person' s blood testing, if a vailable All medical records that y ou are responsible to maintain, including v accination status, relevant to the appropriate treatment of the emplo yee Remember that HIV and hepatitis infection ma y be notifiable conditions under y our local or state statutes. Clinica l Management of HIV Each HIV -infected patient initially entering into care should ha ve a complete medical history , physical examination, labor atory ev aluation, and counseling. The purpose is to confirm the presence of HIV infection, obtain appropriate baseline historical and labor atory data, ensure patient understanding about HIV infection and its tr ansmission, and initiate care. The initial ev aluation also should include introductory discussion on the benefits of antiretro viral ther apy (AR T) for the patient 's health and to prev ent HIV tr ansmission. Baseline information then is used to define management goals and plans (DHHS , 2013).The CD4+ T -cell count (or CD4 count) serv es as the major clinical indicator of immune function in patients who ha ve HIV infection. It is one of the k ey factors in determining the urgency of antiretro viral ther apy (AR T) initiation and the need for opportunistic infection proph ylaxis. it is also the strongest predictor of subsequent disease progression and surviv al according to clinical trials and cohort studies (DHHS , 2013). Before 1996 there were three medications a vailable to treat HIV . These drugs were used singly and were of limited benefit. R esearchers in 1996 disco vered that combinations of these and newer medications dr amatically reduced the amount of HIV (vir al load) in the bloodstream of a person infected with HIV . Two or three different medications are used in combination. Each one targets a separ ate part of the virus and its replication. The reduction of deaths from AIDS in the United States has been primarily attributed to this combination ther apy, called highly activ e antiretro viral ther apy (HAAR T). Many studies ha ve demonstr ated that better outcomes are achiev ed in HIV -infected outpatients who are cared for b y a clinician with HIV expertise. Appropriate tr aining and experience, as well as ongoing continuing education, are important components for optimal care. Primary care pro viders without HIV experience, such as those who pro vide service in rural or underserv ed areas, should identif y experts in the region who will pro vide consultation when needed (DHHS , 2013). Prevention of HIV Infection Many are seeking to address the HIV epidemic through prev ention progr ams. These efforts include national, international, and local progr ams. A bright spot on the horiz on is the possibilit y of a v accine. Potential Vaccine in the Pipeline As noted in the bulletin at the top of the course, there is growing confidence that in the future a v accine for HIV ma y be able to \"remo ve the HIV virus from the body .\" For a video issued in September 2013 b y Louis Pick er, associate director of the Oregon Health and Science Univ ersity's Vaccine and Gene Ther apy Institute, click here. National HIV/AIDS StrategyA conserv ative estimate for the period 1991 to 2006 finds that in the United States prevention has already a verted more than 350,000 HIV infections. The nation' s HIV prevention efforts are guided b y a single, ambitious str ategy for combating the epidemic: the National HIV/AIDS Str ategy (NHA S). Recent scientific breakthroughs and growing leadership and momentum among some of the hardest hit communities bode well for change (CDC, 2013e). To address the continuing challenges, CDC and its partners are pursuing a High- Impact Prevention approach to reducing new HIV infections. High- Impact Prev ention refers to use of combinations of scientifically pro ven, cost -effectiv e, and scalable interv entions targeted to the right populations in the right geogr aphic areas, and is intended to increase the impact of HIV prev ention efforts\u2014 an essential step in achieving the goals of NHA S (CDC, 2013e). This approach is designed to maximiz e the impact of prev ention efforts for all Americans at risk for HIV infection, including ga y and bisexual men, communities of color , women, injection drug users, tr ansgender women and men, and y outh (CDC, 2013e). Behavior Change for HIV Prevention In instances where national epidemics ha ve been rev ersed, a number of evidence-based studies ha ve shown that broad-based beha vioral changes were centr al to success. A comprehensiv e review of the evidence documents both the efficacy (the impact seen in a clinical trial setting) and the effectiv eness (the impact seen in real- world settings) of behavioral HIV prev ention efforts. Hundreds of r andomiz ed controlled trials ha ve demonstr ated that individual, group , Group , 2008). Studies in low - and middle-income countries among y oung people, sex work ers, and other populations ha ve demonstr ated that prev ention progr ams ha ve to change sexual and drug-use beha viors in resource-limited settings and prev ent HIV tr ansmission. The prevention progr ams ha ve used the following evidence-based approaches to prev ent HIV infection: Progr ams target individual beha vior. Emphasis is on broad-based efforts to alter social norms and address the underlying drivers of the epidemic. In addition, there is effectiv e use of a vailable tools such as: Treatment of sexually tr ansmitted infections (STIs)Medical male circumcision Substitution ther apy for chemical dependence Progr ams that pro vide access to clean injecting equipment (W orking Group , 2008) Using these and other interv entions aimed at beha vioral change, sev eral countries ha ve had dr amatic successes in curbing the spread of HIV within their borders: In Brazil , public health campaigns ha ve encour aged open discussion of HIV , frank public -awareness campaigns, condom promotion, focused beha vioral interv entions, needle ex change, school-based education, prev ention services in prisons, and v oluntary HIV counseling and testing. Especially noteworth y is Br azil's success in rev ersing a serious epidemic among injection drug users. Condom use increased b y almost 50% among sexually activ e adults between 1998 and 2005, and focused beha vioral change prev ention progr ams also maintained HIV prev alence at low lev els among sex work ers. Although the W orld Bank had predicted in 1990 that 1.2 million Br azilians would be infected b y 2000, fewer than 600,000 were living with HIV in 2002. In Australia , broad public -awareness campaigns ha ve focused on beha vioral interv entions among ga y men, syringe ex change progr ams, and v oluntary counseling and testing for HIV . As a result of A ustralia's early , comprehensiv e response, focused largely on beha vior change, annual HIV incidence peak ed in 1985 and declined through the end of the 1990s. Between 1990 and 2000, the annual number of new HIV diagnoses fell b y half . In what is perhaps the world' s best -documented national prev ention success, Uganda moved in the mid-1980s to address the r apid spread of HIV , implementing public - awareness campaigns that encour aged y oung people to dela y initiation of sex and urged sexually activ e adults to reduce the number of sex partners. In the 1990s, the country supplemented these early measures with condom promotion and in vestment in voluntary counseling and testing. From the earliest y ears, communit y-gener ated progr ams pla yed a major role in the country' s AIDS response. The results of these efforts were remarkable. The percentage of y oung people who were sexually activ e fell b y more than half between 1989 and 1995, and Ugandans were significantly less lik ely to ha ve multiple sex partners than people living in neighboring countries. Increases in condom use in the 1990s helped preserv e and acceler ate early prev ention gains. By the late 1990s, infection lev els in capital cit y Kampala had fallen b y two-thirds, and national HIV prevalence had been cut in half .In Thailand the annual incidence of HIV has declined from 143,000 in 1991 to 19,000 in 2003 through the country' s inno vative 100% condom progr am, which promoted the use of condoms in brothels. The go vernment also promoted public education about HIV and fair treatment of those infected with the virus. Had Thailand not brought comprehensiv e HIV prev ention to scale, it would now ha ve 7.7 million HIV infections, rather than the estimated 580,000 residents currently living with HIV . In Senegal , early in vestment in a wareness-r aising, condom promotion, intensiv e prevention services for populations at greatest risk, and engagement of communit y leaders and faith-based organizations, combined with high r ates of medical male circumcision, succeeded in k eeping national HIV prev alence below 1 percent, when neighboring countries experienced significant increases in infections. (W orking Group , 2008) Together , these examples suggest that countries in a wide v ariety of settings ha ve contributed to changes in HIV risk beha viors and, in doing so , have saved countless liv es by averting HIV tr ansmission. Based on the totalit y of epidemiologic evidence, it appears that national implementation of evidence-informed combination HIV prev ention efforts in the 1990s w as associated with a 50% to 90% decline in HIV incidence and prev alence in key populations (W orking Group , 2008). HIV and AIDS in Florida In 1988 Florida became one of the first states with high r ates of HIV infection to enact comprehensiv e legislation to address the AIDS epidemic. The Florida Omnibus AIDS Act stipulates that all licensed healthcare pro viders must tak e a course on HIV/AIDS and licensed healthcare facilities must educate their entire workforce on HIV infection. It also sets standards for testing, confidentialit y, informed consent, reporting requirements, and discrimination (FDOH, 2013). F or more information, click here. Testing, Informed Consent, and Confirmation The Florida Omnibus AIDS Act stipulates that HIV testing must be \"informed, v oluntary , and confidential\" and \"shall be preceded b y an explanation of the right to confidential treatment of information identif ying the subject of the test and the results of the test to the extent pro vided b y law\" (Florida Senate, 2010).Consent does not ha ve to be in writing but an explanation of the test and an indication that consent w as obtained must be recorded in the medical chart. In addition, the person tested must be informed that a positiv e test will be reported to the count y health department with sufficient information to identif y the test subject. \" All reasonable efforts\" must be made to inform the subject of a positiv e test result. In addition, healthcare pro viders are required to confirm positiv e test results through corrobor ating tests before informing the test subject of the result (FDOH, 2013). There are some ex ceptions in Florida la w to the requirement to obtain informed consent prior to conducting a test for HIV : When testing for sexually tr ansmissible diseases is required b y state or feder al law, or by rule including the following situations: When a person is con victed of prostitution or procuring another to commit prostitution When an inmate is released from prison When deemed necessary b y a medical examiner Pregnant women (see Pregnancy below) Exceptions pro vided for blood, plasma, organs, skin, semen, or other human tissue During bona fide medical emergencies when needed to pro vide appropriate care When obtaining informed consent would be detrimental to the patient When performed as part of an autopsy for which consent w as obtained When done at a victim' s request in a prosecution for an y type of sexual battery where a blood sample is tak en from the defendant v oluntarily When mandated b y a court order For epidemiological research When human tissue is collected la wfully without the consent of the donor for corneal removal or enucleation of the ey es When a healthcare work er has had significant exposure to a patient 's blood, and a blood sample is already a vailable that w as giv en voluntarily for other purposes When a hospitaliz ed infant is determined to be abandoned When done on a person already determined to be HIV positiv e and for repeat testing (Florida Senate, 2010)The Florida Omnibus AIDS Act also directs the Florida Department of Health to conduct epidemiologic studies and pro vide testing and patient care services throughout the state. In 2010 there were 405,757 HIV tests performed in Florida b y count y public health departments, with 1.1% of the tests being positiv e (FDOH, 2010a). Confidentiality In Florida all patient medical records are confidential, but to encour age v oluntary testing the Omnibus AIDS Act mak es HIV test results superconfidential . The superconfidentialit y applies only to the results of labor atory reports and does not extend to clinical observ ations regarding symptoms associated with AIDS . Breach of confidentialit y of sexually tr ansmitted disease information is a third-degree felon y. Pregnancy Florida la w requires that during pregnancy ev ery person\u2014including ph ysicians and midwiv es\u2014attending a pregnant woman for conditions relating to pregnancy during the period of gestation and deliv ery must offer the woman tests for sexually tr ansmissible diseases, including HIV . In 2005 the la w was amended to mandate \"opt -out\" testing for pregnant women. Pregnant women are advised that they will be tested for HIV but they have the right to refuse. An y refusal must be obtained in writing and placed in the woman' s medical record (FDOH, 2013). Minors Minors under the age of 18 do not need parental consent for HIV and STD testing. Florida law specifically forbids informing the parents of the minor 's HIV test, results, or treatment, even indirectly (FDOH, 2013). Discrimination The Florida Omnibus AIDS Act prohibits discrimination against those who are HIV -positiv e in emplo yment, housing, public services, health and life insur ance, and public accommodations. Notifiable DiseaseHIV and AIDS are notifiable diseases in Florida. In 1996 Florida began requiring ph ysicians and labor atories to report HIV -positiv e test results to local health authorities with patient identifiers. F ailure to do so can result in a $500 fine and disciplinary action b y their licensing board. Under Department of Health (DOH) rules, pr actitioners must report HIV - positiv e diagnoses of all people to their local count y health department within 2 weeks, and infants born to HIV -positiv e women must be reported the next da y. In 2006 the DOH expanded its reporting requirements to include CD4 and vir al load data (FDOH, 2013). Conclusio n There ha ve been man y well-documented and successful str ategies emplo yed in the United States and throughout the world to curb the dev astating expansion of the AIDS epidemic. Nevertheless, the cost in liv es and lost productivit y remains a staggering problem. In the United States there were 34,188 new HIV infections reported in 2008 and worldwide there are about 2.5 million new infections annually . HIV/AIDS affects people of all ages and ethnic backgrounds in Florida and is the third leading cause of death among women between the ages of 25 and 44, although it is the sixth leading cause of death in men in that age group . In 2010 it w as the fourth leading cause of death among black men and second among black women. As healthcare work ers, we ha ve the abilit y to encour age pr actices that are known to reduce the spread of AIDS , including beha vioral change, prompt treatment of sexually tr ansmitted disease, encour aging use of clean injection drug equipment, routine HIV testing, patient education and counseling, and consistent condom use. The goal is to eliminate new HIV infections entirely in Florida and throughout the United States and the world. W e all pla y a vital role in accomplishing this goal.
