Homeopathy has been proven to be a safe and effective alternative to many prescription drug therapies. Unlike other medicines, homeopathic medicines usually do not have any side effects because they are not chemical based. Homeopathic treatments are not know to cause any physical damage to cells because again, they are not chemical based and therefore cannot alter our body's cellular or other physical elements. Homeopathic medicines act by stimulating the body's own defense mechanism and healing powers. They can be given to children and adults alike without worrying about the dosage and are considered safe for every one. It is important and wonderful to note that homeopathic medicines are gaining popularity and respectability among \"mainstream\" physicians and clinicians. Homeopathic medicines are very effective - in both acute and chronic conditions.Homeopathy in fact, is the only system of medicine which offers curative treatment (not palliative) to a large number of chronic ailments which have been labeled as 'incurable' by other schools of medicine. In acute ailments also, homeopathic remedies, if selected properly, give results faster then any other systems of medicine. Homeopathic medicines are easy to administer.Homeopathic medicines are usually dispensed as sweet sugar pills, which are very easy to take. Due to this reason, children readily agree to take homeopathic remedies. Homeopathic treatment is inexpensive.Homeopathic medicines are usually much cheaper than comparable allopathic and ayurvedic drugs. And also there is little stress on costly diagnostic procedures as homeopaths rely on the symptoms to find the right medicine for a person. The overall cost of homeopathic treatment is small compared to the cost of pharmaceutical remedies. Unfortunately, this treatment may be less in initial cost in western countries as homeopathic treatment is usually not covered by insurance companies. Don't focus on the cost as that's a myopic vision and one has to think of long-term gains. Under proper homeopathic treatment not only the person's immediate complaints improve, but also his/her susceptibility to disease decreases as pestlethere is a general improvement in health. So in the long run, there is better health, less medical consultations and the cumulative cost is very low. Even otherwise, hasn't some wise man said ..\"Health is the real Wealth\"? Homeopathy considers the complaints of a patient in totality. It views a person as a whole, as an integrated entity, and not as a mere collection of body parts. So it treats the person as a whole too. Thus one does not have to visit ten different 'specialists' for his/her ten different body parts. After all our body is more than a collection of parts! So homeopathy saves your time, money and health at the same time. "}
