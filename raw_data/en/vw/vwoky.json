These 'points' are referred to in Chinese Medicine as Acupuncture or Acupressure points, and in [Ayurveda](https://www.ekhartyoga.com/articles/wellbeing/all-about-ayurveda) and yogic healing as Marma points. This isn't to say that the two systems discount each other - many books on marma points also speak of meridians and many books on acupuncture mention chakras. According to both Ayurveda and Chinese Medicine, energy (prana or chi) can stagnate in these points. Both systems have healing practices focused on freeing this energy, whether through acupuncture or acupressure, Ayurvedic massage or even visualisation - like in [Esther's class](https://www.ekhartyoga.com/classes/1764/31-point-relaxation-technique) below. Marma points are energy points in the body used for healing in Ayurveda. They can be compared to acupuncture points in Chinese Medicine.

It is best massaged in a broad and gentle way with the palm of the hand with sesame oil in order to calm the energy of the heart.

Talahridaya Known as the point at the 'heart of the hand', this marma point is found at the center of the palm, and measures \u00bd anguli (half a finger unit) in size. This point is closely linked to [Anahata, the heart chakra](https://www.ekhartyoga.com/classes/1439/feel-the-space-inside-practice-for-the-fourth-chakra), and is thought of as an important point in stimulating circulation throughout the whole body. It links closely to the lungs and respiratory health, and is also a vital marma point to work with regarding communication. Therapists who use their hands can also massage this point before a treatment to enhance the flow of prana to the palms. Massage this point in a strong, circular motion for roughly five minutes. Sesame or almond oil is best used, with essential oils like eucalyptus for opening blocked sinuses or 'energising' the hands. You can also energise the point further by rubbing the palms together until they feel warm. Indrabasti Referring to the God Indra's arrow, this point is found at the center of the calf muscle, and measures approximately \u00bd anguli (half a finger unit). Massaging the calves is important to do daily, as they can very easily become tight, but also because they're one of the most important parts of the body regarding blood flow! They are sometimes referred to as the 'second heart' pumping the venous blood back up to the heart through the veins as they contract and release through movement and exercise. When they're unable to work efficiently, the heart has to work a lot harder. Another reason to get up out of your chair as much as you can!

Phana Meaning 'a serpent's hood' and found at the sides of the nostrils. Each of these two points measures \u00bd anguli (half a finger unit) in size, and is located just outside the base of the nose, where the nostrils open out. These points are said to control the flow of prana through the subtle body, the sense of smell, and the sinuses. To massage these points, use a strong and circular motion for about five minutes simultaneously. When using the index finger for acupressure at this point, it is said to help relieve headache symptoms and sinus congestion, and can be even more effective when coupled with aromatic oils like peppermint, eucalyptus or camphor.
