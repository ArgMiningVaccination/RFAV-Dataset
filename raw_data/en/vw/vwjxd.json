It is a group of diverse medical and health care system, practices, therapies and procedures that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine. Then, 'alternative' medicine means practices and healing techniques that are not generally taught in medical schools, thus alternating with prevailing view. The technique that replaces the allopathic medical care. The word 'complementary' gained popularity in the field conveying the idea that the modalities or techniques could be used to complement and enhance the biomedical treatments. The technique that are used in addition to the conventional medicine. Nursing, however, is a holistic approach at its essence. Likely, it is because nursing is a holistic discipline that nurses have demonstrated great enthusiasm for the techniques and modalities associated with the field of complementary and alternative care as these techniques assist nurses to address the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of care.

TCM view the people as ecosystem in miniature. Diagnosis is based on examination of the person's complexion, tongue, radial pulse and detection of scent in the body, and the treatment is geared towards correcting the imbalance and is given with acupuncture and herbal therapy. a) Traditional Chinese medicine: b) Ayurvedic medicine : Comes from the Sanskrit word ayur (life) and Veda (knowledge). It considers the disease results from the accumulation of toxin in the body and an imbalance of emotions. It prescribes individualized diets, detoxification, cleansing from orifices, meditation and yoga. c) Homeopathic medicine: The treatment is based on the principle, \"Like cures like\". Homeopathic medicine are taking original substance from plants, animals and minerals and highly diluting them. It is believed that body's own healing ability is stimulated by these medicines. They are sold over the counter without prescription. They are so light that they are considered to have very less side effects. d) Naturopathic medicine: It cures the disease by harnessing the body's own natural healing powers. Rejecting synthetic drugs and invasive procedures, it stresses the restorative powers of nature. It takes seriously the motto, \"First, do no harm.\" It relies on natural healing approaches such as herbs, nutrition, and movement and manipulation of the body. A system of healing. Physical illness is attributed to spiritual causes or spirit. The healing involves activities that appease the spirits, rid the individual of impurities and restore them to a healthful, spiritually pure state. The central figure in American Indian medicine is the medicine man (healer, sorcerer, seer, educator and priest), often called as Shaman.

A mixture of natural modalities which may include herbs, air, sunlight and hydrotherapy etc. Aim of naturopathy is to make a person more resilient and to enhance the immune system stronger. The first stage is to prevent the development of further development of disease through a Three basic principles of naturopathy are: The body has a natural drive to maintain the equilibrium, symptoms of disease are viewed and indications that the body is striving to heal it. The root cause of all diseases is the accumulation of waste product and toxin due to lifestyle habits. The body contains the wisdom and power to heal itself, provided serves to enhance its power. It includes: physiotherapy therapeutic exercises acupuncture hydrotherapy nutrition Herbal therapy etc. Meditation: Self directed practice for relaxing the body and calming the mind. State of consciousness in which individual eliminates environmental stimuli from awareness, producing a state of relaxation and stress relief. Meditation evokes a restful state, lowers oxygen consumption, a reduction in respiratory rate and heart rate and subjective reports of reduced anxiety. Various forms of meditation techniques are there, but all of them can be grouped into two which include mindfulness meditation and concentrative meditation. Indications for meditation; Anxiety or tension Chronic bereavement Chronic fatigue syndrome Drug abuse Irritability Hypertension Mild depression Low self esteem or self blame Sleep disorders Psychological disorders Limitations: Some may have hypersensitivity to mediation and require less time than average 15-20mts. Over meditation should be avoided Over meditation in a patient with history of psychosis may precipitate psychoses episode. It augments the effect of certain medications so precautions should be taken to alter the dose of medicines. Relaxation therapy: It is the releasing of physical and mental tensions. Relaxation is the state of generalized decreased cognitive, physiological or behavioral arousal. The process of arousal elongates the muscles, reduces the neural impulses sent to brain and thus decreases the activity of brain as well as other body systems. Goal: the long term goal of relaxation therapy is for the person to continually monitor himself for indicators of tension and to consciously let go and release the tension contained in various parts of the body. Types: Progressive relaxation: one learns to detect the subtle localized sensations of muscle tension in one muscle group and then multiple muscle groups. Reduce mental activity is reduced by focusing on muscle contraction and relaxation. Passive relaxation: involves teaching the individual to relax muscles passively (without contracting them). E.g. deep breathing. Clinical applications of relaxation therapy: lowering heart rate, HR,RR and muscle tension improving well being and reducing symptom distress in combination with imagery, yoga etc known to reduce pain, improve emotional wellbeing and immune functions. Limitations of relaxation therapy: fear of loss of control, feeling like they are floating \"predormescent start\" in beginning of the therapy In advance diseased patients relaxation therapy would not be appropriate. Music therapy: \"Use of musical or rhythmic interventions specifically selected by a music therapist to accomplish the restoration, maintenance, or improvement of social or emotional functioning, mental processing, or physical health of an older individual.\" Many experts suggest that it is the rhythm of the music or the beat that has the calming effect on us although we may not be very conscious about it. Among the first stress-fighting changes that take place when we hear a tune is an increase in deep breathing. The body's production of serotonin also accelerates. The Older Americans Act authorizes grants to states to provide music therapy as a supportive service to enable older persons to attain and maintain well- being. Imagery: Formation of mental concepts, figures and ideas applied therapeutically to decrease anxiety. Mental process and a variety of procedures to encourage changes in attitudes, behavior, or physiologic reactions. It is a process of incorporating the \"power of the mind\" to assist the body to heal, maintain health or relax by way of an inner communication involving all senses, (i.e. visual, touch, smell, sight, sound). It forms a balance between the mind, body and spirit. It uses the conscious mind to create mental images to evoke physical changes in the body, improve sense of well being and enhance self awareness. It is of two types: self directed ( individual creates his own mental images) guided ( practitioner leads the individual through the particular scenario) Technique of guided imagery: A common guided imagery technique begins with a general relaxation process asking the person to slowly close their eyes and focus on their breathing. They are encouraged to relax, clear their mind, and surround themselves in images that are peaceful and calm. Guided imagery may be practiced independently, with a coach or with an audio or videotape. Guided imagery provides an opportunity for people to directly focus on positive thoughts and images, thus allowing a much welcomed \"temporary mental escape\". People often call imagery their \"mini vacation in their mind.\" Clinical applications Control or relief of pain Decrease blood pressure Decrease blood glucose levels (Diabetes) Decrease allergy and respiratory symptoms Decrease the severity of headaches achieve calmness and serenity treatment of chronic conditions as asthma, hypertension and GI disorders Limitations :of guided imagery Least clearly defined intervention, can range from being highly structured to consisting of day dreaming by the individual.

Uses For managers and staff under pressure For people who are generally stressed and overworked For people with mental health problems For people with severe learning difficulties For children and young people who have problems conforming in school and with personal problems at home For people who feel they are problem free but would like the opportunity to explore issues within themselves Biofeedback: It helps the client to control the physiological functions that are most difficult to control e.g. in stroke patients muscle recovery. It involves measuring a person's bodily processes using machinery that translates physiological functions into audio or video signals conveying that information to him in a real time in order to raise his awareness or conscience of the related physiological functions. Parameters measured include HR, BP and oxygen saturation etc. and skin temperature. Types of instrument used to do the measurement are: - EEG - ECG - EMG - Galvanic skin response training Uses in anxiety, migraine, raynaud's syndrome and other GI Laughter therapy: Types of therapy: Humor therapy (books, shows, movies, or stories to encourage spontaneous discussion of the patients own humorous experiences) Clown therapy (clowns perform personal hygiene for others with the use of magic, music, fun, joy) Laughter therapy (client's laughter triggers are identified) How it works: By ensuring the inhalation of more oxygen, it makes people feel better It decreases stress leading to lowered stiffness of muscles - muscle relaxation gives a sense of well being because of release of endorphins and neuropeptides very useful for patients of hypertension it also improves the immunity (increases level of interferon) decreased incidences of cough and cold. Laughter has innumerable other benefits. It proves a potent anti-stress factor, decreases asthmatic attacks, increases stamina, relives arthritic pain, ensures good sleep and elevates mood. Since the serotonin levels go up after laughter, it is an effective antidote for depression too. Positive qualities are cultivated, thereby removing negative emotions as jealousy, fear, guilt and anger. Hypnosis: Florida's \"Hypnosis Law,\" defines hypnosis as hypnotism, mesmerism, posthypnotic suggestion, or any similar act or process which produces or is intended to produce in any person any form of induced sleep or trance in which the susceptibility of the person's mind to suggestion or direction is increased or is intended to be increased, where such a condition is used or intended to be used in the treatment of any human ill, disease, injury, or for any other therapeutic purpose condition is used or intended to be used in the treatment of any human ill, disease, injury, or for any other therapeutic purpose. All hypnosis is self hypnosis. It is important to identify this state, because it is individual is typically more suggestible, or more receptive to new ideas and initiation of new behaviours. According to Erikson, \"in hypnosis the limits of one's usual frame of reference and belief are temporarily altered so that one can be receptive to other patterns of association and modes of mental functioning that are more conducive to problem solving.\" Has been shown to be helpful in the management Contraindicated in patient with cognitive impairment. Hypnosis phases Preparation The first phase typically involves having the subject sit or lie down and getting comfortable. Induction Induction takes the subject from normal awareness to a state of enhanced relaxation. Deepening The deepening phase takes the subject from a very relaxed state into the fully \"hypnotized\" state, where conscious thinking is minimized Awakening The awakening phase is when the subject is taken out of the hypnotic state. If the session is to try to alleviate insomnia, then the subject is encouraged to sleep, otherwise the subject is brought back to a state of awareness with the conscious mind fully reengaged. Length of an induction: Progressive Relaxation (PR) Rapid Induction (RI) With fear removed, most individuals can be deeply hypnotized in 5-10 seconds. Not all people can be hypnotized, but about 10% of people respond exceptionally well. Recent research suggests that highly hypnotizable people have high sensory and perceptual gating abilities that allow them to block some stimuli from awareness (Barnier, Disinhibition leads the subject to performing acts that he would normally consider socially unacceptable or simply would not do. General effects: Focused attention: a state is very similar to other states of extreme concentration, where a person becomes oblivious to his or her surroundings while lost in thought. Suggestibility: Depth of hypnosis: Pupillary reflex An objective sign of hypnosis can be observed by a pupillary reflex test. The subjects' pupils are usually Hypnotherapy is a term to describe the use of hypnosis in a therapeutic context. Cessation of smoking (often in a single session) and The aid of weight loss (body sculpting). Psychologists and psychiatrists use hypnosis predominantly for the treatment of Dissociative disorders, Phobias, Habit change, D\u00e9pression and Applications Post-traumatic syndromes Medicine and dentistry Education Surgery Entertainment Self-hypnosis Hypnosis in which a person hypnotizes himself or herself without the assistance of another person to serve as the hypnotist Most often used to help the self-hypnotist stay on a diet, overcome smoking or some other addiction, or to generally boost the hypnotized person's self- Waking hypnosis Involves altering the behaviour of a subject by suggestion without inducing a trance. Related to the placebo effect, a subject becomes subconsciously convinced that what they are being told is inevitable reality, for example that the air in the room will cause them to swallow. Post hypnotic suggestions: \"a person can act, some time later, on a suggestion seeded during the hypnotic session. Post-hypnotic suggestions can last for a long time. A hypnotherapist told one of his patients, who was also a friend: 'When I touch you on the finger you will immediately be hypnotized.' Fourteen years later, at a dinner party, he touched him deliberately on the finger and his head fell back against the chair.\" Potential dangers \"A hypnotized patient will respond to a suggestion literally. A suggestion that requires conscious interpretation can have undesirable effects.\" BIOLOGICALLY BASED THERPIES: Alternative treatments that use substances found in nature, such as: Botanicals Animal-derived extracts Vitamins Minerals Fatty acids Amino acids Proteins Prebiotics and probiotics Herbalism A traditional medicinal or folk medicine practice based on the use of plants and plant extracts.

Concept: it is based on the same concept as that of the acupuncture but unlike acupuncture, acupressure does not involve the use of needles to stimulate energy points along the meridians, but employs pressure from the fingers and hands for the same purpose. In stimulating the energy points in this way, acupressure aims to remove energy blocks which produce health problems. It is used as an adjunct therapy to either acupuncture or massage. It promotes relaxation and comfort.

Hands-on therapy-especially adjustment of the spine-is central to chiropractic care. Misalignments of the spine can interfere with the flow of energy needed to support health. Focuses on the relationship between the body's structure-mainly the spine-and its functioning. Is based on these key concepts: Body has a powerful self-healing ability Body's structure (primarily that of the spine) and its function are closely related, and this relationship affects health. Therapy aims to normalize this relationship between structure and function and assist the body as it heals. The goal is to increase the range and quality of motion in the area being treated and to aid in restoring health The aim of such treatment is to restore a full range of movement to the joints of the spine, relax and lengthen muscles, tendons and ligaments and relieve pain.

The Rolfing practitioner endeavors to manipulate and stretch the body's fascial tissues to reestablish proper physical alignment of the head, torso, pelvis, legs, and feet and To promote associated mental and emotional balance. Magnetic therapy: Based on the principle that the earth is one big magnet and that all our bodies are surrounded by magnetic waves emanating from the earth and other spatial bodies including the sun and moon. This natural magnetism influences and supports all forms of life.
