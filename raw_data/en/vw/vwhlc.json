FSC LOGOUF HEALTH SHANDS | AWARDS+KUDOS Q&A WITH ED JIMENEZ \u2014 AND BARBARA LONG STRAYHORN! CEO executive assistant reflects on career and retirement UF Health Shands CEO Ed Jimenez is recognizing his long-time executive assistant Barbara Long Strayhorn, who recently retired after 36 years with the organization. Strayhorn worked in the UF College of Business Administration before joining what was then Shands Hospital. She first worked with Wayne Tharp, C.P .A., in planning and finance for the hospital system. She then was executive assistant to the chief operating officer, Jodi Mansfield. She became Jimenez's assistant when he was COO and then when he was appointed CEO. During her tenure, she helped support several executives and five hospital CEOS \u2014 John Ives; Paul Metts; Richard Gaintner, M.D.; Tim Goldfarb praised his partner-in-crime of nine years. \"We've developed the type of bond that transcends work. She knows what I'm thinking before I think it, \" he explains. \"She manages it all. She can keep me in line and I listen to her because she's so insightful. \" She brings in desserts he loves (\" And I don't even have a sweet tooth!\"), but he said her superpower is being a mentor and adviser in her own right. \" Among the hospital's senior team members and executive administrative staff, she's been a leader and has made a tremendous impact. She is also so patient, kind and a great person. We are going to miss her. \" He asked us to turn the questions to her. Barb, what have you enjoyed about your long career here? My big regret is not coming sooner to join the health system! I really like the work and have so many great memories. When I was new, I worked on the hospital bond issuance process for finance and got to work closely with Joyce Smith (retired former CEO executive assistant). I was Jodi's executive assistant for about 20 years and now I've been with Ed for about a decade. It worked out here for me because of how everything changes ... I got to see so much growth and feel part of it. We went from being a single hospital to a multiple hospital system \u2014 and nothing has slowed down! I've liked all our CEOs and executives, and the hardest part was when they left after you' d known them so long. What's kept you with this organization? It's like a family here. That's why it's been so hard for me to leave, even though I'm ready to retire. I spend as much time here as I do at home. It's an exciting place! But I'm ready to spend more time with my husband, Mike, our three kids and our (seven) grandkids.NEWS +NOTES || SEPT/OCT 2019 3HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE CEO? Email Kim Rose, director of strategic communications with UF Health Communications, at roseka@shands.ufl.edu and she'll share your question with Ed Jimenez for an upcoming CEO column.UF HEALTH SHANDS | AWARDS+KUDOS Q&A WITH ED JIMENEZ \u2014 AND BARBARA LONG STRAYHORN! CEO executive assistant reflects on career and retirement Ed is only three days younger than my son. I feel like I know him well \u2014 he's energetic and 'predictably unpredictable' and keeps things interesting. He has lots of ideas, says, \"Make it happen!\" and leaves me to figure things out. I have stayed flexible, I've grown and I've enjoyed it. Tell us something about our executive team that you want to share. They all want the right thing for our patients and employees. They really have people's best interests at heart. They can't make everyone happy but they work hard trying. They always do their best for our staff. Come on, Barb. We really want some intel about Ed ... As for funny things, well ... What's interesting is he comes in the door and we look at each other and nod or shake our heads and often don't need to say much. And he's never in a bad mood! He's good at reading other people. He's naturally energetic. And ... he likes banana pudding. And he likes the brownies I make and bring in. If there are leftovers, he'll take them home, so sometimes I make extra for him. That's more like it. One last question. What's been your biggest inspiration? Going into the hospitals, seeing how hard our doctors and nurses work. The way they work together ... To me, they are all underappreciated! Everyone here, everyone ... they work so hard. And how the CEO and leaders keep everything going. I don't know how they do it. UF Health is growing and it's amazing how it's not slowing down. This place keeps blossoming. We congratulate and thank you, Barb, for being such a special colleague and for all your contributions over the years!

No other Florida hospital has more than seven adult specialties ranked in the nation's top 50, up from six ranked specialties a year ago. And for the fifth year in a row, UF Health Shands is ranked in more adult and pediatric specialties combined than any other hospital in the state \u2014 a total of 12, factoring in the pediatric rankings released in June. UF Health Shands maintained its No. 2 position overall among Florida hospitals at a time of volatility as other health systems' rankings fluctuated in the state, with its highest national rankings coming in urology and nephrology. Both nephrology and urology are ranked 24th in the nation. UF Health's other ranked specialties are geriatrics (37th), diabetes and endocrinology (40th), gastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgery (40th), cancer (42nd) and pulmonology and lung surgery (44th). \"Every day, the entire UF Health Shands team shows its dedication to the highest-quality patient care, \" said David R. Nelson, M.D., senior vice president for health affairs at UF and president of UF Health. \"These rankings are the result of the skill and intense dedication of our caregivers and staff. And our patients benefit from that. \" In addition to the ranked specialties, two others are rated as \"high performing\" \u2014 placing them in the top 10 percent of hospitals reviewed by U.S. News. Those are neurology and neurosurgery and orthopaedics. \"The achievement of once again having nationally ranked medical specialties is a hard-earned and well-deserved accomplishment by our physicians, nurses and staff, \" said Ed Jimenez, UF Health Shands CEO. \"Every year, our accolades are merely a starting UF HEALTH SHANDS | CARE+QUALITY UF HEALTH SHANDS HOSPITAL RANKS AMONG NATION'S BEST Seven medical specialties are recognized BY DOUG BENNETT NEWS +NOTES || SEPT/OCT 2019 9UF HEALTH SHANDS | CARE+QUALITY UF HEALTH SHANDS HOSPITAL RANKS AMONG NATION'S BEST Seven medical specialties are recognized BY DOUG BENNETT Visit https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals to see the full rankings and methodology.point. We are constantly striving to build on our remarkable reputation for patient care, innovation and physician training. That commitment is why so many patients choose UF Health Shands for their treatment. \" UF Health's urology practice achieved a national ranking after improving on its position as a \"high-performing\" program last year. It has achieved a U.S. News national ranking 11 times since 2005. The department has outstanding faculty who have received advanced fellowship training from top medical centers in the United States and Canada, said Li-Ming Su, M.D., a professor of urologic oncology and chair of the UF College of Medicine department of urology. Su also attributes the improved ranking to accomplishments that include expanded general and subspecialty urology services that allow for timely access for patients seeking urologic care, the development of online and printed materials to help patients navigate their care at UF Health, and multidisciplinary care teams for urologic cancers and kidney stone patients. Patients have also benefited from established resident training rotations that ensure continuity of treatment from a consistent care team throughout the preoperative, hospitalization and postoperative phases of their care, Su added. \"These efforts allow us to provide ideal patient-centered care that meets each patient's unique needs and expectations, \" Su said. C. Parker Gibbs, M.D., UF Health Shands chief medical officer, said the rankings validate the commitment to excellence in a wide range of medical specialties.\"Patients come to us with high expectations for care, safety and innovation. Our medical care teams and hospital staff have worked tirelessly to establish and maintain that reputation, \" he said. U.S. News also reviewed treatment of \"common procedures and conditions\" at hospitals nationwide. For the third consecutive year, UF Health has been rated \"high performing\" for five adult procedures. Those are lung cancer surgery, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, colon cancer surgery, heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. \"Everyone at UF Health Shands can be especially proud of the teamwork that brings national distinction to our work in clinical care, education and research, \" said Joseph A. Tyndall, M.D., a professor of emergency medicine and interim dean of the UF College of Medicine. \"Our commitment to patients never wavers. \" UF Health Jacksonville also was recognized as a high-performing hospital in three specialties, including two national rankings. Its ear, nose and throat program is ranked 41st nationally and the nephrology specialty placed 45th. The neurology/neurosurgery program was recognized as high performing. UF Health Jacksonville increased its overall ranking among local and state hospitals from 22nd to 16th in Florida. The \"Best Hospitals\" rankings are based on measures such as survival rates, patient safety and specialized staff across 16 adult medical specialties at nearly 5,000 medical centers. The publication also analyzed survey responses from thousands of physicians as part of the rankings. 10 NEWS +NOTES || SEPT/OCT 2019The Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at UF Health opened its new, world-class clinical care and research building, marking its latest step in the pursuit of providing the nation's most comprehensive and advanced care for Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. The $9 million state-of-the-art building \u2014 which features some of the foremost experts in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, dystonia, Lewy body dementia, ALS and concussions \u2014 was made possible by the generous support of many donors, including the Lauren and Lee Fixel Family Foundation and Tyler's Hope for a Dystonia Cure. The Fixel family built upon their support of the new facility with an additional $20 million gift in January to UF and UF Health that established the Fixel Institute, aimed at advancing research, technological innovation and clinical care for neurological diseases. That gift was matched by UF for a total funding package of $40 million, propelling a $100 million capital campaign to provide new resources for researchers and physician- scientists working to discover revolutionary treatments and pursue cures. The institute will expand upon the interdisciplinary service and science hub specialty care model started in 2011 as the UF Health Center for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration by Michael S. Okun, M.D., chair of the UF College of Medicine department of neurology, and Kelly D. Foote, M.D., UF College of Medicine neurosurgeon Under the groundbreaking hub model, a care team including neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech and swallowing specialists, nutritionists, psychiatrists and social workers all work together under one roof to foster a collaborative partnership among the care team. The facility, which houses the UF Health Neuromedicine - Williston Road practice, significantly expands the previous center's space to 24,700 square feet, 28 exam rooms and seven therapy rooms \u2014 including three clinical trials rooms and a telemedicine room. \"The mission of the Fixel Institute is to make a meaningful difference in the lives of people with complex neurological disorders through interdisciplinary care, innovative research and the teaching of the next generation of practitioners, \" said Foote, co- director of the Fixel Institute.UF HEALTH | CARE+QUALITY UF HEALTH UNVEILS INNOVATIVE NEW FACILITY TO TREAT DEBILITATING NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS Four renowned neuroscientists have committed to join the Fixel Institute BY MICHELLE JAFFEE | PHOTOS BY BERNARD BRZEZINSKI + JESSE JONES UF Health leadership and the Fixel family cut the ribbon on the new Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at UF Health on June +NOTES || SEPT/OCT 2019 11UF HEALTH | CARE+QUALITY UF HEALTH UNVEILS INNOVATIVE NEW FACILITY TO TREAT DEBILITATING NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS Four renowned neuroscientists have committed to join the Fixel Institute BY MICHELLE JAFFEE | PHOTOS BY BERNARD BRZEZINSKI + JESSE JONES The facility incorporates indoor and outdoor rehabilitation, spaces to meditate, a clinical trials center and five laboratory spaces for researchers. \"This new facility is going to not only deliver medicine, but facilitate the healing process, \" said Okun, executive director of the Fixel Institute. \"We often forget that it's not just the medicines and therapies, it's patients and families who need to heal, and we need to have the right team members to help them live happy and meaningful lives despite the presence of neurological disease. \" The Fixel family's gifts have prompted a search to bring the world's top talent to Gainesville along with their related programs. Over the past six months, four renowned neuroscientists from leading research institutions have committed to join the Fixel Institute. The new researchers are: Matthew Farrer, Ph.D., from the University of British Columbia, directs UF's Clinical Genomics Program; Mal\u00fa G. Tansey, Ph.D., from Emory University School of Medicine, who directs UF's Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease, or CTRND; Matthew LaVoie, Ph.D., from Harvard Medical School, who will co-direct the CTRND upon his arrival in 2020; and Stefan Prokop, M.D., from the University of Pennsylvania, who directs UF's Neuromedicine Brain Bank. \"We are thinking broadly and establishing a coordinated approach to improvement of clinical care, drug discovery, as well as gene and neuromodulatory therapy, \" said David R. Nelson, M.D., senior vice president for health affairs at UF and president of UF Health. \"Our outstanding team of experts will continue to push the boundaries in identifying new, game-changing approaches to treating neurologic disease. \"In addition to these faculty hires, the newly created Fixel Scholars Endowment will be used to support fellowship and postdoctoral researchers, all with a primary focus on Parkinson's disease and dystonia. Prokop is the first designated Fixel Scholar, and Farrer, Tansey and LaVoie are the first endowed chairs of the Fixel Institute. \"The generosity of the Fixels will aid in providing superb clinical care, allowing even more patients to participate in clinical research studies and enhancing our collaborative basic research efforts throughout the university, \" said Todd E. Golde, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Evelyn F. and William L. McKnight Brain Institute of UF. \"It will bolster our search of translational therapies to change the lives of millions of patients suffering from neurological diseases and conditions. \" (L) The new, world-class clinical and research building opened to patients on July 1 and (R) Michael S.

They guide faculty and staff in our hospitals and outpatient programs on what to do when faced with a crisis. A crisis could be any situation that requires our teams to adapt regular, day-to- day operations to quickly accommodate patients (mass-casualty accidents or transfers/evacuations) or manage through a challenge or loss of utilities, technology or other infrastructure on any scale. Current plans are posted online for a general mass-casualty response and for specific situations, including severe weather, missing child/infant abduction, active shooter, biological event and bomb threat response. Go to Bridge.UFHealth.org and type \"Emergency Operations\" in the search bar. Or go directly to Bridge.UFHealth.org/ shands-emergency-operations-plan for details.KNOW YOUR ROLE How does your team respond? Many departments stay well-trained and prepared year-round, due to the important responsibilities they have in emergency situations. Y ou may be in a department or program that has an \"all hands on deck\" approach when the hospital \"activates\" and the Incident Command Center is mobilized. Other departments have supportive roles but may rarely experience a sense of urgency during a mobilization. Or, you may be in a role that doesn't directly respond, but you may be asked to sign up for a staffing pool to come in and help another team. Please talk with your supervisor about your unit's role in a large- scale emergency response here at work. Are you considered among \"essential personnel\" who may be required to take a role? Would you be asked to help another team? Please discuss and understand your leaders' expectations for your team. HURRICANE RESPONSE This time of year, we remain focused on our \"severe weather\" readiness in case of serious storms and hurricanes. The Emergency Operations Bridge site includes a \"Resources\" tab with helpful information to help you prepare at home and work. Links include the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, and UF Emergency Management. For example, when we activate for an impending hurricane, the hospital may offer limited child care for essential staff during their shifts. But staff shouldn't bring other family members to shelter in UF Health properties. UF Health can't be responsible for their safety and well-being when we're focused on caring for patients and staff who are working. Staff are asked to have plans for their loved ones and pets' safety during severe weather. The \"Resources\" tab offers Emergency Shelter information by county for North Central Florida, with emergency links and a checklist to help you prepare in advance. We hope you'll visit the Bridge, review resources and stay informed and prepared for whatever comes our way.

This time of year brings a certain buzz around getting a flu shot. It's common to hear things like, \"I got the flu shot and immediately got the flu!\" or \"I didn't feel great after getting my flu shot, so I'll skip it this year. \" But the best way to avoid the flu is by getting a flu shot, and the CDC recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone 6 months old through adulthood. Here, we address a few common concerns and misconceptions that are regularly voiced each flu season and provide helpful insight into what you can do to keep you and your family safe. Getting the flu vaccine will give me the flu. The virus in the flu vaccine is inactive, which means you cannot get the flu from the flu shot. Y ou may experience body aches, which stem from your body's immune response, and show your body is responding to the vaccine. It's also possible you could have caught the flu prior to receiving the flu shot, which means you would not have been protected from the flu at that time. \"Like any vaccination, once you get the vaccine, it takes about two weeks for your immune system to rev up and develop a protective response, \" said Nicole Iovine, M.D., Ph.D., UF Health Shands epidemiologist in chief. \"So, if you're exposed to the flu in that two- week period before you've gotten a protective response, you might actually end up coming down with the flu. \" Do I really need to get the flu vaccine this year if I got it last year? It is very important that you get the flu vaccine every year, even if you got it the year before. Y our body's immune response to a flu vaccine declines over time, meaning yearly vaccination is imperative to protecting yourself from the flu. The flu virus is constantly changing, requiring the vaccination strains to be reviewed and updated in order to keep up with the ever-changing virus. \"The influenza vaccine is constantly changing, \" said Michele N. Lossius, M.D., UF Health Shands chief quality officer. \"While the vaccine is created each year with a best estimate as to what will be the most common viruses that year, it's not always a perfect match. However, each year that you receive the vaccine, you do add on to the protection you already have, so it's important that we keep getting the vaccine each year. \"The side effects from receiving the flu vaccine are not worth it and I would rather risk getting the flu. The flu is highly contagious. When you get the flu, you may become a carrier without knowing it for a few days, meaning you may unknowingly spread the virus and put others at risk. \"Getting the flu vaccine really makes a huge difference, \" Iovine said. \"It can prevent you from getting the flu, make it less severe, keep you out of the hospital and reduce your chance of dying from the flu. \" With the flu, symptoms can include fever, headaches, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, extreme body tiredness and body aches. All of these combined can disrupt your work and personal life for up to two weeks. Flu vaccinations can help reduce or prevent these symptoms, as well as flu-related hospitalizations. I've never had the flu and flu vaccines don't always work, so why should I bother getting vaccinated? Again, getting the flu vaccine really makes a difference. Most importantly, it can keep you out of the hospital and it reduces your chance of getting seriously ill or dying from the flu. \" Any vaccine against the flu is better than no vaccine against the flu, \" said Kathleen Ryan, M.D., UF College of Medicine department of pediatrics chief of infectious diseases. \"Everybody, 6 months and older, every year, regardless of being healthy or not, should get the flu vaccine. \" At UF Health, we're committed to keeping our community healthy and safe. \"It is important for the health care givers here at UF Health and our community to be as healthy as possible. An aspect of health is preventive medicine, and I consider immunizations to be part of the arsenal of prevention, \" Lossius said. We appreciate everyone's help in sharing information \u2014 and reducing any misinformation \u2014 about flu this season. Please visit Flu Central on the Bridge intranet portal to learn more about flu prevention and our vaccination policies for this upcoming flu season. UF HEALTH | CARE+QUALITY STAYING INFORMED AND SAFE DURING FLU SEASON Addressing common concerns and misconceptions about the flu vaccine BY RACHEL RIVERA NEWS +NOTES || SEPT/OCT 2019 15UF HEALTH | CARE+QUALITY STAYING INFORMED AND SAFE DURING FLU SEASON Addressing common concerns and misconceptions about the flu vaccine BY RACHEL RIVERA Healthy habits keep the flu at bay While the best prevention from the flu is getting vaccinated, there are healthy habits to help stop the spread of germs and prevent the flu from catching you! Cover your mouth and nose. When coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. Clean your hands. Regularly washing your hands will help protect you from germs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol- based hand rub. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs are often spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches his or her eyes, nose or mouth. Practice other good health habits. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work or school, especially when someone is ill. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food. *Healthy habits brought to you by the CDC.

Suite updates included new walls, floors, equipment and bathrooms. These new rooms are beautifully appointed, spacious and designed to provide as much or as little intervention as necessary for the birth experience. The second phase of the renovation will create a new high-risk Antepartum Unit. This patient care space will be immediately adjacent to our new labor rooms and will include 12 rooms. These newly refurbished suites will be used for moms receiving a higher level of care for their pregnancy or those who are remaining in the hospital until delivery. Suites on this unit will be refurbished with new paint, wall art, sinks and televisions. This construction is underway with completion anticipated in November. Construction on these units will allow for continuous maternal and fetal assessment, enhancing care for our patients. Randall C. Jenkins, Esq., was named UF Health senior vice president and general counsel, responsible for all legal affairs of our academic health center, including our hospital systems in Gainesville and Jacksonville. He continues oversight of the UF Healthcare Education Insurance Company, or HEIC, and UF Self-Insurance Program, or SIP . \"Randy is exceptionally well-suited to serve in this role and will guide a restructuring of our legal support for our academic health center to create additional efficiencies and ensure clear communication and collaboration within UF Health and across the university, \" said David R.

JENKINS, ESQ., NAMED UF HEALTH SVP/GENERAL COUNSEL Continues oversight of the UF Healthcare Education Insurance Company and UF Self-Insurance Program BY MELANIE FRIDL ROSS NEWS +NOTES || SEPT/OCT 2019 19 UF HEALTH | CARE+QUALITY THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF HEALTH CARE In honor of National PA Week, meet three PAs educated and employed at UF Health BY TYLER FRANCISCHINE | PHOTOS BY JESSE S JONES Only 54 years have passed since the nation's first physician assistant program was started at Duke University, but the career has evolved and expanded to become the fifth fastest-growing profession in the nation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2018. Each day in hospitals, clinics and academic health care settings across the nation and beyond, PAs work on care teams with physicians and nurses to provide trusted, competent patient care. The UF School of Physician Assistant Studies, which has been housed in the George T. Harrell, M.D., Medical Education Building since 2015, provides a systems-based, collaborative approach to medical education, coupling real-life clinical training with use of leading-edge simulation technology, ensuring students graduate with all the skills they need to work in the modern health care field. Each year during Oct. 6-12, we celebrate National PA Week, which recognizes the commitment and talent of physician assistants across the nation. We' d like to introduce three PAs who were trained at the UF School of Physician Assistant Studies in the College of Medicine and remained on campus to provide quality patient care at UF Health Shands hospitals and outpatient practices. Rick Davis, P A-C For Rick Davis, PA '82, 2019 marks 30 years working as a physician assistant at UF Health. He says UF Health is his home, a place where he collaborates with physicians and nurses across disciplines during work days filled with variety. Davis, a PA in the UF College of Medicine division of gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition, works in the UF Health Physicians gastroenterology outpatient practice for GatorCare and GatorAdvantage patients. He says his education at the UF School of Physician Assistant Studies not only provided him with a wide breadth of clinical and research experience during monthlong rotations across 13 or 14 specialties, but also taught him many important lessons he uses each day in his current career. He passes these teachings on to current UF PA students in his role as a clinical preceptor teaching Introduction to Gastroenterology. \"Continue to read and build your knowledge base, \" Davis says. \" Always be aware of what you don't know. Don't be shy to ask questions. We all share a scientific and medical curiosity. And don't forget that each patient has a story. We used to say, 80% of diagnoses are made when taking a patient's history. Try to achieve a balance so that you give your patients enough time to tell you about themselves. \" Anthony Musalo, P A-C Shortly after graduating from the UF School of Physician Assistant Studies, Anthony Musalo, PA '05, joined the UF Health team, where he worked in a multidisciplinary surgical ICU, the UF Health Shands Burn Center and as a member of the cardiac arrest Code Blue Team. Today he works nights in the UF Health Neuromedicine Hospital Neuro ICU Unit 46, and he's found that his career at UF Health centers around the same kind of collaborative teamwork that characterized his education. Musalo says he was driven to embark on a career at UF Health because of the mentorship he received from Thomas J. Gallagher, M.D., former chief of the UF College of Medicine division of critical care medicine. As a PA, Musalo values the close relationships he develops with physicians and other members of the patient care team. \"The landscape of health care is changing. By design, we as physician assistants are part of a team with physicians. That aspect of teamwork is something I value and wanted to be a part of, \" Musalo says. \"There's great respect and camaraderie among all members of a team who work together to provide care. It is only with the contributions of the entire team that we're able to deliver the highest-quality care to our sickest patients. \" 20 NEWS +NOTES || SEPT/OCT 2019 UF HEALTH | CARE+QUALITY THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF HEALTH CARE In honor of National PA Week, meet three PAs educated and employed at UF Health BY TYLER FRANCISCHINE | PHOTOS BY JESSE S JONES Caroli Harkness, P A-C, MP AS Since starting her career as a critical care PA at UF Health in 2010, Caroli Harkness, PA '10, has witnessed immense growth and evolution at every level. At both the newly constructed UF Health Heart & Vascular Hospital and the UF Health Neuromedicine Hospital, Harkness has helped develop new ICUs for patients across surgical critical care specialties. She recalls working on a team that grew from five to 40 advanced practice providers \u2014 encompassing PAs and nurse practitioners. Harkness credits her education at the UF School of Physician Assistant Studies with equipping her with all the skills she needed to work in \"highly specialized, challenging and evolving fields within medicine. \" Harkness says working with Musalo in an ICU during her clinical year of training inspired her to become a critical care PA. This summer, Harkness got the opportunity to serve as a mentor herself to current PA students by instructing them in simulation and procedural lab settings. \" Anthony took me under his wing. Working with him as my mentor was a highlight of my clinical year and led me to my career, \" Harkness says. \"I'm glad I've been able to give back to the UF School of Physician Assistant Studies and pay it forward by teaching during the summer. It was nice to meet the students before their rotations, before they step into a challenging and intimidating ICU. Now, when they enter the ICU, they'll see my familiar face. \" NEWS +NOTES || SEPT/OCT 2019 21 CELEBRATING PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT WEEK PAs are medical professionals who diagnose illness, develop and manage treatment plans, prescribe medication and often serve as a patient's principal health care provider.

UF HEALTH SHANDS | HOSPITALITY+SERVICE SECURITY SPOTLIGHT Get to know the staff who keep us safe BY SARAH STANLEY Durrell Hicks, a UF Health Shands Security officer, remembers being a 19-year-old rookie correctional officer, looking up at a large incarcerated man with several inches and years on him. Hicks doesn't remember what he was asking the man to do, but he does remember being intimidated. \"I was a young guy telling an older guy what to do, \" he said. Hicks had been working at a Piggly Wiggly grocery store and studying criminology when he was offered a position at Lancaster Correctional Institution in Trenton. In the prison system, kindness was looked at as weakness. \"Y ou can come in tough and lighten up, but you can't come in soft and get tougher, \" his boss would say. Hicks learned to be tough, despite being kind by nature. Thirty-one years later, and after a year of retirement, Hicks joined UF Health Shands Security in 2017. He said he loves it and would never return to corrections. Kindness and hospitality are required on the job, and that's a change he's welcomed. He works overnight in the UF Health Shands Cancer Hospital and enjoys interacting with everyone who enters the building. Cory Hunte is the UF Health Shands Security officer who switches off with Hicks to work the day shift. He had a similar role at New Y ork Presbyterian Hospital before joining UF Health Shands. He also prefers his new job here in Gainesville. \"The weather is great, \" Hunte said. \"There's no snow and, generally, the people here are much nicer. \" Hunte has also been here since 2017 and said his transition was seamless. He has always appreciated the patient care environment. 22 NEWS +NOTES || SEPT/OCT 2019 DID YOU KNOW? UF Health Shands Security is a phone call away. Call 352-265-0911 for urgent requests.

That's the highlight of our job. \" The most difficult cases for our Security teams involve patients with medical conditions affecting their behavior or people suffering from addiction. They often have to help staff by restraining patients who have become noncompliant and aggressive. The security team's strength is their training and skill in de-escalating tense situations through careful verbal intervention. Hicks said that in disruptive situations and difficult patient care scenarios, each person is \"a soul that needs to be tended to, like anybody. \"Hunte agrees, describing their team as \"mediators\" who regularly meet hostility and the threat of violence with understanding. He added, \"(Patients who act out are) not really mad at you. They don't know you. They're mad at the situation, and you can't take it personally. \" In stressful situations, Hicks draws inspiration from his pastor. A saying that he reflects on is, \"It doesn't matter how people treat you, but it does matter how you react. \" NEWS +NOTES || SEPT/OCT 2019 23 DID YOU KNOW?

In 2016, UF Health Shands launched the Pharmacy Technician Training Program for entry- level candidates. Since then, the training program has been a huge success with a 100% passing rate on the Registered Pharmacy Technician exam. Candidates have completed the program to find more than a job and a learning experience. Thirty-five UF Health staff members have found a new career path to launch them forward in health care. Martina Holder, Pharm.D., BCPS, education coordinator of UF Health Shands Pharmacy Services and the pharmacy residency program director, has seen the transformation in her students' lives through this opportunity. \"I am amazed that through the development of this program we created a technician career ladder, so not only are we giving people the opportunity within the pharmacy department to become pharmacy technicians, \" Holder said, \"we are also giving them the opportunity for further growth opportunities. \" A pharmacy technician's main responsibilities are filling prescriptions, counting tablets and measuring medications, updating patient profiles, managing inventory, compounding or mixing medications and providing customer service. This training program provides 165 hours of didactic self-study and practical training over 10 weeks in all these areas in preparation for a qualifying exam. 24 NEWS +NOTES || SEPT/OCT 2019 UF HEALTH SHANDS | BENEFITS+TRAINING PROMISING GROWTH FOR PHARMACY TECHS Finding a new career here at UF Health BY EMILY DUNSON UF HEALTH SHANDS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL | CARE+QUALITY SCHATZ APPOINTED INTERIM CHAIR OF PEDIATRICS Desmond Schatz, M.D., has been appointed interim chair of the UF College of Medicine department of pediatrics and physician-in-chief of UF Health Shands Children's Hospital.

Tyndall, M.D., M.P.H., interim dean of the UF College of Medicine. \"He will guide the department of pediatrics until a national search can be convened to appoint a new leader.\" Schatz assumed the role June 20, as Scott Rivkees, M.D., began his appointment as state surgeon general and secretary of the Florida Department of Health. Rivkees, a professor of pediatrics, has led the department to significant growth across its clinical, education and research missions, and will continue to oversee his federally funded research projects at UF. It prepares candidates to function as competent pharmacy technicians under the supervision of a pharmacist. As each candidate has diverse and unique interests and skills, they can become proficient in a specialty area for which there is a departmental need or an expressed desire by the candidate. \"We all have 'developing self and others' on our job descriptions (as UF Health Shands employees), and that really speaks to what these practicing pharmacists and technicians are doing, \" Holder said. \"They are developing themselves to learn how to be a teacher, but they are also developing our tech trainees through this experience. \" According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of pharmacy technicians is projected to grow by 12% from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations. In parallel with this growth, the training program prepares candidates for an approved qualifying exam and makes them eligible to register as a pharmacy technician in Florida. In addition, once the pharmacy technician registration is received from the Board of Pharmacy, trainees will be eligible for promotion to a Level 1 pharmacy technician position, as well as the opportunity for future promotions. \"Here at UF Health, as we add geography, new sites, new beds and more, the need for trained pharmacy experts is growing, \" said Diana Richardson, UF Health Shands vice president of operations. \"It's a necessary role to deliver and prepare medications for patients, whether it's in the outpatient or inpatient setting, and we cannot do it without these individuals. \" UF Health is committed to quality patient care, which means a commitment to personal and professional development for all employees. When the candidates successfully complete the program, they are eligible for tuition reimbursement. \"The Pharmacy department's solution to develop our own in-house pipeline for pharmacy techs has been so positive, and it's great to see the popularity of the program each time we offer enrollment opportunities, \" said Gayla Beach, UF Health Shands Human Resources associate vice president. The program leaders look forward to more interest. Stay tuned for announcements about the application process and dates for the next training program.
