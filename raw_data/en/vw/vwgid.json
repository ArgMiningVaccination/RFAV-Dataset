The Liver Detox Support pills contain artichoke which increases bile flow and can cause gallstones to move through the bile duct. There is a risk that the increased bile flow will cause a gallstone to lodge in the duct, and partially or fully block the duct which causes acute pain and inflammation (attack). Since a gallbladder attack can be a medical emergency, I don't recommend taking herbs for gallbladder disease without working with a trained practitioner under the supervision of their primary care provider. If gallstones are not an issue, then this product will help decrease inflammation and increase bile flow. Again, if gallstones are an issue, it would be best to start by addressing the diet and to work with a naturopath or other trained complementary health care provider who will take a detailed history and recommend products and diet recommendations specific to their health needs. -Dr. Lepore *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
