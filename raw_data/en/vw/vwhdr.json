When Sir Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibiotic, penicillin, in 1942, he forewarned that if we misuse, overuse or abuse this miracle drug, bacteria would begin to mutate and become stronger. Today, if we continue to prescribe or take antibiotics \"just in case,\" it is projected that superbugs could kill 10 million people by 2050 - more than cancer and auto accidents combined. Travel with Dr. Goff to South America, Vietnam, Africa and Columbus, Ohio where she identifies real-life cases of death caused by antibiotic resistance. Learn how superbugs are spawned through antibiotics that kill susceptible bacteria, yet leave behind mutants that multiply and spread rapidly. 33% of antibiotics are prescribed in error. 30% are prescribed unnecessarily or \"just in case.\" Physicians, caregivers, pharmacists and laypersons alike will hear real-life scenarios on how they can become \"antibiotic stewards\" and be a part of the solution to help stop a superbug epidemic in the future.Presented by: Debra A.

Poor oral health can lead to many diseases including cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, stroke and heart disease. Infective endocarditis is a bacterial infection on the lining of the heart, typically the heart valve. This infection causes a growth on the valve which makes it impossible for the heart to function properly. Join Dr. King as she explains how infective endocarditis is caused primarily by poor oral health, specifically gum disease, resulting in 40,000 - 100,000 of cases every year. Learn how bacteria attached to platelets act as a Trojan Horse to cause this serious heart disease. Explore with Dr. King how researching the molecules of Streptococcus oralis could be a key to solving the puzzle of how to treat infective endocarditis. Presented by: Samantha J.

King, PhD Samantha King, PhD, is a Principal Investigator in the Center for Microbial Pathogenesis at Nationwide Children's Hospital and an Associate Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. Dr. King's research program focuses on a category of bacteria called alpha-hemolytic streptococci and diseases that they cause. Dr. King's laboratory studies how alpha-hemolytic streptococci modify and interact with host cell surface molecules (glycans), and how these interactions contribute to pathogenicity. Two major avenues of her work include: 1) defining how these bacteria can release carbohydrates from host glycans and utilize these free carbohydrates for growth, and 2) how interactions with host glycans can mediate bacterial binding to host surfaces.Back to speaker topicsMore About Samantha J.

In 1885, Louis Pasteur used a newly developed vaccine to immunize a little boy who was bitten by a rabid dog. At the time, rabies was a death sentence. Whereas Pasteur types of vaccines have protected humanity from viral infections for well over a century, viruses have been studying our immune system for millions and millions of years, and some do not respond to vaccination. Join Dr. Niewiesk as he presents how these invaders are getting around our immune system. Hear the scientific differences between measles vaccines that protect us long-term, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection that only confers short-term protection. Discover how researchers are using this knowledge to develop a long-term vaccine for RSV.Presented by: Stefan Niewiesk, DVM, PhD, DECLAM Professor and Chair Department of Veterinary Biosciences College of Veterinary MedicineThe Ohio State University Watch Stefan's Talk About Discovery Talks Discovery Talks is an outreach program at The Ohio State University designed to educate the community about the impact of microbes and infectious diseases on people and ecosystems around the globe. A leading cause of death and a major threat to our food supply and natural resources, infectious diseases pose a growing threat to the world, and Ohio State has made their prevention, detection and management a priority.

Though there are 50 million viruses in a mouthful of sea water, 90% of these viral communities remained nameless until recently. Travel around the world's oceans with Dr. Sullivan on the research vessel Tara as he and more than 200 international scientists set sail to catalogue viruses globally. This scientific group seeks to understand how viruses and other organisms affect the oceans and cli - mate change. Hear Dr. Sullivan extend these lessons from the oceans to better understand virus-host interactions in natural communities. Explore how a virus hidden inside a pathogen can adjust its toxicity to cause a pandemic. Learn how viruses can sink through the oceans and bury carbon that is likely helping to keep our planet cooler. Discover how studying ocean viruses provides a roadmap to better understand viral communities in the soil, air and human body.Presented by: Matthew B.

Epidemics caused by Ebola, SARS, MRSA and most recently the Zika virus have been in the forefront of media headlines. Private and public funding is streamlined to drug developers to \"find the cure.\" These cures are typically developed based on earlier findings by research scientists who discover for discovery's sake. Join Dr. Turner as she explains how we may be looking at the cure for tuberculosis and other infections the wrong way. Learn how current treatment for tuberculous involves a drug cocktail with major side effects resulting many times in recurrence, and even more, resistance to antibiotics. Explore how scientists are using a new approach that may result in reducing a 6-9-month treatment of tuberculous to 6 weeks.Presented by: Joanne Turner, PhD ProfessorMicrobial Infection & Immunity The Ohio State University Watch Joanne's Talk About Discovery Talks Discovery Talks is an outreach program at The Ohio State University designed to educate the community about the impact of microbes and infectious diseases on people and ecosystems around the globe.

Studies include investigating how immune-suppressive cytokine production modifies long-term control of M. tuberculosis infection, vaccine efficacy and drug treatments. Additionally, Dr. Turner studies the changes that take place in the immune system during the natural aging process and the influence that this has on the capacity of the host to control infectious diseases.
