On the global front, MOH faced the resurgence of infectious diseases such the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). MERS was first reported to cause severe pneumonia in humans in September 2012. In 2014, the world saw a total of 945 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS, including 349 deaths. Most cases were reported in Saudi Arabia. At the same time, an outbreak of EVD affected Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in West Africa. This was the biggest outbreak of EVD ever recorded and the first time the virus spread among urban populations. The outbreak has continued into 2015. As at 24 June 2015, 27,479 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported globally with 11,222 deaths. The lessons from these incidents underscore the importance of maintaining vigilance and preparedness for new and emerging infectious diseases. On the home front, dengue fever (DF)/dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) continued to pose a burden of communicable diseases in our community. Following the record dengue epidemic seen in 2013, the number of DF/DHF cases remained high in 2014, with 18,326 laboratory cases of DF/DHF reported. There were six deaths due to dengue in 2014. The main circulating serotype was DENV-1. Mosquito larval source reduction remains the mainstay of vector-borne disease control and this approach requires active community participation. Public health education continues to be coordinated by the National Environmental Agency (NEA) with support by MOH. The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) among residents and long staying non-residents continued to decline from 37.6 in 2013 to 36.9 in 2014. Measures to strengthen case detection and treatment have been rolled out progressively to enhance the Singapore TB Elimination Programme (STEP) following a review in 2012, which addressed key challenges for TB control: delayed diagnosis of infectious TB cases and the non-compliance with the complete treatment regimen until a full cure. The number of newly reported HIV cases in 2014 (456) was similar to the number reported in 2013 (454). MOH has added three clinics to the list of private clinics offering anonymous testing services, to enhance the accessibility to voluntary testing. Moving forward, MOH will be reviewing strategies to further encourage early voluntary testing. This is necessary as a substantial proportion of cases continue to be diagnosed with late stage disease. This report is published from the compilation of epidemiological information on communicable diseases collated through our close working relationship with the community of health professionals and our partner agencies. We thank all healthcare professionals and our partner agencies for their unwavering support and dedication in combating and minimising the threats of communicable diseases, for the common goal of safeguarding public health. I hope that you will find this report useful. I look forward to your continued support and cooperation in the national surveillance of communicable diseases. A/PROF BENJAMIN ONGDIRECTOR OF MEDICAL SERVICESMINISTRY OF HEALTH, SINGAPORE 6 76 7In 2014, Singapore had an estimated population of 5.47 million, with a resident population of 3.87 million. The female-to-male ratio in the resident population was 1.03. The ethnic distribution in the resident population showed a Chinese majority of 74.3%, followed by Malays and Indians at 13.3% and 9.1% respectively. The aging pattern of Singapore's population is shown in the age pyramid below. The proportion of residents aged 15 to 64 years increased from 71.0% in 1990 to 73.1% in 2014 while the proportion of children under 15 years has steadily declined from 23.0% in 1990 to 15.7% in 2014. Currently 11.2% of Singapore residents are aged 65 years and above, compared to 6.0% in 1990.

However, notifications of cases seeking medical treatment in Singapore for infectious diseases have been excluded from selected morbidity statistics which reflect the status in Singapore citizens, Singapore permanent residents and foreigners residing in Singapore (i.e. non-citizens who have not been granted permanent residence status). AIR-/DROPLET-BORNE DISEASES In 2014, hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) continued to contribute significantly to the burden of air-/droplet-borne diseases. There were 22,171 notified cases (405.3 per 100,000 population) of HFMD, a decrease of 30.2% from 31,741 cases in 2013. A total of 142 measles cases were notified in 2014 compared to 46 cases in 2013. A total of 17 rubella cases were notified compared with 48 cases in 2013. There was no reported termination of pregnancy resulting from acquired maternal rubella infection. There were 478 notified cases of mumps (8.7 per 100,000 population) in 2014 compared to 495 cases (9.3 per 100,000 population) in 2013. VECTOR-BORNE/ZOONOTIC DISEASES In 2014, dengue fever (DF)/dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) contributed significantly to the burden of vector borne diseases. A total of 18,326 dengue fever (DF)/dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases were notified compared with 22,170 cases in Year 2013. The majority of the cases were infected locally. DEN-1 was the predominant circulating strain in 2014. A total of 182 chikungunya fever cases were notified in 2014 compared with 1,059 cases in Year 2013. In addition, there were 62 notified cases of malaria in 2014, all were acquired overseas. All vector-borne diseases were thoroughly investigated on notification, followed by a multi-agency response. Intensive vector control remained the main strategy for the prevention and control of vector-borne diseases.FOOD-/WATER-BORNE DISEASES There were 73 cases of Hepatitis A notified in 2014, a decrease of 17.0% compared to 88 cases in 2013. The incidence of enteric fevers (typhoid and paratyphoid fevers) showed a 28.0% decrease from 107 cases in 2013 to 77 cases in 2014. Campylobacteriosis and non-typhoidal salmonellosis contributed significantly to foodborne disease morbidity. There were 435 cases of campylobacteriosis and 1,920 cases of salmonellosis reported in 2014. Although most cases were sporadic in nature, strict measures were implemented to ensure that a high standard of food and environmental hygiene was maintained. These measures were carried out by the Ministry of Health (MOH), in close collaboration with the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA). ENVIRONMENT-RELATED DISEASES In 2014, 37 cases of legionellosis and 34 cases of melioidosis were notified. Two patients died of melioidosis-related conditions giving an overall case fatality rate of 6.3%, much lower than that reported in 2013 (23.5%). HIV/AIDS, STIs, TUBERCULOSIS & LEPROSY The number of HIV/AIDS infection notifications in Year 2014 was 456 compared with 454 in 2013. The three main sexually transmitted infections (STIs) notified in Singapore in 2014 were chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis. The overall incidence rate for STIs was 186 cases per 100,000 population. Chlamydia was the most common STI with an incidence rate of 44.8 cases per 100,000 population. In 2014, a total of 2,018 new cases of TB were reported (1,454 residents and 564 long staying foreigners), a decrease of 0.5% from 2013. In 2014, a total of 6 cases of leprosy were notified (1 resident and 5 non-residents). The resident incidence rate was 0.03 per 100,000 population. The annual statistics on infectious disease notifications and deaths are presented in the following table. Detailed updates on individual diseases are provided in the respective chapters of the report.OVERVIEW OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES SITUATION8 9+Source: Registry of Births & Deaths *Rates per 100,000 population, based on estimated mid-year total population, 2014 (Source: Singapore Department of Statistics) ** Refers to Singaporeans/PR cases *** Refers to Singaporeans/PR cases & long staying foreignersDiseasesNo. of notified casesNo. of Deaths+Morbidity rate*Mortality rate* Air-/Droplet-Borne Diseases Foot and Mouth Disease 22,171 0 405.3 0.0 Measles 142 0 2.6 0.0 Meningococcal Infection 9 0 0.2 0.0 Mumps 478 0 8.7 0.0 Rubella 17 0 0.3 0.0 Vector-Borne/Zoonotic Diseases Chikungunya Fever 182 0 3.3 0.0 Dengue Fever/Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever 18,326 6 335.2 0.1 Malaria 62 1 1.1 0.0 Food-/Water-Borne Diseases Campylobacteriosis 435 0 8.0 0.0 Cholera 2 0 0.0 0.0 Hepatitis A 73 0 1.3 0.0 Hepatitis E 68 0 1.2 0.0 Paratyphoid 19 0 0.3 0.0 Salmonellosis 1,920 0 35.1 0.0 Typhoid 58 0 1.1 0.0 Blood-Borne Diseases Hepatitis B 48 0 0.9 0.0 Hepatitis C 5 0 0.1 0.0 Environmental-Related Diseases Legionellosis 37 0 0.7 0.0 Melioidosis 34 1 0.6 0.0 HIV/AIDS, STIs, TB 186.2 0.0 Tuberculosis*** 2,018 55 36.9 1.4 Leprosy 6 0 0.0 0.0Infectious disease notifications and deaths in 201410 11In the 1960s and 1970s, measles epidemics occurred in Singapore every one to three years and most children developed measles after one year of age. Measles vaccination using the monovalent vaccine was first introduced to the National Childhood Immunisation Programme (NCIP) in October 1976 and administered to pre-school children at 12-24 months of age. The initial vaccination acceptance rate was poor as there were cultural beliefs that measles is an innocuous and inevitable childhood infection. To correct this belief and promote the benefits of vaccination, extensive health education programmes were conducted in Singapore between 1977 and 1979. Despite efforts in health education and routine checks of measles vaccination certificates for pre-schools and primary schools, vaccination coverage rate remained low 1. In October 1980, measles became a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases Act (IDA). Cyclical epidemics continued to occur and the highest incidence was recorded in 1984 involving 2,417 cases (including seven deaths). Measles vaccination was made mandatory by law in August 1985 for all children aged 12-24 months with an aim to interrupt measles transmission by achieving vaccination coverage of at least 95% for each birth cohort by the age of two years 2. The monovalent vaccine was substituted by the trivalent measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in January 1990. Following a sharp rise in measles incidence in 1997, a 'catch-up' vaccination campaign was implemented from July to November 1997, targeting children aged 12-18 years regardless of their measles vaccination status or past history of measles infection. Subsequently, a second dose of MMR vaccine was introduced into the NCIP in January 1998 for primary school children aged 11-12 years. The second dose of MMR vaccine was brought forward from 11-12 years to 6-7 years in 2008. In 2011, another change was made to the schedule, bringing the first dose to 12 months and the second dose to 15-18 months. Changes to the measles vaccination schedule over the years are summarised in Table 1.SPECIAL FEATURE SINGAPORE'S PROGRESS TOWARDS MEASLES ELIMINATION Table 1 Changes to measles vaccination schedule, 1976 - 2011 Year Changes made Schedule 1976 Introduction of monovalent measles vaccine Dose 1: 12-24 months 1990 Monovalent measles vaccine replaced with MMR vaccine Dose 1: 12-24 months 1998 Introduction of second dose of MMR vaccineDose 1: 12-24 monthsDose 2: 11-12 years 2008 Change in the timing of second dose of MMR vaccineDose 1: 12-24 monthsDose 2: 6-7 years 2011 (Dec)Changes in timing of first and second doses of MMR vaccineDose 1: 12 monthsDose 2: 15-18 months10 11Between 1976 and 1985, cyclical epidemics continued to occur and the highest incidence of measles cases was recorded in 1984 (88.5 per 100,000 population). Since the implementation of compulsory measles vaccination in 1985, the reported measles incidence remained low until surges in measles incidence were observed in 1992, 1993, and 1997 (18.7 - 37.2 per 100,000 population) 3. Following a 'catch-up' vaccination campaign in 1997 targeting children aged 12 - 18 years and the introduction of two-dose MMR vaccination schedule in 1998, the measles incidence declined to 2.9 per 100,000 population in 1998 and fluctuated between 0.3 and 3.5 per 100,000 population for the next decade. The vaccination coverage for children aged 2 years old steadily increased from 92.0% in 1998 to 95.3% in 2004 and has been maintained at 95% or above thereafter. In recent years, the reported measles incidence per 100,000 population increased from 0.3 in 2009 to 0.9 and 2.6 in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Analysis of age-specific incidence showed that the increase was highest in infants aged less than one year, followed by young children aged 1-4 years. Further breakdown of cases in the 1-4 year age group shows that two-thirds were in the 12 - 24 months age-group; majority of whom were yet to be vaccinated. To address the rising trend of measles among unvaccinated young children, the timing for both MMR doses was brought forward with effect from December 2011, with the first dose to be given at 12 months of age (from 12 - 24 months) and the second dose at 15 - 18 months of age (from 6 - 7 years). In 2012 and 2013, the measles incidence decreased to 0.7 and 0.9 per 100,000 population (Fig. 1).

The highest incidence rate was observed in infants under one year of age, followed by young children aged one to four years (Table 2 and 3). Among the three major ethnic groups, Malays had the highest incidence rate, followed by Chinese and Indian (Table 4 and 5).

During this period, 86% of the cases were sporadic and the rest were involved in small clusters. The source of infection and the method of confirmation based on WHO classification are shown in Table 6. Out of 132 measles cases, 95 were classified as locally acquired and 37 were imported. The majority of imported cases originated from the Philippines, followed by Indonesia (Table 7). From January to November 2014, there were eight small clusters involving two to four cases (Table 8). The largest cluster involved four students of a Singapore-based foreign education institution. The onset of rashes occurred between 1 and 20 April 2014, none of the cases were known to each other. Three cases were serologically confirmed for measles IgM while the fourth case was negative. One case was identified to have H1 genotype. Among the remaining seven clusters; four were due to B3 genotype, one was due to H1 genotype, another was due to D9 genotype, and the last cluster was undetermined. #Source - whether the source of virus was imported, import-related, endemic or unknown, as extracted from description provided by WHO in the WHO monthly summary excel spreadsheet. Imported: A case exposed outside the region or country during the 7-21 days prior onset to rash and supported by epidemiological or virological evidence, or both.Import-related: A locally acquired infection occurring as part of a chain of transmission originating from an imported case as supported by epidemiological or virological evidence, or both. Endemic: Laboratory or epidemiologically-linked confirmed cases of measles resulting from endemic transmission of measles virus. Unknown: A confirmed case for which an epidemiologically or virological link to importation or to endemic transmission cannot be established after a thorough investigation. * Persons who had both respiratory and blood samples collected2009(%) 2010(%) 2011(%) 2012(%) 2013(%) Singapore Resident Chinese 0.2 0.8 1.9 0.5 0.6 Malay 0.4 1.2 6.3 1.4 1 Indian 0 1.4 3.7 0 0.6 Others 0 3.2 8.8 2.4 3.2 Foreigner 0 0.7 1.8 0.8 0.6 Total 0.3 1.0 2.9 0.7 0.9 Source#Confirmed measles cases Laboratory confirmedEpidemiological LinkageTotal Respiratory specimen Blood specimen Endemic 20 (2*) 13 0 31 Unknown 41 (7*) 30 0 64 Imported 22 (1*) 16 0 37 Imported-Related 0 0 0 0 Total 83 (10*) 59 0 13214 15Table 7 Distribution of measles cases by genotype, January - November 2014 Epidemiological and laboratory surveillance systems for measles Quality of epidemiological surveillance system for measlesTable 8 Measles clusters in Singapore, January - November 2014GenotypesClassification Local Imported Total Country of importation (No. of persons ) B3 18 14 32 Philippines (14) D4 0 0 0 D8 14 1 15 Indonesia (1) D9 17 3 20Philippines (1) Indonesia (1) Malaysia (1) G3 1 1 2 Indonesia(1) H1 5 0 5 Genotyping not performed40 18 58Philippines (10) Indonesia (5) Australia (1) China(1) India(1) Total 95 37 132 Size of clusters (based on number of cases)Total no. of clustersNo. of cases in clusters (%)No. of sporadic cases (%)Total no. of cases (%) 2 3 - 5 7 1 8 18 (13.6) 114 (86.4) 132 (100) The Communicable Diseases Division, Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for the surveillance and investigation of measles cases. A clinical measles case, based on WHO criteria, is defined as a person with fever, maculopapular rash, and one or more of the following symptoms: cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis. A laboratory confirmed case is defined as a person with positive measles IgM antibodies, or at least a four-fold rise in antibody titre, or positive virus isolation. In recent years, antigen IF and PCR are also used to detect measles antibodies in blood samples or measles virus in respiratory samples, respectively. In June 2012, MOH enhanced the measles surveillance system by instituting an investigation and follow up of clinically diagnosed cases, in addition to laboratory confirmed cases. Clinical cases were investigated and followed up with laboratory tests via PCR or serology if they met the clinical measles case definition. Cases were discarded if they did not meet the case definition, or if laboratory results were negative for measles. A total of 116 cases were reported in 2013, comprising of 43 laboratory confirmed cases, seven clinically measles-compatible cases and 66 discarded cases. From January to November 2014, a total of 249 cases were reported, comprising of 132 laboratory confirmed cases, 37 clinically measles-compatible cases and 80 discarded cases. (Clinically measles compatible cases are cases which are not laboratory-confirmed but had fever, rashes and at least one of the following symptoms such as cough, coryza and conjunctivitis.)14 15Table 9 Summary of NML accreditation results, January 2013 - August 2014 Table 10 Specimens submitted to NML for measles and rubella testing, June 2012 - August 2014Serological tests and results# With effect from April 2013, reporting of measles IgM and rubella IgM results is changed to within four days from receipt of samples. In June 2012, measles surveillance was enhanced with serological cross-testing between measles and rubella IgM on specific patient samples requested by MOH. From June 2012 to August 2014, 1,970 samples were tested. A total of 68 samples were positive for measles IgM and 47 samples were positive for rubella IgM.

NML participates in WHO proficiency and confirmatory tests annually, and remains fully accredited. In 2013, 98% of specimens collected from suspected measles cases for measles IgM tests had laboratory results available within seven days after the specimens were received by the laboratory. All data from NML had been consistently reported to WPRO and MOH within the required time intervals. The NML accreditation results are summarised in Table 9.NML performs diagnostic tests for both measles and rubella IgM upon request from attending clinicians. NML also identifies measles cases by measles antigen detection on direct patient samples using immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and by virus isolation, as ordered by clinicians for suspected cases. To enhance surveillance, virus isolation is also performed on specimens sent for measles antigen detection. Sequencing is performed on virus isolates to determine the genotype. Quality of laboratory surveillance systems for measles16 17Virological surveillance Table 11 Proportion of measles cases with genotyping among lab-confirmed samples* in Singapore, January 2011 - November 2014 Table 12 Distribution of measles genotypes among lab-confirmed samples* identified in Singapore, January 2011 - November 2014As part of the enhanced measles surveillance system, a higher proportion of measles cases with positive PCR result is followed up with genotypic analysis. This will lead to a better understanding of the origin of measles cases notified in Singapore and aid in the tracing of epidemiological linkages amongst cases. Table 11 shows the proportion of all lab-confirmed samples with genotyping. Table 12 shows the measles genotypes identified in Singapore from January 2011 to August 2014. The genotype distribution shirted from D9 genotype in 2010 - 2011, B3/D9 genotypes 2012, G3/D9 genotypes in 2013, and to B3 genotype in 2014. The B3 genotype was first detected in 2012 and became predominant in 2014. Two imported cases from the Philippines with B3 genotype were reported in early 2014. Subsequently, locally acquired and imported cases with genotype B3 were reported until e-week 11. Three sporadic cases with genotype B3 were further reported in the year (Fig. 2).

Immunisation coverage for measles has remained consistently high, and maintained at around 95% (Table 13).A set of indicators was developed by WHO WPRO, covering i) incidence, ii) surveillance, and iii) population immunity. Table 14 shows Singapore's current status in comparison to WHO targets.

Each case is investigated thoroughly to determine any common exposures in place and time with other cases. NML remains fully accredited and plays a key role in the system. Vaccination coverage for the first dose is maintained at 95%. Despite maintaining high immunisation coverage, there are still sporadic measles cases occurring in Singapore. Singapore met most of WHO indicators for measles elimination in 2014, except for incidence of measles cases and adequate blood specimens from clinical cases. Among the 132 laboratory-confirmed cases, 83 (63%) were respiratory specimens. As most of the cases involved infants, respiratory specimens (throat swabs) were collected for confirmation via PCR instead of blood specimens. In this context, Singapore's indicator for the percentage of suspect cases with adequate blood specimens does not truly reflect the effort made to confirm suspect cases, as PCR is the mainstay of laboratory confirmation. The majority of the specimens in 2010 and 2011 associated with endemic transmission in Singapore were D9 genotype. The dominant genotypes were B3/D9 in 2012, G3/D9 2013 and B3 in 2014. Other genotypes (D8, G3 and H1) were also detected. Singapore receives about 15 million international visitors annually 4. The variation of genotypes detected is indicative of importation from other countries. The ability to collect appropriate specimens from as many of the cases as possible is an important factor in determining the source of infection. Encouraging clinicians to send specimens for laboratory confirmation of clinical cases is a challenge, as the cost of laboratory test would need to be borne by the patient. Although Singapore has a well-established system for measles notification, there is still progress to be made towards measles elimination 5. MOH has increased its efforts to perform genotyping for all positive respiratory samples; a 3% increase in 2014 compared to year 2013 and also to ensure harmonisation of genotyping data. Detailed epidemiological analysis is carried out for each notified measles case; all clinical cases are investigated and followed up with recruitment into the enhanced measles and rubella surveillance programme. This will aid establishing chains of transmission and source of infection with genotyping results. References 1. Goh KT. The national childhood immunisation programme in Singapore.

TreatmentCLUSTER OF CLINICAL SARCOCYTOSIS CASES The Ministry of Health (MOH) was notified by an infectious disease physician from the National University Hospital (NUH) on 25 Jul 2014 of two students suspected of having muscular sarcocystosis. They had been on a school trip to Tioman island, Malaysia, from 6 - 13 June 2014. One was hospitalised and the other was treated as an outpatient. Investigations carried out revealed that these two students were among a group of 125 grade eight students and 7 staff members (n=132) who had visited the island. They were divided into three groups. Each group had a separate departure date on 6 June, 7 June or 9 June 2014. Each group stayed in the island for 5 days at either Juara Beach Resort or Riverview Resort, both located at the Juara Beach area. All three groups had identical itineraries including kayaking at Juara Beach, trekking to waterfall at Mentawak and an overnight stay at a campsite in Dungun. A case was defined as a previously well individual who had visited Tioman island between 6 and 13 June 2014 and subsequently developed myalgia from 27 Jun to end of July 2014. Based on this case definition, a total of 13 cases (all students aged 13 - 14 years) were identified. One staff member with fever was subsequently diagnosed to have dengue fever. The attack rate of the students was 10.4%. The onset of myalgia was between 27 June and 23 July 2014 (Fig 1) . The mean and median incubation periods were 31 days and 33 days (range 14 - 40 days), respectively. The signs and symptoms included myalgia (100%), fever (92%), nausea (54%), headache (38%), diarrhoea abdominal pain (31%). The laboratory findings were eosinophliia in all cases and elevated creatine kinase in 3 cases. No specific tests were performed to confirm the diagnosis of sarcocystosis.Four cases (30.8%) were hospitalised. Eight cases (61.5%) sought outpatient treatment while one (7.7%) self-medicated. All had recovered. Figure 1 Onset of myalgia of 13 students who had travelled to Tioman island from 6 - 13 June 201422 23Discussion This is a cluster of clinical sarcocystosis cases involving 13 students who had travelled on a school trip to Tioman island, Malaysia, between 6 and 13 June 2014. The clinical symptoms (predominantly myalgia and fever), incubation period (mean of 31 days) and laboratory findings were compatible with the clinical and epidemiological description of muscular sarcocystosis infection (e.g. incubation period of 14 - 42 days). As muscle tissue biopsies were not carried out, we were unable to confirm the causative agent. Cases of sarcocystis association with travel to Tioman island. 1, 2 had been reported previously in 2011, 2012 and 2014. Activities such as kayaking at Juara Beach, swimming in the waterfall area at Mentawak and overnight stay at the Dungun campsite could have potentially exposed individuals to sarcocystis oocyst-contaminated water, e.g. swallowing of water while swimming and drinking of chlorine-treated river water at Dungun campsite. We hypothesize that treated water or untreated water from the natural environment as the likely source of the infection. A study indicated that treatment with chlorine is ineffective to prevent sarcocystosis infection in contaminated water 3. Furthermore, there is a possibility of animal reservoir of sarcocystosis which could contaminate the water within Tioman island. Besides ingestion of contaminated water, consumption of undercooked meat is another possible route of transmission. However this is unlikely as the incubation period observed in reported cases of intestinal sarcocystosis infection (incubation period of 3 - 6 hours 4) did not fit the incubation period of our cases (4 - 6 weeks).

Swimming at the Mentawak waterfall, drinking chlorine-treated river water at Dungun campsite and Jetty Jump, using branches (picked from ground) to skew marshmallows and consuming it around the camp fire were not significantly associated with illness. Other risk factors such as contact with animals, drinking untreated/ unfiltered water, inadvertent ingestion of water during swimming and consumption of raw/ undercooked food items (e.g. fruits, vegetables and meats) were also found not to be statistically significant. 22 23 = Haemophilus Influenza Type B Disease = Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease = Influenza = Measles = Meningococcal Infection = Mumps = Pertussis = Pneumococcal Disease (invasive) = Rubella = Viral Conjunctivitis = Severe Illness & Death from Possibly Infectious Causes Figure 1.1 E-weekly distribution of reported Hib cases, 2013 - 2014Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) disease is a serious disease caused by bacteria. The most common severe types of Haemophilus influenzae disease are: pneumonia (lung infection); bacteremia (bloodstream infection); and meningitis (infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord). The causative agent is Haemophilus Influenza type b (gram-negative coccobacillus). The mode of transmission is by inhalation of respiratory droplets or direct contact with respiratory tract secretions of infected persons. Hib disease is vaccine-preventable. In 2014, there were six cases of Haemophilus influenza type b disease reported compared to ten cases in 2013 (Figure 1.1). All the cases were laboratory confirmed with positive blood or cerebral spinal fluids culture. The incidence rates were highest in those aged 0 to 4 years; and 65 years and above. Among the three major ethnic groups, Malays had the highest incidence rate (Table 1.1 and 1.2). Of the six reported cases, 1 was imported case and 5 indigenous cases (Table 1.3).Airborne transmission occurs by dissemination of droplet nuclei which are small particle residues 5 micrometers or smaller in diameter, which can remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. Droplets can be formed when a person coughs, sneezes or talks. Droplets can also be formed during administration of drugs via nebuliser or invasive procedures such as suctioning and bronchoscopy. Transmission occurs when droplets containing microorganisms generated from infected persons are propelled a short distance (within a meter) through air and deposited on the host's mucous membranes (such as conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZA TYPE B DISEASE24 25Table 1.1 Age-gender distribution and age-specific incidence rates of reported Hib cases, 2014 Table 1.2 Ethnic-gender distribution and ethnic-specific incidence rate of reported Hib cases, 2014 Table 1.3 Total number of notifications received for Hib, 2010 - 2014*Rates are based on 2014 estimated mid-year population.

Children may have reduced appetite due to painful oral ulcers erupting on the tongue, gums or inside of the cheeks. A non-pruritic vesicular rash or red spots typically appears on the hands and feet, most commonly on the palms and soles. The common causative agents for HFMD are the coxsackieviruses type A (CA), echovirus (EC) and enterovirus 71 (EV71). HFMD can be transmitted from person to person through the faecal-oral or respiratory route. A total of 22,171 cases of HFMD were reported in 2014, a decrease of 33.3% compared to 31,741 cases reported in 2013 (Figure 1.2). There were no local cases with severe complications due to HFMD reported in 2014. The incidence rate was highest in the 0 - 4 years age group, with an overall male to female ratio of 1.3:1 (Table 1.4). Among the three major ethnic groups, Chinese had the highest incidence rate, followed by Malays and Indians (Table 1.5). No HFMD deaths were reported in 2014. Viral isolation and PCR of enterovirus 71 (EV 71) and other enteroviruses was carried out on samples collected at the KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), National University Hospital (NUH) and sentinel GP clinics. Of the isolates that were tested positive, the majority was coxsackieviruses type A (CA) (28.0%), followed by EV 71 (0.4%). Among the coxsackieviruses, was serotype, by CA16 (25.2%).

Table 1.6 gives a breakdown of HFMD outbreaks at various educational institutions by attack rate. Two HFMD clusters are discussed below. Since 2010, additional measures were introduced to curb the HFMD transmission in educational institutions. Childcare centres or kindergartens with prolonged HFMD transmission had their names published on the MOH website and were subsequently closed for ten days if the transmission was further prolonged. These measures continued to be enforced in 2014 with public education enhanced. An outbreak of HFMD involving 18 children aged between 0 and 5 years occurred between 17 May and 13 Jun 2014 in a childcare centre at Punggol. At the time of the outbreak, the centre had 24 full-time staff and 132 children in six classes: Infant, Toddler (PG), Nursery 1 (N1), Nursery 2 (N2), Kindergarten 1 (K1) and Kindergarten 2 (K2).The class-specific attack rates ranged from 3.0% to 33.3.3%, with an overall attack rate of 13.6% (Table 1.7). The index case, a nursery student, presented with symptoms on 17 May 2014. The infection subsequently spread amongst other children. The last reported case was on 13 Jun 2014 (Figure 1.3). The centre was mandatorily closed for ten days from 18 to 27 Jul 2014 due to the high number of cases and the prolonged disease transmission period.^Excluding 25 tourists. *Rates are based on 2014 estimated mid-year population.

It is spread from person to person mainly through infectious respiratory secretions released during coughing and sneezing. The causative agent is the influenza virus and three types of influenza virus (influenza A, B and C) are recognised. The Influenza type A viruses include two subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) that infect humans and have been associated with pandemics and widespread epidemics. Influenza type B is occasionally associated with regional epidemics, and influenza type C is usually associated with sporadic cases and minor localised outbreaks. Diagnosis is based on the clinical recognition of influenza-like illness with or without laboratory confirmation and strain characterisation. In temperate and cold climates, influenza reaches peak incidence in winter. As the Northern and Table 1.8 Attack rates of hand, foot and mouth disease in a child care centre at Telok Blangah, 25 March - 28 April 2014 Figure 1.4 Time distribution of 18 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease in a childcare centre atTelok Blangah, 25 March - 28 April 2014Class CategoryNo. Enrolled No. Affected and Attack Rates Male Female Total Male % Female % Total % Infant 3 7 10 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 Toddler 7 7 14 1 14.3 1 14.3 2 14.3 N1 18 17 35 2 11.1 2 11.8 4 11.4 N2 16 22 38 2 12.5 2 9.1 4 10.5 K1 28 15 43 1 3.6 1 6.7 2 4.7 K2 25 18 43 2 8.0 1 5.6 3 7.0 Total 97 86 183 8 8.2 7 8.1 15 8.230 31Southern Hemispheres have winter at different times of the year, there are two flu seasons each year: December-March in the Northern Hemisphere; and June-September in the Southern Hemisphere. In tropical and subtropical areas, influenza epidemics can occur either twice a year or even throughout the year. In Singapore, influenza viruses circulate year round, with a bimodal increase in incidence observed in April-July and November-January. The weekly attendance for acute respiratory infections (ARI) at polyclinics and public hospital emergency departments (ED) is routinely monitored as a proxy indicator for influenza activity (Note: ARI represents a mixture of respiratory illnesses and the proportion of influenza cases presenting with ARI varies with the level of influenza activity.) The weekly number of admissions due to ARI at public hospitals is also monitored. There were a total of 686,247 attendances at polyclinics for ARI in 2014, a decrease of 2.5% compared to 703,527 seen in 2013. No clear seasonal pattern for ARI was observed. The average daily number of polyclinics attendances for ARI peaked at 3,288 in E-week 4 (Figure 1.5). An annual total of 95,661 ARI cases were seen at the emergency departments (ED) of public hospitals in 2014, a decrease of 9.8% compared to 106,086 cases reported in 2013. The highest average weekly ARI attendance at ED was observed in E-week 25 at 2,393. In addition, ARI admissions peaked at 92 cases in E-week 25 (Figure 1.6).Figure 1.5 E-weekly distribution of acute respiratory infection attendance at polyclinics 2013 - 2014 30 31Virological surveillance of influenza viruses was carried out on throat and/or nasopharyngeal specimens obtained from polyclinics, hospitals and sentinel private clinics throughout the year. The typing, subtyping and isolation of influenza viruses was carried out at the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) and at designated hospital laboratories. Further genetic analysis and antigenic characterisation of selected samples was also done by NPHL and the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Melbourne, Australia. The 4-weekly moving average of the proportion of samples from patients in polyclinics and sentinel private clinics with influenza-like illness (ILI) which were positive for influenza viruses is shown in Figure 1.7. Higher levels of influenza activity were observed for the 4-weekly moving average between E-weeks 21-24 and 30-33, with a range of 62.3% to 69.1%. Influenza activity peaked in E-weeks 28-31 with 69.1% of ILI samples testing positive for influenza viruses. 77.6% of the positive samples in E-weeks 28-31 were influenza A viruses. Of these, 84.1% were of the H3N2 subtype. In 2014, 49.4% of all ILI samples tested positive for influenza viruses. Of the positive samples, 62.2% tested positive for influenza A viruses, of which 65.8% were of the influenza A(H3N2) subtype.Figure 1.6 Weekly polyclinic attendance, emergency department (ED) attendances and admissions for ARI, 2014 Figure 1.7 4-Week Moving Virological Surveillance of Influenza A & B, 2014 32 33 Between E-week 1-4 and 24-27, influenza B predominated among the influenza viruses, co-circulating with lower levels of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2). This was followed by influenza A(H3N2) virus gaining strong predominance in Singapore for the remainder of 2014 (Figure 1.8). Majority of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses of 2014 were antigenically similar to current vaccine strain, A/California/07/2009. The haemagglutinin genes of A(H3N2) viruses belonged to phylogenetic clades 3C.3 and 3C.2, and the viruses were antigenically similar to either A/Victoria/361/2011 or A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, which were the viruses in the vaccines for use in the 2014-2015 influenza seasons as recommended by WHO. Approximately 95% of influenza B viruses were of the B/Yamagata lineage and the rest belonged to B/Victoria lineage. Under B/Yamagata lineage, both B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like viruses (~27%) and its low reactors (~73%) were detected during Jan-Jun 2014, while B/Phuket/3073/2013-like viruses were detected during Jul-Dec 2014. All the viruses of B/Victoria lineage were typed as B/Brisbane/60/2008-like viruses. Over 280 isolates, including influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B viruses, were analysed for the resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir, peramivir, laninamivir and zanamivir. No antiviral resistance was detected except that reduced inhibition to peramivir was detected in one influenza B isolate. Measles is an acute, highly communicable viral disease caused by the measles virus, a member of the genus Morbillivirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. The mode of transmission is airborne by droplet spread, or direct contact with the nasal or throat secretions of an infected person. In Singapore, the number of reported measles cases has rapidly declined with the introduction of compulsory measles vaccination in August 1985. In 1992 and 1997, there was an increase in the number of reported cases (Figure 1.9). All age groups were affected and as a result, the \"catch-up\" immunisation initiative was implemented in July - November 1997 and the two-dose MMR vaccination regime was implemented in January 1998. The incidence of measles has remained at a low level since then.Figure 1.8 4-Week moving influenza typing results, 2014 MEASLES32 33A total of 142 laboratory confirmed cases of measles were reported in 2014 compared to 46 cases reported in 2013 (Figure 1.10). The highest incidence rate was observed in children under the age of 1 year (Table 1.9). Among the three major ethnic groups, Malays had the highest incidence rate, followed by Chinese and Indian (Table 1.10). Six cases had at least one dose of MMR vaccination prior to onset of illness (Source: National Immunisation Registry).

Frequently there is a petechial rash with pink macules or very rarely, vesicles. The causative agent is Neisseria meningitidis with serotype groups, namely, A, B, C, Y, W-135, X and Z. The mode of transmission is via direct contact, including respiratory droplets from nose and throat of infected persons.In 2014, there were nine cases of meningococcal infection reported compared to three cases in 2013. (Tables 1.12 and 1.13). All the cases were laboratory confirmed with positive blood/ cerebral spinal fluids culture or virginal swab PCR (Table 1.14). MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTION36 37Table 1.14 Epidemiological data of nine reported meningococcal infection cases, 2014 Figure 1.11 Incidence of reported mumps cases, 1990 - 2014 Mumps or infectious parotitis is an acute viral disease characterised by fever, swelling and tenderness of one or more salivary glands. The mumps virus, a member of the genus Paramyxovirus, is antigenically related to the parainfluenza viruses. The mode of transmission is airborne spread via infected respiratory droplets or by direct contact with the saliva of an infected person. The incidence of mumps in Singapore increased five-fold between 1998 and 1999, from 1,183 cases (30.2 per 100,000 population) to 6,384 cases (161.6 per 100,000 population). Children below age 15 were the most affected age group. This increase was due to the low protective efficacy of vaccines containing the Rubini strain, which had been used between the years 1993 - 1995. Following this resurgence, a more efficacious vaccine replaced the Rubini strain-containing vaccine. Since then, the annual incidence of mumps has declined rapidly (Figure 1.11).Case particulars Gender Age Ethnic group Causative agent Status M 2 months Indian Neisseria meningitides Grp B Recovered M 42 years Indian Neisseria meningitides Grp C Died M 3 months Chinese Neisseria meningitides Grp B Recovered M 50 years Chinese Neisseria W-135 Recovered M 53 years Chinese Neisseria Died M 63 years Chinese Neisseria W-135 Recovered F 4 months Malay Neisseria B Recovered F 26 years Malay Neisseria (non-groupable) Recovered F 58 years Died MUMPS36 37Figure 1.12 E-weekly distribution of reported mumps cases, 2013 - 2014 Table 1.15 Age-gender distribution and age-specific incidence rate of reported mumps cases, 2014 Table 1.16 Ethnic-gender distribution and ethnic-specific incidence rate of reported mumps cases, 2014A total of 478 cases (8.7 per 100,000 population) were reported in 2014 as compared to 495 cases in 2013 (Figure 1.12).

The mode of transmission is by droplets or close contact with the nasopharyngeal secretions of an infected person. A total of 147 laboratory confirmed cases of invasive pneumococcal infection were reported in 2014, a decrease of 12% compared to 167 cases reported in 2013 (Figure 1.14). Of the 147 reported cases, seven were imported cases and 140 indigenous cases (Table 1.20). The incidence rate was highest in those aged 65 years and above. Among the three major ethnic groups, Malays had the highest incidence rate, followed by Chinese and Indians (Tables 1.21 and 1.22). Of these 147 laboratory confirmed IPD cases, the number of serotyped cases was 117, which correspond to 79.6% of laboratory confirmed IPD cases. The predominant pneumococcal type for children cases was 19A and for adult cases was 3. (Tables 1.23 and 1.24).

It is also commonly known as German measles. The causative agent is the rubella virus (genus Rubivirus ) from the Togaviridae family and it is spread through droplets or by close contact with the nasopharyngeal secretions of an infected person.Rubella incidence fluctuated during 1991 - 1999. This was followed by a steady decline from 1999 (10.9 per 100,000 population) to 2014 (0.3 per 100,000 population) (Figure 1.15). A total of 17 cases of rubella were reported in 2014, a decrease of 64.6% compared to 48 cases reported in 2013 (Figure 1.16). The incidence rate was highest in the 0 - 4 year age group (Table 1.25). All the 5 female cases (0.4 per 100,000 female population) were in the reproductive age group of 15 - 44 years.

The common causative agents are the and enteroviruses.In 2014, the polyclinics reported 26,227 attendances conjunctivitis, an increase of 2.6% compared to 25,563 attendances reported in 2013 (Figure 1.17). There were no institutional outbreaks of viral conjunctivitis reported in 2014. The SIDPIC programme is a hospital-based sentinel surveillance programme which reviews cases of unexplained deaths and critical illness to identify possible emerging infections caused by novel pathogens. It aims to reduce delays in recognising emerging infections of public health importance. The project is presently operational in four public hospitals (TTSH, NUH, SGH and KKH). In year 2014, a total of 10,039 hospital patients were screened by SIDPIC project coordinators in participating hospitals (Table 1.28). Of these, 171 SIDPIC cases that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were identified. The majority of SIDPIC cases (35.09%) had illnesses with respiratory syndromes (Table 1.29). Of the 171 cases identified in 2013, 96 were found to have alternate aetiologies. 40 of these 96 cases had causative pathogens found. The top two causative pathogens were respiratory viruses (20%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20%). The remaining cases had clinical presentations that were consistent with the clinical diagnosis, e.g. auto-immune disorders. Despite extensive laboratory testing, the aetiology in 75 (43.86%) cases remained unknown.

The disease is characterised by fever, joint pain with or without swelling, headache, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Some patients may develop a rash affecting the trunk and limbs. The disease is usually self-limiting. Most symptoms last for 3 -10 days although the joint pain may last for weeks to months. The main vector in Singapore is the Aedes albopictus mosquito. A total of 182 laboratory-confirmed cases of chikungunya fever were reported in 2014, compared to 1,059 laboratory-confirmed cases in 2013 (Figure 2.1). Out of the 182 cases, 43 were imported cases, involving 6 Singapore residents, 9 foreigners including work permit holders and 28 tourists or foreigners seeking medical treatment. The remaining 139 cases were indigenous cases. No deaths due to chikungunya were reported in 2014. The incidence rate among indigenous cases was highest in the 35 - 44 years age group with a male to female ratio of 1.8:1 (Table 2.1). Among the three major ethnic groups, Chinese and Indians had the highest incidence followed by Malays. Foreigners comprised 60.4% of the indigenous cases (Table 2.2). ^Cases acquired locally among Singaporeans, permanent and temporary residents. *Rates are based on 2014 estimated mid-year population.

Early generalised erythema may occur in some cases. The infectious agents are flaviviruses comprising four serotypes (dengue-1, 2, 3 and 4) and are transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. In some cases, dengue haemorrhagic fever - a potentially fatal complication characterised by high fever, thrombocytopaenia, haemorrhagic manifestations, and evidence of plasma leakage may develop. A total of 18,326 laboratory confirmed cases of DF/DHF [comprising 18,306 cases of dengue fever (DF) and 20 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)] were reported in 2014, a decrease of about 17 percent from the 22,170 dengue fever cases reported in 2013. Out of the 18,326 cases, 514 cases were imported cases involving 213 Singapore residents and 301 foreigners including work permit holders. The remaining 17,812 cases were classified as indigenous cases. With continuation from 2013 epidemic, the incidence in the beginning of 2014 until the E-Week 7 was found high. Then the incidence declined starting from E-week 8 and remained plateau until E-week 17. Then it increased again in E-week 18 reaching a peak in E-week 28 and decreased from E-weeks 28 to 37, after-which the incidence fluctuated with downward trends for the rest of the year (Figure 2.3). The incidence rate among indigenous cases was highest in the age group of 15-24 with a male to female ratio of 1.9 :1 (Table 2.5). Among the three major ethnic groups, Chinese had the highest incidence rate, followed by Malays and Indians.

The National Environment Agency (NEA) adopts an evidence-based approach for the surveillance and control of Aedes vectors. Surveillance builds on the current regime of inspecting premises for mosquito breeding. Vector surveillance is integrated with epidemiological surveillance and laboratory-based virus surveillance, to generate risk maps that are used to guide vector control efforts, and to communicate risk to the community. It is complemented by adult mosquito sentinel surveillance using Gravitraps, which capture gravid mosquitoes. The Gravitrap-based sentinel surveillance system monitors the Aedes mosquito population in HDB housing estates at 34 locations around Singapore. Data collected from the sentinel surveillance system helps to provide insights on mosquito population and distribution, and informs operational deployment.Source reduction is central to Singapore's dengue vector control efforts. NEA actively engages the community to do their part to prevent mosquito breeding in their premises. Through the Inter-Agency Dengue Taskforce, NEA coordinates source reduction efforts in partnership with stakeholders in the public, private and people sectors. Since 2006, this has been augmented by Intensive Source Reduction Exercise (ISRE) that takes place at the start of the year. This systematic searching and destroying of potential breeding habitats in outdoor areas helps to reduce the vector population to a low level before the onset of the peak season for dengue transmission, which typically falls between May and October. To control the vector population in clusters, NEA carries out space spraying of insecticides to kill adult mosquitoes, complemented by searching and destroying of mosquito breeding sources. Apart from surveillance, Gravitraps are also used to supplement these measures and to monitor the extent of control efforts.Figure 2.5 Surveillance of dengue virus serotypes, 1993 - 2014 60 61A total of 18,326 cases were reported in 2014. This was 17% lower than 2013, which saw the start of an epidemic associated with the switch of predominant serotype from DENV-2 to DENV-1 and the emergence of a new strain of DENV-1 virus with apparently greater fitness. DENV-1 remained the predominant virus serotype in 2014. Overall, 79.1% of the serotyped and DENV-4 (0.2%). In 2014, NEA inspected some 3 million premises and surveyed over 110,000 outdoor areas. These include residential premises, construction sites, schools and factories. The distribution of dengue cases and Aedes mosquito breeding are shown in Figure 2.7. The overall Aedes House Index (HI) was 0.26%, with compound houses showing the highest HI among the residential premises (Figure 2.8). The top five breeding habitats for Ae. aegypti were domestic containers (31.2%), flower pot containers (10.7%), discarded receptacles (2.9%), and puddle ground depression (2.2%) (Figure 2.9). As for Ae. albopictus, the most common breeding habitats were discarded receptacles (11.2%), flower pot plate/tray (10.9%), domestic containers (9.4%), (5.3%), and closed perimeter drains (4.8%) (Figure 2.10).

The disease is transmitted via the bite of an infective female Anopheles mosquito. There are four species that cause disease in humans, namely P. vivax, P.malariae, P. falciparum and P. ovale . In recent years, P. knowlesi - a species that causes malaria among monkeys and occurs in certain forested areas of South-East Asia - has also caused several human cases of malaria. Symptoms of malaria include fever, headache, chills and vomiting. In 2014, a total of 62 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, a decrease of 44% compared to the 111 cases reported in 2013 (Figure 2.15). All 62 cases were imported. The incidence rate was highest in the 25 - 34 years age group, with an overall male to female ratio of 7.5:1 (Table 2.12). Among the three major ethnic groups, Indians had the highest incidence rate, followed by Chinese and Others (Table 2.13). ^Excluding 7 foreigners seeking medical treatment in Singapore and 4 tourists. *Rates are based on 2014 estimated mid-year population.

The weekly surveillance of acute diarrhoeal attendances showed a similar pattern to that of the previous year (Figure 3.1).Food-borne diseases are caused by the ingestion of foodstuffs or water contaminated by toxins associated with bacterial growth in the food, bacterial, viral or parasitic agents, toxins produced by harmful algal species or present in specific fish species or heavy metals and other organic compounds. Campylobacter enteritis is an acute bacterial enteric disease of variable severity characterised by diarrhoea, abdominal pain, malaise, fever, nausea and vomiting. Campylobacter jejuni and less commonly, Campylobacter coli are the usual causes of Campylobacter enteritis in humans. The mode of transmission is by ingestion of the organism in undercooked chicken and pork, contaminated food and water or unpasteurised milk. A total of 435 cases of Campylobacter enteritis was reported in 2014, an increase of 9.6% compared to 397 cases reported in 2013. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated in the majority of the cases (Table 3.1). Of the 435 reported cases, 40 were imported cases and 370 indigenous cases (Table 3.2). The other 25 cases comprised 8 foreigners who travelled to Singapore to seek medical treatment and 17 tourists. The incidence among indigenous cases was highest in the 0-4 years age group, with an overall male to female ratio of 1.3:1 (Table 3.3). Among the three major ethnic groups, the Indians had the highest incidence followed by the Chinese (Table 3.4).

(Source: Singapore Department of Statistics) Cholera is an acute bacterial enteric disease characterised in its severe form by sudden onset, profuse painless watery stools, nausea and vomiting. Untreated cases proceed rapidly to dehydration, acidosis, hypoglycaemia, circulatory collapse and renal failure. The usual causative agent in Singapore is Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 which includes two biotypes, Classical and El Tor. Each of these biotypes can be further classified into serotypes Inaba, Ogawa and Hikojima. Other serogroups in addition to O1 are O139 and Non O. The mode of transmission is through ingestion of food or water contaminated with faeces or vomitus of infected persons. In 2014, two imported cases of cholera were reported (Figure 3.2), one is a Singapore citizen and the other is a foreigner. Both cases were positive for V. cholerae O1 El Tor biotypes. The overall incidence rate was 0.04 per 100,000 population (Table 3.5 and 3.6).CHOLERA76 77Figure 3.2 E-weekly distribution of reported cholera cases, 2013 - 2014 Table 3.5 Age-gender distribution and age-specific incidence rate of reported cholera cases, 2014 Table 3.6 Ethnic-gender distribution and ethnic-specific incidence rate of reported cholera cases, 2014 Male Female Total (%)Incidence rate per 100,000 population* Singapore Resident Chinese 0 0 0 ( 0.0) 0.00 Malay 0 0 0 ( 0.0) 0.00 Indian 1 0 1 (50.0) 0.30 Others 0 0 0 ( 0.0) 0.00 Foreigner 1 0 1 (50.0) 0.10 Total 2 0 2 (100.0) 0.04*Rates are based on 2014 estimated mid-year population.

It is important to appreciate the difference between Salmonellosis food poisoning, and typhoid or paratyphoid fever, commonly known as enteric fevers. Causative organisms for the enteric fevers are Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi (types A or B) and infections are usually associated with travel to countries where these diseases are endemic. During the period 2010 to 2014, a total of 549 cases of enteric fever were reported, of which 379 (69.0%) cases were typhoid and 167 (31.0%) cases were paratyphoid. The majority (92.5%) were imported cases (Table 3.8). In 2014, a total of 77 cases of enteric fevers, comprising 58 cases of typhoid, and 18 cases of paratyphoid A and one case of paratyphoid B were reported, a decrease of 28.0% compared to 107 cases reported in 2013 (Figure 3.3).ENTERIC FEVERS Year TyphiParatyphiTotalA B 2010 82 (77) 37 (35) 1 (1) 120 (113) 2011 71 (69) 32 (31) 1 (0) 104 (100) 2012 84 (82) 57 (46) 0 (0) 141 (128) 2013 84 (75) 23 (23) 0 (0) 107 ( 98) 2014 58 (52) 18 (17) 1 (0) 77 ( 69) Total 379 (355) 167 (152) 3 (1) 549 (508)78 79Figure 3.3 E-weekly distribution of reported enteric fever cases, 2013 - 2014 Table 3.9 Classification of reported typhoid and paratyphoid cases, 2014Of the 58 reported cases of typhoid, 21 were Singapore residents, four were foreigners seeking medical treatment in Singapore and four were tourists.

Foods that are eaten raw or partially cooked, prepared with contaminated water or by an infected food handler are common sources of infection. Clinical features include jaundice, fever, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain and tenderness, dark urine and pale stools. There were 73 cases of serologically confirmed acute hepatitis A as compared to 88 cases in 2013 (Figures 3.4). Of the 73 reported cases, 46 were imported cases and 21 indigenous cases (Table 3.25). The remaining 6 cases involved 5 foreigners seeking medical treatment in Singapore and 1 tourist (Table 3.20). Among local residents, the age-specific incidence of acute hepatitis A (1.2 per 100,000 population) was highest in the 25 - 34 years age group. The overall male to female ratio was 1.7:1 (Table 3.21).

Salmonellosis is a bacterial disease commonly presenting as acute enterocolitis, with sudden onset of fever, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and sometimes vomiting. Dehydration, especially among infants or in the elderly, may be severe. The causative pathogen, Salmonella is a genus of gram- negative, facultative anaerobic motile rod-shape bacteria. It is divided into two species, Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori. Salmonella enterica is further subdivided into subspecies and serotypes based on biochemical and antigenic reactions. The majority (59%) Salmonella serotypes common O-antigen serogroups identified are from A to E. Numerous serotypes of Salmonella are pathogenic for both animals and human; that includes the most commonly reported Salmonella enterica serovar (S. Typhimurium) and Poultry is the commonest source of human salmonellosis. Consumption of contaminated meat and eggs is also a frequent cause. A wide range of domestic and wild animals including poultry, swine, cattle, rodents and pets may act as reservoirs for salmonellosis.

There are many different blood-borne diseases. We focus on hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) in this chapter. The mode of transmission is via infected human blood and body fluids. The mechanism of infection commonly includes transfusion of blood or blood products, sexual contact, contaminated IV drug use paraphernalia or accidental occupational exposure. The incidence rate was highest in the 45 - 54 years age group, with an overall male to female ratio of 5.9:1 (Table 4.1). Among the three major ethnic groups, Chinese had the highest incidence rate (Table 4.2). There were both local and imported cases, with local cases comprising 75% of the notifications (Table 4.4).Hepatitis B virus is a small DNA virus that belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family of viruses. Common symptoms of hepatitis B infection include fever, fatigue, muscle or joint pain, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. More severe cases may present with jaundice and ascites. A total of 48 cases of acute hepatitis B were reported in 2014, compared to 57 cases reported in 2013 (Figure 4.1). All cases were serologically confirmed with the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBc IgM antibody which are both associated with acute clinical presentation.

HCV is a major cause of acute hepatitis and chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is most efficiently transmitted by direct percutaneous exposure to infected blood or intravenous drug use. A total of five cases of acute hepatitis C were reported in 2014, compared to two cases reported in 2013 (Figure 4.2).

Legionellosis is an acute bacterial disease caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila . It has two recognised distinct clinical and epidemiological manifestations: Legionnaires disease and Pontiac fever. Both conditions are characterised by fever, chills, anorexia, malaise, myalgia and headache. However, Pontiac fever is not associated with pneumonia. The mode of transmission is airborne and includes aspiration of aerosolised water containing the bacteria. Chest X-ray in a Legionnaires' disease patient may reveal patchy or focal areas of consolidation.A total of 37 cases of laboratory-confirmed legionellosis were reported, compared with 24 cases in 2013 (Figure 5.1). 31 of these 37 cases were local residents. The other six cases comprised foreigners who came to Singapore to seek medical treatment for infections acquired overseas. Of the 31 local residents, 17 cases had confirmed Legionnaires' disease, three cases had presumptive Legionnaires' disease, eight cases had confirmed Pontiac fever and three cases had presumptive Pontiac fever (Table 5.1). Four of the 31 cases had acquired their infections overseas. All the diagnoses were based on an indirect fluorescent antibody titre of 1:1,024 in a single blood specimen or positive urinary antigen detection.

The mode of transmission is usually by contact with contaminated soil or water through overt or inapparent skin lesions. It could also be transmitted by aspiration or ingestion of contaminated water or inhalation of dust from contaminated soil. In 2014, there were 34 cases of laboratory confirmed melioidosis, compared with 36 cases in 2013 (Figure 5.3). 32 of these 34 cases were local residents and there was one resident who contracted infection overseas. The remaining two cases comprised a tourist and a foreigner who came to Singapore to seek medical treatment for infections acquired overseas.

HIV, the cause of the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), continues to spread. Since the disease first appeared in 1981, almost 78 million people have been infected with the virus and about 39 million have died of AIDS worldwide. Globally, 35.0 million [32.2-37.2 million] people were living with HIV at the end of 2013. HIV can be transmitted from person to person through unprotected sexual intercourse, the use of HIV contaminated needles including the sharing of needles among intravenous drug users, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, mucosal exposures with infected body fluid and the transplantation of HIV-infected tissues or organs. Mother-to-child or vertical transmission is the most common route of HIV infection in children. AIDS is the advanced stage of HIV infection, when a person's immune system is severely damaged and vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Previously, people with HIV could progress to AIDS in eight to ten years. However, since the introduction of Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) in the mid 1990s, the lifespan of a HIV infected individual on treatment has become comparable to someone without HIV infection. Singapore's multi-pronged National HIV/AIDS Control Programme comprises education of the general public and high-risk groups, protection of the national blood supply through screening of blood and blood products, management of cases and contact tracing, epidemiological surveillance, scaling up the prevention and control of sexually-transmitted infections (STIs), and legislation. The National HIV/AIDS Policy Committee, which comprises representatives from seven ministries (Health; Defence; Home Affairs; Social and Family Development; Manpower; Education; Communications and Information), the Communicable Disease Centre, the National Skin Centre, the Health Promotion Board, Action for AIDS and the Singapore National Employers Federation, provides guidance on all policy matters related to HIV infection/AIDS, including public health, legal, ethical, social and economic issues, and coordinates a broad-based multi-sectoral approach to the prevention and control of HIV infection/AIDS in Singapore. In 2014, a total of 456 Singapore residents were newly reported to have HIV infection, which is comparable with 454 cases in 2013 (Table 6.1). This brings the cumulative total number of HIV/AIDS infections among residents since the first case was diagnosed in 1985 to 6,685, of whom 3,407 persons are asymptomatic carriers, 1,541 have or have had AIDS-related illnesses and 1,737 have died. During 2014, 117 cases of AIDS were reported (Table 6.2), including 116 with AIDS at diagnosis of HIV infection and one previously diagnosed asymptomatic HIV-infected patient who progressed to AIDS. These 116 cases with AIDS at diagnosis comprised 25% of the newly reported cases. 49% of the newly reported patients presented with late-stage 1 HIV infection. The notification rate of HIV/AIDS in 2014 was 117.8 per million population, compared to 118.1 per million population in 2013 (Figure 6.1). The AIDS morbidity rate was 30.2 per million population in 2014, compared to 30.4 per million population in 2013. In 2014, 87 deaths in HIV/AIDS patients were reported, giving a mortality rate of 22.5 per million population. 1As defined by CD4+ cell count of less than 200 per cu mm or AIDS-defining opportunistic infections or both.120 121Year Male Female Total No. of cases per million population 1985 2 0 2 0.8 1986 6 1 7 2.8 1987 10 0 10 3.9 1988 15 0 15 5.8 1989 9 1 10 3.8 1990 17 0 17 6.2 1991 39 3 42 15.0 1992 49 6 55 19.3 1993 58 6 64 22.0 1994 76 10 86 29.1 1995 102 9 111 36.8 1996 123 16 139 45.3 1997 157 16 173 55.4 1998 167 32 199 62.6 1999 171 35 206 63.8 2000 193 33 226 69.0 2001 204 33 237 71.3 2002 206 28 234 69.2 2003 212 30 242 71.9 2004 290 21 311 91.1 2005 287 30 317 91.4 2006 327 32 359 101.8 2007 392 31 423 118.1 2008 426 30 456 125.2 2009 418 45 463 124.0 2010 403 38 441 116.9 2011 430 31 461 121.7 2012 437 32 469 122.8 2013 428 2014 422 34 456 117.8 Total 6,076 609 6685 - Table 6.1 Distribution of Singapore residents with HIV/AIDS by gender, 1985 - 2014122 123Year Male Female Total No. of cases per million population 1985 0 0 0 0.0 1986 1 0 1 0.4 1987 3 0 3 1.2 1988 6 0 6 2.3 1989 5 0 5 1.9 1990 8 0 8 2.9 1991 12 0 12 4.3 1992 17 1 18 6.3 1993 19 3 22 7.6 1994 44 4 48 16.2 1995 51 5 56 18.6 1996 89 3 92 30.0 1997 80 8 88 28.2 1998 112 13 125 39.3 1999 125 15 140 43.3 2000 128 15 143 43.7 2001 136 16 152 45.7 2002 133 13 146 43.2 2003 130 13 143 42.5 2004 162 11 173 50.7 2005 91 9 100 28.8 2006 118 9 127 36.0 2007 153 6 159 44.4 2008 157 5 162 44.5 2009 142 12 154 41.2 2010 152 14 166 44.0 2011 174 13 187 49.3 2012 148 12 160 41.9 2013 111 6 117 30.4 2014 108 9 117 30.2 Total 2,615 215 2,830 -Table 6.2 Distribution of Singapore residents with AIDS by gender, 1985 - 2014122 123 Figure 6.1 Notification rate of HIV/AIDS among Singapore residents, 1985 - 2014 As in previous years, HIV/AIDS cases were predominantly male with a male to female ratio of 12:1. In 2014, the highest notification rates were observed for males in the 30 - 39 years age group and for females in the 50-59 years age group (Table 6.3). Among the three major ethnic groups, the Malays had the highest HIV notification rate at 174.2 per million population, followed by the Indians and the Chinese (Table 6.4).

Heterosexual transmission accounted for 46.3% of all cases in 2014, while homosexual and bisexual transmission accounted for 48.3%. There was one case infected via intravenous drug use. No cases were infected via blood transfusion, overseas renal transplant or the perinatal route. In 2014, after excluding those who had died or were in prison, 430 HIV cases were identified to be interviewed for contact tracing. Of these, 401 cases (93%) were interviewed. The remaining cases were hospitalised, overseas or pending interview (as at 31 Dec 2014). In 2014, after excluding spouses who had died, were divorced or overseas, there were 95 spouses to be contacted under the spousal notification programme. 88 spouses (93%) were notified. The remaining spouses were not notified as it was assessed that there was no ongoing risk of transmission. A total of 385 sexual contacts were reported during contact tracing interviews conducted among cases diagnosed in 2014. 228 contacts were contactable (59%) and were notified of their exposure to HIV and advised to undergo testing. 137 of them (60%) reported that they tested for HIV, of whom 21 (15%) tested positive. About 56.6% of the new cases in 2014 had their HIV infection detected when testing was performed in the course of medical care provision. Another 24.8% were detected during routine programmatic HIV screening while another 13.8% were detected as a result of voluntary HIV screening. The rest were detected through other types of screenings.

The proportion of cases tested positive for HIV within each programme has declined or remained stable over the last four years. In 2014, the prevalence of HIV infection among cases tested in anonymous test sites was highest, at 1.3%, followed by inpatient opt-out testing and antenatal screening, at 0.19% and 0.05% respectively.

They are patients with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) attending the Department of STI Control (DSC) clinic; and inpatients at one tertiary Restructured Hospital. The HIV seroprevalence among STI attendees peaked in 2005 at 1.4% and decreased to 1.2% in 2014. Among inpatients, there has been an increasing trend in the HIV seroprevalence. In 2014, the seroprevalence was 0.9%. (Figure 6.2). In 2014, plasma samples from HIV-positive individuals were tested by the National Public Health Laboratory for recent infections by an in vitro quantitative enzyme immunoassay. The proportion of recently-infected individuals was estimated at 17.8% in newly-diagnosed, treatment-na\u00efve individuals (n=118). Viral subtype determination among these recently-infected individuals revealed the predominant circulating HIV subtype was CRF01_AE (60%), followed by subtype B (40%). Resistance testing was also performed to determine the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance-associated mutations in newly diagnosed, treatment-na\u00efve HIV-positive individuals. The overall prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) to any antiretroviral (ARV) class was 3.4% in 2014. Transmitted resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) were 1.7% respectively. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections caused by different pathogens (e.g. bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi) which are spread from person to person primarily through sexual contact. The common and important STIs are caused by Treponema pallidum (Syphilis), and rectum), herpes simplex virus - types 1 human papilloma virus (anogenital warts), Trichomonas vaginalis (infection of the urethra and vagina) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The diagnosis of an STI is a \"sentinel\" event which indicates unprotected sexual activity and therefore, patients presenting with one STI are at increased risk of acquisition of others. The presence of STIs can increase the risk of acquisition of HIV infection and also promote its transmission. Sexually transmissible pathogens are also implicated in other reproductive system problems such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility and ectopic pregnancy. The Department of STI Control (DSC) Clinic of the National Skin Centre (NSC) is a public clinic for the diagnosis, treatment and control of sexually transmitted infections (STI) in Singapore. The DSC runs the National STI Control Programme in Singapore, and its activities include health and public education on STI/HIV, clinic services, disease detection, patient management and research. Figure 6.2 Unlinked HIV Seroprevalence, 1989- 2014HIV unlinked anonymous sero-surveillance programme HIV molecular surveillance program SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS 126 127STIs which are legally notifiable under the Infectious Diseases Act (IDA) comprise gonorrhoea, non-gonococcal urethritis, syphilis, chlamydia and genital herpes. Since 19 December 2008, the IDA requires medical practitioners to notify all cases of chlamydia genital infection to NSC within 72 hours of diagnosis. In the past two decades, the incidence of legally notifiable STIs was highest at 201 per 100,000 population in 1992, followed by 197 per 100,000 in 2005 and thereafter it decreased to 128 per 100,000 in 2014. The incidence rates of individual legally notifiable STIs are shown in Figure 6.4.The overall incidence for STIs was 186 per 100,000 population in 2014. The STI incidence rate increased by 6% from 155 per 100,000 population in 2000 to 165 per 100,000 population in 2002, and then increased sharply by 29% from 199 per 100,000 population in 2003 to 257 in 2004 per 100,000 population. The rate dropped to 250 per 100,000 population in 2006, and thereafter remained similar until 2008. The rate then dropped further to 186 per 100,000 population in 2014 (Figure 6.3). The three main bacterial STIs notified in 2014 were chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis. Figure 6.3 Incidence rate of STIs, 1980 - 2014Disease trend Legally Notifiable STIs128 129Among the five legally notifiable STIs, the overall incidence of chlamydia was the highest, followed by gonorrhoea and syphilis. The incidence of legally notifiable STIs was higher among males than females (Table 6.8).* Monitoring for chlamydia genital infection started in 1999, and it was made legally notifiable since 19 Dec 2008. * Rates are based on 2014 estimated mid-year population.(Source: Singapore Department of Statistics) 1 Not applicable, as NGU occurs only in males. 2 Not applicable, as vaginal discharge occurs only in females. 3 Not applicable, as MPC occurs only in females.Table 6.8 Distribution of incidence rates by STIs and gender, 2014 STIs Incidence rate per 100,000 population* Legally Notifiable STIs Male Female Total Gonorrhoea 51.6 10.3 31.9 Non-Gonococcal Urethritis (NGU) 21.6 - 1 - 1 Syphilis 40.8 20.5 31.1 Genital Herpes 19.1 12.2 15.8 Other STIs Vaginal discharge -2 14.7 -2 Candidiasis 4.2 16.6 10.1 Genital Warts 33.2 6.8 20.6 Mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC) -3 17.3 -3 Chancroid 0.0 0.0 0.0 Others 6.4 3.8 5.2 All types 231.3 136.6 186.2Figure 6.4 Incidence rate of legally notifiable STIs, 1992 - 2014 Distribution by STIs and gender128 129In 2014, the male to female ratio for STIs was 1.9:1. As in previous years, the age-specific incidence rate for STIs among females was highest in the age group 25 - 29 years. Among the males, the highest age-specific incidence rate was in the age group 25 - 29 years. The overall rate was highest in the 20 - 24 year age group (Table 6.9). Among the three major ethnic groups, the Malays had the highest incidence rate at 213.9 per 100,000 population, followed by the Chinese and the Indians (Table 6.10). Chlamydia is the most common cause of NGU. Since 2006, there have been more cases of NGU tested for Chlamydia trachomatis. NGU cases which test positive for Chlamydia trachomatis are classified as chlamydia infection instead of NGU, resulting in a decreasing trend in the incidence of NGU and a converse trend in the incidence of chlamydia. The overall incidence of chlamydia peaked in 2009 at 55 per 100,000 population and decreased to 45 per 100,000 population in 2014 (Figure 6.4). The incidence of chlamydia among males increased sharply from 11 per 100,000 population in 2006 to 59 per 100,000 in 2010 overtaking the incidence among females in 2009. It decreased to 54 per 100,000 population in 2014. The incidence of chlamydia among females increased from 49 per 100,000 population in 2006 to 62 per 100,000 in 2008 before decreasing to 34 per 100,000 population in 2014 (Table 6.8).

From a historical perspective, the incidence rate of syphilis decreased from 45 per 100,000 population in 1980 to 23 per 100,000 population in 1991. From 1992, there was an increase in the incidence rate from 26 per 100,000 population to 36 per 100,000 population in 1997. Subsequently it declined to 18 per 100,000 population in 2002 before rising to 36 per 100,000 population in 2006 and dropping to its lowest point at 16 per 100,000 population in 2010 (Figure 6.4). The rate of infectious syphilis declined progressively from 18 per 100,000 population in 1986 to 3 per 100,000 population in 1999. It then increased to 5 per 100,000 population in 2004 and remained stable at 4 per 100,000 population to 2009. In 2014, the rate of infectious syphilis remained at 4 per 100,000 population. There were no cases of congenital syphilis reported in 2014. The incidence rate of gonorrhoea was 32 per 100,000 population in 2014. Gonorrhoea has been on a decreasing trend since 2004 when the incidence rate was 63 per 100,000 population (Figure 6.4). There were 4 cases of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum reported in detected among Gonorrhoea positive cultures screened was 43.1% in 2014, which was a slight decrease from 45.0% in 2013 (Table 6.11).

Initial tuberculous infection usually goes unnoticed and is a condition known as latent TB infection (LTBI). About 10% of immunocompetent adults with LTBI will eventually progress to active disease, and half of them will do so in the first two years following infection. The risk of progression to active disease is increased in immunocompromised persons and children under 5 years of age.The National TB Control Programme was established in the late 1950s with the setting up of the Tuberculosis Control Unit and a National TB registry. The programme was enhanced with the launch of the Singapore Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (STEP) in 1997. The main aim of STEP is to eliminate TB in Singapore by detecting, diagnosing and treating all infectious TB cases, identifying and treating infected tuberculosis contacts; and preventing the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. A total of 2,920 cases of TB were notified in 2014. This comprised 1,454 new and 137 relapsed cases among Singapore residents (citizens and PRs) and 1,287 new and 42 relapsed cases among non-residents (long-and short-term pass holders). Of the non-resident cases, 56% were short-term pass holders such as pass applicants and tourists. A total of 2,018 new cases of TB were notified among Singapore residents (citizens and PRs) and long-staying foreigners in 2014. The incidence rate of TB was 36.9 per 100,000 population in 2014. (Figure 6.5) In terms of overall disease burden, about 28% of new TB cases were notified in long-staying residents in 2014. The majority (84.5%) of cases had pulmonary TB with or without extra-pulmonary involvement, while the remainder (15.5%) had exclusively extrapulmonary TB (Table 6.13).

From a historical perspective, the incidence rate of TB declined from 307 per 100,000 population in 1960 to 56.3 per 100,000 population in 1987. From 1987 to 1997, the incidence rate of new TB cases among Singapore citizens and permanent residents stagnated around 50-55 per 100,000 population. Following enhanced TB control measures implemented by STEP, the incidence rate declined from 56.9 per 100,000 population in 1998 to a historical low of 35.1 per 100,000 population in 2007. However, in 2008, the incidence rate increased for the first time in ten years to 39.8 per 100,000 population. Between 2009-2012, the incidence rate stagnated at 38.6 to 40.9 per 100,000 population, before decreasing to 36.9 per 100,000 in 2013 (Figure 6.6). Of the 1,454 new TB cases among Singapore residents notified in 2014, 83.9% (1220) of cases had pulmonary TB with 13.9% (170) or without extra-pulmonary involvement 86.1 % (1050), while 16.1% (234) had exclusively extrapulmonary TB (Table 6.16). All extra pulmonary TB disease (404), the most common site of extrapulmonary TB was the pleura (134) followed by the lymphatic system (119) in 2014. There was no case of tuberculosis meningitis reported among Singapore residents below 15 years of age.

As in previous years, TB in Singapore residents (citizens and PRs) continues to be a disease of older males (Table 6.17). Of the 1,454 new cases notified in 2014, 970 (66.7%) were 50 years old and above, and 1018 (70.0%) were males. The TB incidence rate among males increased from 52.1 per 100,000 population in 2013 to 53.5 per 100,000 population in 2014, while that among females remained stable at 22.2 per 100,000 population.Distribution by age and genderTable 6.16 Distribution of new TB cases by site of disease among Singapore Residents, 1960 - 2014136 137Age (Yrs)Incidence rate per 100,000 population* Male Female Total (%) Male Female Total 0 - 4 5 1 6 (0.4) 5.4 1.1 3.3 5 - 9 2 2 4 (0.3) 1.9 2.0 1.9 10 - 14 1 3 4 (0.3) 0.9 2.8 1.8 15 - 19 15 12 27 (1.9) 11.9 9.9 10.9 20 - 29 55 55 110 (7.6) 21.0 20.6 20.8 30 - 39 71 62 133 (9.1) 25.0 20.0 22.4 40 - 49 134 66 200 (13.8) 43.6 20.8 32.0 50 - 59 243 79 322 (22.1) 80.2 26.3 53.3 60 - 69 234 75 309 (21.2) 120.9 37.7 78.7 70 - 79 177 40 217 (14.9) 212.8 40.0 118.5 80 + 81 41 Total 1,018 436 1,454 (100.0) 53.5 22.2 As in previous years, Malays had the highest TB incidence among the three main ethnic groups.

PLWHIV are 29 times more likely to develop TB disease than those who are HIV-negative worldwide. In 2013, 1.1 million (13%) of the 9.0 million people who devel - oped TB worldwide were HIV-positive 2. In 2014, 40 (2.8%) of the 1454 new TB cases notified among Singapore residents had prior diagnosis of HIV, similar to 3.1% in 2013. Of the 137 relapsed TB cases notified among Singapore residents in 2014, 7 (5.1%) had been previously diagnosed with HIV, compared with 6.7% in 2013. The high - est TB-HIV co-infection rates were observed among males above 40 years of age (Table 6.22).

Cases with unknown place of births were excluded from the analysis. The data presented is based on the drug susceptibility testing result of mycobacterial cultures taken at baseline (from three months before to two weeks after the date of notification or date of starting treatment, whichever earlier). The overall incidence of drug resistance among 713 new pulmonary TB cases in whom drug-susceptibility testing was performed was 7.3%, with 5.3% (38 cases) resistant to one drug and 2% (14 cases) resistant to more than one drug (Table 6.27). Multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), i.e. resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid, was detected in 6 cases (0.8%), while resistance to isoniazid but not rifampicin was detected in 24 cases (3.4%). The overall incidence of drug resistance among 61 relapsed pulmonary TB cases with drug susceptibility testing performed was 11.5%, with 8.2% (5 cases) were resistant to one drug and 3.3% (2 cases) was resistant to more than one drug. There were no MDR-TB cases. Resistant to isoniazid but not rifampicin was 9.8% (6 cases).

The manifestations of the disease vary in a continuous spectrum between the two polar forms, lepromatous and tuberculoid leprosy. It can present as hypopigmented patches with diminished sensation, multiple raised plaques, thickened nerves or neuritis. Diagnosis can be made through clinical features, a slit skin smear or skin biopsy for histological examination. In the past, leprosy was regarded as a highly contagious, mutilating and incurable disease and this led to a lot of social stigma associated with the disease and the people afflicted with it. Before effective treatment for leprosy was available, patients were segregated in leprosariums to prevent the spread of leprosy to the community. Modern treatment for leprosy was introduced in 1941 when dapsone and its derivatives were used. With effective chemotherapy, leprosy is curable today and patients are now treated in the general health services alongside other diseases. Currently, the Cutaneous Infections Unit of the National Skin Centre undertakes the treatment of leprosy based on the WHO guidelines for therapy. There are very few cases of Leprosy in Singapore. The distribution of leprosy notifications among Singapore residents and non-residents from 2010 to 2014 is shown in Table 6.31. The incidence rate of leprosy among Singapore residents has declined over the past five decades, from 21.3 per 100,000 population in 1960 to 0.03 per 100,000 population in 2014 (Figure 6.7). In 2014, there was one male Singapore resident with leprosy were notified (Table 6.32). There were no cases reported in those under 15 years of age.LEPROSY Table 6.31 Leprosy notifications among Singapore residents and non-residents, 2010 - 2014 Figure 6.7 Incidence rate of leprosy among Singapore residents, 1960 - 2014YearNo. of cases Resident (% Total Notifications)Non-resident (% Total Notifications)Total 2010 4 (30.8%) 9 (69.2%) 13 2011 5 (31.3%) 11 (68.8%) 16 2012 5 (33.3%) 10 (66.7%) 15 2013 3 (25.0%) 9 (75.0%) 12 2014 1 (16.7%) 5 (83.3%) 6 Leprosy in Singapore Residents146 147In 2014, there were two cases of multibacilliary leprosy and two cases of paucibacilliary leprosy amongst non-residents (Table 6.35).

Only vaccinations against diphtheria and measles are compulsory by law. BCG immunisation began in mid-1950s as part of the NCIP. All newborns were vaccinated at birth. Although parental consent is required, acceptance has been high and close to 100% of children has been vaccinated in the last decade (Table 7.2). The BCG immunisation programme has contributed significantly to the eradication of tuberculous meningitis in young children. BCG was discontinued for Mantoux non-reactors and BCG booster dose was also discontinued in July 2001. Hepatitis B immunisation for infants born to hepatitis B carrier mothers was incorporated into the NCIP in October 1985. This was extended to all newborns in September 1987. To protect those born before 1987, a four-year hepatitis B immunisation programme was implemented for students in secondary 3, junior college year 2, centralised institute year 3, institutes of technical education (ITE), polytechnics and universities starting from January 2001. In addition, full-time national servicemen (NSFs) who have not been vaccinated are offered hepatitis B immunisation. The NSFs are also offered MMR and Tdap if they were not vaccinated previously. Since January 1990, the monovalent measles vaccine given to one-year-old children was replaced by the trivalent MMR vaccine. As of January 1998, the monovalent rubella vaccine given to primary school leavers was also replaced by the second dose of MMR vaccine. The MMR immunisation was last reviewed by the Expert Committee on Immunisation in 2011 and a revised schedule was implemented in December of the same year. With the change in the immunisation schedule, both doses of MMR vaccine were brought forward to 12 months and 15-18 months respectively. School Health Services continues to provide MMR vaccine to primary one (6-7 years old) students who did not receive the second dose in their pre-school years. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was included as the 10th vaccine in the NCIP in November 2009 to reduce morbidity and mortality of invasive pneumococcal diseases in Singapore. The ECI recommended a schedule of two doses for the primary series and one booster dose (2+1 schedule). The two doses in the primary series are given at ages 3 and 5 months and a single booster dose at 12 - 24 months of age (change to 12 months in December 2011). The polio immunisation schedule prior to June 2013 comprised six doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV). Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) had been available on request and at full cost. In order to reduce the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) due the use of OPV, the all-OPV schedule was replaced with a sequential IPV-OPV schedule. The ECI recommended a four-dose IPV schedule with three primary doses to be given at 3, 4, and 5 months of age and the first booster dose at 18 months of age. A fifth dose using OPV was recommended at 10-11 years of age (Primary 5). The OPV dose at 6-7 years of age (Primary 1) was discontinued at the end of 2013. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) immunisation was introduced into the NCIP to reduce the risk of serious complications such as meningitis and pneumonia which may lead to long-term disabilities and deaths. The ECI recommended a four-dose schedule, in line with the schedule for DTaP and IPV at 3, 4, and 5 months of age and a single booster dose at 18 months of age. The ECI also recommended the use of combination vaccines containing IPV and Hib for the routine schedule. The recommendations for IPV and Hib became effective in June 2013 and the new schedule became a standard of care by January 2014. Between June and December 2013, clinics were allowed to use the existing stocks of DTaP and OPV before the replacement with IPV and Hib-containing combination vaccines. 151IMPLEMENTATION OF THE IMMUNISATION PROGRAMME Table 7.1 Singapore National Childhood Immunisation Schedule, 2014The NCIP is carried out by: (a) National Healthcare Group (NHG) polyclinics and SingHealth (SH) polyclinics (b) Youth Preventive Services Division (YPSD), the Health Promotion Board (HPB) (c) Private medical practitionersImmunisation of pre-school children is carried out at the polyclinics and by private medical practitioners.

In 2014, no indigenous case of diphtheria, poliomyelitis and neonatal tetanus was reported. With the implementation of the 'catch-up' measles vaccination programme using the MMR vaccine in 1997, and the introduction of the second dose of MMR vaccine to all primary six school children in 1998 and primary one school children with effect from 2008, the incidence of measles decreased from 1,413 cases in 1997 to 142 in 2014 (Figure 7.3). Rubella incidence decreased from 48 cases in 2013 to 17 in 2014. There were no reported cases of indigenous congenital rubella and no termination of pregnancy was carried out in 2014 due to rubella infection (Table 7.14). The resurgence of mumps which began in 1998, continued until the year 2002. The resurgence was due to poor protection conferred by the Rubini strain of the MMR vaccine which was subsequently de-registered in 1999. The incidence of mumps remained largely unchanged in recent years; there were 495 cases in 2013, and 478 cases in 2014 (Table 7.15). The incidence of indigenous acute hepatitis B for all age groups has declined from 243 cases (9.5 per 100,000 population) in 1985 to 48 cases (0.9 per 100,000 population) in 2014 (Figure 7.4). During the same period, the reported number of cases in children <15 years decreased from 10 to 0 (Table 7.15). A national sero-prevalence survey was conducted in 2012 to determine the prevalence of antibody against vaccine preventable diseases and other diseases of public health importance in the adult Singapore resident population aged 18 - 79 years using residual sera from the National Health Survey 2010. The overall sero-prevalence was 85.0% for rubella in those aged 18 - 79 years. 11.1% of women 18 - 44 years of age remained susceptible to rubella infection. About 43.9% of Singapore residents aged 18 - 79 years possessed immunity against hepatitis B virus (anti-HBs 10 mIU/mL). The overall prevalence of HBsAg in the population was 3.6%. The Health Promotion Board educates parents on the importance of childhood immunisations through educational materials such as \"Childhood Immunisations: Give Your Child The Best Protection\" and \"Protect your child against Measles, Mumps and Rubella with the MMR vaccination\". These are distributed in the polyclinics and other healthcare institutions. Under the Healthier Child, Brighter Future initiative, the \"Healthy Start For Your Baby\" guide also contains a chapter on childhood immunisations. This educates parents the importance of immunisation and to immunise their children according to the recommended National Childhood Immunisation Schedule.
