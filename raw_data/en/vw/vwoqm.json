It has been fully recognized by infertility doctors and patients by its success rate.

Chinese Herbal Medicine is a time-tested comprehensive medical system. It has been widely used in medical conditions ranging from minor to major problems, such as stomach to cancer. It specially excels for illnesses that conventional medicine has difficulty to treat, as well as conditions that simply don't have a western diagnosis. The herbal medicine is completely natural, therefore, it is gentle to body and yet amazingly powerful and dramatic. Clinical Nutrition Therapy is typically used to address many medical conditions caused by the lack of nutrition elements or unbalanced nutrition elements in a body system. For example, mild depression patients can be significantly improved with some special nutrition supplements and be reversed from the dark mood quickly. Many tailored nutrition programs based on individual's body conditions are available and highly beneficial to people's long-term wellness. Depending on individual's medical needs, different treatments may be provided. Each technique and procedure has its unique power and may address certain illness and conditions more effectively than others. An individual's body system may react to one approach better than others. In some cases, multiple methods will be taken simultaneously or in sequence to best resolve a problem.
