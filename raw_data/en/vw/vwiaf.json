Established through state legislation and im plemented in 2007 with a grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Program's Aging Initiative, the program is authorized to handle both controlled and non-controlled medications (see appendix group 4 for historical documents related to the pr ogram). This handbook describes the program components, as well as the outcomes and lessons learned from Phas es I & II of the program. The handbook is des igned as a guide to organizati ons that are implementing similar programs in other states. Maine, which has a combination of rural r egions and urban centers, serves as an ideal state in which to test distribution and collection methods, combined with cost containment. The pilot program began with 11 participating pharmacies, and has since expanded to includ e approximately 150 pharmacies and health and human services agencies in all 16 counties of Maine. The program has broadened from the original target audience of older adults and caregivers to include adults of all ages. The program currently maintains a waiting list of intere sted community-based distribution sites. The mail-back program, during its first two phas es of operation, has disposed of more than 2,300 lbs of drugs, representing 3,926 env elopes. Pharmacist and pharmacy tech volunteers have cataloged and inventoried those envelopes through eight cataloging events during the first two phases of the program. The volu me was so great that the inventory method was changed to a 20% samp ling process during the second year of operation. Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 7 Why Collect Unused Pharmaceuticals? The Athens Declaration,1 developed in 2007 at the 2nd Inte rnational Conference on the Environment in Athens, Greece, supported si x reasons for citizens to tackle unused drug disposal: (1) to curtail childhood overdose s; (2) to restrict household drug theft; (3) to limit accumulation of drugs by the elderly ; (4) to protect our physical environment; (5) to restrain improper international drug donat ions; and (6) to eliminate waste in the international health care systems of all countries. Any or all of the Athens Declaration reasons could be adopted as program goals for a mail-back drug return program. Goals should state in general terms what the program aims are, and what impact you hope to have. The Athens Declaration components describe a hoped-for result, but state it in a gener al (not objectified) fashion. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Associat ion estimates that mo re than 3.6 billion prescriptions are written each year in the United States. 2 More recent figures indicate that U.S. sales of prescrip tion medicines rose 5.1 percent in 2009 to $300.3 billion.3 In Maine, more than 16 million pre scriptions were filled in 2008,4 including 2.3 million 1 The Athens Declaration can be found at http://www.mainebenzo.org /athensdeclaration.htm .

Yet, research indicates that patients very frequently do not take prescr ibed medications as they were directed, if at all.6,7 In Maine, diverted, abused, and misused pr escription drugs are a major cause of accidental poisonings and arrests. In 2008, 95% of Maine drug deaths were caused by pharmaceutical drugs, either alone or in combination with other drugs. 8 The state has seen arrest rates for prescription drug-rela ted offenses rise from 50 in 1998 to 75 in 2003, and 259 (39% of all arrests) in 2008.9 According to data from the 2008 National Drug Intelligence Center's National Drug Threat Survey, the state of Maine ranks number one in the country in te rms of the perceived relation ship of pharmaceuticals to violent crime and property crime, and second in terms of the availability of pharmaceuticals for abuse. Forty percent of Maine law enforcem ent agencies perceive prescription drug misuse as the most serious drug threat. 10 Medication safety affects all ages. For y outh, one of the fast est growing trends nationally in teenage prescription drug abus e is the \"pharm party\" where teens dump bottles of prescription medications they hav e found into a punch bowl to be distributed like candy. According to results from the 2006 Maine Youth Drug and Alcohol Use (MYDAUS) Survey, 12% of teenagers in grades 6 through 12 across the state report 5 Maine Prescription Monitoring Program, \"PMP Prescription Count Trends within Counties,\" (http:///www.maine.gov/dhhs/osa/data/pmp/reports.htm ), accessed Dece mber 21, 2009. 6 Sabate, E.

For older adults, persons 65 and older repr esent 13% of the U.S. population yet consume about a third of prescriptions sold.11 Older patients also have the lowest prescription drug compliance rates of any age, including never filling their prescription, filling but not taking the prescription, taking only part of the doses, or taking less than the prescribed dose. 12 These behaviors occur in all age groups, not just elders, and result in an accumulation of medications in the household. The large, accumulating volume of unused pharmaceuticals not only poses potential dangers to communities and to the environment, 13 it also represents a significant over- expenditure of health care dollars. Pha rmaceutical drug residues have been found in many environmental contexts, including our sewer systems and our drinking water.14 In a recent study by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were found in 18 out of 19 samples of Maine water samples,15 with a majority of sites having three or more types of PPCPs present. Although research clearly shows the pres ence of pharmaceutical s and other personal care products in our water supply, the effe cts of these exposures on the environment will depend on many factors, including the specific chemicals involved and the variation in their effects on different organi sms. One topic that is of concern to some scientists is the impact on reproduction processes. 11 Prescription Drug Abuse Statistics. www.prescriptiondrugabuse.us/statistics-facts.html , accessed December 21, 2009. 12 Kocurek, B., \"Promoting medication adherence in older adults...and the rest of us.

Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 10 More research is needed to clarify both the short term and long term impacts on humans. In addition, research is needed to document the costs and benefits of various interventions. This project cont ributes to the ongoing discussion. What Is The Best Way To Dispose Of Medicines? Several basic methods are currently being us ed in the United States to dispose of unused medicines: flushing, throwing away and collecting. These approaches are reviewed in the Appendix in a document prepar ed by the Northern New England Poison Center (see the Medication Disposal Summary Report in Appendix Gr oup 4). Opinions about the best method for drug disposal vary widely. Benefits and costs of each method are different, and state legislatures have addressed these issues in different ways. The most important goals that conc erned citizens and legislatures focus on are (1) preventing poisoning, (2) preventing drug abus e, (3) ensuring the sa fety of patients, and (4) limiting environmental impacts. The method described in this handbook involves a statewide effort to collect drugs using a mail-back system, followed by high temperature incineration. This method has the advantages of prev enting unintentional poisonings, preventing access to medicines by drug abusers, and lim iting impact on the environment. It is not as i mmediately inexpensive to the community, or as convenient, as throwing away or flushing. However, throwing away and flushi ng may create long term environmental costs that communiti es may have to bear in the future. The mail-back mechanism has the advantag e of being continuously available to community members. Com pared to event-type community take-backs, the mail-back program does not contribute to hording medicines between take-back events, which might set the stage for diversion or poisonings. Medication Disposal Goals 1. Prevent poisoning 2. Prevent drug diversion & abuse 3. Ensure patient safety 4. Limit environmental damage Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 11 Mail-back programs incur immediate costs, involve substantial program management, and still require law enforcement collaboration as do other m odels. These costs should be balanced against the estimated costs of futu re environmental damage, as well as the societal costs of drug diversion and poisoning. An additional cost factor to consider is the drug waste within our medical system. Medication accumulates in households bec ause too much, or the wrong drug was prescribed; patients did not take the drugs, or did not take them as directed. These effects point to the importance of careful prescription management and patient education at the front end. How to Use This Handbook This handbook was produced as a general guide to organizations interested in developing a mail-back program in their state, region, corporate or affinity group. It is not meant as a step-by-step ma nual. Each state's laws and cultural context are unique. For example, responses and participation by particular stakeholders, such as law enforcement agencies, will vary greatly. A dditionally, ideas about prescription drug return programs will have evolved since wo rk began on this project two years ago. There must be recognition that Federal law and regulations has played a major role in shaping, and at times constraining, certain aspects of the mailback program design. Thus, we have provided an overview of the principles and guidelines to serve as a concept umbrella. Readers will find more spec ific material in the appendices. These documents may be of assistance as new pr ograms are developed and the guidelines are being implemented. Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 12 Helpful Appendices Included: Contact information for program leadership Organizations (state, federal, national, and international) that were involved, to provide ideas about stakeholders to include A detailed project conceptual timeline to assist in planning Legal and technical documents and agreements that link the project with multiple stakeholders Sample distribution site materials Helpline and volunteer information Instruction booklet for preparing and returning medicine Marketing and outreach materials Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 13 BUILDING A SOLID FOUNDATION Engaging Stakeholders: Community, Academic, and Government By the time the proposal to pilot the Mai ne mail-back program was written in 2007, a wide range of stakeholders had been engaged for several years in discussions with policy makers about Maine's prescription drug problem generally. A coalition, initially convened by the Maine Benzodiazepine Study Group (MBSG) and the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (MDEA), began to consider drug return programs as one solution beginning in 2002. Stakeholders were included in these discussions from children's advocacy, substance abuse treatment, law enforcem ent, environmental organizati ons, medical associations, university research programs, as well as le gislators and other po licy makers. Every effort was made to come to informal cons ensus as the work proceeded. Communication with Federal agencies was initiated early on in the process for general guidance and to ensure clarification of existing regulations. \"A major reason we went with a mailback program is that we're the third most rural state in the nation, our population is very dispersed, and we have a significant prescription drug problem. We believed mailback programming might be the most convenient and the least cumbersome method to use. We not only considered rurality issues, but also considered the vulnerability of populations who are less mobile, and less physically able to transport medications from one point to another.\" Lenard Kaye, D.S.W, Ph.D, Director and Professor, University of Maine Center on Aging Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 14 Detailed discussions and presentations of re search clarified the costs and benefits of various drug disposal approaches that had been tried, and highlight ed some of the program issues to be faced by the Maine progr am. These efforts ultimately stimulated the passage by State Legislat ion of Public Law 2003, C hapter 679, which formed the Maine Unused Pharmaceutical Disposal Program, and created the Maine Drug Return Implementation Group. This work group came to consensus that a mail-back approach would work best in Maine. Meeting the Challenges of a Rural and Aging State Maine ranks 38th in population density nationwide with fewer than 10 residents per square mile in over half of the state. This poses challenges to distribution and collection methods as well as financial challenges. Ma ine also has the oldest population in the country with a median age of 41.2 years (U nited States Census, 2005). Needing to travel long distances to bring unused drugs to a collection site would have posed problems for a substantial number of Maine's elders. Using the U. S. Postal Service system solves that problem bec ause virtually all of Maine's citizens have access to the mail. Selecting an Environmentally Sound and Legally Secure System In addition to the issues involved in securing and transporting drugs over long distances, there was controversy about the best way to dispose of them. Program leaders were aware of the research about the environmental hazards posed by drugs getting into the groundwater, either through fl ushing or solid waste disposal. Although the financial costs and impact on air quality we re also certainly important factors, incineration was ultimately chosen as the method of disposal for the mailback program as it would minimize environmental im pact. All drugs collected undergo high-heat incineration, according to the procedur e already established for Maine's law enforcement drug seizures. Incineration avoids the problems of direct contamination of wate r. The MDEA had been using this method to dispose of drugs from law enforcement seiz ures. The form of Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 15 incineration already in use by the MDEA wa s a controlled, high-heat process designed to convert waste to energy. (See Appendix 4E for a break down of other drug collection methods with their advantages and disadvantages.) Political Will and Partnerships Issues surrounding the collection and disposal of pharmaceuticals involve many professional, legal, and regulatory agencies. For this reason any proposed project should be founded upon an extensive network of professional and community partnerships. Development of these working relationships took several years prior to actual implementation of the Maine program and involved each of those acknowledged at the beginning of this handbook. Key project partners within Maine included the Maine Benz odiazepine Study Group, the Maine Department of Envir onmental Protection, the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency, the Maine Office of Substance Abuse, the Maine Department of Health, the Maine Office of the Attorney General, the U.S. Distric t Attorney for Maine, and the University of Maine Center on Aging. A technical expert advisory task force was formed that included members from each of these and a cadre of partnering organizations. The Community Advisory Group (explained in more deta il later) provided a cr itical consumer perspective, including the perspectives of i ndividuals involved \"at the front line:\" the project volunteers handling comm unity education and marketing. The Maine Department of Health and Human Services and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection both provided as sistance with public education and outreach in Phase I and II, and a representative from each group acted as their organization's liaison to the project. A number of state and national specialists and associations also committed to the project. Both the Community Medical Foun dation for Patient Safety and the National Council on Patient Information and Education agreed to enlist their staff to review instructions and informational materials to be distributed to distributions sites and mail-Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 16 back participants. Rite Aid Cor poration, the nation's third largest drugstore chain and the largest on the east coast, formally committed to participation in the pilot project with their pharmacies serving as distribution site locations. Researchers from the Univer sity of Maine Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center committed to project evaluation and to act as an outside advisor to the project on matters related to drug disposal. In Maine, there has also been a key legislativ e component to coalition building. In 2003, the Maine Benzodiazepine Study Group and the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency convened a group of stakeholders from various sectors and professions including children's advocacy, environmental and medi cal organizations, and higher education research units. The Center on Aging at the University of Maine assumed the administrative coordination of the project. The group's focus was to create legislative solutions to the problem of diversi on, misuse and abuse of prescription drug medications. A legislative mandate, P ublic Law 2003, Chapter 679, 16 created the Maine Unused Pharmaceutical Disposal Program and tasked the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency with the program's administrat ion. The Maine Drug Return Implementation Group was also formed. This group was tasked with addressing postal regulations, methods and requirements for mailing, minimizing drug diversion and theft of mailed returns, providing public education, and encouraging the development of turn-in programs. This mandate encouraged the impl ementation group to seek outside funds. A grant proposal was made to the U.S. EPA Aging Initiative to pilot the program (findings and activities covered in this report). In 2007, the Maine Legislature enacted Mai ne LD 411 \"An Act to Establish a Pilot Program for the Return of Unused Prescription Drugs by Mail.\" This initiative provided 16 See http://www.maineleg islature.org/ros /LOM/LOM121st/15Pub651-700/Pub651-700- 126.htm#P9390_1232537 Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 17 an additional $150,000 to the pilot which al lows the program to continue for an additional two years beyond the initial EPA grant. Partnering with Law Enforcement is a Key Component Close partnership with the Maine Drug En forcement Agency (MDEA) provided the critical involvement of law enforcement. By law, only law enforcement entities are permitted to receive and handle returned pharmaceutical drugs classified as Schedules II, III, and IV, which includes narcotic analgesics, sedatives, and stimulants. 17 Their involvement is necessary to insure security , to prevent drug diversion, and because the law requires it. Because of the likelihood that controlled substances would be an important subset of the re turned drugs, the MDEA agreed to oversee receipt of drugs returned via this program. Maine's mail-back program also required partnership with the MDEA in order to facilitate use of the already-established incineration disposal method, as well as to actually transfer the returned drugs for incineration. Selecting a Central Coordinating Agency From this base, the University of Maine C enter on Aging (CoA) took the leadership role in seeking funding for a pilot study from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Aging Initiative. The Center on Aging has a number of characte ristics that were advantageous for this role. First, as a departm ent within the Universi ty, the Center is a qualified non-profit organization and therefore able to receive federal funding. The CoA has the institutional base to act as the fiscal and administrative agent for what was to become a highly visible and complex project. This includes qualified personnel, experience with community/academic/government partnerships, and accessible, centrally-located headquarters that can house meetings and coordinate communications. 17 DEA Schedule of Controlled Drugs, h ttp://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/csa.html Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 18 In addition, the CoA is well-known statewide and trusted by co mmunities and elder networks. They have established communi cation vehicles (website, newsletter, on- going functions) to facilitate the education an d marketing so essential for an innovative project. The social network qualifications of the CoA proved to be beneficial during all phases of the project. Developing Organization Capacity The following sections of this report pr ovide some basic guidelines in developing organizational capacity to address the problem of unused pharmaceuticals. If you are just starting a program it is important to refine your organiza tion's intentions and clarify how you wish to proceed. In other words, agreeing on a mission, goals, and objectives. This is a necessary step not only in focusi ng your organization's resources, but also a requirement in order to seek external funding. Each organization will be different. For t hat reason, we begin each of the following three sections with basic instructions that can be applied broadly. We then use our program as a specific example. Developing a Program Mission This first step focuses on your organization's values with respect to the problem or set of problems confronting your community. The mission stat ement should express what you want your organization to be in relationship to that problem? Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 19 You might begin by constructing the following: \"We are [ insert a phrase that describes who you are as a group] who agree on the importance of [ insert value/values] in addressing [ insert problem you want to solve] , we will [ insert what you have agreed to do about it]. After you decide on these components, you can edit the statement to make it flow better, for example: As an academic-community part nership concerned with the environmental risks posed by the accumulation of unused household pharmaceuticals, we work together enthusiastically to s upport and implement a successful mail-back program. Goals, Objectives and Outcomes Deciding on goals, objectives, and outcomes will help your organization do more effective planning and implementation. Arti culation of these program components is usually required by funding agencies. Check carefully with the agency funding announcements, however, because agencies may di ffer in exactly how they define these terms. Goals are the general targets your program will aim for, usually phrased as some sort of societal improvement. Setting goals is simila r to setting a navigation course by pointing your sights toward a star or a distant land mass. Goal statements can then be clarified by defining and discussing concepts and terms used in the goal statements. In contrast, objectives are specific, observable acco mplishments that demonstrate progress toward the program goals, or even define ultimate goal achievement. Objectives can be mid-range or long-range. They can function as benchmarks or Sample Mission: As an academic community partnership concerned with the environmental risks posed by the accumulation of unused household pharmaceuticals, we work together enthusiastically to support and implement a successful mailback program. Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 20 milestones, signals along the way that let you know your e fforts are successful as you move toward a goal. Or, long term objecti ves can be used to operationalize success in arriving at the program goal. Objectives should be indicators that can be agreed upon, even by an observer or evaluator outside your organization. Objectives are useful for planning; they constitute the day-to-day things the organiza tion must actually mobilize it self to do. They should be phrased in such a way that an administrator can use them in order to make decisions about how to direct resources and personnel. Maine's Goals and Objectives The goals for a prescription drug return program in Maine, were two-fold: 1) to devise, implement and evaluate a mail-back plan to remove unused and unwanted medications, both prescription and over-the-counter, from residences and dispose of them in compliance with applicable state and federal laws and sound environmental practices, and 2) to test the effectiveness of an educational campaign about the hazards to life, health, and the environment posed by improper storage and disposal of unwanted medications. A cost- effective model for the disposal of unwanted medication would be created and implemented, and an educational campaign woul d be instituted in each of Maine's 16 counties. Further, the projec t would address potential barriers to participation due to age, infirmity, rural locale, and other challenges. Maine's Goals 1. To devise, implement and evaluate a mail back model 2. To test effectiveness of an educational campaign about risks of improper storage and disposal 3. Develop a framework for a national model and ensure replicability Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 21 Maine developed a list of 15 milestones and completion dates, which functioned in effect as intermediate program objectives. These included first a model development phase: (1) develop consolidation, transportati on, and incineration protocols; (2) contract with incineration facilities and transportation vendors; (3) commence meetings of technical advisor task force; (4) secure network of 75 mailer distribution points (pharmacies); (5) engage community advis ory board and commence meetings; (6) design and produce mailers, mailer survey, training materials for distribution site educators, and instructions for pharmaci es and the public; (7) create web site and establish a toll-free helpline and helpline training materials; (8) engage and train distribution site educators; (9) develop public education campaign content and dissemination plan. The implementation included a Phase I to pilot the program components, specifically: (1) launch Phase I education campaign; (2) distribute informational materials and provide traini ng for pharmacists, staff, and individuals acquiring mailers; (3) collect, inventory, and destroy returned products from Phase I locations in compliance with applicable state and federal laws and sound environmental practices statewide; and (4) evaluate Phase I and refine for Phase II. Phase I program components were implemented and designed to specifically target older adults and caregivers. Objective milestones for Phase II included: (1) distribute informational materials and provide training for pharmacists, staff, and individuals acquiring maile rs for Phase II; (2) collect, inventory and destroy returned products; (3) generate, analyze and report on survey and inventory data in a manner that allows physicians, pharmacists, insurance companies, patients, and others to modify behaviors to minimize unused medications; Nuts & Bolts Mission Develop a program mission that expresses in simple terms what you want your organization to be. Goals Decide on program goals that express what you want your program to aim for in its work overall. Objectives Define mediumterm and longer term objectives, that is, clear benchmarks that need to be accomplished along the way in order to demonstrate you are achieving your goals. Outcomes Describe the measureable outcomes that will result if you have met your goals. Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 22 (4) evaluate need for Phase III (and institute as necessary); (5) conduct final evaluation; and (6) publish best practices handbook. It is important to note that Phase II expanded the program exposure to populat ion groups beyond older adults. Maine's long term program objectives incl uded: 1) calculating the weight, type and hazardous characteristics of returned medications by actual pill count and drug classification; 2) calculating the cost of the mail- back program as a model for future use nationally, by other organizations and stat es; and 3) offering a statewide education campaign targeted toward the proper use and disposal of prescription drugs with an initial focus on citizens 65 and older. Projected outcomes included: 1) understanding the practicality and costs associated with a mail back medication return program; 2) information on the best methods to educate older adults concerning the hazards of unused medications and improper disposal; 3) reduction in the amount of medications availa ble for improper disposal, diversion or poisoning; and 4) heightened aw areness by the public-at-large and older adults in particular that could lead to a reduction in accidental deaths, human and animal poisonings, and suicides caused by unused medications. Maine's Expected Outcomes 1. An understanding of the model's practicality and costs 2. Information on best methods to educate older adults about hazards of unused and improperly disposed medications 3. A reduction in the medications in Maine available for improper disposal, diversion or poisoning 4. Heightened public awareness, especially in older adults, of the risks caused by accumulated or improperly disposed medications Maine's Long Term Program Objectives 1. Conduct a statewide educational campaign on proper use and disposal 2. Calculate weight, type, and hazardous characteristics of returned medication 3. Calculate the cost of the mailback program modelSafe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 23 THE BASICS OF THE PROGRAM Why Maine Mailback Partic ipants Use the Program Findings from program participant surveys from the Maine SMDM E program itemized multiple reasons for drug accumula tion in their homes, including: Medicine belonged to a deceased family member (19.6%) A physician told the patient to stop taki ng the medication or gave the patient a new prescription (27.3%) The person had a negative reaction or allergy to the medicine (11.9%) The person felt better or no longer needed the medicine (18%) Participants also noted multiple reasons fo r removing the drugs from their homes, including concerns for the environment, drug compliance, drug safety, as well as for preventing drug diversion. Some noted t hey did not want anyone else to use the medicine. Some were concerned about the pot ential poisoning dangers to children, or the risks of drug abuse diversion. Often t he medicine was expired or outdated and no longer useful. In some cases this adds to their potential for misuse or harm. Figure 1. Motivation for Using the Mailback Program Motivation for Using the Mailback Program N = 1828 77%16%4%3% Best for the environment Safest for me and my family Free to use Most convenient Nearly half (46%) of those surveyed repor ted that, in the absence of a take back program, they would have flushed drugs down the toilet. Another one third (37%) would Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 24 have dumped left over prescriptions into their trash. These disposal solutions can pose environmental risks. Overwhelmingly, 77% of program survey respondents cited participation because, \"it's best for the environment.\" Refining the Concept: The Mail-Back Model There are five primary models for drug take-back progr ams. The first, a pharmacy- based take back program, which is considered to be a controversial approach nationally. Because returned medications oft en include Schedules II, III, and IV drugs, which have a higher abuse potential, the DEA r egulations require that they be received and transported by law enforcement personnel. In-person event-driven take back programs, the second model, are coordinated locally (community-by-community) and would take the commitment of multiple police departments and multiple law enf orcement agencies to enact a statewide program. Such events are offered sporadically and rely on local law enforcement to shoulder the time commitment and costs associat ed with take back programming. The third and fourth models, police depar tment drop-off and pick-up, are emerging models that have been developed through local community policing efforts. Both models are not yet widely available but continue to grow in popularity in local communities. The fifth model, a statewide mail-back prescription return program, was most appropriate for Maine. It allows drugs to be returned directly to one agency, which reduces coordination costs. In Maine, the Maine Dr ug Enforcement Agency (MDEA) has statewide jurisdiction and had been involved in concept development. It was therefore the most appropriate for piloting in Maine. The statewide mail-back model Overwhelmingly, 77% of program survey respondents cited participation because, \"it's best for the environment.\" Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 25 offers a centralized coordination component, adds an element of confidentiality and anonymity not found with in-person take back programs, and is the least burdensome of all models in terms of consumer partici pation (see Appendix 4E for a comprehensive review of various models). Figure 2. Center on Aging staff member orients a participating pharmacist to the program Tasks Leading Up to the Actual Mailback Before a mailback can begin, there are a number of preliminar y tasks that must be accomplished. In Maine, this included t he following (see Appendix 3 for complete timeline): Create consolidation, transporta tion, and incineration protocols Contract with incineration fac ilities and transportation contractors Commence meetings of technical advisory task force Secure network of distribution points (pharmacies, community sites, etc.) to which mailers are distributed in both phases The statewide mail-back model offers centralized coordination..., adds ...confidentiality..., and is the least burdensome of all models in terms of consumer participation. Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 26 Engage community advisory board members Commence meetings of community advisory board Design and create mailers and accom panying survey, training materials for Distribution Site Educators and instructions for pharmacies and public Create web site, establis h 800 number call center and create related training materials and protocols Engage and train Distri bution Site Educators Develop education campaign content and communication dissemination plan Launch Phase I education campaign Distribute informational materials for pharmacists, staff, and individuals acquiri ng mailers for Phase I; provide training The Bottom Line: Costs and Funding Below is the actual phase I and II budget fo r the Maine program. As noted, the per- envelope cost in the initial y ears of the program is significa nt given the staff time and effort needed to create a novel program. Addi tionally, the value of donated time from pharmacists and pharmacy tech staff total ed approximately $800 for each inventory event toward the end of the project period. The time and effort contributed by Community Educator volunteers was calculat ed to be $20.25/hour as estimated by the Independent Sector.18 18 www.independentsector.org Figure 3. Each pharmacy receives a program sign to market the availability of envelopes Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 27 Now that piloting has been completed for t he program, the administr ative costs for the program have been reduced considerably. Below is the currently two-year operational budget for the mailback program which incl udes enough funding to distribute and process 20,000 mailback envelopes from across the state. Phase I and II Actual Program Costs (9,400 envelopes, 42% return rate) Budget Line Actual Cost Envelopes (including freight); supplies and materials $6,214.38 Assembly and printing (assumes color printing and survey printing and assembly) $9,358.62 Postage including PO Box permit $11,310.22 Disposal for both controlled and non-controlled drugs (2,123 pounds non-controlled and 250 lbs controlled) $ 7,111.00 DEA staff costs, data analysis consultants, research consultants $21,402.13 Website and Phone costs (User support) $4,237.53 Travel for activities/program Subtotal and Total cost: $150,000.00 Per unit cost: $15.96 In-kind provided to the project in Phases I and II $26,607.13 Per unit cost factoring both actual costs and in-kind provide d $18.79 In-kind d etail: 9,000 mailers donated by Polyair Manufacturing: Time and effort donated by Principal Investigator: $11,130; Pharmacist and pharmacy staff donated time: $6,400; Community Educator volunteers (330 hours x $20.25 per hour value): $6,682.50 Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 28 Phase III Two-Year Budget Base of 20,000 envelopes, 30% return rate assumption Envelopes (including freight) $6,200 Assembly and printing (assumes color printing and survey printing and assembly) $12,000 Postage ($2.50 average per returned envelope) $15,150 Postage Fees (permit and PO Box for one year) $1,850 Disposal $16,000 DEA staff costs $10,200 Cataloging, data entry, data cleaning, reporting (pharmacist time, data entry staffing) $12,000 General supplies $3,800 Website and phone costs (User support) $2,805 Travel for cataloging/research activities/program administration $3,000 Staff time-program support costs) $2,000 Subtotal $132,511 Indirect costs (13.4%) charged on all direct costs except volunteer/participant support $17,489 Total cost: $150,000 Per unit cost: $7.50 * budget assumes 30% return rate after Phases I & II Implementation Structure The Safe Medicine Disposal for ME mail-ba ck model was conceived in two phases and has since moved into a third phase: Phase I Overview: In this pilot program, 1,800 postage-paid, padded mailers were made available to consumers at 11 pre-selected pharmacies in four Maine counties (see Figure 4). Counties were selected for t heir geographic disparity, access to rural and urban communities, and demographic characteristics of residents (age, socioeconomics, education, culture, lifestyle, etc.). This initial phase allowed staff to monitor the program, pilot protocols, and revise as needed before Phase II implementation went statewide. Phase I di d not include marketing strategies or a public education component, and there was limit ed press coverage of the program. Only persons aged 65 or older and their ca regivers were encouraged to participate. Phase II Overview : Safe Medicine Disposal for ME went statewide in Phase II with 7,600 mailers available in all 16 Maine co unties (see Figure 4). Initial envelope distributions to sites during this phase were based on county population size. Pharmacies continued to be the primary poi nt of distribution for program envelopes, although site selection expande d to include health agencies, doctors' offices, social Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 29 service programs, and Area Agencies on Aging. This phase included a public education component with extensive, target ed marketing urging individuals into distribution centers for the purpose of picking up and using return mailers. All age groups and caregivers were eligible to participate in the program. Phase III Overview : During Phase III the program wa s expanded to additional sites within the state's 16 counties (see Figur e 5). The program remains open to participants of all ages. Safe Medicine Disposal for ME The Process At a Glance Distribution sites are solicited and trained (Appendix Group 5 includes Distribution Site materials) Volunteer staff are trained (Appendix Groups 6 includes Helpline and Volunteer materials) Brochures and other educational materials are created, and volunteer staff begin presentations in communities (Appendix Group 8 includes Consumer Education Items) Volunteer staff distribute postage-paid, padded return envelopes to pharmacies and other health and social service agencies across the state at no cost. (Appendix Group 7 includes information on Mailback Materials). Pharmacy and agency staff give an envelope which includes an instruction packet (Appendix 7A) and a consumer survey (Appendix 7C) to any interested participant. o Participants are asked to use a black permanent marker to write over the name of the person for whom the prescription was written. They are asked not to write over the name of the medicine or the dose. o Liquids or creams are to be wrapped in a paper towel and placed in a Ziploc bag. o Sealed medicine bottles along with any Ziploc bags of liquid are to be put into the padded self-addressed return envelope and sealed. Participants return the completed survey and drugs to the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (MDEA) using the postage-paid return envelope provided. Participants are asked to write down the envelope code written on the corner of the medicine envelope and call the program help line to leave a message with the envelope code and the date it was mailed. Envelopes are received and held by the U.S. postal service. Drug enforcement agency officials pick up collected envelopes periodically and take to a secure central location where they are logged and catalogued. Questionnaires are returned to the Center on Aging for analysis at the time of cataloging. Medicine is destroyed via incineration.

Map of Phase I and Phase II distribution locations showing township population density Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 31 Figure 5. Map of Phase III distribution locat ions showing township population density Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 32 The Mailer Center on Aging staff tested a variety of padded mailers. There are many to choose from depending on project budget constraints, and selecting the size of a chosen mailer will have cost implications. Minimally, ma ilers need to have a tamper-evident seal and should be nondescript--not easily identifiable as containing drugs. Mailers chosen for Safe Medicine Disposal for ME are 7.25 x 12 inches and can hold four different bottles of prescriptions and six to eight ounces of drugs, although it has held up to a pound of drugs. The specific mailer chosen was the XPak mailer manufactured by Polyair. 19 Figure 6. Stack of mailback envelopes In Maine, each mailer is accompanied by a questionnaire along with an instruction booklet on how to properly prepare and mail the envelope (see Appendix Group 7). The questionnaire is designed to assess the nature of the returned product(s) as well as reasons for their return. Information collected includes basic demographic data, source of contents, patient identification of contents and reasons for surplus. During Phases I & II, 9,400 envelopes we re distributed and 3,926 envelopes were returned generating 2,373 pounds of unused and unwanted medicines. As reported by the Community Medical Foundation for Pati ent Safety, almost 17% of medications returned through the Maine Program were f ound to be controlled drugs (see \"What We Have Discovered\" section of this report). Older medications have not been uncommon; some of the prescriptions returned were noted to be twenty or more years old. It is also 19 For more information visit www.xpak.com Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 33 estimated that several of the envelopes returned to date have contained enough unused narcotics to net thousands of do llars if sold on the street. The Mail System & The USPS In Maine, an \"operational test agreement\" was formed between the U.S. Postal Service and the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency - the first of its kind. Operational test agreements are traditionally craft ed so the postal service can test out novel options. These agreements are time limited contracts, and each state will need to pursue an agreement within their own state. Because there had been no previous template for this sort of agreement, the process in Maine took more than a year to finalize. Important decisions to be made include the type of mailer to be used, how to educate the public about the program, and how to ensure the safe delivery of envelopes to the receiving drug enforcement agency. A copy of the Memo of Understanding between the U.S. Postal Service and the Maine Dr ug Enforcement Agency is provided in Appendix 4D. Figure 7. Phase I envelope shipments to distribution sites were prepared in-house at the Center on Aging Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 34 Figure 8. CoA staff member prepares Phase I envelope shipment to pharmacies Figure 9. Phase I boxes ready for shipment to program sites When The Mailers Come In, Then What? Using a double verification process, MDEA law enforcement personnel count and collect returned mailers from the Post Offi ce on a regularly scheduled basis and take them directly to a secure consolidation facility. The audit process involves a repeat count of the number of packages received a nd verification of accounting logs conducted by the UMaine Center on Aging. Throughout the pr ocess the MDEA maintains continuous, unbroken custody of the returned medicine. Cataloging of returned drugs was done under law enforcement supervision by volunteer project pharmacists and pharmacy students. As participation has increased over time, Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 35 the program has moved from cataloging 100% of returns to a 25% random sample to a 20% random sampling procedure. Using a sa mpling method was found to be both cost effective and yielded a data sample that wa s statistically repres entative of the full inventory data set. For the envelopes that do not receive a full inventory, all non- controlled drugs are sorted for di sposal, and all controlled drugs are fully inventoried. During the cataloging, drugs were sorted ac cording to whether they were controlled drugs or not and further into controlle d hazardous or controlled non-hazardous categories.20 This sorting method facilitates appr opriate disposal and therefore helps control disposal costs. Figure 10. Volunteer pharmacists and pharmacy staff inventory returned medicine Figure 11. Boxes of inventoried medicine Figure 12. Drugs are occasionally returned mixed together and without their original container. Figure 13. Returned consumer surveys collected at a drug inventory event. 20 Very few drugs have been found to be both controlled and hazardous. Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 36 Disposal Mechanics Various methods of disposal, good and bad, for collected prescription drugs have been traditionally used by consumers and facilities including: flushing down the toilet, throwing medication out in the trash, burying in a landfill, burning, or mixing substances with kitty litter and used coffee grounds to make results undesirable. In Maine, drug disposal options were to be considered if they satisfied the requirements and standards of the Department of Envi ronmental Protection and the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency. Maine DEP has classifi ed drug returns as hazardous waste, while other states may classify drugs differently. All non-cont rolled drugs collected by the mailback were incinerated as hazardous waste. All cont rolled drugs were disposed of through incineration with a witness from the Maine Dr ug Enforcement Agency to certify that the drugs were in fact destroyed. Collection, Inventory and Disposal Requirements In compliance with the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency and the Department of Environmental Protection, drug collection, inventory and disposal included the following elements: 1) Double verification of returns 2) One secure collection and consolidation facility 3) Repeat count of the number of packages that have been received 4) Proper disposal of all drugs colle cte d 5) Continuous, unbroken custody by law enforcement from receipt to disposal Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 37 Volunteer Workforce: Elder Invol vement is a Critical Component It cannot be stressed enough how important volunteers, in particular older adult volunteers, are to the progr am. The first two external groups to be developed, the Community Advisory Board and the Distribut ion Site Educators, are outlined below. Members were recruited by print, broadcast, and word-of-mouth. In Phase I, the 15-member Community Advisory Board was comprised of volunteers age 65 and older recruited from the Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), Maine Area Agencies on Aging, and other older adult organizations and associations from urba n, rural, and suburban areas in each county represented in the pilot project. Board members reflected the population's diversity by gender, socioeconomic status, and education. In the early stages, Community Advisory Board members attended monthly meetings and acted as a sounding board for the pr oject, in part to review br ochures, instruction booklets, and marketing strategies for applicability to an elder community. The board has also provided valuable insight into the rural Ma ine communities represented by individual members. Volunteer Distribution Site Educators incl uded community members from around the state and Community Advisory Board members. In Phase I, their purpose was to deliver mailers and materials and to educate distribution site pharmacists and staff about the program process. This role wa s discontinued for a variety of reasons, one being that pharmacies were often too busy to meet with Educators and orientation materials as designed were fairly self-expla natory. Beginning in Phase II, Educators organized and attended meetings at local C hambers of Commerce, Kiwanis clubs, senior centers, and nursing homes to educat e members of their own communities about Figure 14. Community Educator volunteer orients community pharmacist to the mailback program Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 38 the mail-back program. Presentations included a PowerPoint slideshow, a presentation quiz, and handouts (Appendix Group 8). Evaluation data for community education sessions were gathered via a post-session survey tool. One hundred and fifty-one su rveys (151) from education session participants were gathered and analyzed. Pa rticipants in community outreach and education presentations range in age from 20 to over 80 years old. The majority of participants were within the 60-80+ age range. Eighty-seven per cent of participants are female and 13% are male. Ninety-four percent (94%) of participants had never participated in a community drug disposal event prior to attending the education session. This indicates that the present ation is often touching upon new topics and disposal issues to which participants had not yet been exposed. Ninety-seven percent (97%) rated the overall drug disposal presentation as \"good\" or \"exc ellent.\" The average exam score on post-presentation evaluations was 95/100 indicating that the training has a high level of impact on knowledge. A sa mpling of comments from education session participants: Very helpful/informative This information is very important! Hank (CAB volunteer) has a wonderful way of presenting and relating to people. His talk was very well received by fo lks at the Knox county TRIAD meeting Very necessary information! Well done! Lynn (CAB volunteer) was great with the women attending! Well done! / Good job! Important information-much needed in our community! It is my understanding when people take me ds, then urinate, the meds end up in the sanitation systems and cause gender confusion. Great! Entertaining and informative An additional avenue for volunteering with the Maine program was the use of volunteer pharmacists from distribution sites who were recruited to catalogue returned drugs. Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 39 Pharmacy tech staff and students volunteered their time under supervision of the pharmacists to assist in data collection. Th is assistance was provided by Miller Drug, a local community pharmacy, volunteer licens ed pharmacists, along with faculty and staff from Husson University School of Pharma cy, and the University of New England College of Pharmacy. Communication Systems The mailback program utilized several project- specific communication vehicles, two-way communication \"channels,\" to stay in touch with a primary network of advisors and to interact with the public: meetings, a consumer website, and a helpline. In addition, the Center's newsletter Silverwire often contained proj ect updates. Two-way communication allowed the project to be responsive to unanticipated problems. Regular meetings of both t he Technical Advisory Board and the Community Advisory Board offered an opportunity for the project staff to share successes and problem-solve, and to receive and send feedback to/from the public and other concerned stakeholders. The project website (www.safemeddisposal.com) provided a \"one-stop-shopping\" solution for people who wanted to know about the project or check policy changes. The website was heavily used by both local and out-of-state persons interested in the project. In addition, website vi sitors were able to send an ema il inquiry to pr oject staff. During the last most recent reporting peri od, for example, pr oject staff received approximately one email a day during the work week. E-mail was used most by caregivers and professionals. Caregiver r equests were usually for an envelope to be mailed to them because a nearby site lo cation was not available via the program. Professional inquirie s tended to come from pharmacies and other sites interested in participating in the program. Additional requests that came in by e-mail were from other states looking for information on the progr am for replication purposes. A sampling of states requesting information about the program model include: Oregon, Washington, D.C.; New York; California; Florida; New Hampshire; and Washington. As an example Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 40 of the national impact of the pilot, please se e the U.S. Postal Service press release in appendix group 4. The helpline, which was sta ffed by student interns, prov ed to be a very critical component of the program communication system. This phone number was liberally circulated to pharmacies and community site s, and was found on virtually all program informational material. During a recent th ree-month reporting period, the project received 727 calls, an average of more than 10 a day during the workweek. Two thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven (2,777) calls were received over the 2.5 year reporting period. Many of these have been from individuals ca lling the program to alert staff that they were mailing an envelope . Additional sources of inquiries included pharmacies, healthcare, and community site s that are interested in becoming established distribution sites. Thus the hel pline functions in recruitment as well as information exchange. Feedback Loops: Tracking and Evaluation Feedback loops existed as a function of the evaluation forms distributed at each community education event. These events were usually staffed by volunteer community educators trained for the project. In additi on, each mailer contained a short survey, which was designed to learn about the demographic profile of the participant, the reasons for participating, the sources of the drugs, and the reason they had accumulated. Communication \"Channels\" 1. Advisory board meetings 2. Project website 3. Project helpline 4. Agency newsletter 5. Media releases 6. Public presentations 7. Evaluation forms at community education sessions 8. Survey instruments inside mailers Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 41 But beyond these basic tracking mechanisms, a thoughtful program evaluation should be a critical component of any publicly funde d effort. Without we ll-designed evaluation methods, programs do not have systematic ways to measure success, to improve systems, or (minimally) to programmatically account for their expenditure of public monies. Program evaluations should track and acc ount for whether the program meets is benchmarks along the way as outlined in the workplan (formative evaluation). These feedback mechanisms should be built into the pr oject's internal information systems. In addition, program evaluations should assess whether the project met its overall goals, as indicated by measurable outcomes (summati ve evaluation). Programs often find it challenging to identify outcome measures that clearly reflect the efforts of the project in achieving its goals. If they are to be used for quality improvement, outcome measures should ideally be selected to reflect processes over which the project has some control and which move it toward its selected goals. In other word s, depending on the outcomes, one should be able to actively \"tweak\" the systems, if nece ssary, in order to get an improved result. The link between program effort and its outcome should be clear (visible) and measurable (ideally by an objective observer) in either qualitative or quantitative terms. It is only when both the process and outcome s are documented that the program has the potential to become \"evi dence-based,\" evidence being the best source of informed policy. Public Relations and Marketing A unique education campaign wa s implemented for Maine in two phases. In Phase I, education provided by the program was done via the program website and program brochures and tipsheets. The purpose of these materials was to enlighten the public on the hazards to life and health posed by unus ed drugs. The explicit message and goal was to reduce/eliminate unused medication s in circulation and improper disposal Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 42 because of the significant potential for human and environmental harm as well as to advance public knowledge about protecting, sustaining and restoring the environment. The Phase II campaign built upon the messages established in Phase I and incorporated a new message encouraging the public to visit distribution sites statewide to acquire and use mailers. Phase II education e fforts were rolled out locally via multiple media channels and local in-person presentations by volunteers in a more extensive and purposeful fashion than in Phase I to measure the impact that such education would have on the use of the program. Because of the higher rate of pharmaceutic al usage among older adults and the higher risk of accidental misuse and/or overdose wit hin this population, special emphasis was placed on crafting cohort-specific me ssages during both phases and utilizing communication channels targeti ng specific user groups. Effective Use of the Media Communication with the public via print, digi tal, and broadcast media constitutes an essential part of program planning (see A ppendix Group 9). The Univ ersity of Maine's Public Affairs department was routinely used as a vehicle to develop and circulate press releases. Staff generated program drafts of press releases and welcomed input from those who specialize in this type of commu nication. Relationships between programs and such specialists, including public info rmation officers, journalists, news anchors, and other writers can be very helpful in des igning interesting and appropriate material that targets particular readerships/audiences. They used material the program generates and augmented it for their particula r purpose, sometimes with an interview of program staff or program volunteers. Program staff encouraged volunteers and partner or ganizations to \"get the word out\" by providing basic informational materials so t hat there was a uniform source for basic facts and concepts while leaving room for each outlet to augment the material as appropriate. For example, a media temp late was provided to local papers and community contacts that could be used as a backdrop for a story about a local person, Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 43 group, or educational event. An example of the template is included in Appendix Group 9. Material generated for local community educati on, such as PowerPoint presentations, was made accessible for interested and involved ci tizens to use. This accessibility is important in increasing the speed at which a new idea (the drug mailback concept) can reach a large number of people. In this way, media and publicity efforts dovetailed with the heavy use of volunteers for outr each, training, and communication. The Value of Research Whether or not you plan to do any formal res earch as a part of your mailback program, research findings will nevertheless flow from your efforts. The experience gained by conceiving, planning, and implementing this program will include c onclusions based on information. It will probably also incl ude evaluation findings about how you reached your objectives, how well certain efforts wo rked, and ways your program is similar or different than others like ours. We strongly recommend that , at a minimum, you take advantage of your experience by carefully documenting your plans, progress, and experience. Your documented fi ndings will be of use in (1) educating others about your program, (2) building political support for future programs, (3) writing proposals to funding agencies to obtain fundi ng, and (3) designing public policies in your region and nationally. Simply collecting weight or es timated dollar value of the drug returns collected provides very little precise data on which to formulate policy or useful insights on drug accumulation. Some levels of research are limited by res ources, but should be attempted if possible. In particular, cataloging the drugs retur ned requires secure settings and professional input from pharmacists and healthcare volunteers, as well as some research skills to analyze the results. Ideally, funding is allo cated in your budget ahe ad of time for some research. Sometimes, as is the case for the Maine program, vo lunteers can boost your efforts. For example, loca l schools of pharmacy may be interested in using this as an educational experience for st udents. The program also partnered with the Community Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 44 Medical Foundation for Patient Safety in Texas, which is working to establish a national database of drug returns to assist in research design and data analysis. Take-back programs are in their infancy, but growing fast. Because of their potential impact on environmental policy, healthcare policy, and public safety, it is very important that good data are developed describing t heir scope and impact. Knowledge about the amount of excess drugs collected in Mai ne has been informative in refining Maine Medicaid policy, for example, leading to limits for some drugs on how much can be prescribed (see Appendix 4F regarding the new 15-Day Rule ). And the Maine state legislature, along with other states, is c onsidering new product st ewardship laws that would require pharmaceutical companies to cover the cost of drug disposal. What We Have Discovered with Our Program Research The short survey included with each mailback envelope yielded vast amounts of data on the demographic characteristics of participants, the reasons drugs had accumulated in their households, and reasons for participat ing in the program. Each envelope has a code number pre-printed on the front which allo ws for linking survey data directly to drug inventory data. Several databases ar e currently maintained by the program including: envelope tracking and distribution databases, a survey database, a database with community education session evaluatio ns, drug inventory data, and helpline communication logs. These data are valuable in dicators for future programs and helpful for designing program materi als and community education. As the program continued into Phase II, increasing demand by non-pharmacy organizations lead to the expansion of distribution channels to a wider range of distribution sites, includi ng home health agencies, doctor' s offices, social service programs, and Area Agenc ies on Aging. After examining returns patterns, a trend was noted that revealed that returns are directly related to the population size within the areas where sites are located. However, t he rate of return fo r each site was not calculated. As such, site locations and distribution patterns for the program were modified to ensure that envelope stock is us ed in an efficient and appropriate manner. Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 45 Maine's program was targeted for elders in itially, although program staff quickly anticipated that it m ade sense to expand to adults of al l ages given the drug abuse and death trends within the state. However, it was discovered that starting with older, retired citizens was a very effective strategy to launc h this new concept. First of all, they are likely to have more prescriptions and more lik ely to be willing and available to assist in the program as volunteers. The average age of pr ogram users in Phase I was found to be 70 years of age; once the program opened up to adults of all ages, the average age of program participants (those who return drugs using the envelopes) was found to be 59 years, with 65% of parti cipants being female. Households participating in the mailback program were more likely to have adults rather than children living in the household. However, nearly one quarter of the participating households had a teenager Safe Medicine Disposal for ME Phases I & II Snapshot $150,000 in funding provided by the U.S. EPA to pilot in Phases I & II 9,400 envelopes distributed 3,926 envelopes collected (42% return rate) Over 380,000 pills cataloged via the drug inventory process 2,074 surveys collected and analyzed 2,777 telephone calls answered via the program helpline 2,123 pounds of noncontrolled drugs destroyed 250 pounds of controlled drugs destroyed Average weight of a returned envelope: 7 ounces Estimate Average wholesale price (AWP) of medicine collected: $572,772.35 (US Dollars)* Value of donated envelopes by Polyair, donated time by Principal Investigator, pharmacist, student, and volunteer time donated to the program: $26,607.13** Percentage of individuals using trash or toilet to dispose of drugs prior to the program = 83% x 2,373 lbs of drugs = 1,970 lbs of drugs prevented from entering the water supply and landfills *Estimate provided by Community Medical Foundation for Patient Safety based on sampling.

The most frequent reason given wa s that the medicines were now expired or outdated .21 The second most common reason was that the doctor had told the patient to stop taking the medicine. Other reasons were that t he doctor had given them a new prescription, that they had had a negative reaction or allergy to the medicine, or that the patient felt better or no longer needed the medicine. A substantial number of participants wanted to prevent anyone else from using the medicine. The open- response option for this question also yielded a considerable portion of respondents who were returning medicine for a deceased loved one. Based on these data, we began tracking the portion of respondents returning medicine for a deceased family member or friend. Most drugs returned vi a the program were obtained at a local pharmacy (84%) or by mail (14%). 21 Older medications were not uncommon. Some were presc riptions noted to be as many as 20 or more years old. Figure 15.

We received mostly pills , but also gels, creams, inhalers, and other items. Nearly all (86%) of the returns were prescr iption drugs, and 12% over-the- counter. The vast majority of returns represented pre scription drugs consumed by humans as compared to the negligible amount of veterinarian medicines returned using the program. Figure 19. Disposal Methods Used Prior to Mailback Program Figure 20. Controlled Drug Status of Returned Medicine Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 50 About 17% of the drugs were schedules II, III, and IV -\"controlled drugs.\" These include narcotic pain relievers, tranquilizers and sedatives, as well as stimulants. These are the drugs that are some times diverted for \"street\" use or sale. Controlled substances were equally likely to be returned by males (14%) and females (15%) (no statistically significant difference). The rate of controlled substances returned increased slightly with age, but the diffe rences were not significant. Figure 21. Over-the-County Returns vs. Prescription Medicines Figure 22. Human vs. Veterinarian Medicines Returned Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 51 Most returns were in pill form. Fourteen per cent of returns represented liquids, gels, ointments and patches. A negligible amount of medical supplies and devices were returned including unused morphine pumps. Full, unused bottles were some times returned, including pr escriptions from mail-order pharmacies or VA pharmacy services, as well as anti-retroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS treatment. It was not uncommon to find a mix of local and mail order pharmacies represented sometimes where a patient was receiving the same drug from both sources. Drug data were classified into therapeutic categories by the Community Medical Foundation for Patient Safety using the Dr ug Abuse Warning Network system (DAWN). The following chart produced by the Community Medical Foundation for Patient Safety demonstrates that the CNS agents, cardiovascular age nts, and psychotherapeutic agents were the top three categories of drugs returned through the program.

All items for which data were available were found to pose at least some environmental risk. Environmental risk refers to risk of acute toxicity to the aquatic environment. Environmental risk is based on the ratio of predicted environmental concentration of the substance (PEC) and the highest concentration of the substance that does not have a harmful effect in the environment (PNEC) 23. Environmental Risk is specified as follow: Risk Condition Value Insignificant if PEC/PNEC <0.1 Low if PEC/PNEC 0.1-1 Moderate if PEC/PNEC 1-10 23 More detailed information is available at www.fass.se and www.janusinfo.org/imcms/ser vlet/GetDoc?meta_id=7236 Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 58 High if PEC/PNEC >10 POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL RISK (DF=33, Var Name=RISK) (Total=11382 Items) The potential environmental haz ard assessment of the active pharmaceutical substance is based on the three characteristics of persistence (P), bioa ccumulation (B), and toxicity (T). Each characteristic is a ssigned a numeric value (0-3). The total of the values comprises the PBT Index of the s ubstance with 0 being the lowest PBT rating and 9 being the highest score representing the highest degr ee of environmental hazard. Environmental hazard assessment is bas ed on the JANUS Classification System, accessed at http://www.janusinfo.se/im cms/servlet/GetDoc?meta_id=6913. JANUS Classification System (Janusinfo) is a public-domain website that provides drug information to support healthcare professi onals and environmental scientists to understand better the wide range of pharmaceutical produc ts and their potential impact on the environment. The Drug Therapeutic Co mmittees and the Department of Drug Management and Informatics in Stockholm C ounty Council, Sweden maintain this website and periodically update the information. Figure 26. Potential Environmental Risk of Returned Medicine Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 59 POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD (DF=34, Var Name=PBT; DF=35, P; DF=36,B; DF=37,T) (Total=11382 Items) Classification is made of both the medicines' inherent ability to affect the environment (environmental hazard) and the environm ental risk posed by the pharmaceutical substances when used to their current ex tent. The Environmental Department of Stockholm's County Council initiated the environmental hazard assessment based on data submitted by pharmaceutical manufactu rers in 2003. The classification system includes environmental risk assessmen t, which was conducted by the Swedish Association of the Pharma ceutical Industry in 2005. While the Swedish and European pharmaceutical market overlaps with that of the U.S., some medicines (generic categories) availa ble in the U.S. may not be listed in the current JANUSINFO. Project Investigat ors along with the Community Medical Foundation for Patient Safety researched and evaluated many classification systems for the National Unused and Ex pired Medicines Registry and has determined that JANUSINFO is appropriate and efficient in characterizing the relative potential Figure 27. Potential Environmental Hazard Posed by Returned Medicine Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 60 environmental risk and hazard of UEMs. The scientific basis of JANUSINFO follows industry guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the Organization for Economic and Co- operation for Development (OECD). OE CD is a 30-country membership body established in 1961 to monitor, create st andards, and present recommendations to help governments foster prosperity and fight pov erty through economic growth and financial stability, as well as to ensure and address environmental implications of economic and social development. In general, the standards and recommendati ons for environmental risk and hazard assessments are more stringent in Europe than those in the U.S. For more technical information and description of these standards, refer to the publication Environmental Classification of Pharmaceuticals. 24 Environmental risk and hazard data point to the need for disposal program options and communication campaigns that educate the public about t he potential environmental impact of drugs that have been disposed of improperly. Findings from the mailback program indicate that, for dr ugs where environmental impact data were available, there was at least some risk or hazard present am ong the returns. Appr oximately 43% of the drugs collected were found to be a hazard to the environment and 50% of the returns presented environmental risk. Conclusions Maine's citizen mailback program has dem onstrated that this approach is not only feasible, but effective. The program utilized a phased implement ation, beginning by targeting elders and focusing on pharmacies as distribution sites for the mailback envelopes. We then phased in a broader tar get population, adults of all ages, as well as a broader range of distribution sites (ot her providers of health services). 24 Contact the Community Medical Foundation for Patient Safety for more information: www.communityofcompetence.com Safe Medicine Disposal for ME : A Handbook and Summary Report y April 2010 61 The mailback envelope take-back method retu rned a large quantity of drugs that would have otherwise been disposed of directly into the water system through flushing or into landfills through the trash. A short survey inserted in the envelope allowed us to track the reasons for participation, the sources of the drugs, and the demographic profile of the participants. This is information that is useful not only for project planning and education, but also policy development. The mailback program provides a rich oppor tunity to educate a broad public citizenry about prescription drugs and the environment via community outreach and information distributed with the mailer. It involves citize ns in an easy, \"DIY\" (do it yourself) problem- solving program that prev ents environmental harm, prev ents drug diversion, and prevents poisoning. Community education by ol der adults was found to be both effective and engaging while encouraging new users of the program to spread the word in their local communities. It is for this reason the consumer involvement should be a key component in any drug return program model. The major challenge for this and other dispos al programs continues to be funding to sustain such efforts. All disposal pr ogramming, whether mailback or event-based takeback programs, require a co nsiderable amount of time and effort to plan, execute, and educate the public. Our first two phases have shown us that t he interest and the community need exist and in fact, clearly out weigh the resources available to address the issue of drug disposal. However, it is imperative to continue as many programming and outreach efforts as possible to provide drug disposal options directly to the consumer at the same time that informa tion is disseminated so as to avoid the confusion and misinformation the surr ounds the issue of drug disposal.

Introductory Remarks Senator Lynn Bromley opened the meeting at 10am. She noted that her goal was to pass a bill on this issue, hoping to come out of today's meeting with an outline. Her deadline for drafting legislation is January 6 at the Revisor's Office. Let's not make perfect the enemy of the good, she suggested. The group represented a wide variety of constituencies and viewpoints. As individu als introduced themselves and stated their reasons for attending the meeting, Senator Bromley noted the priority categories into which they fell. Seven said they were here for diversion issues, nine regarding waste issues, five for education, three for mistaken prescriptions, and two for security issues. Karen Simone from the Poison Center noted that the center would support anything environmentally sound, as they used to recommend flushing because of the speed with which you could get rid of it. She not ed that garbage cans are not safe for kids and are often raided by drug abusers. We need to make sure we're not making these drugs more accessible. Many members of the state's environmental community, including the state's fish pathologist, biologist, as well as the state geologist, attended and raised concerns regarding the impact of drug disposal on groundwater. They noted that a lot of work is being done on the downstream effects of flushing prescription drugs. Ann Pistell of the DEP said that they deal a lot with product stewardship issues, which has a role in this discussion. Scott Austin of the DEP noted that he deals with hospitals on this issue and that there are no hospital incinerators left in Maine. We were joined by Laurie Tenace of Flori da who is working on this issue regarding pharmaceuticals and personal care products. She is scheduling a teleconference on this issue in January. The Rite -Aid representative noted that we need to find out what the Federal regs were for scheduled drugs a nd that an appropriate method for paying for this needed to be found. Marci Sorg, from the Margaret Chase Smith Center, was involved in the drug mortality/morbidity studies recently and works with the state medical examiner. She has seen the results of a lot of mistakes, especially in the elderly. 2 Ann Robinson, representing Pharma, noted that diversion is an issue with today's children, stressing that drugs ought to be taken by those to whom they were prescribed. The science issues are complex and emerg ing with lots to be learned. She advised the group to proceed with caution. Jim Cameron from the Maine Attorney General's Office is concerned about diversion, noting that Schedule II drugs have a huge street value. A collection mechanism must keep this in mind. Security must be built in. Pharmacies, represented by both Jim MacGregor of the Maine Merchants Association, and Bob Morisette, noted that reverse distribution is a common practice. Current Practices Scott Austin noted that there are some current requirements, including RCRA, which controls toxic drugs (chemotherapy, etc) and the DEA, which dictates controlled drug disposal. He noted the need to involve the State Board of Pharmacy. The Maine Hospital Association has identified alternatives to incineration. Scott noted that there would be some pollution concerns. Steam sterilization is a cleaner non -incineration option for waste but not for drugs. It was noted that law enforcement incinerates at 1800 degrees. They incinerate evidence, both pills and marijuana, totaling 9.1 tons per year. This is mostly marijuana. It was also noted that chemo drugs cannot be incinerated. Ann Pistell noted that the USGS has identified pharmaceuticals in the water. The EPA is doing a sampling and we should have results by the end of the month. Suggestions for Legislation Dr. Gressit told the group that the DEA has said that controlled drugs cannot be returned to pharmacies and other providers. Apparently specific licensed individuals cannot handle thes e as returns. He suggested a mail -back program where a packet would go to the post office and the DEA could empty the box and dispose of the contents appropriately. Ann Pistell suggested considering product stewardship. The returns could go back to the pharmaceuticals, similar to the mercury switch law. She also suggested that perhaps they could be handled as hazardous waste and be collected as such. The group discussed this but concerns over the safety of handling the drugs were prevalent. Marci Sorg cautioned the group to consider HIPPA issues. Senator Bromley threw out the idea of doing a pilot program with one drug but the idea was dismissed. All prescription drugs would be preferable. 3 The group agreed that incineration would be worth pursuing. However, the \"air people\" at DEP need to be able to weigh in on this. Extra manpower and resources would be needed for this. Having the DEA incinerate would satisfy the licensing question. The DEP suggested that Maine needs better waste control treatme nt plants, which should be the subject of a separate bill. Roy McInney of the MDEA had a number of comments. 1) From a public safety standpoint, the MDEA would like to be of assistance, as long as it does not endanger its core mission, which is to reduce the drug supply through identification and prosecution of drug traffickers. 2) MDEA has a central evidence facility, which has 5000 individual exhibits collected each year. They dispose of these through incineration. Approx 9 tons were destroyed last ye ar. 3) We must find funding for using MDEA's infrastructure. It's $88/ton for destruction. And the cost of staff needs to be covered. They would need two people and a vehicle to do this. Roy was interested in finding out how much volume we're expecting but this number was too hard to discern (somewhere between 5000 and 10000 pounds was suggested). The public health nurse asked the group what they thought of including veterinarian medications. The group seemed interested and agreed to include them. Focusing the Legislation Senator Bromley suggested that the legislation be a pilot program. Marci Sorg was solicited to suggest particular counties where diversion was the worst and she recommended Cumberland and Washington. However, Anna Bragdon suggest ed that we ask for a statewide program and only reduce it to a pilot program if need be. Dr. Gressit suggested using school districts to distribute information and mailers. Marci Sorg suggested that there may be federal dollars and money from drug manufa cturers. Jim Cameron noted that the manufacturers have foundations. We would need to determine how we would use the money before we asked. It's important to have no strings attached. He suggested Purdue Pharma and Phizer. It was suggested that we poll the state for current disposal behaviors. There is a statewide survey already done which we could add a question to for a fee. It is sent to 4000 Maine residents. The group discussed doing a random opening of 100 packages to learn from them. We could translate found pills into actual dollars. The Poison Center could do the research on the pills with some staff help. There may be privacy issues that need to be addressed. 4 Issues needing further attention Postal inspectors Liquids Committee referra l - HHS Mobilization of support (including AARP) Research aspect Rules should be minor technical. Conclusion Senator Bromley wrapped up the meeting by reviewing the group's progress. A bill will be drafted which will call for mailers for returned prescr iptions to be destroyed by the MDEA. It will include veterinary meds and the rules will not be major substantive. 1 of 6 Northern New England Poison Center Medication Disposal Summary Report Latest update (1/17/2008) Purpose The purpose of this report is to: Summarize research related to, and the c ontroversy surrounding, medication disposal. Document rationale for the Northern New England Poison Center's (NNEPC) Medication Disposal Recommendation. Executive Summary Medication-related overdoses have incr eased significantly in recent years.1 Limiting access to medicines is a key prevention strategy (\"clean out the medicine cabinet\").2 Pharmaceuticals and other personal care pr oducts (PPCP) have been found in our water supply.3 The sources are most likely excrem ent, flushed products and ground water contamination from land-fills.4, 5, 6, 7 The presence of PPCP in the environment has not been proven to negatively affect humans. However, the health effects from long-term exposure to these compounds are not clear.8 There is controversy about how to proper ly dispose of medicines (Table 1 & 2). 9 There are three common methods utilized throughout the United States for medication disposal: flushing, throwing away and collecting5,10,11 All of these options hav e strengths and weaknesses. Legislation related to medication reuse and disposal varies by state. The goal of any disposal method needs to keep these in mind: \u0083 Prevent acute poisoning; \u0083 Prevent abuse; \u0083 Ensure patient safety; \u0083 Limit environmental impact and water supply contamination. Ultimately, any disposal recommendation needs to be practical, cost effective and safe. The NNEPC is taking an active role in developing di sposal recommendations for the general public and health care and public he alth professionals. 2 of 6 Call to Action In 2006 the American Medical Association (AMA) passed a resolution aski ng the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to lead the nation in addressing this issue. The AMA requested that the EPA: 1. Continue aggressive research to understand the public health impact of PPCP's on the drinking water supply, environment and human health. 2. Lead and engage stakeholders from other federal agencies, the pharmaceutical industry, hospitals and other health care in stitutions, health professional organizations representing physicians, pharmacists, and nurse s and the public for the proper disposal of PPCP to prevent drinking water c ontamination and envi ronmental impact. 12 Medicine-Related Poisonings Childhood poisonings - In 2005, in the United Stat es, more than a half-m illion calls were made to poison centers about medication-related poisonings among children 5 years of age and younger.13 Medication overdoses - In 2004, poisoning became the second leading cause of death from unintentional injury in the United States. Acco rding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly all poisoning deaths in the United States are attributed to drugs, and most drug poisonings result from the abus e of prescription or illegal drugs.1 Several reports confirm this alarming trend of pha rmaceutical abuse and misuse.14,15,16,17,18 Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Pr oducts (PPCP) in the Water Supply Medicines are not entirely absorbed by our bodies, and are excreted and passed into wastewater and surface water. According to the Environmental Prot ection Agency, studies have shown that pharmaceuticals are pr esent in our nation's waterbodies.3-7 Research suggests that certain drugs may cause harm to the environment. To date, scientists have not found evidence of adverse human health effe cts from PPCP's in the environment.8 Medications' effects on the aquatic environment: Ability to resist degradation in the aquatic environment; Accumulation in adipose tissue of aquatic organisms; Potential to poison aquatic organisms.19 It is important to remember, \"Not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that can be counted counts.\" - Albert Einstein20 Medication Disposal Recommendations There is no undisputed recommendation for disposi ng of medicines (Table 1 & 2). There are three common methods utilized throughout the United States for medication disposal: flushing, throwing away and collecting for incineration. Community-based studies show that most people dispose of unwanted medicines in their garbage or by flushing them down their toilets or sinks, but would be willing and interested in properly disposing of their unused or expired medicines by returning them to a c onvenient location (such as a pharmacy). 5, 9-11,21,22 3 of 6 Table 1.

For a number of years in Maine, research from the Maine Benzodiazepine Study Group, The University of Maine Center on Aging, and in part funded by the only Federa l Grant in the US on unused drug return mail back programming has suggested that adherence to medication and other variables may lead to large amounts of unused and discarded medication. Closer evaluation of side effects and ef ficacy may lead to better patient outcome and better safety for patients with closer evaluation of initial response. With that, MaineCare will institute new 15 day limits on in itial prescriptions for various medication that have been identified with high side effect profiles, high disc ontinuation rates, or frequent dose adjustments to ensure cost effectiveness without \"wasting\" or \"discarding\" of used medications. Effective 8/6/09 MaineCare will begin limiting initial prescriptions on the following medications , Suboxone, Subutex, Chantix and Nicotine replacement products to 15 day supplies. Initial prescriptions for pr eferred products over the initial 15 day supply will require prior authorization. Subsequent refill s of these products will be allowed at the usual MaineCare allowable days supply. For further questions please contact Goold Health Systems at 1-888-4450497.

To curtail childhood overdoses 2. To restrict household drug theft 3. To limit accumulation of drugs by the elderly 4. To protect our physical environment 5. To restrain improper in ternational drug donations 6. To eliminate waste in the international health care systems of all countries We call upon governments, NGO's, and citi zens everywhere to correct policies and practices that foster waste in the health care systems of all co untries and endanger humans, animals, and our physical environment. We call upon all countries to renew their support of WHO Guidelines on Drug Donations and the WHO Guidelines on Drug Disposal, and strive to improve on these. We call upon health care providers worldwide to appropriately prescribe medicines to patients in the most effective form and quantity. We call upon health care organizations to re frain from policies that promote excessive dispensing. We call upon patients world wide to recognize the need f or medicine to be taken as intended if it is to be effective. We call upon governments, NGO's, and citizens worldwide to refrain immediately from improper drug donations either as humanitarian aid following disasters or in general practice. We call upon others to endorse these principles with us for the betterment of the health of the environment and patients worldwide. Athens, Greece August 3rd, 2007 In North America: Maine Benzodiazepine Study Group to prescribing policy, reimbursement incentives, formulary select i on, distribution, pricing systems, dispensing and actual prescription writing, have led to the need for this Istanbul Statem ent of September 7, 2009 during the 69th Conference of FIP. Confirming the Athens Declaration of 2007, this Statement as well draws attention to responses to these problems in the Netherlands, Sweden, and the State of Maine in the United States of Americ a. Research from a number of countries as diverse as Canada and Kuwait demonstrate the need for further work and research but already a need for addressing the problem. We thereby ask that all NGO's, governmental bodies, health care professionals, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and citizens everywhere place unused drug disposal and prevention of pharmaceutical waste as a highest priority. We encourage those listed above to move to address this problem as soon as possible. Istanbul, Turkey September 7, 2009 Stevan Gressitt, M.D. Rationale for a Concerted Focus on Unused Pharmaceuticals Ilene S. Ruhoy, MD Doctoral Candidate University of Nevada, Las Vegas Department of Environmental Studies Stevan Gressitt, MD Maine Benzodiazepine Study Group, The Drug Disposal Group, Medical Director, Northeast Occupational Exchange, Corresponding Author: 314 Clark Road, Unity, Maine, 04988 207-441-0291 gressitt@uninets.net Abstract: Unused and unwanted consumer pharmaceuticals have a negative impact on public health. The lack of effective and efficie nt methods of drug disposal has resulted in unwelcome social, cultural, ecological, and global effects. Among the many issues pertinent to unused consumer medication, we have comprehe nsiv ely explored and addresse d six specific and significant problems; 1) Childhood Poisoning : Un int entional pharmaceutical poisonings of children, resulting in unnecessary morbidity and mortality. 2) \"Pharming\": Thef t and social use, misuse, and abuse of pharmaceuticals by teenagers, adults, and older adults. 3) Exce ssive Accumulation and Polypharmacy: Polypharmacy, non-compliance and/or poor adherence to medication regimens, and medication errors contributes to accumulation and poor patient outcome. 4) Unintended Environment a l Exposure : Potential deleterious effects on wildlife and h u m a n s d u e t o d r u g d e p o s i t i o n i n s u r f a c e a n d g r o u n d w a t e r s a s a r e s u l t o f both disposal and excretion pathways. 5) Inappropriate Humanitarian Drug Donations : Un der-regulated and poorly controlled methods of international donations to countries in need, resulting in massive amounts of \"gifts\" of unused and expired pharmaceuticals. Expired and unwanted drugs ultimately become accumulated waste, some of which may be hazardous, due in part to the lack of an environmentally sound disposal or destruction method. 6) Pharmacoe conomi cs: Unused medications contribute to wasted health care dollars. The purchase costs of drugs to the consumer, the insurance carrier, and the taxpayer have continued to increase in the past decade. These issues define the problem of proper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals and beg for acceptable solutions to pr otect human and environmental health. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 8, 2010 Contact: Darlene Casey (O) 202-268-3440 darlene.casey@usps.gov usps.com/news Release No. 10-032 Postal Service Expands Prescription Mail Back Program Diverts Expired, Unused M edicine from Landfills, Water Supply WASHINGTON \u2014 Veterans will be able to safely dispose of expired and unused prescriptions and help the environment at the same time under a program offered by the U.S. Postal Serv ice and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This pilot program is limited to an estimated 780,000 veterans living in Baltimore, Washington, D C, and West Virginia. Veterans mail back outdated, unwanted medici ne. Federally approved facilities safely destroy the medicine, insuring that prescriptions don't end up in municipal refuse, soil or ground water. \"This initiative pairs the convenience of the mail with the safety of a federally approved prescription drug disposal process,\" said Robert Bernstock, presiden t, Mailing and Shipping Services. \"The Prescription Mail Back program demonstrates the Postal Service's continued value as an integral part of American communities.\" Veterans receive specially designed, postage-paid en velopes and instructions with their prescription fulfillment. Expired and unused pharmac euticals placed in the special packaging can be dropped in familiar blue USPS collection boxes or at Post Offices. The envelopes are delivered to facilities regulated and approved by the Environmental Protection Agen cy (EPA) and Drug Enfo rcement Agency (DEA). Pharmaceuticals from this and other similar mail -back initiatives are destroyed in accordance with EPA and DEA standards, including cataloguing and use of in cineration, chemical or thermal processes. The prescription mail- back initiative began in the state of Maine in 2008, and has been successfully expanding ever since. The VA program joins similar ones in 47 states. Mail-back envelopes are being distributed at supermarket pharmacies, in doctors an d dentists offices, and at medical facilities including hospitals, clinics and hospices. \"The 40 th anniversary of Earth Day is a perfect opport unity to tell Americans the good news about the expanded prescription mail -back program,\" said Sam Pulcrano, vice president, Sustainability. \"It is another way the Postal Service demonstrates its commitment to the environment.\" The Postal Service has won more than 75 environme ntal awards, including 40 White House Closing the Circle, 10 Environmental Protection Agency WasteWise Partner of the Year, Climat e Action Champion, Direct Marketing Association Green Echo, and the Postal Te chnology International Environmental Achievement of the Year, 2009. For more information about the Postal Service green initiatives, tools and products, visit usps.com/green . The Postal Service receives no tax dollars for operating expenses, and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations. # # # Please Note: For broadcast quality video and audio, photo stills and other media resources, visit the USPS Newsroom at www.usps.com/news. A self-supporting government enterprise, the U.S. Postal Service is the only delivery service that reaches every address in the nation, 150 million residences, businesses and Post Office Boxes. The Postal Service receives no direct support from taxpayers. With 36 ,000 retail locations and the most frequently visited website in the federal government, the Postal Service relies on the sale of po stage, products and services to pay for operating expenses. Named the Most Trusted Government Agency five consecutive years and the sixth Most Trusted Business in the nation by the Ponemon In stitute, the Postal Service has annual revenue of more than $68 billion and delivers nearly half the world's mail. If it were a private sect or company, the U.S. Postal Service would rank 28th in the 2009 Fortune 500.

During the past year, the Safe Medicine Disposal for ME Program has been working to establish pilot program sites within a designated four-county area. The program has become such a success within our pilot pharmacy sites that we are now expanding the program statewide. Our first key step is to secure partnering distribution sites across the state that are interested in providing Maine residents with pre-paid envelopes for medicine disposal. We would like to extend an invitation for your organization to join a growing roster of organizations that are participating as a distribution site for envelopes. As an Area Agency on Aging, you and your staff members represent a critical link to older adults throughout the state. Research indicates that older adults consume far more prescription drugs than any other population, putting them at risk for accumulation of medication that is unneeded and unwanted. Please consider joining our program as a distribution site. Here is what is required of distribution sites: o There is no cost to you or to program participants (this is currently a grant-funded program). o A designated staff person at your location should provide program envelopes to all interested individuals at no cost to them. o You will be asked to display a sign or flyer at your location alerting the public to the availability of program envelopes. o You and your staff do not need to answer any questions about the program. We have an established Program Helpline for participants. We anticipate that envelopes will be available for distribution within the next few months. Please confirm that your organization is interested in participating in the program. If you are interested in serving as a site, please complete the attached contact information sheet to ensure that we have up to date contact information for you and your site. Return this form to me by e- mail at: jennifer.crittenden@umit.maine.edu or by fax at 207-262-7921. You can expect to receive regular updates on the program as we gear up to go statewide. Thank you for considering partnering with our program. We hope that you will consider serving as a site for this very important project benefiting Maine residents. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions you may have.

Youth prescription drug abuse is a problem in Maine. About 1 in 5 Maine youth grades 9-12 report having used a prescription drug not prescribed to them to get high. Non-medical use of prescription drugs is the second most popular category of drug abuse after marijuana. Nearly one in five teens report abusing prescription medications to get high. Teens are misusing everything from pain relievers to stimulants, sedatives and tranquilizers. Many teens believe that prescription drugs are safer than alcohol or illicit drugs, and that abusing them isn't risky.Facts About Teens and RX Abuse Facts About Teens and Facts About Teens and RX AbuseRX Abuse One of the fastest growing trends with teenage prescription drug abuse is the Pharm Party. These are parties where each person brings bottles of prescription medications that they can find to a party where the medications are then put into a punch bowl for everybody to take like candy. Other names for this are \"skittling\" and \"fish bowling\". \"Pharm\" PartiesMyths & Facts Myth - Prescription painkillers, even if they are not prescribed by a doctor, are not addictive. Fact - Abusing certain prescription painkillers is similar to abusing heroin.Myths & Facts Myth - There is nothing wrong with using prescription drugs without a doctor's consent. Fact - Taking prescription medicine that your doctor didn't prescribe and doesn't know about can result in a dangerous situation if he or she actually prescribes medicine for you that shoul d not be mixed with what you are abusing \"on the sly\".Myths & Facts Myths - If a prescription drug is legal and widely available, it must be safe. Fact - Prescription drugs are safe when used correctly under a doctor's supervision. But taking prescription drugs that aren't intended for you and/or mixing them with alcohol or illicit drugs can result in potentially deadly consequences.Ways You Can Help: Dispose of any unused or unwanted medications properly. Keep close track of your prescription medications in case any go missing or are refilled without your knowledge. Ways You Can Help Ways You Can Help Avoid stockpiling prescription medications in your home and keep them in a safe place. Encourage talking with your pre-teen/teenage relatives about the risks of abusing prescription medicationsReasons why keeping unused or expired drugs in your home is not safe: Over 40% of poisoning reported to the poison control center are from mishandling or misuse of prescription drugs. Those who abuse prescription drugs often meet their own needs by stealing drugs or stealing property in order to buy drugs.Medication SafetyMedication SafetyMedication SafetyMedication Safety Medication Safety If medications are burned, they can release pollutants into the air If they are thrown out, they can be scavenged and sold illegally If medications are flushed, they can have damaging effects on the environment Disadvantages of some methods of disposal:Remember to:Remember to:Remember to: Review the contents of your medicine cabinet regularly Check expiration dates on your prescription and non- prescription medication Store medicine safely, out of the reach of children and in a locked cabinet if possibleHow Can you Safely Dispose of Medications Utilize the Safe Medicine Disposal for ME Program Contact your local law enforcement office to see if they sponsor a medication take-back event or drug drop off day Contact Maine Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222Evaluation & Questions Please feel free to ask questions at this time, and kindly complete page two of the evaluation form.

Such medicines represent an expensive waste of healthca re resources and a potential environmental and safety hazard. Unused Prescription Medicine is: An Environmental and Health Hazard Over half of Americans dispose of unwanted prescrip tion medicine in the trash, one-third put it down the sink or toilet, and only 1.4% return it to a collection facility.1 Prescription medicine then enters t he water through disposal down a dr ain or from the leaching or leaking of the drugs from landfills.2 Over 80 pharmaceuticals of various prescription drug classes have been found in treated sewage, surface water, and ground water throughout the country.3 Studies have found that exposure to medicine in water has been link ed to serious reproductive side effects in fish, and the full effect on humans is currently unknown.4 A Danger to Children and Pets Children and pets can accidentally get poisoned by unused prescription medi cine found in the home. In the US, medicine in the home accounts for mo re accidental poisonings than any other product.5 Nearly 2% of children ages 12-13 intentionally misuse prescription medicine.6 Accessibility to the medicine is likely a contributi ng factor to this growing trend.7 A Danger to Older Adults Older adults make up only 13% of the population, but fill one-third of all prescriptions. This makes them susceptible to intentional or acci dental medicine misuse , dependence, and addiction.8 Diversion and theft of prescription medicine is cu rrently at very high levels, and older adults may be particularly at risk.9 A Danger to Communities In 2002 in Maine, almost 90% of all drug deaths were caused by prescription medicine.10 The non-medical use of prescription medicine, among US residents ages 12 and older, is more common than the use of any illicit drug except marijuana.11 Maine DEA arrests for prescription medicine misuse have increased dramatically to 16% of all arrests.12 A Waste of Valuable Healthcare Dollars One small study conservatively estimates the cost of wasted prescription medicine by adults ages 65 and older to be over one billion dollars annually . 13 With healthcare costs rising at 3 times the rate of inflation, this waste will only continue to grow.14 For more information contact Safe Medicine Disposal for ME 1-866-637-9743 DETAILED FACT SHEET References: Introduction paragraph: Mireles, M.

Program Take-Back Model at a glance: Why Maine? /square4 Maine has the oldest population in the nation as measured by median age. Americans age 65 and older ac count for over one-third of all prescription drugs dispensed, despite making up only about 13% of the national population. /square4 The state of Maine has previously experienced and documented the consequences of unused drugs re maining in circulation. In 2002, nearly 90% of all drug deaths in Maine were caused by prescription drugs. Maine DEA arrests for prescription drug theft and misuse have increased dramatically to 16% of all arrests in the state. Maine ranks number one in the country in terms of the relationship of pharmaceuticals to violent crime and property crime. What are the benefits of this model? Many other areas of the country are considering replicating our model of drug disposal. Here's why: /square4 Avoids the harmful environmental impacts and health hazards of flushing or disposing of drugs via ho usehold trash /square4 Easy, convenient, and anonymous way of disposing of drugs /square4 Takes advantage of the security protocols of the U.S. Postal Service mail system /square4 Accessible to those who live in rural areas and are unable to attend event-based or on-site medicine re turn programs Safe Medicine Disposal for ME Program Kits distributed to Maine residents through designated pharmacy and community sites free of charge Unused medications returned by mail to a centralized Maine Drug Enforcement Agency location Medication returns ca taloged by program pharmacists and then destroyed by incineration \u00a92009 University of Maine Center on Aging, July 20, 2009 edition 2 /square4 Drugs are returned directly to the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency so the program is able to accept co ntrolled substances /square4 From a social standpoint such a program presents the opportunity to: limit drug related crimes, limit op portunities for drug abuse, and reduce waste related to medical and insurance costs by providing a safe alternative from stockpiling medications in consumer's homes /square4 The potential environmental benefits include: protecting water and soil supplies from drug co ntamination and prevention of accidental poisonings of humans, pets, and wildlife This initiative is a unique collaboration between environmental, drug enforcement, and healthcare officials and puts the University of Maine in the forefront of innovative outreach research.
