Ensuring that family child care providers know what potentially poisonous plants they have in their yards , and how best to protect the children in their care from the negative effects of those plants, is essential for keeping Minnesota's children safe. What is a poisonous plant ? The toxicity levels of plants var y. A child's reaction to different plants can vary greatly as well, with symptoms ranging from skin irritation to vomiting and diarrhea. In more serious cases, exposure can affect a child's heart, kidneys or liver. To explain the toxicity levels of plants, t he Minnesota Poison Control System has a list published online that divides plants into three categories: Non -toxic, Mildly Toxic, and Toxic. The online document can be found HERE (also attached). The list describes the toxicity of the three categories of plants and provides some direction about safely keeping the plants around children. Nontoxic (safe, not poisonous). The plants in this category are considered to be non -toxic. However , any plant may cause unexpected reactions in certain individuals, including choking. Common plants in this category include ferns and lilacs. Mildly Toxic ( caution). The plants in th is category may be mildly toxic or may easily be confused with toxic plants. Plants in this category are common in many households and yards and include tomato (leaves), crab apple, dogwood, and potato (leaves) plants. Toxic ( dangerous, poisonous). The plants in this category are toxic. Many of the plants in this category are common in landscaping and along walkways such as hydrangea and peonies. What can I do to comply with this requirement? What do I do if I have non -toxic plants in my home or yard? Location of plants : Although there are no restrictions about the location or accessibility of these plants to children, children could ingest these plants . Make sure you know what to do if a chi ld ingests the plants or has an unexpected allergic reaction . If a child ingests a portion of a non-toxic plant , the Minnesota Poison Control System recommends that Poison Control be contacted at 1-800-222-1222 . What do I do if I have mildly toxic plants in my home or yard? Location of plants : Because these plants are mildly poisonous, they can be kept around children, \"with some precautions.\" These plants should not be directly in the area where the children's activities most often occur. However, these plants may be located in other areas of a yard not used August 2016 for regular play and where a child's presence would be known when the required superv ision is being provided. They may also be located in areas where children may pass while supervised when in route to the yard's play area or when entering the home. If the provider would have difficulty intervening to prevent the ingestion of toxic plants , the provider needs to provide some type of barrier to make these plants inaccessible to children. The provider may also choose to remove the plants rather than installing a barrier. If a child ingest s a portion of a mildly toxic plant, Poison Control should be called at 1-800-222- 1222 . What do I do if I have toxic plants in my home or yard?

What steps can I take to comply with this requirement and ensure that poisonous plants are inaccessible to children? (1) Know your yard. Do you know which plants are in your yard? Are any mildly toxic or toxic? (2) Assess the location of the plants, especially those included on the Minnesota Poison Control System list as mildly toxic or toxic. Which plants are in locations that children use to play? (3) Assess your ability to supervise children in those spaces. For mildly toxic and toxic plants, providing required supervision is critical in making the plants in the yard inaccessible to children in care. If mildly toxic or toxic plants are in a provider's yard, the provider must assess how close the plants are to the area used by children and the provider's ability to provide the required supervision to prevent children from accessing the mildly toxic and toxic plants. If the provider would have difficult y intervening to prevent the ingestion of mildly toxic or toxic plants, the provider needs to provide some type of barrier to make these plants inaccessible to children. The provider may also choose to remove the plants rather than installing a barrier. (4) Questions or concerns. If you have questions or concerns, reach out your county licensor or use DHS' \" Family Child Care Provider Questions \" portal to receive clarification on licensing requirements (www.dhs.state.mn.us/fccfaq ). What if I have plants in my home or yard that are not on the Minnesota Poison Control System list? The same steps listed above apply to this situation . (1) Do you know which plants are in your yard? (2) Assess whether these plants are in locations that children use to play. (3) If a chi ld was near these plants, is he/she being supervised, such as by you or a parent (i.e., along a walkway to the home)? Would you be able to intervene and prevent a child from ingesting the plants? (4) If you are still uncertain of the appropriate steps to take, reach out for further guidance.
