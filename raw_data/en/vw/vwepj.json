This special issue belongs to the section \" [Epidemiology](/journal/vaccines/sections/Epidemiology)\". Deadline for manuscript submissions: 31 December 2023 | Viewed by 9385 Special Issue Editor Guest Editor Interests: SARS-CoV-2; vaccines; natural infection; variant; immunity Special Issue Information Dear Colleagues, Reports from South Africa, along with evidence that Omicron (BA.1) could cause reinfection, suggest that new waves of infection can occur in highly immune populations whose are immune due to a prior infection and/or vaccination. Other preliminary studies indicate that BA.2 can readily overcome the immunity provided by vaccination and/or infection with an earlier variant, although its real impact on the spread of the virus in a specific area remains elusive. With the emergence of these new variants of SARS-CoV-2, questions around the impact of a natural infection (old or recent) and different vaccine strategies on the spread of the epidemic need answering. We are pleased to invite you to reflect with us on this pressing issue. The aim of this Special Issue is the influence of natural and/or vaccine immunity on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. As part of the scope, the current status of the diagnosis of, therapeutics around, and vaccines for COVID-19 are of particular interest to Vaccines. In this Special Issue, original research articles and reviews are welcome. Research areas may include (but are not limited to) the following: SARS-CoV-2 and vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 and natural infection, immunity mechanism, competition between variants, and SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. We look forward to receiving your contributions.
