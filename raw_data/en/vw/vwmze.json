Galbraith Road Cincinnati, OH 45236 What are functional medicine and integrative medicine? Functional medicine is a patient-centered approach to help the body and all its systems work in the best way possible. It looks for the root causes of disease by examining factors like lifestyle, diet, sleep, environment, and emotional health. Functional medicine draws on conventional medicine and evidence-based alternative treatments to support long-term health. Integrative medicine is a coordinated approach to provide conventional Western medicine together with complementary therapies like acupuncture, chiropractic care, massage therapy, nutrition, and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR).
