VA-ALL-INFO(01-21) SAMPLEVA-NOP(01 -19) This notice provides a brief summary of the Virginia Life, Accident and Sickness Insurance Guaranty Association (\"the Association\") and the protection it provides for policyholders. This safety net was created under Virginia law, which determines who and what is covered and the amounts of coverage. The Association was established to provide protection in the unlikely event that a life, annuity or accident and sickness insurance company (including a health maintenance organization) licensed in the Commonwealth of Virginia becomes financially unable to meet its obligations and is taken over by its Insurance Department. If this should happen, the Association will typically arrange to continue coverage and pay claims, in accordance with Virginia law, with funding from assessments paid by other life and health insurance companies licensed in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The basic protections provided by the Association are: Life Insurance o$300,000 in death benefits o$100,000 in cash surrender and withdrawal values Health Insurance o$500,000 for health benefit plans o$300,000 in disability income insurance benefits o$300,000 in long-term care insurance benefits o$100,000 in other types of accident and sickness insurance benefits Annuities o$250,000 in withdrawal and cash values The maximum amount of protection for each individual, regardless of the number of policies or contracts is $350,000, except for health benefit plans, for which the limit is increased to $500,000. Note: Certain policies and contracts may not be covered or fully covered. For example, coverage does not extend to any portion(s) of a policy or contract that the insurer does not guarantee, such as certain investment additions to the account value of a variable life insurance policy or a variable annuity contract. There are also various residency requirements and other limitations under Virginia law. To learn more about the above protections, please visit the Association's website at www.valifega.org or contact: VIRGIN IA LIFE, ACCIDENT AND SICKNESS INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION c/o APM Management Services , Inc. 1503 Santa Rosa Road, Suite 101 Henrico, VA 23229 -5105 804-282-2240 STATE CORPORATION COMMISSION Bureau of Insurance P.O.

Notice of Protection Provided by Virginia Life, Accident and Sickness Insurance Guaranty Association SAMPLEForm 405 -A (rev. 9 /2022) Your Rights and Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills What is \"balance billing\" (sometimes called \"surprise billing\")? When you see a doctor or other health care provider, you may owe certain out-of-pocket costs, like a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible. You may have additional costs or have to pay the entire bill if you see a provider or visit a health care facility that isn't in your health plan's network. \"Out -of-network\" means providers and facilities that haven't signed a contract with your health plan to provide services . Out-of-network providers may be allowed to bill you for the difference between what your plan pays , and the full amount charged for a service. This is called \"balance billing .\" This amount is likely more than in -network costs for the same service and might not count toward your plan's deductible or annual out -of-pocket limit. \"Surprise billing\" is an unexpected balance bill. This can h appen when you can't control who is involved in your care \u2014like when you have an emergency or when you schedule a visit at an in- network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an out -of-network provider. Surprise medical bills could cost thousands of dollars depending on the procedure or service. Insurers are required to tell you which providers and facilities are in their networks. Providers and facilities must tell you with which provider networks the y participate. This information is on the insurer's, provider's or facility's website or on request. You're protected from balance billing for: Emergency services If you have an emergency medical condition and get emergency services from an out -of- netwo rk provider or facility, the most they can bill you is your plan's in - network cost-sharing amount (such as deductibles, copayments and coinsurance). You can't be balance billed for these emergency services. This includes services at the same facility that you may get after you're in stable condition, unless you give written consent and give up your protections not to be balanced billed for these post -stabilization services. Certain services at an in-network facility When you get services from an in -network facility, certain providers there may be out -of- network. In these cases, the most those providers can bill you is your plan's in -network cost - sharing amount. This applies to emergency medicine, laboratory, surgeon and assistant surgeon services, and When you get emergency care or are treated by an out -of-network provider at an in-network facility, you are protected from balance billing. In these cases, you shouldn't be charged more than your plan's copayments, coinsurance and/or deductible. SAMPLEForm 405 -A (rev. 9 /2022) professional ancillary services such as anesthesia, pathology, radiology, neonatology, hospitalist, or intensivist services. These providers can't balance bill you and can't ask you to give up your protections not to be balance billed. If you receive other types of services at these in-network facilities, out-of-network providers can't balance bill you unless you give written consent and give up your protections. You're never required to give up your protections from balance billing. You also aren't required to get out-of -network care . You can choose a provider or facility in your plan's network. When balance billing isn't allowed, you also have these protections: You're only responsible for paying your share of the cost (like the copayments, coinsurance, and deductible that you would pay if the provider or facility was in-network). Your health plan will pay any additional costs to out -of-network providers and facilities directly. Generally, y our health plan must: o Cover emergency services without requiring you to get approval for services in advance (also known as \"prior authorization \"). o Cover emergency services by out-of-network providers. o Base what you owe the provider or facility (cost -sharing) on what it would pay an in - network provider or facility and show that amount in your explanation of benefits. o Count any amount you pay for emergency services or out-of-network services toward your in -network deductible and in- network out- of-pocket limit. If you think you've been wrongly billed, call the federal agencies responsible for enforcing the federal balance billing protection law at: 1-800-985-3059 and/or file a complaint with the Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Insurance at: scc.virginia.gov/pages/File -Complaint - Consumers or call 1- 877-310- 6560. Visit cms.gov/nosurprises/consumers for more information about your rights under federal law. Consumers covered under (i) a fully -insured policy issued in Virginia, (ii) the Virginia state employee health benefit plan; or (iii) a self-funded group that opted- in to the Virginia protections are also protected from balance billing under Virginia law.

SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 1 SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION This health benefit Plan is offered by Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the Mid- Atlantic States, Inc. (further referred to as \"Health Plan,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and \"Kaiser Permanente\" throughout this Evidence of Coverage (EOC). You have selected the Kaiser Permanente Flexible Choice Plan. This Evidence of Coverage (EOC) describes health care coverage provided under the a greement between Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the Mid- Atlantic States, Inc. (KFHP -MAS) , Kaiser Permanente Insurance Company (KPIC) and your employer Group. In this EOC, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the Mid -Atlantic States, Inc. is sometimes referred to as \"Health Plan.\" Both Health Plan and KPIC are sometimes referred to as \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our.\" Members are sometimes referred to as \"you.\" Some capitalized terms have special meaning in this EOC. Please see the \"Definitions\" section of this EOC for ter ms you should know. The term of this EOC is based on your employer Group's Contract Y ear and your effective date of coverage. Your employer Group's benefits administrator can confirm your eligibility, including that of your covered Dependents (if any). The Kaiser Permanente Flexible Choice Plan includes thre e coverage options. You are free to choos e the option that best meets your needs each time you plan to receive care. Choose from: Option 1 (HMO) , which gives you access to Plan Providers including P hysic ians in the highly-regarded Mid -Atlantic Permanente Medical Group. In almost all cases, your Option 1 care is provided in Kaiser Permanente medical centers. Option 2 (PPO ), which gives you access to an extensive network of Participating Providers and Physicians who are part of the PHCS and MultiPlan provider networks for Kaiser Permanente Insurance Company . Option 3 ( Indemnity) , which gives you access to any licensed Provider or Physician who is not in our Option 1 or Option 2 provider networks. Health Plan underwrites Option 1 coverage, which includes specific covered Services provided, prescribed or directed by Plan Providers. Covered Services also include certain Emergency Services received from non- Plan Providers. Emergency care is covered 24 hours a day, seven days a week, anywhere in the world by Health Plan. To make your health care easily accessible, Health Plan provides conveniently located Plan Medical Centers and medical offices throughout the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore me tropolitan areas. We have placed an integrated team of specialists, nurses, and technicians alongside our physicians, all working together at our state -of-the- art Plan Medical Centers. In addition, we have added pharmacy, optical, laboratory, and x- ray fac ilities at most of our Plan Medical Centers. KPIC underwrites the Option 2 (PPO) and Option 3 ( Indemnity) coverage, which includes specific covered Services you may receive from Participating and Non- Participating Providers. You may choose to use a Partici pating Provider or a Non- Participating Provider when you plan to receive care. SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 2 Your financial responsibility is different for covered Services received under each coverage Option. You should consult the Appendix - Summary of Cost Shares to determine your financial responsibility under each coverage Option . You may not have the option to choose among the three O ptions for all covered Services; you should review this Evidence of Coverage to determine whether medical and hospital services are covered Services, at which Option the covered Service may be accessed and whether any other specific coverage requirements must be met. With the exception of Preventive Benefits, a ll covered Services must be Medically Necessary. Your choice of providers will affect t he level of benefits you receive . When you access covered Services, you may be required to pay out -of-pocket costs such as Co - payments, Coinsurance and Deductibles. Y our out -of-pocket costs will generally be lowest when receiving care using the Option 1 (HMO) provider network underwritten by KFHP -MAS . Option 2 (PPO) coverage requires out -of-pocket costs that are generally higher than those available under Option 1 (HMO), but generally lower than those available under Option 3 ( Indemnity). Finally, Option 3 (Indemnity) coverage generally requires the highest out-of- pocket cost s. It is your choice to receive care from Plan Providers, Participating Providers or Non- Participating Providers. Neither Health Plan nor KPIC is responsible for any Member's decision to receive treatment, services, or supplies under any of the three coverage Options. Neither Health Plan nor KPIC is liable for the qualifications of providers or treatment, services or supplies provided under the other party's coverage. The three coverage options are treated as one plan; there shall be no coordination of benefits between the benefits provided by Health Plan and those provided by KPIC. Please note that Health Plan and KPIC are subject to the regulations of the Commonwealth of Virginia by both the State Corporation Commission Bureau of Insurance, as well as the Virginia Department of Health.

If you provide us this documentation in the specified time period and we do not make a determination about eligibility before the termination date, coverage will continue until we make a determination. If we determine that your Dependent does not meet the eligibility requirements as a disabled Dependent, we will notify you that he or she is not eligible and let you know the membership termination date. If we determine that your Dependent is eligible as a disabled Dependent, there will be no lapse in coverage. Also, beginning two years after the date that your Dependent reached the age limit, you must provide us documentation of his or her incapacity and dependency annually within 60 days after we request it so that we c an determine if he or she continues to be eligible as a disabled Dependent.

Special Enrollment Due to Court or Administrative Order If a parent eligible for family coverage is required under a court or administrative order requiring a Subscriber to provide health care coverage for a child who meets the eligibility requirements as a Dependent, the Subscriber may add the child as a Depen dent by submitting to your Group a Health Plan-approved enrollment or change of enrollment application, regardless of enrollment period SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 6 restrictions. If the Subscriber fails to enroll a child under a court or administrative order, the child's other parent or the Department of Social Services may apply for coverage.

Special Enrollment Due to Loss of O t her Coverage You may enroll as a Subscriber (along with any or all eligible Dependents), and existing Subscribers may add any or all eligible Dependents, if all of the following are true: A. The Subscriber or at least one of the Dependents had other coverage when he or she previously declined all coverage through your Group B. The loss of the other coverage is due to one of the following: (1) Exhaustion of COBRA coverage; (2) Termination of employer contributions for non-COBRA coverage; (3) Loss of eligibility for non-COBRA coverage, but not termination for cause or termination from an individual (non-group) plan for non-payment. For example, this loss of eligibility may be due to legal separation or divorce, reaching the age limit for dependent children, or the Subscriber's death, termination of employment, or reduction in hours of employment ; (4) Loss of coverage because plan does not provide benefits to individuals outside the service area. Note: If you are enrolling yourself as a Subscriber along with at least one eligible Dependent, only one of you must meet the requirements stated above .

Under Option 3 ( Indemnity) , you can choose any licensed provider or physician who is not in our Option 1 or Option 2 network s. To verify the current participation status of a Participating Provider (for Option 2), you can call the phone number listed on your ID card or you may visit the company's web s ite at: http://www.multiplan.com/kpmas . Your out-of- pocket costs will general ly be lowest when receiving care using the Option 1 (HMO) provider network underwritten by K FHP-MAS . Option 2 (PPO) coverage requires out -of-pocket costs that are generally higher than those available under Option 1 (HMO), but generally lower than those available under Option 3 ( indemnity). Finally, Option 3 (Indemnity) coverage generally requires the highest out -of-pocket costs. Both Options 2 and 3 are underwritten by KPIC. For specific Pre-certification provisions for obtaining certain Services under Option 2 (PPO) and Option 3 (indemnity) of your Kaiser Permanente Flexible Choice Plan, please refer to Pre -certification through the Medical Review Program (Options 2 and 3) in this section. Your Primary Care Plan Physician ( Option 1) Your primary care Plan Physician plays an important role in coordinating your health care needs, including hospital stays and referrals to specialists. We encourage you to choose a primary care Plan Physician when you enroll. Each Member of your family should have his or her own primary care Plan Physician. If you do not select a primary care Plan Physician upon enrollment, we will assign you one near your home. You may select any primary care Plan Physician who is available to accept new Members from the following areas: in ternal medicine, family practice and pediatrics. A listing of all primary care Plan Physicians is provided to you on an annual basis. SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 9 You may also access our Provider Directory online at the following website address: www.kp.org To learn how to choose or change your primary care Plan Physician, please call our Member Services Department at: Inside the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan area (301) 468 -6000 TTY 711 Outside the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area 1-800-777-7902 Our Member Services Representatives are available to assist you Monday through Friday from 7:30 a .m. until 9:00 p. m. Continuity of C are (Option 1) A Member may request to continue to receive health care Services for a period of at least 90 days from the date of the notification of Plan Provider's termination from the Health Plan's provider panel, except when terminated for cause. The terminated provider will be the reimbursed in accordance with our agreem ent with the provider existing immediately before the provider's termination of participation. In addition, under the following special situations, Health Plan will continue to provide benefits for Plan Provider's care beyond the period of 90 days as defined above: (1) The Member has entered at least the second trimester of pregnancy at the time of the provider's termination, except when terminated for cause. Such treatment may continue, at the Member's option, through the provision of postpartum care; or (2) The Member is determined to be terminally ill at the time of the Plan Provider's termination, except when terminated for cause. Such treatment may continue, at the Member's option, for the remainder of the Member's life. Continued Health Coverage from a Prior Plan Continued health coverage will also be provided if: a) The plan replaced a prior benefit plan of your employer or an associated company, and b) a person's continued health coverage under a provision of that prior plan similar to this ended due t o the replacement of that prior plan. In such case, that person may obtain continued health coverage under this provision. It will be as though the plan had been in effect when the qualifying event occurred. But no benefits will be paid under the policy fo r health care expenses incurred before its effective date. Getting a Referral (Option 1) Plan Providers offer primary medical, pediatric, and obstetrics/gynecology care as well as specialty care in areas such as general surgery, orthopedic surgery, dermato logy, and other medical specialties. If your primary care Plan Physician decides that you require covered Services from a specialist, you will be referred (as further described in this EOC) to a Plan Provider in your network who is a specialist that can pr ovide the care you need. All referrals will be subject to review and approval (authorization) in accordance with SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 10 the terms of this EOC. We will notify you when our review is complete. Any additional radiology studies, laboratory Services or Services from any other professional not named in the referral are not authorized and will not be reimbursed. If a non- Plan Provider recommends Services not indicated in the approved referral, your primary care Plan Physician will work with you to determin e whether those Services can be provided by a Plan Provider. When utilization management is the responsibility of an in-network provider, any reduction or denial of benefits will not affect the enrollee. Our facilities include Plan Medical Centers and specialty facilities, such as imaging centers, located within our Service Area. You will receive most of the covered Services that you routinely need at these facilities unless you have an approved referral to another Plan Provider. When you need covered Servi ces (that are authorized) at a Plan Hospital, you will be referred to a Plan Hospital. We may direct that you receive covered hospital Services at a particular Plan Hospital so that we may better coordinate your care using Medical Group Plan Physicians and our electronic medical record system. There are specific Services that do not require a referral from your primary care Plan Physician. However, you must obtain the care from a Plan Provider. These Services include the following: (1)The initial consultation for treatment of mental illness, emotional disorders, drug or alcohol abuse provided by a Plan Provider. The Behavioral Health Access Unit may be reached at 1-866- 530-8778. (2)A female Dependent age thirteen (13) years or older can receive direct access to Services from a participating OB/GYN that is authorized to provide Services under this Agreement and is selected by the Dependent. (3)Optometry Services. (4)Urgent Care Services provided inside our Service Area. Alt hough a referral or P rior Authorization is not required to receive care from these providers, the provider may have to get P rior Authorization for certain Services in accord with this \"Getting a Referral\" section. When P rior Authorization is the responsibility of an in- network provider, any reduction or denial of benefits will not affect the enrollee. As a Flexible Choice Member, you may see any Option 2 (P articipating Provider ) or Option 3 (Non- Participating Provider) without a referral . Services received from Option 2 a nd Option 3 providers may require Pre -certification. Please refer to Pre -certification through the Medical Review Program (Options 2 and 3) in this section for complete details. Prior Authorization for Prescription Drugs Requests for covered outpatient prescription drugs may be subject to certain utilization management protocols, such as P rior Authorization or step therapy. If we deny a Service or prescription drug because P rior Authorization was not obtained, or if a ste p-therapy exception request is denied, you may submit an appeal. For information on how to submit an appeal, see Section 5: Filing Claims, Appeals and Grievances . SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 11 To find out if a prescription drug is subject to P rior Authorization or step-therapy require ments, please see Drugs, Supplies and Supplements in Section 3 - Benefits, Exclusions and Limitations or the Benefits section of the Outpatient Prescription Drug Benefit . Standing Referrals to Specialists If a Member suffers from a life- threatening, degene rative, chronic or disabling disease or condition that requires specialized care, your primary care Plan Physician may determine, in consultation with the Member and the specialist, that your needs would be best served through the continued care of a speci alist. In such instances, your primary care Plan Physician will issue a standing referral to the specialist. For a Member who is pregnant, after the Member receives a standing referral to an obstetrician, the obstetrician is responsible for the primary management of the Member's pregnancy, including the issuance of referrals in accordance with Health Plan policies and procedures, through postpartum period. If a Member has been diagnosed with cancer, Health Plan will allow for the Member's primary care Plan Physician to issue a standing referral to any Health Plan and/or authorized oncologist or board- certified physician in pain management, as the Member chooses. With the exception of standing referrals to obstetricians for pregnant women as stated above, standing referrals will be made in accordance with a written treatment plan developed by the primary care Plan Physician, specialist, and the Member. The treatment plan may limit the number of visits to the specialist or the period of time in which visits to the specialist are authorized. We retain the right to require the specialist to provide the primary care Plan Physician with ongoing communication about your treatment and health s tatus. If you have been diagnosed with cancer, Health Plan will allow your primary care Plan Physician to issue a standing referral to any Health Plan authorized oncologist or board- certified physician in pain management, as you choose. Referrals to Non -P articipa ting Providers (Option 1) A Member may request a referral to a Non -Participating Provider in accordance with the requirements listed below: 1. The Member is diagnosed with a condition or disease that requires specialized medical care; and 2. KPIC does not have in its provider network a specialist with the professional training and expertise to treat the condition or disease; and 3. The specialist agrees to accept the same reimbursement as would be provided to a specialist who is part of the carrier's provider netw ork. Under Virginia law a non -Plan Provider shall not balance bill for : 1. Emergency services provided by a non -Plan Provider ; or 2. Nonemergency Services provided at a Plan Facility or a non -Plan Facility if the non -emergency Services involve surgical or ancil lary Services provided by a non -Plan Provider. Note: Surgical or ancillary Services are professional Services including surgery, anesthesiology, pathology, radiology, or hospitalist Services and laboratory Services.

You will incur the same Cost Sharing (Deductible, Coinsurance and/or Co- paymen t, as applicable) for Emergency Services furnished by non- Plan Providers as Plan Providers and such Cost Sharing will be calculated based on the Allowable Charge in accordance with applicable law if you Cost Sharing is not a fixed amount. If Emergency Serv ices are provided by a non- Plan Provider, Health Plan will make payment for the covered Emergency Services directly to the Non- Plan Provider. The payment amount will be equal to the amount by which the Allowable Charge exceeds your Cost -Sharing amount for the Services. You will not be liable for an amount that exceeds the r ecognized a mount as further described in this Agreement: Bills for Emergency Services You should not receive a bill for Emergency Services directly from a Plan Provider or non- Plan Provi der when the federal No Surprises Act applies.

Pre- certification through the Medical Review Program (Options 2 and 3) When using Participating Providers (Option 2) and/or Non- Participating Providers (Option 3), a Member must obtain Pre -certification of all non -emergency Hospital stays and certain other non -emergency Services and procedures. Request for Pre -certification must be made by the Member, the Member's attending Physician, or the Member's authorized representative prior to the commencement of any Service or treatment.

However, in these circumstances Health Plan, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Medical Group, and Medical Group Physicians will not have any liability for any delay or failure in providing covered Services. In the case of a labor dispute involving Health Plan, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, or Medical Group, we may postpone care until the dispute is resolved if delaying care is safe and will not result in harmful health consequences. Coordination of B enefits (COB) Note: The three coverage options in your Kaiser Permanente Flexible Choice plan are treated as one plan; there shall be no coordination of benefits between benefits provided by Health Plan (Option 1) and those provided by KPIC (Options 2 and 3). Coordination of Benefits means the way benefits are payable under more than one medical or dental plan. Under Coordination of Benefits, the Member will not receive more than the Allowable Expenses for a loss. If you have health care coverage with another health plan or insurance company, we will coordinate benefits with the other coverage. The Plan that pays first (Primary Plan) is determined by using National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) Order of Benefits Guidelines. The Primary Plan then provides benefits as it would in the absence of any other coverage. The Plan that pays benefits second (Secondary Plan) coordinates with the Primary Plan, and pays the difference between what the Primary Plan paid, or the value of any benefit or service provided, and the maximum liability of the Secondary Plan, not to exceed 100 percent of total Allowable Expenses. The Secondary Plan is never liable for more expenses than it would cover if it had been Primary. For Health Plan (Option 1), if you have any questions about COB, please call our Member Services Call Center. Inside the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan area (301) 468 -6000 TTY 711 Outside the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area 1-800-777-7902 TTY 711 For KPIC (Options 2 and 3), if you have any questions about COB, please call our Customer Service Center. Nationwide 1 -800-392-8649 , 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET Definitions Allowable Expense: A health care service or expense, including Deductible s, Coinsurance or Co- payments, that is covered in full or in part by any of the Plans covering the Member. This means that an expense or healthcare service or a portion of an expense or health care service that is not covered by any of the Plans is not an allowable expense. For example, if a Member is confined in a private hospital room, the difference between the cost of a semi-private room in the hospital and the private room usually is not an Allowable Expense. \"Allowable Expense \" does not include coverage for dental care except as provided under \"Accidental Dental Injuries\" in the \"benefits\" section. SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 97 Closed Panel Plan means a health maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), exclusive provider organization (EPO), or other plan that provides health benefits to Members primarily in the form of services through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the plan, and that limits or excludes benefits for services provided by other providers, except in the cases of emergency or referral by a panel Member. If the primary plan is a closed panel plan with no Out -of-Network benefits and the secondary plan is not a closed panel plan, the secondary plan must pay or provide benefits as if it were primary when no benefits are available from the primary plan because the Member used a non- panel provider, except for emergency services that are paid or provided by the primary plan If, however, the two plans are closed panels, the two plans will coordinate benefits for services that are Covered Services for both plans, including emergency services, authorized referrals, or services from providers that are participating in both plans. There is no COB if there is no covered benefit under either plan. Health Plan: Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the Mid-Atlantic States, Inc., providing services or benefits for health care. Health Plan is a Plan. Primary Plan/ Secondary Plan means that when This Plan is primary, its benefits are determined before those of the other Plan; the benefits of the other Plan are not considered. When This Plan is secondary, its benefits are determined after those of the other Plan; its benefits will coordinate with the other Plan's benefits. When there are more than two Plans, This Plan may be primary as to one and may be secondary as to another. Plan: Any of the following that provides benefits or services for, or because of, medical care or treatment: Group insurance or group -type coverage, whether insured or uninsured. This includes prepaid group practice or individual practice coverage. Order of Benefit Determination Rules Coordination of Benefits (\"COB\") applies when a Member has health care coverage under more than one Plan. \"Plan\" and \"Health Plan\" are defined below. The Order of Benefit Determination Rules will be used to determine which Plan is the Primary Plan. The other Plans will be Secondary Plan(s). If the Health Plan is the Primary Plan, it will provide or pay its benefits without considering the other Plan(s) benefits. If the Health Plan is a Secondary Plan, the benefits or services provided under this Agreement will be coordinated with the Primary Plan so the total of benefits paid, or the reasonable cash value of the services provided, between the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan(s) do not exceed 100 percent of the total Allowable Expenses. If another Plan does not have a COB provision, that Plan is the Primary Plan. If another Plan has a COB provision, the first of the following rules that apply will determine which Plan is the Primary Plan: o Subscriber/Dependent. A Plan that covers a person as a Subscriber is Primary to a Plan that covers the person as a dependent. SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 98 o Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divorced. Except as stated in subparagraph (b)(iii) below, when Health Plan and another Plan cover the same child as a dependent of different persons, called \"parents\": i. The Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the year is Primary to the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in the year; but ii. If both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that covered a parent longer is Primary; or iii. If the rules in (i) or (ii) do not apply to the rules provided in the other Plan, then the rules in the other Plan will be used to determine the order of benefits. o Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced Parents. If two or more Plans cover a person as a dependent child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the child are determined in this order: i. First, the Plan of the parent with custody of the child; ii. Then, the Plan of the Spouse or Domestic Partner of the parent with custody of the child; and iii. Finally, the Plan of the parent not having custody of the child. iv. However, if the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the Plan obligated to pay or provide the benefits of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is primary. This paragraph (iv) does not apply with respect to any Claim Determination Period or Plan year during which any benefits are actually paid or provided before the payer has that actual knowledge. v. Active/Inactive E mployee. A Plan that covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or as such an employee's dependent) is Primary to a Plan which covers that person as a laid off or retired employee (or as such an employee's dependent). vi. Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the Plan that has covered a Subscriber longer is Primary to the Plan which has covered the Subscriber for the shorter time. Effect of COB on t he Benefits of this Plan When Health Plan is the Primary Plan, COB has no effect on the benefits or services provided under this Agreement. When Health Plan is a Secondary Plan as to one or more other Plans, its benefits may be coordinated with the Primary Plan carrier using the guidelines below. COB shall in no way restrict or impede the rendering of services provided by Health Plan. At the Member's request, Health Plan will provide or arrange for covered services and then seek coordination with a Primary Plan. Coordination with This Plan's Benefits :Health Plan may coordinate benefits payable or may recover the reasonable cash value of services it has provided when the sum of: The benefits that would be payable for, or the reasonable cash value of, the services provided SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 99 as Allowable Expenses by Health Plan in the absence of this COB provision; and The benefits that would be payable for Allowable Expenses under one or more of the other Plans, in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this COB provision, whether or not a claim thereon is made; exceeds Allowable Expenses in a Claim Determination Period. In that case, the Health Plan benefits will be coordinated, or the reasonable cash value of any services provided by Health Plan may be recovered, from the Primary Plan, so that they and the benefits payable under the other Plans do not total more than the Allowable Expenses. Right to Reserve and Release Needed Information (Option 1): Certain information is needed to apply these COB rules. Health Plan will decide the information it needs, and may get that information from, or give it to, any other organization or person. Health Plan need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under Health Plan must give Health Plan any information it needs. Right to Reserve and Release Needed Information (Options 2 and 3): Certain facts are needed to coordinate benefits. KPIC has the right to decide which facts it needs. KPIC may get needed facts from or give them to any other organization or person. KPIC need not tell, or get the consent of any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under This Plan must give KPIC any facts it needs to pay the claim. Facility of Payment (Option 1) : If a payment made or service provided under another Plan includes an amount that should have been paid or provided by or through Health Plan, Health Plan may pay that amount to the organization which made that payment. The amount paid will be treated as if it was a benefit paid by Health Plan. Facility of Payment (Options 2 and 3 ): A payment made under another Plan may have included an amount, which should have been paid under This Plan. If it does, KPIC may pay that amount to the organization that made the payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under This Plan. KPIC will not pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services. In this case \"payment made\" means the reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. Right of Recovery (Option 1): If the amount of payments by Health Plan is more than it should have paid under this COB provision, or if it has provided services that should have been paid by the Primary Plan, Health Plan may recover the excess or the reasonable cash value of the services, as applicable, from one or more of: The persons it has paid or for whom it has paid; Insurance companies; or Other organizations Right of Recovery (Options 2 and 3): If the amount of the payments made by KPIC is more than it shoul d have paid, KPIC may recover the excess if related to payments made under any workers' compensation laws or federal or state programs. The \"amount of payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. Milit a ry Services For any Services for conditions arising from military service that the law requires the Department of SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 100 Veterans Affairs to provide, we will not pay the Department of Veterans Affairs, and when we cover any such Services we may recover the value of the of the Services from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Effect of Medicare This Plan will be primary to Medicare for an active employee and Dependent Spouse or Domestic Partner of such active employee. This Plan will not be primary to Medicare if the Member is eligible for Medicare as primary. Any such Member may not continue enrollment under This Plan. Medicare is primary for an insured retiree or the Dependent Spouse or Domestic Partner of a retiree age 65 or over; this applies whether or not the retiree or Spouse or Domestic Partner is enrolled in Medicare. Medicare and TRICARE Benefits The value of your benefits are coordinated with any benefits to which you are entitled under Medicare, except for Members whose Medicare benefits are secondary by law. TRICARE benefits are usually secondary benefits by law. SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 101 SECTION 5 - GETTING ASSISTANCE; CLAIMS AND APPEAL PROCEDURES; AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROCEDURE The following provisions under this Evidence of Coverage explain both claims procedures and your appeal rights for Adverse Benefit Determinations made under your Kaiser Permanente Flexible Choice Plan. Claims and appeal procedures for decisions made regard ing Services under Option 1 (HMO) benefits are different from those under Option 2 (PPO) benefits and Option 3 (I ndemnity) benefits. Claims and Appeals Information for Option 1 (HMO) General Provisions When receiving services outside of a Plan Medical Cent er, you will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) within 21 days of P roof of Loss. An Explanation of Benefits is any form provided by an insurer, health services plan or health maintenance organizations which explains the amounts covered under a policy or Plan or shows the amounts payable by a Covered Person to a health care provider. The EOB will describe the Services provided, whether the claim was paid or denied, the amount paid by Health Plan, your Cost Share, and the amounts accumulated toward meet ing your Deductible (if applicable) and Out -of-Pocket Maximum. For Services furnished by Kaiser Permanente staff clinicians within a Plan Medical Center, EOBs will not be issued unless the Services provided are subject to a Deductible and/or Coinsurance. Proof of Loss means all necessary documentation reasonably required by the Health Plan to make a determination of benefit coverage. Health Plan will review claims that you make for Services or payment, and we may use medical experts to help us review claims and appeals. You may file a claim or an appeal on your own behalf or through an Authorized Representative. As used with respect to Pre- Service, Concurrent Care, or Post -Service Claims and appeals related thereto, the term \"Member\" or \"you\" shall inc lude an Authorized Representative, as defined above. The Health Plan will also process for a Member, the Member's Authorized Representative, or the prescribing physician (or other prescriber) to request a standard review of a decision that a drug is not covered by the plan. The initial response of the Health Plan may be to request additional information from the prescribing provider in order to make a determination. Health Plan will make its determination on a standard exception and notify the Member, the Member's Authorized Representative, and the prescribing physician (or other prescriber, as appropriate) of its coverage determination no later than 72 hours following receipt of the necessary clinical information from the prescribing provider. Health Plan w ill provide coverage of the drug for the duration of the prescription, including refills if the Health Plan grants a standard exception. If you miss a deadline for filing a claim or appeal, we may decline to review it. If your health benefits are provided through an \"ERISA\" covered employer group, you can file a demand for arbitration or civil action under ERISA \u00a7502(a) (1)(B), but you must meet any deadlines and exhaust the claims and appeals procedures as described in this Section before you can do so. If you are not sure if your group is an \"ERISA\" group, you should contact your employer. We do not charge you for filing claims or appeals, but you must bear the cost of anyone you hire to represent SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 102 or help you. You may also contact the Office of the Managed Care Ombudsman (contact information is set forth below) to obtain assistance.

The Claims Process Pre-Service Claims Pre-Service claims are requests that Health Plan provide or pay for a Service that you have not yet received. We will decide if your claim involves an Urgent Medical Condition or not. If you receive any of the Services you are requesting before we make our decision, your claim or appeal will become a Post -Service Claim with respect to those Services. If you have any questions about Pre -Service Claims, please contact our Member Services Department at the numbers listed above. SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 103 Procedure for Making a Non-Urgen t Pre-Service Claim Tell the Member Services Department that you want to make a claim for Health Plan to provide or pay for a Service you have not yet received. Your written or oral request and any related documents you give us constitute your claim. You may write or call us at the address and number listed above. We will review your claim, and if we have all the information we need we will communicate our decision within two working days after we receive your claim. If we cannot make a determination because we do not have all the information we need, we will ask you for more information within 15 days of receipt of your claim. We encourage you to send all the requested information at one time, so that we will be able to consider it all when we make our decision. If we do not receive any of the requested information (including documents) within 45 days, we will then make a decision within 15 days of the due date or the receipt date, whichever is earlier, based on the information we have. We will make a good faith attempt to obtain information from the Treating Provider before we make any Adverse Decision. At any time before we make our decision, the provider shall be entitled to review the issue of medical necessity with a physician advisor or peer of the Treating Provider. A physician reviewer will review the issue of medical necessity with the provider prior to making any Adverse Decision relating to cancer pain medication. If we m ake an Adverse Decision regarding your claim, we will notify the Treating P rovider: 1. in writing within two working days of the decision; or 2. orally by telephone within 24 hours of the decision if the claim is for cancer pain medication. The notice will include instructions for the provider to seek a reconsideration of the Adverse Decision, on behalf of the Member, including the name, address, and telephone number of the person responsible for making the Adverse Decision. If we deny your claim or if we do not agree to provide or pay for all the Services you requested, we will tell you in writing why we denied your claim, and how you can appeal. Expedited Procedure for an Urgent Medical Condition If you or your Treating P rovider feels that you have an Urgent Medica l Condition, you may request an expedited review of your Pre- Service claim. If we determine your claim does not involve an Urgent Medical Condition, we may treat your claim as a non-urgent Pre-Service Claim. We will review your claim, and if we have all the information we need we will notify you of our decision as soon as possible taking into account your medical condition(s) but no later than 72 hours after receiving your claim. We will send a written or electronic confirmation within three days after making our decision. If we cannot make a decision because we do not have all the information we need, we will ask you for more information within 24 hours of receipt of your claim. You will have 48 hours from the time of notification by us to provide the missing information. We will make a decision 48 hours after the earlier of (a) our receipt of the SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 104 requested information, or (b) the end of the 48-hour period we have given you to provide the specified additional information. If we deny your claim or if we do not agree to provide or pay for all the Services you requested, we will tell you in writing why we denied your claim, and how you can appeal. When you or your Authorized Representative sends an appeal, you or your Authorized Representative may also request simultaneous external review of our initial adverse decision. If you or your Authorized Representative wants simultaneous external review, your or your Authorized Representative's appeal must tell us this. You will be eligible for the simultaneous external review only if your pre-service appeal qualifies as urgent. If you do not request simultaneous external review in your appeal, than you or your Authorized Representative may be able to request external review after we make our decision regarding the appeal. See Section C Bureau of Insurance Independent External Appeals for additional information about filing an external appeal. Concurrent Care Claims Concurrent Care Claims are requests that Health Plan continue to approve an ongoing course of covered treatment to be provided over a period of time or number of treatments, when either (a) the course of treatment prescribed will expire, or (b) the course of treatment prescribed will be shortened. Determinations regarding a Concurrent Care Claim request will be made, and notice provided to the Member's provider, by telephone and in writing, within one business day of receipt of all information necessary to make a decision, but no later than 15 calendar days of receipt of the request. If care is authorized, the notice will identify the number of approved services, the new total of approved services, the date of onset of services and the date of the next scheduled concurrent review of the case. If we reduce or terminate coverage for an ongoing course of treatment that we already approved, we will notify the Member sufficiently in advance of the reduction or termination to allow the member to appeal the decision as described below. Concurrent Care Claims for an Urgent Medical Condition If your Concurrent Care Claim involves an Urgent Medical Condition, and the claim is submitted within 24 hours before the end of the initially approved period, we will decide the claim within 24 hours of receipt. If you filed a request for additional services at least 24 hours before the end of an approved course of treatment, you may continue to receive those services during the time your claim is under consideration. If your claim is denied, you will be financially responsible for the entire cost of those services. Otherwise, if your request for additional services was not timely filed, Health Plan will decide your request for review within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances but in no event later than 30 calendar days from the date on which your claim was received. If we determine your claim does not involve an Urgent Medical Condition, we may treat your claim as a non -urgent Concurrent Care Claim. We will notify you of our decision orally or in writing within 24 hours after we receive your claim. If we notify you orally, we will send you a written decision within three days after that. If we deny your claim or if we do not agree to continue approval of all the Services you requ ested, SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 105 we will tell you in writing why we denied your claim and how you can appeal. When you or your Authorized Representative sends the appeal, you or your Authorized Representative may also request simultaneous external review of our adverse decision. If you want simultaneous external review, your or your Authorized Representative's appeal must tell us this. You or your Authorized Representative will be eligible for the simultaneous external review only if your concurrent care claim qualifies as urgent. I f you or your Authorized Representative do not request simultaneous external review in the appeal, then you or your Authorized Representative may be able to request external review after we make our decision regarding the appeal. See Section C Bureau of Insurance Independent External Appeals for additional information about filing an external appeal. Post-S ervice Claims Post-service claims are requests for payment for Services you already received, including claims for Emergency Services and Urgent Care Services rendered outside our Service Area. If you have any questions about post -service claims or appeals, please call the Member Services Department at the address and telephone numbers listed below . Procedure for Making a Post -Service Claim Claims for Emergency Services or Urgent Care Services rendered outside our Service Area or other Services received from non -Plan Pro viders must be filed on forms provided by Health Plan; such forms may be obtained by calling or writing to the Member Services Department. You must send the completed claim form to us at the address listed on the claim form within 180 days, or as soon as r easonably possible after the Services are rendered. You should attach itemized bills along with receipts if you have paid the bills. Incomplete claim forms will be returned to you. This will delay any payments which may be owed to you. Also, you must compl ete and submit to us any documents that we may reasonably need for processing your claim or obtaining payment from insurance companies or other payers. We will review your claim, and if we have all the information we need we will send you a written decisio n within 30 days after we receive your claim. If we tell you we need more time because of circumstances beyond our control, we may take an additional 15 days to send you our written decision. If we tell you we need more time and ask you for more information, you will have 45 days to provide the requested information. We encourage you to send all the requested information at one time, so that we will be able to consider it all when we make our decision. If we do not receive any of the requested information (including documents) within 45 days, we will make a decision based on the information we have. We will issue our decision within 15 days of the deadline for receiving the information. If we deny your claim or if we do not pay for all the Services you requested, our written decision will tell you why we denied your claim and how you can appeal. Reconsideration of an Adverse Decision Reconsideration of an Adverse Decision is available only to the treating health care provider, to request a review, on behalf of a Member, of an Adverse Decision by Health Plan. A request for reconsideration is optional. The Treating P rovider may choose to skip this step and the Member or the Authorized Representative may file an appeal as described below. If the provider does request reconsideration, the SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 106 Member still has a right to appeal. Health Plan will render its decision regarding the reconsideration request and provide the decision to the Treating Provider and the Member, in writing, within ten working days of the date of receipt of the request. If we deny the claim, the notice will include the criteria used and the clinical reaso n for the Adverse Decision, the alternate length of treatment of any alternate treatment recommended, and the Member's right to appeal the decision as described below. Appeals of Claim Decisions The Appeal Procedures are designed by Health Plan to assure t hat Member concerns are fairly and properly heard and resolved. By following the steps outlined below, Member concerns can be quickly and responsively addressed.

Please note that the time frame for our response differs for Post- Service Claims (it is longer). You or your Authorized Representative may initiate a standard appeal by submitting a written request, including all supporting documentation that relates to the appeal to: Kaiser Permanente Attention: Appeals Coordinator Nine Piedmont Center 3495 Rd NE Atlanta, GA 30305 1-404-949-5001 ( FAX ) You or your Authorized Representative may request a standard appeal by contacting the Member Services Department. In addition, you or your Authorized Representative, as applicable, may review the Health Plan's appeal file and provide evidence and testimony to support the appeal request. Member Service Representatives are available by telephone each day during business hours to describe to Members how appeals are processed and resolved and to assist the Member with filing an appeal.

The appeal must be filed in writing within 180 days from the date of receipt of the original denial notice . If the appeal is filed after the 180 days, Health Plan will send a letter denying any further review due to lack of timely filing. If within five working days after a Member files an appeal, the Health Plan does not have sufficient information to initiate its internal appeal process, the Health Plan shall: Notify the Member that it cannot proceed with reviewing the appeal unless additional information is provided; Assist in gather ing the necessary information without further delay. Standard appeals will either be acknowledged within 5 working days of the filing date of the written appeal request. An acknowledgement letter will be sent as follows: SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 107 Appeal of a Non- urgent Pre -Service or Non -urgent Concurrent Care Claim If the appeal is for a Service that the Member is requesting, the acknowledgment letter will: i) request additional information, if necessary; ii) inform the Member when there will be a decision on their appeal; and iii) state that written notice of the appeal decision will be sent within 30 days of the date the appeal was received. Appeal of a Post -S ervice Claim If the appeal is asking for payment for completed services, an acknowledgment letter is sent: i) requesting additional information, if necessary; ii) informing the Member when a decision will be made; and iii) that the Member will be notified of the decision within 60 days of the date the appeal was received. If there will be a delay in concluding the appeal proce ss in the designated time, the Member will be sent a letter requesting an extension of time during the original time frame for a decision. If the Member does not agree to this extension, the appeal will move forward to be completed by end of the original t ime frame. Any agreement to extend the appeal decision shall be documented in writing. If the appeal is approved, a letter will be sent to the Member stating the approval. If the appeal is by an Authorized Representative, the letter will be sent to both th e Member and the Authorized Representative. In addition, you or your Authorized Representative, as applicable, may review (without charge) the information on which Health Plan made its decision. You or your Authorized Representative may also send additiona l information, including comments, documents, or additional medical records supporting the claim, to: Kaiser Permanente Attention: Appeals Coordinator Nine Piedmont Center 3495 Rd NE Atlanta, GA 30305 1-404-949-5001 ( FAX ) If the Health Plan asked for additional information before and you or your Authorized Representative did not provide it, you or your Authorized Representative may still submit the additional information with the appeal. In addition, you or your Authorized Representative may also provide testimony by writing or by telephone. Written testimony may be sent along with the appeal to the address above. To arrange to give testimony by telephone, you or your Authorized Representative may contact the Member Services Appeals Unit. Heal th Plan will add all additional information to the claim file and review all new information without regard to whether this information was submitted or considered in the initial decision. Prior to Health Plan rendering its final decision, it must provide you or your Authorized Representative, without charge, any new or additional evidence considered, relied upon, or generated (or at the direction of) by Health Plan in connection with the informal appeal. If during the Health Plan's review of the standard a ppeal, it determines that an adverse decision can be made based on a new or additional rationale, the Health Plan must provide you or your Authorized Representative with this new information prior to issuing its final adverse decision. The additional infor mation must be provided to you or your Authorized Representative as soon as possible and sufficiently before the deadline to give you or your Authorized Representative a reasonable opportunity to respond to SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 108 the new information. If the review results in a d enial, Health Plan will notify the Member or the member's Authorized Representative. The notification shall include: The specific factual basis for the decision in clear understandable language; References to any specific criteria or standards on including interpretive guidelines, on which the appeal decision was based (including reference to the specific plan provisions on which determination was based); A statement that the Member is entitled to receive upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim. If specific criterion was relied upon, either a copy of the criterion or a statement that such criterion will be provided free of charge upon request. If the determination was based on medical necessity, experimental treatment or similar exclusion or limit, either an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment, applying the terms of the plan to the Member's medical circumstances, or provide a statement that such explanation will be supplied free of charge upon request.

If we send you a notice of an adverse decision to an address in a county where a federally mandated threshold language applies, then you or your Authorized Representative may request translation of that notice into the applicable threshold language. A threshold language applies to a county if at least 10 percent of the population is literate only in the same federally mandated non-English language. You or your Authorized Representative may request translation of the notice by contacting Member Services. If Health Plan fails to make an appeal decision for a non-urgent Pre-Service Appeal within 30 days or within 60 days for a Post-Service Appeal, the Member may file a complaint with the Bureau of Insurance. Expedited A ppeal When an Adverse Decision or adverse reconsideration is made, and you, your Authorized Representative, or treating health care provider believes that such Adverse Decision or adverse reconsideration warrants an immediate Expedited Appeal, you, your Authorized Representative, or your treating health care provider shall have the opp ortunity to appeal the Adverse Decision or adverse reconsideration by telephone on an expedited basis. An Expedited Appeal may be requested only when the regular reconsideration and appeal process will delay the rendering of covered Services in a manner that would be detrimental to the Member's health. You, your Authorized Representative, or your treating health care provider may initiate an Expedited Appeal by contacting Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the Mid- Atlantic States, Inc.: SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 109 During Regular Business Hours Monday through Friday from 7 :30am - 9:00pm Inside the Wash ington, D.C.

Box 1157 Richmond, VA Fax: -SIG(01 -23) 120 SECTION 6 - TERMINATION OF MEMBERSHIP Your Group is required to inform the Subscriber of the date your coverage terminates. If your membership terminates, all rights to benefits end at 11:59 p.m. on the termination date. In addition, Dependents' membership end at the same time as the Subscriber's membership ends. You will be billed at Non- Member Rates for any Services you receive after your membership terminates. Health Plan, Plan Providers and Participating Providers have no further responsibility under this EOC after your membership terminates, except as provided under \"Extension of Benefits\" in this \"Termination of Membership\" section. This \"Termination of Membership\" section describes how your membership may end and explains how you will be able to maintain Health Plan and KPIC coverage without a break in coverage if your membership under this EOC ends. Termination Due to Loss of Eligibility If you meet the eligibility requirements described under \"Who is Eligible\" section on the first day of a month, but later in that month you no longer meet those eligibility requirements, your membership terminates on the last day of that month unless your Group has an arrangement with Health Plan and KPIC to terminate at a time other than the last day of the month. Please check with your Group's benefits administrator to confirm your termination date. Termination o f Group Agreement If Your Group Agreement with Health Plan and KPIC terminates for any reason, your membership ends on the same date. Termination for Cause By sending written notice to the Subscriber at least thirty -one ( 31) days before the termination date we may terminate your or your Dependent's membership for cause if You or your Dependent(s) knowingly perform an act or practice that constitutes fraud, which under certain circumstances may include, but is not limited to, presenting a fraudulent prescription or physician order, selling your prescription, or allowing someone else to obtain covered Services using your health plan ID card; You or your Dependent(s) make an intentional misrepresentation of material fact in connection with your coverage. If the fraud or intentional misrepresentation was committed by the Subscriber, we may terminate the memberships of the Subscriber and all Dependents in the Family Unit. If the fraud or intentional misrepresentation was committed by a Dependent, we may terminate the membership of only that Dependent. We may report any Member fraud to the authorities for prosecution. Termination for Nonpayment You are entitled to coverage only for the period for which we have received the appropriate Premium from your Group. If your Group fails to pay us the appropriate Premium for your Family Unit after a grace period of thirty -one ( 31) days, we will terminate the memberships of everyone in your Family Unit. SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 121 Rescission for Fraud or Intentional Misrepresentation A rescission of coverage means that coverage may be legally voided all the way back to the day Health Plan and KPIC began to provide coverage, just as if the coverage never existed. Subject to any applicable state or federal law, if Health Plan and/or KPIC make a determination that a Member performed an act, practice or omission that constitutes fraud or made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact under the terms of this Evidence of Coverage, Health Plan and/or KPIC may rescind coverage under this Evidence of Coverage by giving no less than thirty ( 30) days advance written notice. The notice will contain: Clear identification of the alleged fraud ulent act, practice, or omission or the intentional misrepresentation of material fact; An explanation as to why the act, practice, or omission was fraudulent or was an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact; Notice that the covered person or the covered person's authorized representative, prior to the date the advanc e notice of the proposed rescission ends, may immediately file an internal appeal to request a reconsideration of the rescission; A description of the health carrier's internal app eal process for rescissions, including any time limits applicable to those procedures; and The date when the advance notice ends and the date back to which the coverage will be rescinded. The rescission will be effective, on: The effective date of coverage, if we relied upon such information to provide coverage; or The date the act of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact occurred, if the fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact was committe d after the Effective Date of Your coverage. Your premium will be refunded from date of coverage being rescinded. You or Your Dependent have the right to request an appeal from us for the rescission of coverage. Please refer to Section 5 (Getting Assistanc e: Claims and Appeal Procedures; and Customer Satisfaction Procedure) section for a detailed discussion of the claims and appeals process. Extension of Benefits In those instances when your coverage with us has terminated, we will extend benefits for covered Services, subject to Premium payment, in the following instance: If you become Totally Disabled while enrolled under this Agreement and remain so at the time your coverage ends, we will continue to provide benefits for covered Services. Coverage will continue for one hundred eighty ( 180) days from the date of termination or until you no longer qualify as being Totally Disabled, or until such time as a succeeding health plan elects to provide coverage to you without limitations as to the disabling condition, whichever comes first. To assist us, if you believe you qualify under this \"Extension of Benefits\" provision, you must notify us in writing. Upon termination of the Extension of Benefits, the Member will have the right to continue his or her SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 122 coverage as described below. Limitation(s): The \"Extension of Benefits\" section listed above does not apply to Members' whose coverage ends because of failure to pay Premium; or Members' whose coverage ends because of fraud or material misrepresentation by the Member. For the continued health coverage of disabled Members that exceeds eighteen ( 18) months, Health Plan and KPIC may increase the premium it charges by as much as fifty percent (50%) . The employer may require the disa bled Members to pay all or part of that total increased premium. In no event will continued health coverage extend beyond the first month to begin more than thirty ( 30) days after Social Security determines that the Member is no longer disabled. The Member must notify the employer within thirty ( 30) days of the date of such a Social Security determination. Discontinuation of a Pr oduct or All Products We may discontinue offering a particular product or all products in a market, as permitted by law. If we discontinue offering in a market the product described in this EOC, we will give ninety ( 90) days prior written notice to the Subscriber. If we discontinue offering all products to groups in a market, we will give one hundred eighty ( 180) days prior written notice to the Subscriber. Continuation of Gr oup Coverage under Federal Law (COBRA) You and/or your Dependents may be able to continue your coverage under this EOC for a limited time after you would otherwise lose eligibility. Members are eligible for COBRA continuation coverage even if they live in another Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Region or allied plan service area. Please contact your Group if you want to know whether you or your Dependents are eligible for COBRA coverage, how to elect COBRA coverage, or how much you will have to pay your Group for it. If your Group is not eligible for COBRA, you and/or your Dependents may be eligible for continuation of coverage under the existing Group coverage for a period of at least twelve ( 12) months immediately following the date of termination of your eligibility for coverage under this Evidence of Coverage. Continuation of coverage for twelve ( 12) months is not applicable if the Group is required by federal law to provide for continuation of coverage under COBRA. If applicable, this coverage shall be provided without additional evidence of insurability subject to the following requirements: The application and payment for the extended coverage are made to the Group within thirty - one ( 31) days after issuance of notification of your continued rights, but in no event beyond the 60 day period following the date of termination of eligibility; Each premium for the extended coverage is timely paid to the Group on a monthly basis for the 12-month period; and The premium for continuing the coverage shall be at the Health Plan's current rate applicable to this Evidence of Coverage plus any applicable administrative fee not to exceed two percent (2%) percent of the current rate. The Group Administrator shall provide you or other persons covered under this Evidence of Coverage written notice of the availability of the option chosen and the procedures and timeframes for obtaining continuation of continued of this Evidence of Coverage. This notice shall be provided within fourteen (14) SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 123 days of the Group Administrator's knowledge of your or other your Dependent's loss of eligibility under this Evidence of Coverage. USERRA If you are called to active duty in the uniformed services, you may be able to continue your coverage under this EOC for a limited time after you would otherwise lose eligibility, if required by the federal USERRA law. Members are not ineligible for USERRA continuation coverage solely because they live in another Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Region or allied plan service area. You must submit a USERRA election form to your Group within sixty ( 60) days after your call to active duty. Please contact your Group if you want to know how to elect USERRA coverage or how much you will have to pay your Group for it.

Attorney Fees and Expenses In any dispute between a Member and Health Plan or Plan Providers or Participating Providers, each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other expenses. Contracts with Plan Pro v iders Health Plan and Plan Providers are independent contractors. Your Plan Providers are paid in a number of ways, including salary, capitation, per diem rates, case rates, fee for service, and incentive payments. If you would like further information about the way Plan Providers are paid to provide or arrange medical and hospital care for Members, please refer to your Provider Directory or call our Member Services Call Center in the Washingt on, D.C., Metropolitan area at (301) 468-6000, or in the Baltimo re, Maryland Metropolitan Area at 1 -800-777-7902.

However, you may be liable for the cost of non- covered Services or Services you obtain from non- Plan Providers, except for Emergency Services or authorized referrals. If our contract with any Plan Provider terminates, for reasons unrelated to fraud, patient abuse, incompetence, or loss of licensure status, while you are under the care of that Plan Provid er, you may continue to see that provider and we will retain financial responsibility for covered Services you receive, in excess of any applicable Co -payments, Coinsurance or Deductible s for a period at least 90 days from the date we have notified you of the Plan Provider's termination. Governing Law Except as preempted by federal law, this EOC will be covered in accord with the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia and any provision that is required to be in this EOC by state or federal law shall bind Me mbers and Health Plan whether or not set forth in this EOC.

Incontestability Any statement made by the Policyholder or a Member in applying for insurance under This Plan will be considered a representation and not a warranty. After This Plan has been in force for two years, its validity cannot be contested except for nonpayment of premiums. No statement made by any person insured under the policy relating to his insurability or the insurability of his insured dependents shall be used in contesting the validity of the insurance with respect to which such statement was made: 1) after the insurance has been in force prior to the contest for a period of two years during the lifetime of the person about whom the statement was made; and 2) unless the statement is contained in a writing and signed by the Member.

SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 126 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act provides for parity in the application of aggregate treatment limitations (day or visit limits) on mental health and substance use disorder benefits with day or visit limits on me dical and surgical benefits. In general, group health plans offering mental health and substance use disorder benefits cannot set day/visit limits on mental health or substance use disorder benefits that are lower than any such day or visit limits for medical and surgical benefits. A plan that does not impose day or visit limits on medical and surgical benefits may not impose such day or visit limits on mental health and substance use disorder benefits offered under the Plan. Also, the Plan may not impose Deductibles, Co- payment, Coinsurance, and out of pocket expenses on mental health and substance use disorder benefits that are more restrictive than Deductibles, Co -payment, Coinsurance and out of pocket expenses applicable to other medical and surgical benefits.

Util ization Management Program Step Therapy Process Selected outpatient prescription drugs require step therapy. Step therapy is a process that defines how and when a particular outpatient prescription drug can be dispensed by requiring the use of one or mor e prerequisite drugs (first line agents), as identified through Your drug history, prior to the use of another drug (second line agent). The step therapy process encourages safe and cost -effective medication use. Under this process, a \"step\" approach is required to receive coverage for certain high -cost medications. Refer to the Formulary for a complete list of medications requiring step therapy. This means that to receive coverage, You may first be required to try a proven, cost -effective medication befo re using a more costly medication. Treatment decisions are always between You and Your Provider. Your prescribing Physician should prescribe a first -line medication appropriate for Your condition. If Your prescribing Physician determines that a first -line drug is not appropriate or effective for You, a second- line medication may be covered after meeting certain conditions. Prior Authorization Prior authorization is a review and approval procedure that applies to some outpatient prescription drugs SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 153 and is us ed to encourage safe and cost -effective medication use. Prior authorization is generally applied to outpatient prescription drugs that have multiple medical uses, are higher in cost, or have a significant safety concern. The purpose of prior authorization is to ensure that You receive the right medication for Your medical condition. This means that when Your Physician prescribes a drug that has been identified as subject to prior authorization, the drug must be reviewed by the utilization management progr am to determine Medical Necessity before the prescription is filled. Prior authorization reviews address clinical appropriateness, including genomic testing, safety issues, dosing restrictions and ongoing treatment criteria. If a drug requires prior authorization, Your prescribing Physician must work with Us to authorize the drug for Your use. Drugs requiring prior authorization have specific clinical criteria that You must meet in order for the prescription to be eligible fo r coverage. Refer to the Formulary for a complete list of medications requiring prior authorization. The most current Formulary can be obtained by visiting kp.org/formulary. If You have questions about prior authorization or about the outpatient prescription drugs covered under Your plan, You can call 1- 800-788-2949 or 711 (TTY), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (closed holidays). When an outpatient prescription drug requiring pri or authorization has been prescribed, You or the prescribing Physician must notify the Utilization Management Program as follows: You or Your prescribing Physician can begin the prior authorization process by calling 1-800- 788-2949; Following completion of the prior authorization intake process as set forth in item 1 above, We will notify the requestor within 72 hours for non- urgent requests and within 24 hours when exigent circumstances exist, that: o The request is approved; or o The request is disappr oved due to: Not Medically Necessary; or Missing material information required to determine Medical Necessity; or The patient is no longer eligible for coverage. If We fail to respond within 72 hours for non- urgent requests or within 24 hours when exigent circumstances exist, the request shall be deemed to have been approved. In the event the prior authorization request is disapproved: o The notice of disapproval will contain an accurate and clear written explanation of the specific reasons for disapproving the request. o If the disapproval is due to missing material information required to determine Medical Necessity, the notice of disapproval will contain an accurate and clear explanation that specifically identifies the missing material information. The prior authorization request shall be deemed approved if the notice of disapproval is not sent to the requestor within 72 hours for non- urgent request or within 24 hours when exigent circumstances exit. SAMPLEKaiser Permanente Flexible Choice VA-SG-3TP- BASE -SIG(01 -23) 154 Notices required to be sent to the requestor sh all be delivered by Us in the same manner the request was submitted to Us or by any other mutually agreeable accessible method of notification. Exception Requests You or Your designated assignee or the prescribing Physician may request an exception to the step therapy process described above if: The prescribing Physician submits justification and supporting clinical documentation to KPIC that a covered outpatient prescription drug: o Is contraindicated; o Would be ineffective based on the known clinical characteristics of the Member and the known characteristics of the outpatient prescription drug regimen; o The Member has tried the step therapy -required outpatient prescription drug while under his or her current or a previous health benefit plan, and such outpatient prescription drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness, diminished effect , or an adverse event; or o The Member is currently receiving a positive therapeutic outcome on an outpatient prescription drug recommended by his or her provider for the medical condition under consideration while under the current or the immediately preced ing health benefit plan. KPIC will respond to a step therapy exception request within seventy -two ( 72) hours of receipt, including hours on weekends, to indicate that the request is approved, denied, or requires supplementation. In cases where exigent circumstances exist, KPIC will respond within twenty -four ( 24) hours of receipt, including hours on weekends, to indicate that the request is approved, denied, or requires supplemental documentation. An exception to the prior authorization process will be granted under the following circumstances: If the prescribing Physician, of the prescribing Physician's designee provides documentation of a prior authorization from the Your immediate prior carrier . We will honor the previous authorization for at least an initial thirty (30) days of the Member's coverage.
