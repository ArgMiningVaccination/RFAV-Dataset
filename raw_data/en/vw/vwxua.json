Vaccines are the safest, most effective way of protecting you from coronavirus and flu, and if you or a loved one is living with diabetes, it's so important to check if you're due a Covid booster or a flu jab. Not only do these vaccines offer individual protection, they also help protect those around us, so making sure you and your loved ones are up to date with your jabs will help everyone to stay safe. Who can get coronavirus vaccines Primary doses of the vaccine are currently only available for children aged 6 months to 4 years who are at increased risk of being seriously affected by Covid-19. This includes children with diabetes. Those not in the above at-risk group are no longer able to receive a first or second dose. Stay up to date with the latest rules in your area: If you have been recently diagnosed with diabetes If you have developed a new condition, including diabetes, you may need an additional vaccine before your booster. You can discuss this with your diabetes team who will assess if and when an additional vaccine dose is needed. Young children and infants For the vast majority of children, coronavirus causes mild symptoms or sometimes no symptoms. But for a small group of children with health conditions, it can lead to more serious illness. Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect against this. If you're pregnant or breastfeeding Your healthcare team should talk you through the risks and benefits of getting the vaccine if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. We strongly encourage you to get the vaccines if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

Covid booster jabs The booster programme aims to top up protection for those who are most vulnerable to becoming seriously ill from coronavirus. The spring seasonal booster programme ran from April-June 2023, and new advice has been issued regarding people who will be eligible for a Covid-19 booster vaccine in autumn 2023, from 11 September. The DHSC have confirmed that all people living with diabetes aged over six months should be made eligible for a booster vaccine, following advice from the JCVI. This advice applies across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The relevant health services for all four nations will each separately determine how and when eligible people can access the autumn booster vaccine. You may also be invited to receive an autumn booster jab of the vaccine if you have a weakened immune system, live in a care home, and you're over 65 years old. People with diabetes weren't automatically invited to receive a spring booster jab. You should still have some protection against coronavirus from previous doses. If you're unsure about this or have questions about getting the jab, speak to your GP or healthcare team. Find out more about the groups eligible for the jab from the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/covid-19/covid-19-vaccination/getting-a-booster-dose-of-the-covid-19-vaccine/). How do I get the coronavirus vaccine? Getting your vaccines depends on where you live. Some people may be able to book it themselves, but others will need to wait to be invited.

Now I've had it, I feel safer and less worried in general. Apart from a bit of a sore arm for a few hours later, I felt good and lucky to have been given some protection.\" - [Sarita]has diabetes and just had her coronavirus vaccine. Are the vaccines safe? We know that some people may still be worried about how quickly the coronavirus vaccines were developed. But this was possible because scientists, governments and industry all around the world focused their attention on this one shared goal. All the vaccine trials included the usual number of participants and no stages of development and testing were rushed or skipped. The joint worldwide effort to find a vaccine allowed for funding and approval processes to be fast-tracked, and manufacturing to begin early. This, alongside using existing technologies in the vaccine development, is why they were developed more quickly than usual. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will also continue to monitor the vaccines over time and make sure vaccinations follow a very high standard. And it's also useful to know that the vaccines have been tested in men and women of different ages and ethnicities, with a range of health conditions - including diabetes. There's no evidence to suggest that the vaccine will work less well in people with diabetes. Vaccine side effects Not everyone taking the vaccine will have side effects. If you do have any, they are usually very mild. They normally won't last longer than around 48 hours. The common side effects are: - a sore arm where you had your vaccine - feeling tired - headaches - aches - feeling or being sick. If you don't feel well, it's really important that you stick to any [sick day rules](/guide-to-diabetes/life-with-diabetes/illness) recommended by your diabetes team. If you are concerned about symptoms, contact your healthcare team. Vaccines and blood sugar levels Taking the vaccine could have an effect on your blood sugar levels, some people have reported them going up or down. When you get the vaccine, your body will start to produce what's called an immune response. This may include your body releasing some extra glucose from its stores. This is nothing to worry about. Your body is just reacting to the vaccine because the vaccine is new to you. Find out more about managing [high blood sugars](/guide-to-diabetes/complications/hypers). . Some people report significant hypos we are not sure why this is, but the advice for anyone having a vaccine is to test blood sugars more often. If you've had an allergic reaction to vaccines If you've had a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine, medicine or food before, it's safe to have any of the coronavirus vaccines unless you're allergic to the specific vaccine ingredients. Your GP will talk this through with you if you have a history of allergic reactions and monitor you for about 15 minutes after the jab. Speak to your healthcare team if you're worried about this or have more questions about your previous reactions. What the vaccines are made of The coronavirus vaccines do not contain meat, egg or any animal products. The vaccines are halal and kosher. There's a very small amount of alcohol in some of the vaccines, around the same as there is in bread. We call this negligible, because it won't have any effect on your body. The vaccines are still halal because the alcohol in them is at a concentration of much less than 1%. The alcohol is there to preserve the vaccine ingredients, to make sure it works. The vaccines contain the blueprints for making tiny fragments of coronavirus. This triggers the immune system to react and start making antibodies that are ready to protect you if you later catch coronavirus. Vaccines also contain other ingredients which are added to keep them stable and help them work better. Common ingredients in the coronavirus vaccines include sucrose (a type of sugar) and salt. These are added in extremely small quantities and won't have any effect on the body. You can find out more about the different types of vaccines and full information on vaccine ingredients in the patient information leaflet for the vaccine when you are offered one. "}
