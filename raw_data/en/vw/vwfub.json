This may depend on your age, your condition and whether or not you are taking any other medicines. The usual dose of Edronax in adults is 4 mg taken twice a day. After 3 weeks your doctor may increase the dose up to 10 mg per day, if required. If you are over 65 years or have poor kidney or liver function, the usual starting dose is 2 mg taken twice a day. After 3 weeks your doctor may increase the dose up to 6 mg per day, if required. How to take it Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water. Edronax tablets can be broken in half along the breakline if your doctor has prescribed a half tablet.

It will also help you remember when to take it. It does not matter if you take this medicine before or after food. How long to take it Most antidepressants take some time to work, so do not be discouraged if you do not feel better straight away.

Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you. This medicine helps to control your condition, but does not cure it. It is important to keep taking your medicine even if you feel well.

Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally. Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist. If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.EDRONAX\u00ae Published by MIMS December 2019 2 If you take too much (overdose) Immediately telephone your doctor or the Australian Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) or the New Zealand National Poisons Information Centre (telephone 0800 POISON or 0800 764 766), or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much Edronax.
