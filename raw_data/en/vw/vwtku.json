On Wednesday, Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired a high-level review meeting all districts reporting higher positivity rate need to undertake adequate testing with a higher proportion of RT PCR tests. \"Any laxity will result in deterioration of the situation in these districts,\" health ministry said, adding that there is need to effectively and strictly monitor home isolation cases so that they are not intermingling and circulating in their neighborhoods, and spreading the infection. Vinod Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog said, \"We need to be mindful that Covid has not gone. Looking at the global scenario, we need to be on high alert. There is poor surveillance, poor testing and below average vaccination in many states undergoing the present surge.\" He urged states to improve the testing in areas with high positivity, increase surveillance as per the revised surveillance strategy and speed up Covid-19 vaccination. States were advised to conduct surveillance as per revised surveillance strategy issued on June 9, 2022. They were further directed to report district-wise SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Illness) and ILI (Influenza-like Illness) cases on a daily basis and also to send these for genome sequencing to mapped INSACOG labs. Testing of international arrivals with genome sequencing to continue. Concerned about low levels of testing, the Centre has now asked states to create awareness regarding reporting of those who opt for home-test kits through Rapid Antigen-test kit. Besides, states were asked to step up their drives on free Covid-19 vaccination for first, second as well as precaution doses. Randeep Guleria, Director, AIIMS, New Delhi advised states to be attentive to clinical symptoms of Covid-19 patients and not wait till their genome sequencing is done to identify whether a cluster is emerging in any state. States need to be attentive to the changing pattern of clinical manifestation of hospitalised patients, he stated.
