For a quarter of a century, Halifax Public Libraries has been asking children to send staff their scary stories. Each and every year, the entries have been numerous, surprising, and emensely enjoyable. Many of these young writers are adults now (some are even Library workers), and their paths have taken different directions, but for a brief time, all of them sent a little chill up readers' spines or elicited a merry squeal of grossness.

You are in a dispute with a friend about the name of a character or the actor in a movie. Invariably, one of you will pull out a mobile device and open a search engine app. It is magnificiently quick and, if you are extraordinarily competitive, finding the answer becomes an added bonus. This new era of information finding is exhilerating and liberating. People have access. For Libraries around the world, this is good news. They see the benefits and rejoice in the idea of information getting into the hands of the many. Contrary to a pesky, clinging belief, Libraries have not been left adrift in the wake of new technology. We are embedded agents in your community and we are ever-adapting to your needs for information and knowledge. Needs have changed. People love personalization An Internet search offers millions of options. Many people have become speedy and adept skimmers. We scan the page(s) for the right link to hit. If the quest is merely a search for trivia, then our rewards are fast and we are content and proud surfers.Yet, not every Internet search is trivial. Sometimes, you go to the Internet with a purpose that is intense (health concerns) or personally important (genealogy). You might have a project that requires accuracy (history of the Ukraine and Russia) or reliability (small business market research). In these circumstances, you want your results to adapt to your situation, to filter the unreliable bits of information, and to leave you with a sense of confidence that nothing is missing. You want a customized experience, a way of going beyond the point where online search tools bring you. You need a librarian. Try it once. You will not go back. The Librarian, that helpful spirit and bright mind who has studied (you need a master's degree to be a full-fledged librarian) and has trained to help you find what you want. S/he is your free advisor. Some librarians specialize in an area of interest and are founts of knowledge, but most are practiced in knowing how to find the information you need, how to focus your search and thus decrease your time in getting there, and how to teach you to do it for yourself the next time.Regular library customers become extremely loyal because they feel lucky to have a resource that is free for their use and is always eagerly offered. For example People often ask library workers (not just librarians) for reading suggestions. You can come in blank and after answering a few questions go home with a book that has a smashing chance of hitting the mark. Journalists ask for assistance in finding historical facts quickly. Artists see what grants are available to them. Small business owners can quickly access statistics for their latest business plan. Personalized without the personal Even if you do not like direct interactions with other people, and that is fine. A librarian can still help you. She or he has already found some helpful tools and put them online for you. Often, a library's website has a research section with links to online tools that can help you when you want. These online collections of information are called databases, one of the most underutilized resources at the Halifax Public Libraries. All of the databases are chosen by librarians for their standard of quality and are free to use, if you have a Library Card. Your library has DIY tools, such as the ever-popular Chilton Automotive Repair and Consumer Reports, as well as databases for health, arts, community contacts, genealogy, science, and so on. We have all adapted New technology has changed how everyone functions in society. Libraries are included. Visit one of your branches. See how mindful we have been in our planning and take advantage of us! 5 January - February 2015 | what's up better than a search Engine\"Librarians wield unfathomable power, bring order to chaos, wisdom and culture to the masses, preserve every aspect of human knowledge and rule the information universe.\" \u2014 Urban dictionary ArT ExHibiT Trevor Tolliver Trevor is a self-taught painter, showing his work to the public for the very first time.
