How to perform aromatherapy One of the main and most beneficial ways to use essential oils is to inhale their scents. However, they can also be used in other ways, depending on the health condition being addressed and the person's lifestyle. 1. Inhalation Inhalation is the most holistic way to obtain all the effects and benefits of essential oil. This action allows for molecules to easily reach the limbic system in the brain, which stimulates different functions in the body. To perform inhalation appropriately, you should start off with light inhalations and gradually increase the number and intensity as following: - Short inhalations: 3 to 7 consecutive inhalations, several times per day - Moderate inhalations: 10 to 15 consecutive inhalations, several times per day - Long inhalations: 10 to 15 minutes of consecutive inhalations, several times per day Be sure to breathe in the oil directly from the bottle. You should breathe deeply, hold it for 2 to 3 seconds, and then exhale. It is best to pick an essential oil that is certified organic to prevent inhaling pesticides and other chemicals that can be harmful. 2. Diffuser With this technique, add 2 or 3 drops of your chosen essential oil into a diffuser device. It will release a cloudy smoke and disperse the aroma throughout the room. A more cost-effective solution is to place drops in a cup of hot water, and as the water evaporates, the aroma will be dispersed through the air. 3. Evaporation Evaporation consists of apply drops of essential oil on cotton balls, gauze or a clean cloth and allowing the oil to evaporate on its own and release its aroma. This is a great way to regulate the intensity of the aroma, as the closer you are to the cotton ball or cloth, the more intense the smell. This is also a great method to use in a work environment, as the objects can be placed in a cup on your desk. 4. Sprays Sprays help to spread the aroma in all the rooms you desire. You can add a few drops of essential oil in a spray bottle and add water. Before using the spray, be sure to shake it to ensure the oil mixes with the water. This is a great way to purify the environment of a room, or to concentrate the aromas in just one area of the house. 5. Vaporization This technique is used especially for the treatment of respiratory problems or colds as it allows for the aroma to enter the respiratory system directly. The essential oils are released through vapor, which also hydrates and soothes the respiratory tract. To use this method, pour boiling water into a bowl and add drops of the essential oil of your choice. Inhale the vapor released from the bowl, and if possibl, cover your head and the bowl with a towel to concentrate the water vapor. Vaporization should not be utilized by children under 7 years old. 6. Massage Massage is the perfect way to apply essential oils on the skin, particularly to treat muscular pain, infections, skin issues or joint pain. Add some drops of essential oil to a vegetable oil (like rice oil, sesame oil or coconut oil). You should not apply essential oils directly on the skin, as they can cause skin irritation or reactions. Ideally, you should only mix a maximum of 5 oils to ensure the molecules within the oils remain intact and can be absorbed into the skin. 7. Baths Baths can mix the benefits of vaporization (as a bath permits inhalation of the vapor and aromas) as well as massage (due to the direct skin contact). Therefore, baths can be prepared in nearly all cases. To prepare an aromatherapy bath, fill the bath with warm water and add drops of essential oil until your intended aroma is achieved. 8. Aromatherapy necklace An aromatherapy necklace consists of a small pendant made of metal, porcelain, wood or crystals in which you can pour 1 to 3 drops of essential oil into. These necklaces permit the inhalation of essential oils in the air your breathe, and can be used for a maximum of 2 hours per day. You can also purchase an aromatherapy bracelet, which is used similarly for the same amount of time. Contraindications for aromatherapy Aromatherapy should not be used by children, pregnant women or breastfeeding women unless approved by a doctor. Aromatherapy should be used cautiously by people with a history of epilepsy, high blood pressure, and asthma. Those with allergic rhinitis should be weary of flare-ups or respiratory reactions. Essential oils should be used with caution on the skin, particularly in people with "}
