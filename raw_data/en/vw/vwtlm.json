A WHO guideline is defined broadly as any information product developed by WHO that contains recommendations for clinical practice or public health policy. Recommendations are statements designed to help end-users make informed decisions on whether, when and how to undertake specific actions such as clinical interventions, diagnostic tests or public health measures, with the aim of achieving the best possible individual or collective health outcomes. The Guidelines Review Committee ensure that WHO guidelines are of a high methodological quality and are developed through a transparent, evidence-based decision-making process.
