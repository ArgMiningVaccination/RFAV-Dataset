Alternative medicine, however, is on the rise with treatment centers such as Stanford Chiropractic taking a leading role in treating various health conditions. Alternative healthcare professionals use a different approach in the treatment of their patients than the standard traditional methods of drugs and surgery. They embrace the use of less invasive, natural solutions in treating ailments of the body and health conditions and adopt new ways of taking care of the whole person! Why Non-Allopathic medical providers are called \"Alternative\" Health Care? Traditional allopathic medicine has been popularized through the strong lobbying bodies of the American Medical Association (AMA) as well as the Pharmaceutical industry which accounts for a large percentage of allopathic medical treatments. Between these two lobbying groups, the World Health Organization and the other various health governing bodies of the USA and its states have adopted health care protocols and insurance reimbursement standards that favor the AMA and the Pharmaceutical industry while attempting to eliminate and minimize the use of alternative healthcare whose practitioners have either been denied prescription rights or who have chosen not to make pharmaceuticals a part of their health care practice. Why Choose Alternative Medicine Practitioners? While allopathic treatments of drugs and surgery may often reduce and relieve pain and other symptoms temporarily, these treatments are not always the best-suited treatments available to obtain optimal relief of symptoms with minimal side effects. Allopathic medicine has become very effective in Emergency Medicine. But the side effects of drugs and surgery often out weight the benefits for many less serious conditions that are often best treated with less invasive treatments that emphasize the body's ability to heal itself. Alternative health practitioners emphasize these types of less invasive treatments and emphasize the treatment of the cause of the patient's conditions as much as possible while minimizing the emphasis on simply treating the presenting symptoms. When the symptoms are the focus of the care, this is often referred to as palliative care and in this type of care that the conditions are bound to recur after a short time because the cause of the symptoms has not been addressed.
