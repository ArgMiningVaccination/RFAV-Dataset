Eating a healthy diet containing plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, and taking regular exercise are important self-help measures but acupuncture can give your immune system a boost too to help you fight off coughs, colds and flu. Whilst many people know of acupuncture as a treatment for many specific conditions and effective pain relief, it can also be used to strengthen the immune system and improve its functioning and bring the body into balance and promote positive energy flow throughout the body. Acupuncture treatment is derived from the principles of Chinese medicine which views health as a balance between the yin and yang forces which depend on the proper circulation of the vital energy 'qi' along energetic pathways or meridians. Acupuncture treatment does this by acting on the circulation and balance of 'qi' or life-force in the body to maintain and improve well-being. Acupuncture is also effective in the treatment of depression, Seasonal Effective Disorder (SAD), fatigue and anxiety experienced over the dark winter months. It can also help those suffering from chronic illness or disease to obtain the boost to the immune system they need to overcome their illness and heal. Acupuncture is drug free and can be used alongside conventional medicine. "}
