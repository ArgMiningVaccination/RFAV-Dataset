It provides unprecedented potential for using innovation as a tool for teaching learning and increased opportunities for all. Innovation has an impact in all fields including education as it can also influence all areas of school education such as Curriculum Planning and Development, Generating Innovative Textbooks, Harnessing Mass Media and Technology for Transacting Curriculum, Teacher education, Teacher Training and Assessment in scholastic as well as Co-s cholastic areas. The board through its education Reforms and more predominantly through the strengthening of Continuous and Comprehensive evaluation in 2009 has brought about a major shift in de-emphasizing the Public examination or board examination at the end of Grade X. The fact that teachers need to be facilitators and classroom coordinators so that learning happens in the classroom and the fact that strategies such as 'talking pairs' or pair work, small group work, group work or whole class work promote real learning the environment for nurturing creativity can be easily provided inside the classroom. The CCe also emphasizes that multiple modes of assessment may be harnessed in Formative Assessment such as project based learning, seminars, group discussions, debates, role play, quiz, experiments, field trips, research projects etc. The grading system which for many years was in a nascent stage was finally implemented and its merits far out way the de-merits. The challenge of replacing marks with grades in a system which has been primarily mark oriented and mark dominated is understandable. It is here I feel that technology can play a great role by generating different kinds of question types for students in a classroom assessing them and keeping records as well. When I think of semi-urban and schools situated in the remote districts I wonder if the effects of technology enabled education are available to teachers and students alike. There are various ways in which a resourceful teacher can supplement her lessons and make them interesting by using other forms of mass media such as television and newspapers. The Cbse is also running programmes on strategic Leadership and effective school Management through various agencies so that it can provide opportunities and a platform for schools to participate in this process of sharing.4 Innovation in EducationThe Cbse also emphasizes on celebration of the national education Day and celebrating the day by organizing activities based on the theme `Child Centred education'. This year the 18th national Annual Conference for sahodaya school Complexes will be held from 27-29 Dec., 2011 at Chennai and the theme of the conference is `Quality Improvement in schools'. The theme is not only current but also topical as it reflects the concerns and issues raised in the national Curriculum Framework 2005, the Position Paper on examination Reforms, the Report of the national Knowledge Commission and also the Right of the Children to Free and Compulsory education Act 2009. I hope that schools will benefit from the articles in this issue and contribute to the forthcoming issues which are also based on relevant themes. VINEET JOSHI Chairman Central board of s econdary education In this increasingly skill driven knowledge economy, necessary investments in education, including enterprise based vocational education and training and market based knowledge and skills in higher education, are going to be crucial to maintain India's Innovation driven growth and its cutting edge in knowledge based industries. - Innovation in India National Knowledge CommissionJuly-September 2011 5v\u00e8;{k dh growth of the Indian economy, Innovation is emerging as a key driver, although this may neither be apparent nor readily visible. - Innovation in India National Knowledge CommissionJuly-September 2011 7Innovations in Education Mrs. Radha Mahalaxmi* Definition The term innovation is derived from the Latin word innovatus , which is the noun form of innovare \"to renew of change\", stemming from in-\"into\" + novus-\"new\". Although the term is broadly used, innovation generally refers to the creation of better or more effective products, process, technologies, or ideas that are accepted by markets, governments, and society. Innovation differs from invention or renovation in that innovation generally signifies a substantial positive change compared to incremental changes (Wikipedia). Indian Education System Indian education system has undergone several changes since ages from Gurukul system to modern day. In every aspect of education like curriculum, pedagogy, methodology, educational technology, teacher education, there are changes. education system has incorporated these changes and innovations that were brought from society, parents, students and also from community school education is a deliberate and more-or-less external intervention in the life of a child. Although much learning and teaching takes place at home and in the neighborhood community, the influences of schooling also plays a very important role. Ideally, education is supposed to encourage the students to analyze and evaluate their experiences to doubt, to question, to investigate - in other words, to be inquisitive and to think independently. In the Post-Independence period, a major concern of the Government of India and of the states has been to give increasing attention to education as a factor vital to national progress and security. Problems of educational reconstruction were reviewed by several commissions and committees. Most of the education commissions advocated the reforms in education system, pertaining to curriculum, pedagogy, methodology in teaching, educational aids, examination, evaluation system and also in teacher education. Inspite of the various recommendations as per nPe 1986, school education remained to be exam oriented, bookish and information loaded devoid of practical aspects. The development in technology has changed the world outside the classroom. It is more eye-catching and interesting for a student than the classroom setting. As a result, students find classroom instructions as dull and devoid of life and it does not interest them for learning. Information Technology has made learner techno friendly and has brought joy in learning. Innovations in Curriculum Lot of changes have come in curriculum. \"Curriculum must stand on three pillars of relevance, equity and excellence. one of the major curricular concerns is providing education for a cohesive society so that equality of opportunity and access to qualify education to various groups including girls, learners with special * Principal, Kendriya Vidyalaya, Steel Plant, Sector 1, Vishakhapatnam8 Innovation in Educationneeds and learners from disadvantaged groups is ensured (s econdary educational Commission 1964-66). According to the needs of the society, it has changed from basic education to 10+2+3 education system to vocational education to ICT integrated curriculum The national Curriculum Frame work - nCF (2005) strongly recommends \"the curriculum must enable children to find their voices, nurture their curiosity to do things, to ask question and to pursue investigations, sharing and integrating their experiences with school knowledge rather than their ability to reproduce external knowledge (p.13)\". It motivates schools to \"provide opportunities to students to question, enquire, debate, reflect and arrive at concepts to create new ideas (p.18)\". The curriculum framework emphasizes developing critical thinking among students making them active learners; this can be made possible by taking advantage of ICT and working on multiple intelligence models. Innovations in Teaching Methodology The most important aspect of learning is developing capacity for abstract thinking and reflection. The students learn in a variety of experiences like reading, experimenting, listening, thinking, reflecting, writing, expressing oneself in speech etc. Thus conceptual understanding can be developed by engaging students actively in learning process. Active involvement involves exploration, enquiry, questioning, discussion and reflection leading to creation of ideas. Hence, the challenge before the teacher is to initiate a process of active involvement in learning of various concepts. several teaching methodologies thus evolved in the process. education methodology transformed from teacher centered to child centered education to child inspired education as advocated in nCF 2005. Human resources contributed their best to the development of innovations in educational methodology. Teacher education has changed drastically according to modern societal needs. Innovations in Education Technology Information and Communication Technology (ICT) provides a support to the student to take an active role in the learning process and strengthen all of the multiple intelligences necessary for quality learning. ICT provides to share discoveries and discussions. ICT continually provides students with enrichment outside of class hours. ICT provides follow-up on weekly activity schedules. ICT provides and maintains instructions for groups and individuals. ICT provides and encourages students to make more efficient and intense use of computers. e-learning has become an important tool in child's learning process. software development has taken place for development of different subjects, language learning, arts, and crafts including library maintenance software. education technology and internet has brought tremendous change in bringing outside world to class rooms and to children's minds. online teaching and learning methods using wikis, Web 2.0 in class rooms, social networking sites like facebook, orkut, twitter, educational blogs and educational video games have brought tremendous revolutionary innovative changes in modern educational system. These online teaching and learning methods attract young generation and make learning interesting and at the same time develop self-learning. It also helps in blended July-September 2011 9learning. Professional learning networks and social networking sites have brought the education fraternity together and helped in sharing the knowledge resources all over the world. Technology has brought \"Joy in Learning\" as per the aspiration of nCF 2005. Innovations in Evaluation Methods and Tools Innovations in evaluation methods and tools have also changed throug-innovative evaluation methods like Continuous and Comprehensive evaluation (CCe), through paper-pencil tests, debates, seminars, quizzes, symposia, etc (CCe Manual IX-X of Cbse). The CCe system evaluates the child not only in academics but also in Co-scholastic and Co-Curricular area. The new evaluation methods have helped the child to understand, think and reflect and to perform well. The new evaluation methods have helped the child to develop self-confidence, ability of expression, social behavior, right attitude towards teachers, class mates and environment and to develop various life skills. They have also promoted various co-curricular activities like swimming, nCC, Yoga, Art and Craft, scouting etc., thus taking care of overall personality development of the child. *** \u0003 10 Innovation in EducationInnovations in Education Chitra Nakra* I am reminded of the words of Jean Piaget who said \" The principal goal of education in schools should be creating men and women who are capable of doing new things not simply repeating what other generations have done -men -and women who are creative, inventive who can be critical and verify, and not accept everything they are offered\". For this, learning process should become proactive and promote a thinking culture. The learner should be restricted not only to the text but should also have access to a variety of innovations so that they can relate it to their real life experiences. The emphasis should be on higher order thinking and reasoning skills. We have to create a stimulating learning environment that allows young minds to flourish and make them constructivist in learning. The use of technology can really augment learning. The impact, application and utility of technology in the sphere of education have come to stay in all walks of our life. new technologies such as You Tube, Podcasting, Mobile phones etc. have actually compressed distance and made communication more accessible. We, as, teachers should influence the use of these technological facilities so that the students are guided in the safe and beneficial use of technologies. The use of technology will become successful because it will make the students more engrossing and engaging and help the teachers to meet them on their own desired platform. The following innovative technologies may be exploited by the teachers : Podcasting : Podcasting is a method of communication allowing anyone to create audio/video files and posting them to the Internet for others to download and watch/listen to at any time. These files can be downloaded to a personal computer or handheld device such as an iPod or iPad. Virtual School Library : one of the key components in the virtual school library is the development of Virtual school Library Communications portal where students may interact with teacher-librarians and other educators\u2014sharing student/educator-generated book reviews, student/educator-produced videos, participate in online polls, or attend online reference service podcasts designed to teach students how to use a particular library database or tool. 3D Printing Technology : 3 D Printing stimulates a student's mechanical, spatial awareness in ways that text books can not. A student can do much more than drawing, apart from this they can even evaluate it, refine and also access how it fits in the larger assembly. besides technology the following innovative techniques can also be incorporated in school. Online Value Education : We need to impart basic skills needed to keep our children rooted to our culture and also for collaborative and co-operative endeavour for living together in a spirit of peaceful co-existence. Computer Music Lab : Research has shown that music education before the age of seven has lasting effect on a child's intelligence. A Computer Music Lab in school can be used to make music compositions. Theatre in Education : As per conventional understanding drama presupposes a script with an inspiring tale. especially, social science in school offers a great deal at content for dramatics. Theatre in education intends to bridge the gap between theory and practical knowledge. Innovative methods of teaching learning processes will ensure effective learning outcomes. We need to transform and not reform the learning system in order to reduce the stress on children and bring about tangible results. * Principal, V eda Vyasa DaV Public School Vikaspuri, New DelhiJuly-September 2011 11Small Steps Lead to Big Changes Dr. G.P . Pandey* The future of the country rests not in the hands of soldiers and merchants but in those of the students and scholars, as rightly put by Dr. Annie besant. standing on the threshold of budding youth, a student cherishes - splendid Vision, Colourful dreams, buoyant hopes. education has become the mission statement of the middle class. It is this tool, which has empowered it. This class works hard and has made its presence felt and is quietly surging ahead for the stable future of its next generation. Globalization, the rapid technological advancements and the exodus from one point of the world to the other, all these are bringing a challenging time for the educationists. The demands of the rapidly changing world are high and thus creativity, opportunity and achievement have climbed up the top steps of the ladder of success. The swirl of changes demand changes in education as well. The rise of Internet has broadened the horizon of information. students are not confined for any piece of information to their teachers. Learning and sharing by interacting has become an essential part of building knowledge. With the advent of CCe - Comprehensive and Continuous evaluation, the stress is on creating understanding. End result : Lead fulfilling and productive life. It is required that the young generation is prepared for the challenges of the world. The present scenario in Indian education is a witness to revolutionary changes. These changes stemmed from the roots of dissatisfaction. The enthusiasm to explore and learn had somehow diminished with the exam phobia. The young children as natural scientists should develop a spirit of enquiry. The discontent also merged when our learners became restless, passive audience as if being entertained by performer in the form of a teacher. At this stage innovative practices come at fore. The true concept of innovation revolves around the process of shepherding students toward competence and autonomy. If an institution doesn't innovate, it inevitably ages and declines. As a twig is bent, so the tree will grow- William Wordsworth The progression of innovation in an institution requires the following steps: 1. Motivating the motivators: Restore teacher morale. Alternative financial compensation. * Principal, Delhi Public School, Mathura Refinery, Mathura12 Innovation in Education Prevent teacher burn out. Measure and honour the leadership potential of a teacher. Teacher empowerment. 2. Role of the family and parent involvement. 3. sW oT Analysis 4. Defining problems and setting objectives. 5. Create a climate of knowledge, commitment and hard work. 6. Reflection of the Principal and consequently Principal's reflection. Innovation involves a thoughtful, purposeful change- Role shift of a teacher from lecturer to facilitator. Using technology as a tool to facilitate communication and learning. Imparting Life skills so that children are able to thrive in the ever changing, challenging world and shift from curriculum based learning to lifelong learning. bringing personal change and character development of students. Making learning more appealing, exciting, adding a fun element to it. Create rich learning environment. (Teachers as Learners) Initiate and encourage active role of students in organizing, managing and owning their learning, making education relevant. Initiate higher order thinking skills, including, research, critical analysis and problem solving. experimenting in new ways of leading, teaching and learning. evolving teachers as school leaders, Maximize student-teacher output. Introducing students to explore, ask question, do and ultimately learn. equal motivation to pursue the dreams of a child, which he/ she holds in his/ her heart. Remember forward movement has power. Doing nothing and being a silent passive spectator is beginning of the end, so let's embrace the changes and use them to our maximum advantage. our efforts need to be persistent and we must be patient. ***July-September 2011 13Innovations in Education ashok Kumar* ours is a dynamic world which by its very nature is always in a state of flux. It is said that the only thing unchanging in this world is the law of change. Different ages differ from each other only in the pace, and not in the substance of change, and the contemporary world is subject to a pace of change which is unprecedented in human history. India too has had its share of the changes sweeping through the world. some of the changes directly impacting the context of education of which schools are a part, are the transition from the joint family system to the nuclear family system, extreme competitiveness due to urbanization and globalization and the increasing influence of the media and the information technology. These changes have thrown up new challenges such as increasing incidents of suicide, aggression and violence and psycho-somatic illness among the adolescents. being new they require correspondingly new responses. Hence, the need for innovation. If the schools, and for that matter any other institution, fails to find innovative ways of meeting challenges they will run the risk of becoming irrelevant and obsolete. Perhaps the most innovative step that a school needs to take is to break out of the stereotype of being an institution where one set of people called teachers transmit a fixed body of knowledge to another set of people called students/pupils, and into an institution dedicated to creating conditions for holistic development of children. And we submit in all humility that when it comes to doing that, we find ourselves in good company. We view ourselves as an agent of social transformation by nurturing the innovative talent of the rising generation. We should focus on the idea of 'the new', it could be a new, hitherto to non-existent thing like 'Prevenwet' the revolutionary cloth drying device, invented by students of our school, which made national headlines, or our introduction of of e-education very early on. our innovative endeavors should be both at the whole school level and at individual unit level such as classes, houses (CCA groupings), sections etc. At the level of the school, we can introduce innovation of e-learning, computerization of major functional processes and the e-tracking of the movement of our bus fleet carrying students to and from the school. organization of the annual exhibition where - in the students display their innovative potentials in various forms including models and computer displays is yet another major whole - school level activity aimed at fostering the innovative potential of both the students and the teachers. environmental protection with its key element of plantation is one area where the innovative spirit finds itself at its best. We are co-opting with the forest department in organizing Van Mahotsav or the 'great forest festival' so to say, and reaching out to the citizens with a massive plantation campaign by distributing thousands of saplings and educating them about their proper care. sensitizing our students to the plight of the variously challenged constituents of our society: the physically or mentally disabled, the poor, the orphans, school drop-outs and the like forms an important innovative endeavor. *** * Principal, D aV Public School, Hazaribag, Jharkhand14 Innovation in EducationInnovations in Education Divya Matti M.B.* Innovation means introducing something new. nowadays innovation in education is required for an all-round development of the children. It is too much for one teacher to handle on his own which is why more school are looking to adopt learning technologies, to help them teach. Adaptive learning technology is a method of teaching that relies upon computer as interactive training device. When students utilize adaptive technology they participate in the learning process. They don't just passively sit and listen while a teacher lecturers. Instead they are actively engaged in a multimedia presentation that involves auditory and visual components while also encouraging them to answer questions to gauge their understanding and progress. In schools or online courses, these learning efforts are generally pursued in tandem with a teacher who can monitor the students progress and also provide further insight and guidance. The teacher will need training regarding adaptive technologies. Already some teachers are finding it difficult to keep up - with the latest trends in technology and some technologies are so new that it is not yet clear how they might be useful in school. by the use of Adaptive learning Technology, the students will be able to merge economics with social studies and History and Maths with science and english. Arbitrary and artificial barrier between the subjects will be broken down, so students can truly achieve mastery of their studies. It will be an environment of learning towards a thirst for knowledge and a motivation to never stop learning. outdoor learning is also effective in teaching children. by this, children learn with nature and they learn by doing, eg., in science (botany and Zoology), about machines in factories, about historical places etc. when we explain about Floods and Tsunami or other abstract matters the children are not able to understand easily so, the teacher can use some audio-visual aids or may also consider visiting such places. Thus we move the children from abstract to concrete. Innovation in education can make students very creative, intelligent and masters in their studies. *** * Principal, Balodyana English School, Jayanagara, MysoreJuly-September 2011 15Innovations in Education anjana Gupta* \"The aim of education is to prepare the young to educate themselves throughout their lives.\" For India, to get transformed into a self reliant developed nation by 2020, our education policy needs to be revised. education in the global scenario, requires to chisel and polish youngminds- scrape vigorously till they become recipients and reflectors of life today in all its vividness and versatility. The constantly evolving techno-canvas often clashes, paradoxically with the age-old ethical background requiring timely improvisations and sharp intellectual manoeuvres. In the present age of science and technology, it is being increasingly realized that one needs to be educated not only to become a better man and better social being, but education has come to be recognized as the main instrument of socio- economic changes. That is why it has been rightly said that the destiny of a nation is shaped by quantity and quality of students coming out of schools and colleges. nowadays more schools are looking to adaptive technologies to help them teach, although it is not a new concept yet it has become sufficiently advanced and inexpensive to make it a realistic option. A new trend emerging in education is E-Learning. It involves new methods to enhance and transform teaching and learning. Internet and a vast array of digital resources and content is used for the purpose. The major advantage of E-Learning lies in its ability to cover distances. This specialized technique has its access worldwide in every nook and corner, even where traditional training becomes a constraint. Innovations in education will surely improve the standards of all the institutions, develop the performance of students in all faculties and by which the progress of a nation can be viewed nakedly. It is therefore, imperative, that as we enter the new millennium, we would replace the structure with a more humane, objective, forward looking system; where there is more stress on character building and vocational training. A system where the youth not only grows up with a healthy personality but also with wholesome knowledge for this own as well as for the nation's progress. *** * Principal, D aV International School, V erka Chowk, a mrisar, Punjab16 Innovation in EducationInnovation in Education Dr. S.V . Sharma* It is rightly said the future of a country depends on the quality of education imparted to the youth. Indian students placed at high levels in the country as well as abroad are a proof of the intellect provided to them from the good old days of 'Guru s hishya Parampara'. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory education Act 2009 stipulates duties and responsibilities by parents, private schools and local communities to ensure that the children in the age group of 6-14 years. get free and compulsory education. It also sets a benchmark for school education regarding teachers qualifications and duties and need to put an end to private tuitions by teachers. The Act seeks to do away with the practice of schools taking capitation fee. If a school disregards this, it could be fined upto 10 times the capitation amount. If tests or interviews are conducted, a school can be fined Rs. 25,000/- for violation Rs. 50,000/- for every subsequent contravention. Under this Act schools cannot deny admission to a child because of lack of age proof and no child can be detained or expelled until the completion of elementary education, physical punishment and mental harassment will attract disciplinary action under the service rules, 25% of seats in every private school will be allocated for children from disadvantaged groups including differently abled children at the entry level. To promote the enrolment, a provision to provide elementary education in mother tongue has also been provided. educating the girl child has been given the prime consideration by introducing the 'Ladli' scheme and scholarships for the only girl child. some programmes for spreading the importance of education and increasing the number of school going children are national Technology Mission, Primary education Programme. nutrition support for primary education, national open school, Mid-day meal schemes, sarva shiksha Abhiyan. The changes brought about in the curriculum, the CCe pattern, Internal grading etc., have been a welcome change for the students. e-learning of late has become a trend in education. It fosters independent learning and has introduced new methods to enhance and transform teaching and learning. The biggest advantage of e-learning lies in its ability to cover distances and thus provide learning to a wide area. The smart classes, blogs, network multimedia, education website have enhanced the learning skills of Generation Y. *** * Principal, Vidya Bal Bhawan Sr. Sec. School, Education Renu Mishra* \"Everyone knows all the questions, but no one knows the answers\" is what T .S. Eillot once said about the 20th century, with these questions come doubts, uncertainty and without proper guidance, life can become nasty, brutish and short. In such a scenario, it is quite obvious that the educational system carries massive responsibilities. Mr. b.G. Petre has stressed on the importance of global attributes to be effective teachers. As per him- BE, DO and TELL are the excellent role model for our students. The methods of teaching that revolve around the information, instruction, and inspirations are the most effective away to educate our children. Comparing from past years, a lot of change is seen in our surroundings- the long life span, hybridizing, role of human machines, GMos, environment hazards, declination in values, but of all of these, it is the education that can touch young hearts with values with feelings and care. The maximum development occurs from the age of six to sixteen in all aspects i.e. physical, mental, social, personal, moral and religious, and therefore, if he/she gets entangled in any problem, his/her total development would be hampered almost permanently. Therefore educational guidance must form an integral part of education today not only to sort out above mentioned problems but also various types of educational problems like disinterest in studies, sudden drop in scholastic performance without any apparent cause and the other psychological and behavioral problems which interfere with scholastic areas. The students should be motivated for team work. by being part of a team, you can accomplish much more faster. For the holistic growth and the development of a child, moral and spiritual classes/lectures should be organized. since the students are much interested in using hi-methodologies more focus should be to trap what they already know and what they are interested in. For making the lesson more interesting apart from using or animation, videos various topics can be dramatized, or can be displayed in form of puppetry show or mimes. According to spencer- \"Education should be for body and soul both, preference should be given to natural education as nature is excellent teacher\". If we want revolution in education we have to move partially towards ancient education which was a complete amalgamation of guru and shishya with devotion deeply from the bottom of the heart. *** * Principal, Shrimati Innovation in EducationQuality Development in Education through Information and Communication T echnology as an Innovative Practice Dr. Shruti Upreti* one of the prime goals of quality development is to build knowledge, life skills perspective, attitudes and values of a student to transform the society into more predictive and sustainable one. education through innovative practices attempts to uphold and convey the ideals of a sustainable world. It takes into consideration the social, economic, and the environment context of the country and helps in shaping the curricula or program to reflect their respective unique condition. Quality has become the defining element in the 21st century in the context of new social realities. Quality management plays a strategic role in educational organizations to achieve higher standards of learning. Low quality of education affects the development of the country. At a time when the country is liberalizing economy and entering the global market, we need to stress on quality in education. It is the nature of the market economy that one who is efficient to maintain high productivity and quality will survive. education is an important instrument of economic and social development. Teacher and teacher- educators are expected to provide vital inputs towards realization of educational goals. education is a profession that fulfills an important role in imparting information and knowledge. The importance of its role may be assessed by corresponding normative need to build a population of enlightened individuals. The educational institutions are the microcosms of culture and society. They are perceived to equip students with intellectual tools to perform some task, which is critical to the functioning of a society. on a broader scale, the teacher educators are helping the society to produce intelligent and enlightened individuals who prove them to be an asset in its democratic functioning. Educational Goals for the Nation's Progress For the nation's progress it is necessary to remove the isolation of teacher training and bring them all into the mainstream of the academic life of the universities and to build up a closer relation between the schools and the training institutions for preparing teachers for different levels. Goals should be\u2014 To improve the quality of Training-programs and Training institutions. To expand training facilities. To make an adequate provision for the continuous professional development of all the teachers, at all the levels. * Lecturer (C.M.D.E), District Institute of Education and Training (North-East) SCERT , DelhiJuly-September 2011 19 To create appropriate agencies, both at the Centre and in the States, for the maintenance of standards in teacher education. Quality education through better management. The Effectiveness of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) as an Innovative Learning Strategy: The efficiency of an educational system depends largely on the efficiency of its teachers. The quality of education imparted to children depends to a large extent on the quality teaching given by the teachers. Infrastructure, equipment, curricula, books and teaching methods are no doubt important but no other aspect of education is so vital and significant as the men and women who actually teach in our school. The 21st century has clearly shown that ICT (Information and Communication Technology) provides unforeseen opportunities that enable multifaceted growth and development. Technological advances are fundamentally altering and redefining our outlook about information and its mode of dissemination. Today it is important for the teachers to become 'digitally smooth' rather than merely 'digitally literate'. For the teaching community it has become most important to adapt new technologies. The need to introduce new methods has gained new urgency in teachers training. The foremost reason is to provide students the latest skills in the era of rapid technological transformation and innovation. These skills include the need to provide skills related to information, reasoning, improving productivity and imparting skills that will provide students with a competitive advantage. Implanting ICT in teaching-learning process is a major initiative in all branches of educations; ICT has a particularly important role to play in developing provision for bilingual learners. This is concerned with exploring news ways of working with bilingual learners as well as facilitating more established techniques. The increased use of ICT to deliver and enhance aspects of educational provision is now an emerging practice for all learners belonging to rural and geographically remote and mainly monolingual areas thus having advantages in overcoming geographical barriers. Distance and open education schemes that have recently relied mainly on the mailing of written materials, videos, cassette recordings, and radio or TV broadcasting techniques can be increased, enhanced or replaced by new online tools and technologies which have the power to transform the learning environment. Conclusion Teachers's role is very important in this whole process. Teacher is at heart of this transformation in learning to facilitate every student to enjoy learning and to achieve the full potential. Teacher should not only be a communicator but also a mobilizer, persuader, promoter, motivator and coordinator. Teachers have to develop appropriate competencies to be able to create a learning environment in which he/she designs and enhances the learning experiences and supports learners continuously in achieving their programs. ***20 Innovation in EducationInnovations in School Education in the Context of CCE K.L. Nagaraju* Continuous and Comprehension evaluation (CC e) has thrown up a whole set of new ideas in teaching learning process. The classroom dynamics has undergone a sea change. The student centric education has demanded changes from the teacher as well as the system. In all the scholastic subjects, the curriculum transaction can take place through a variety of tools. The opportunity of using these tools has given the teacher a room for innovation. Hence it is worthwhile to explore the possibilities of innovations that our teachers can take up. Innovations can be tried out by teachers during planning, executing and evaluating the above tools. The innovations need not be elaborate but could be on a small scale. Languages: Comprehension can be considered as a psycho-linguistic game. There are many factors which affect the degree of comprehension in learners both listening and reading. Teachers can take up studies of the factors that impede or assist effective comprehension. both listening and reading comprehension provide scope for studies that can be taken up by our teachers. Creative writing is a task that has to be taken up very seriously in our languages classes. Creativity is not prerogative of a select few. Creativity can be nurtured in all types of learners. It is a challenging task for the teachers to encourage and assess creative outputs by the learners. Learning through research projects is an innovative idea which makes our learners independent and self-directed. The dynamics of pair work and group work throw up plenty of opportunities for innovation. Mathematics : Problem solving skills are fairly complex and need to be studied in a classroom situation. The mystery of the process has to be demystified with objective studies. At various levels, the skill manifests differently. Logical reasoning and spatial intelligence develop through systematic and structured experiences. The teachers have to think beyond the text books to devise learning experiences. Science: The very nature of the subject of science provides a lot of scope for taking up innovations. students can become researchers in the pursuit of constructing knowledge. The activities develop objectivity, accuracy and scientific temper. Different experimental setups can be tried out to study the same problem and the results can be compared. Social Sciences: social sciences offer a lot of ideas for innovation. The immediate environment of the students can be a rich resource. Inscriptions, edicts on rocks, writings on copper plates and palm leaves, monuments, photographs in neighborhood can be material for innovative projects. study of local dresses, food habits, languages and dialects practices etc. can form part of interesting innovative ideas for project work. To conclude, teachers would definitely find a lot of scope to take up innovations while using the tools suggested under CCe. Teaching and learning become an enriched activity from the inputs provided by the innovations. Also, by sharing their experiences, teachers can grow together and benefit from each other. *** * Education Officer, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, GuwahatiJuly-September 2011 21Innovation in Education: Some Issues Dr. Manjit Singh* schools play a vital role in early childhood development. The future of students lies in the hands of teachers who can influence a child's growth and ability to achieve in life. Quality education not only enhances a child's future potential it also provides him the skills necessary to function as a productive member of society. so innovations are also required in the field of education. In the education sector, some good innovations have been brought with a great pace during the last decade. The CC e scheme launched by C bse, is a great innovation in the field of education whose impact could be seen in the near future. CCe scheme of Cbse is far better than the traditional techniques/methodologies, but its proper implementation by schools is very important and its success lies in the sincerity and dedication of teachers. The most wonderful part of CCe scheme is that the teacher acts as a guide or facilitator, the student learns through projects, seminars, group discussions etc., thereby supporting the fact of 'learning by doing'. The grading system of Cbse has proved to be helpful in maintaining a meaningful continuity in the assessment pattern from the primary level to the secondary level and also in ensuring a basic uniformity in the schools. Also, this method of assessment will bring conformity and fluidity within education with a recognizable term of reference. Further the CCe scheme has minimized the misclassification of students on the basis of marks, thereby eliminating the unhealthy cut-throat competition among high achievers and has provided the students with more flexibility. The grading of students has taken away the frightening judgmental quality of marks obtained in a test leading to a stress free and joyful learning environment in the school. The result is seen in the form of a better learning environment and academic development. It is important to note here that trainings are important for success of any plan whether it is 's mart Class' or CCe scheme of Cbse. Proper training for the teachers, supervisors and coordinators are required for the smooth and proper implementation of CCe scheme. The \"Mentoring and Monitoring initiative\" of Cbse is a good step is this regard, but much has to be done in this direction yet. In the real sense the CCe scheme is meant for overall development of a student. Rather than judging the scholastic areas as we used to do in the past, now we are able to judge and improve the student's personality in co-scholastic areas also. This may be helpful in making the students good citizens on the country. but, this is just a start and there is still much to be done. We should strive to understand how education could be imparted through advanced communication infrastructure and analyze the impact of the change it could bring in the educational methods and system. There is also a need to understand that how the traditional methods of teaching could be changed with the modern methods especially for the primary school children and examine the benefits of such change. *** * Director, Damesh Parivar International School, a ima Kalan, Punjab22 Innovation in EducationInnovations in Education ajit Kumar * The emergence of the global knowledge economy has put a premium on learning throughout the world. Ideas and know-how as sources of economic growth and development, along with the application of new technology, have important implications for how people learn and apply knowledge throughout their lives. 21st century is characterized with the emergence of knowledge based society where Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a pivotal role. The national Curriculum Framework 2005 (nCF 2005) has also highlighted the importance of ICT in school education. With this backdrop, major paradigm shift is imperative in education characterized by imparting instructions, collaborative learning, multidisciplinary problem-solving and promoting critical thinking skills. Government of India has announced 2010-2020 as the decade of innovation. Reasoning and Critical thinking skills are necessary for innovation. Foundation of these skills is laid at school level. It is desirable that affordable ICT tools and techniques should be integrated into classroom instructions right from primary stage so as to enable students to develop their requisite skills. The combination of education and technology has been considered the main key to human progress. education feeds technology which in turn forms the basis of education. It is therefore evident that Information Technology has affected changes in the methods, purpose and perceived potential of education. Changes to Learning being able to access large databases of information fundamentally changes education, since learners can now be creators and collaborators in the access and construction of discourses of information. Due to their technological literacy, young people can derive cultural capital from their understanding of modern information technologies, and thereby have input into educational change. The same technology also facilitates the rapid exchange of information by researchers on specific topics, so that the speed of the distribution of information is greatly increased. All of these changes in learning have implications for teaching practice as well. Changes to Teaching The highest level of change occurring in relation to information technology and education is in the way teaching is increasingly being seen as occurring via the medium of technology, rather than utilizing technology as an additional extra in the classroom. Information technology particularly impacts course content and teaching methodology and the recruitment and training of teaching staff as well as the content of courses. Information technology requires teachers to learn new sets of skills. Utilizing computer technology improves the educational experience of the students - not so much because of the media itself, but because software programs require teachers to think laterally and systematically, and produce better teaching materials. A teacher's role is therefore to help students to develop skills in order to determine how to find, analyse and interpret information. * Vice principal, Gulf Indian School, Dubai, U.a.E.July-September 2011 23 Information Technology and the Purpose of Education While education in the past has been centered on teaching and learning, information technology has affected changes to the aims of education, therefore now education is increasingly perceived as the process of creating, preserving, integrating, transmitting and applying knowledge. ICT fulfills the following objectives in education. Increase Networking Opportunities: ICT helps to connect schools to other schools, as well as individuals within those schools to one another. This ability to network is especially important for students in rural areas and students in developing countries. Provide Distance Learning: With the advent of ICT, learning has become web-based. As a result, ICTs have started to replace correspondence schools. Supplement Traditional Learning: One of the most common uses of ICT in education involves students using software programs for a variety of purposes. *** 24 Innovation in EducationInnovation in Education Ms. Smita Pant* education is today considered as the third eye of a man. There is a big difference in being 'literate' and 'educated', education can change the whole definition of a country from 'developing' to 'developed'. For India to get transformed into a developed nation by 2020, education is an important component. The importance of education can be interpreted from the reply to the question asked from Aristotle. The question asked was \"How much better educated men were than those who were uneducated?\" The reply was \"As much as the living are from the dead.\" education is one of the most important factors in achieving the developmental goals of a country. It is an investment in the human resources. If the fruits of education have to reach the common man, it must be adequately and properly administrated. Technology based innovation in education can be done in several other ways also. A teacher teaching science subject, takes the class out on the ground and shows them the flora live. The teacher can then put question or ask the students to see and touch the leaves or ferns as per their topic and give them the practical knowledge then and there, instead of every time taking the students to science lab. A Maths teacher teaching Primary classes takes the class out in the school corridors and asks the students to measure the length and breadth of a wall or the floor instead of giving them a classroom teaching on board with chalk. A child will be more interested in measuring the wall by himself or touching the leaf and its nerves and then draw diagrams instead of copying them simply from the board. Today, education is no more a conceptual aspect rather it is more based on practical teaching. one more concept which is very common these days is E-Learning. E-Learning is a flexible term used to describe a means of teaching through technology such as network, browser, CD R oM or DVD, multimedia platform. E-Learning offers many sites which can benefit a learner to a great extent. It is a method of self study which fosters independent and individual learning. Instructors are there to readily help a learner if they get stuck anywhere or need any assistance. *** * Dean, P .G.T .(I.P .) Subodh 25Innovation in Education: The role of computer simulation in teaching Physics Dr. Mahesh Shrivastava* Computer simulation seems to be one of the most effective ways to use computers in teaching Physics. It encourages students to carry out the process used in physics research: to question, predict, hypothesis, observe, interpret results etc. Their effective use requires availability of appropriate teaching resources in Cbse secondary schools curricula. over the last decade, new technologies have made rich and dynamic visual representations possible on common personal computers. Previously, the power of typical computers available in schools severely limited the range of computer based educational experiences available to students. educational simulations of this prior era were often based on simple line drawings, and the degree of interactivity was usually limited to setting one or two parameters and then watching the resulting animation. Modern computational power allows much more complex models, higher fidelity visual representations and gives users of educational simulations the control and flexibility to make changes and see the effects in real time. With these advances, simulations can provide students with opportunities for rich and dynamic educational experiences as well as instantaneous feedback on the results of a virtual \"experiment\". simulation has turned out to be a very useful tool in the transmission of scientific knowledge using models based on experience. by means of 3D digital animations it is possible to show physical phenomena in a realistic way so that we identify them easily with the real situation. simulations are designed to offer the visualization of concepts related to a very complex (from the teaching - learning point of view) phenomenon and to clarify the concept for deeper learning. simulations should never entirely replace reality but are extremely useful when we have to study experiments which are impossible to do in practice (for being very expensive, very dangerous, very slow, very fast, etc.). n ormally simulations offer the possibility for pedagogic exploration. In physics education, these goals officially became a part of nCF-2005 and when new educational aims were incorporated into Cbse physics curricula. The words \"information technology\" occurred for the first time in the curricula in connection with modeling activities. According to this newly formulated aim \"students should be able to model basic physical phenomena and processes with an effective use of modern information technologies. This aim has connected two trends of today's physics education: strengthening of the role of IT and didactical transformation of modern research methods into school learning. *** * Department of Physics, Kendriya Vidyalaya, CSWRI Campus, a vikanagar, Rajasthan26 Innovation in EducationInnovation in Education Devaanshi Goswami * The times change fast, so do all things. everything is ever changing. Change is the Law of nature. And also, the beauty lies in the change: 'k.ks&'k.ks ;UuorkeqiSfr :ie~ je.kh;rk;k% The change is so visible around us. The stories of earlier times, which our grandparents recount to us, in contrast with our times, speaks of the great change that has taken place. Means of transport have change, forms of entrainment have changed, our eating habits have changed, our thinking has changed, society has changed, and altogether, the world has changed. education is no exception. It has changed radically. People from old generations never tire of telling about how the standards of education have come down as compared to theirs. but this is not at all true. Like everything, the world has progressed in this direction too. All the development around us is the result of Research and Development (R&D) activities in all fields. education has also had its R&D and the results have been positive, in fact, we could not have done without innovations in education. The pace of progress of the world around us had to be matched up with enlightened minds. or, it can be seen the other way round as it is the result of well educated and enlightened minds. The perpetuity of change in everything has necessitated drastic changes in the content and techniques of education. both the syllabi and pedagogy have changed, to cope up with the modern times. And it has to be so. In olden times, in our country, Aashram system of education was there. Children were sent to the gurukuls (s chools) in aashrams of Rishis. They were taught, there, things necessary for the life of those times. They were given lessons in scriptures and moral education in order to lead a good life. swami Vivekanand emphasized on the need of such education in our times also. He said. \"We want that education, by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, intellect is expanded and with the help of which one can stand on one's own feet.\" This is true and necessary even today. but it needs to be complemented with the latest of our needs. Today's needs stand totally different from those of the olden times. so, education as per the present needs has to be incorporated in the education system, retaining what is good and time-tested. Management and Computer science have to be taken up with the moral education. And, not only the content, but the techniques of education have also got to be upgraded and evolved. Although, we have made great progress in this regard so far, but this is a continuous process. It can never stop. so, we have always had the question before us. What is next? * Student of Class IX-C, St. Dominic's Sr. Sec. School, MathuraJuly-September 2011 27Wooden planks, called pattis along with liquid chalk were substituted by slates and dry chalk, now those have been substituted by paper and pencil. Poorly printed monochrome books have been replaced by multicolored books laid out with the help of computers. Though wooden, clay and plastic models came up to a great help in explaining complex ideas in science and other subjects, they too have given way to computerized modeling. And it has been so only for the sake of betterment. In fact, to pursue the best is human. so we have use of computers in this field too, which is the best we can have now. now the same question once again: what next? We can see the future of things through the window of the present. The present can forecast a lot about the future. The present times are the era of computers and the future times are also going to be those of the computers, may be of far too advanced computers. It is a fact that computer is a Wonder Machine. Its hardware is made use of through different software. World's computer scientists and software engineers, all agree the fact that through all our software and all means, we are able to exploit only 5% of the computer's mechanical potential, so 95% still lies there untapped. If we are able to make only up to the 50% of computer's capabilities, ours will be just another world. Hybrid sciences are opening up new possibilities for the mankind. Amalgamation of life sciences with computer science may bring to exist a different human life surrounded by different bio-mechanical machines and computers, that may revolutionize our education techniques also. but, for now, one thing is certain that computers are here to stay, playing the greatest role in education and innovation is essentially supported by computers. Modelling is must for explaining all kinds of complex models, systems, ideas and concepts in different subjects. Computers are the best means of highly advanced modeling. Audio Visual 3-D models can make everything crystal clear. From this point of view, all the classrooms should be turned into computerized laboratories, where lessons are given with the help of multi-media computers and the students take their lessons on their palm-tops. The transition from wooden planks via slates and paper must rest with computers for efficient learning apart from saving our environment by making schools poper-free. Computers can be a better means of communications between the students and teachers. Computers can come up to a great help for communication with physically handicapped children. Computers are great machines for analyzing data. And the teachers can make use of them for the best possible analysis of their students and develop newer methods and techniques of teaching. so, for computers and computer-aided innovation, the sky is limit. The only thing to be remembered always is that our fancy should fly one heaven above possibilities. ***28 Innovation in EducationInnovations in Education Stuti Krishana* INTRODUCTION- The moment the word 'education' is heard the only thing that comes in mind is teaching or learning something. education is considered to be the most important element/ investment in converting the human resource as the human capital. As it is known to all that the human resource is the most important type of resource required to make a country more prosperous and developed. EDUCATION TODA Y- The meaning of education has changed in the present era. Today unlike ancient times students are not being taught under the trees in an open ground instead they are being taught in well furnished classroom where they have separate seats for them and are able to study comfortably. They have got books to study from, which was not the case earlier. The availability of books has made it easier for the students to study. Today education is not just being spread through books or by the teachers but many other ways have been discovered and are being used to spread education. one of them is the internet which is a global network and provides information about everything. The electronic and other kinds of mass media has also made us connected with the day today happenings in the whole world. sitting in the schools for seven to eight hours and then studying the same thing at the home makes studies quiet boring and as a result students do not study with an interest. To solve these problems many methods are being adopted nowadays. students these days are taught through computers, by the videos to make the things more interesting for them. It is also a fact that we are able to remember what we see twenty times better than what we hear. With modern technology getting more advanced day by day, there is an even greater need to introduce the child early on, to this new dimension of education and try and build his interest in the same. Distance education has also become a new trend in education. It is a boon for those students who really want to pursue their education but have no time to attend regular classes. It is an effective option to continue education. CCE - The most recent changes in the education system is the Continuous and Comprehensive evaluation system which is purposely introduced to reduce the increasing burden on the students. Most of the student's time is spent in schools and the rest in doing the homework which develops a feeling of unrest and irritation within them. often in tenth standard students commit suicide due to their failure in the exams or because of the burden of the studies. so to solve this problem this system has been implemented. This encourages students to participate in various activities. This also helps to show their talent and bring out their creativity. The students who may not be very good in studies are able to prove themselves in other activities. This reduces the workload on students and helps to improve the overall skill and ability of the student. Grades are awarded to students based on the work experience, dexterity, innovation, steadiness, teamwork, public * Student, Class IX, St. Dominic Sr. Sec. School, MathuraJuly-September 2011 29speaking, which help the students who are not good in academics to show their talent in other fields such as art, humanities, sport, music, athletics, etc. Many parents believe that being engaged in the projects is the wastage of time and money. but this in itself is brilliant for education as students are able to learn new things from these projects. With the Cbse all set to introduce new courses in areas like Fine Arts, Music, Carpentry and other skills at the school level, schools are all geared up to cater to the new tidal wave in education. Along with all of the above changes the government is taking many steps to improve the quality of the education. It is trying to provide everyone with free primary education. Many poor families do not send their children to schools as they consider it a wastage of time. so Government has introduced many schemes such as Right of Children to Free and Compulsory education Act 2009, Midday meals, special schools for girls. People are being made aware with the value of education and its need to make the growing population an asset for the country. *** \u0003 30 Innovation in EducationConsequent to the psychological, technological and philosophical researches in the field of education many newer techniques strategies and approaches have been incorporated to the repertoire of teaching learning process. Rather than the methodology of teaching, the individuals teaching style is of pivotal importance in teaching, learning process. There is a general criticism about the attitude of some of the teachers. some of us teachers may follow conventional and unpsychological means and ways of dealing the subject and students alike. This type of \"s trict and scary\" style will create an unpleasant atmosphere in the class, in which learning can never take place. A desirable style of teaching viz. \"Firm and Fun\" , in which the teacher, though firm in her/his decision and stand, projects a relaxed and humorous approach, is the need of the hour. To adopt a 'firm and fun' style of teaching, the knowledge of the theories such as \" emotional Intelligence\" (e I) \"Transactional Analysis\" (TA) is quite helpful. eI refers to acquisition of some core competences such as knowing one's emotions, managing other's feelings, ability to motivate, empathy and handling relationships. Certainly internalization of these competences will help them develop ability to control one's emotions and the classroom situation, effectively. similarly the application of the theory of TA will enable us to achieve effective learning styles. It helps us to avoid playing unnecessary \"Games\" (familiar pattern of behavior which occurs outside adult awareness). In school settings and the effective use of positive and the negative strokes (giving recognition and withdrawing it). Use of TA obviously helps us to employ complimentary transaction in classroom. In short, apart from the manifold strategies and approaches in transacting the curriculum, as teachers, we need to prioritize most desirable individual style of teaching. More than skill and knowledge of the teacher, it includes attitude and mood of the teacher. Dr. N.K. Vijayan Karippal Principal, Apsara Public s chool, Kasaragod, Kerala Since we live in an age of innovation practical education must prepare a man for work that does not yet exist and cannot yet be clearly defined - Peter Drucker How very true are the above words in the era of emerging technology and in the face of millions of marginalized children who are not yet touched by education. \"Innovations in education\" is a broad spectrum of multitude of topics related to education. Innovations can be for the teacher, the taught or the process itself. Innovation can be in techniques, tools used to impart knowledge or in methodology employed by the instructor. Innovation can also be in the curriculum, syllabus, assessment and evaluation (Cbse - CCe)!What other principals say...July-September 2011 31For bringing out any innovation in education the following principles should always serve as guidelines: i) learning should be learner centered ii) there should be enough room for students to innovate iii) the approach for teaching/learning/assessing should be flexible and open ended to be all inclusive (mobile schools for street children, earn while you learn) iv) the focus should always remain on all round development of learner v) students should be made accountable for results vi) students should take charge of their own learning For any innovation in education it is essential to the point of being imperative that the teacher becomes a learner and the students who are the consumers become the designers of own learning. only when the tables are turned, then a change can be brought about. Teaching is essentially communicating and any innovation in ICT can revolutionalise the teaching learning process but it is also essential to forge lasting contacts between the fact and skills (problem solving, critical thinking et al.). It is here that the teachers role as a catalyst comes forth and can never be denied. There definitely is no substitute for teacher and his/her role in sifting through sands of knowledge and separating the grain from the chaff. A teacher always is a vital spark for all change, progress and improvement. Mrs. Sujata Sinha Principal, bVbARR s, Hyderabad Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh Innovations in education help in promoting excellence and sustain quality in teaching and learning process. It connects the communities; strive for all round improvement of teachers and the students. Mental faculty of the students takes a spark and a chain reaction leads to faster and sustained learning. The innovations evolve responsibility among the students, meet community expectations of quality education, accelerate competitiveness thus diminishing interdependence and sustain viability and flexibility. The core essentials of positive innovations are as mentioned below: 1. explore the latest development and trends in education. 2. Link the education with ultimate aim of the student and with the path adopted to achieve these goals. 3. examine the need for sustainable educational system. 4. Integrate the latest technology (gadgets), software and systems into the education system. 5. Debate the future of education, the challenges before ever evolving educational system, viability of the historical aspects and weeding out the obsolete part. 6. balancing the traditional spirit and new interpretation of the text and statues under the light of changes and new inventions and new vistas of knowledge.32 Innovation in Education 7. Learn from innovative case studies where educational institutions have taken initiatives, like our school has taken initiative to adopt different tools of assessment in CCe like puzzle (jigsaw) reading, framing of question paper, and equivalency with co-scholostic and support curriculum. 8. engage in series of seminars, designed to debate the theory and practical of real improvement in education. 9. Participate in, conferences, workshop designed to develop the core-competencies of the students. 10. Activate the students are activated in different aspects of education taking their capacities and abilities as the parameters to define quantum of load of performance. Dinesh Jindal Principal, Rawal Public s chool, ballabhgarh, Faridabad For a long time now, educationists have been feeling a need for Parent education. since a child's views, attitudes, habits and learning are to a great extent influenced by parents, both by way of heredity and dogma, it is imperative that every conceivable change starts there. The school scene is under constant change but the family scenario has only transitioned from crowded bazaars to posh malls, from Ramlilas to Multiplexes!! Resultantly the child is torn between two worlds, utterly confused and directionless. And when the calamities in their development occur, there ensues a war between teachers and parents blaming each other. between the school and home there is no bridge. Half hearted, prejudiced parents' orientation programs were no answer. so, a system of Home Visits was devised in our school, whereby every class teacher was required to visit the homes of all her respective students once a year. A questionnaire was designed to keep the teachers focused on issues of : - s tudy culture - emotional comfort and stability - Habit development - Value s ystem This reaching out to the parents is not only bringing about a slow and steady improvement in parenting but has also given us a rich harvest of other benefits as well. Ms. Ritu Kohli Principal, eicher s chool, s ector-46, FaridabadJuly-September 2011 33some innovative educational techniques being followed in our school for effective teaching learning process are : 1. Whole School Improvement Plan : A team evaluates the current state of the school. A plan of action for overall improvement of the school is made for the next year. 2. Study Booster Techniques 3. Preservation of Country's Heritage 4. Clarifying and Sharing Learning Intentions as a Criterion for Success : Teachers use review techniques at the end of the lesson to help students assess what they have learned. every project is designed with specific evaluation guidelines that are shared with the students in advance. 5. Project based Learning : Projects are taken up to accelerate the learning process and ensure that the information gets stored in brain making memory links. A. David Principal, Darshan Academy, Kirpal bagh, n ew Delhi The educational scenario today is changing at a rapid pace and in order to stay abreast with the same the mentors have to be innovative in the everyday matters of the teaching-learning experience. We are required to think ahead of times and all our plans must be chalked out in such a manner that we can meet the impending challenges. \"an ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching,\" - Mahatma Gandhi With this thought in mind the school should design some innovative remedial measures for the defaulters. We should adopt positive reinforcement methods which aim to root out the deviant behaviour of the students in such a way that the whole experience becomes a learning experience and the student concerned emerges as a better and enlightened individual. Reformatory measures must be formulated to help students with behavioural disorders. Children require guidance and sympathy far more than retribution. Juste Millieu-Commune Bonum (Humane Law for Commmon Good) is the principle that must be followed. These suggested measures may be used to rectify the wayward behaviour of the educands and help to make them even more wholesome. In addition to this the counsellor should hold sessions and perform diagnostic tests to understand and check the earrant demeanour of the students. Thus we can make 'automomy of the conscience' becomes a thorough reality. Dr. Hemlatha Mohan Honorary Advisor & ex-Principal, Delhi Public s teel Jharkhand) sign of life- for life is dynamic; and that which does not change is stagnant, unprogressive, static\". education (of any kind); is also a metaphor for change, growth, development, progress hence 'innovation'. 'Innovation' therefore, is essential to growth as it is the main catalyst which spurs it on. It is also born of necessity and with sole intention of bringing about betterment, effectiveness and efficiency.34 Innovation in EducationInnovations, planned and executed with honesty, integrity and a genuine concern for the welfare and growth of all, have a miraculous and amazingly gratifying effect however; it can be equally disastrous to bring about change (in the name of innovations), where only certain vested interests are served for one's own short-termed personal interests/goals. \"Innovations in educations\" should only be implemented if they make things work in the interest of those being educated. 'Innovations' for the sake of 'innovations' are a strict \"no-no\"! Mrs. P . Arora Vice Principal, sri Padampat s inghania education Centre, Kamla n agar, Kanpur Teaching is an art of imparting knowledge to another. A teacher creates an inspiring and confident atmosphere in the classroom. A true teacher projects a passion and zeal which itself is infectious and contagious. An enthusiastic teacher is never gloomy and heavy hearted. He has to play an actor, a comedian at times. The mental frequency and wavelength of thoughts have to match before the communication. A teacher's gestures, tonal variations, expressions from an atmosphere for effective learning and teaching. Ms. Anju Rai Principal, bansi Vidya n ikten s r. sec school, ballabragh, Faridabad 'Innovation is defined as a process by which varying degrees of measurable value enhancement is planned and achieved. - Innovation in India National Knowledge CommissionJuly-September 2011 35\"Innovation in education is the creative selection, organization, and utilization of human and material resources in new and unique ways which result in the attainment of a higher level of achievement of the defined goals and objective.\" Many countries are engaged in education reform in order to develop the human resources necessary to remain competitive in the international arena. one keyword in many of these reforms is innovation. However, innovation in education appears to have multiple meanings. sometimes, it refers to the need for education to develop innovative people. sometimes, it refers to new products, processes and business word. Many modern examples of innovation in education exist around the world, the common denominator that can be observed throughout 21 st-century competencies, providing learners with key knowledge and skills. The issues of innovation in education involve complex and multi-faced challenges such as education policies, curriculum reforms, new diversity-oriented learning technologies and methods. Moreover, the challenge faced may differ from country to country and from school to school in each country. Therefore, the challenge will have to take into account the specific nature of the education innovation in question, the context it is located, in the teacher and student profile, the historical background of the country or region, local habits, needs and practices, ethics and even religious beliefs. effective change comes from introducing the necessary tools and providing teacher and school administrators with the professional development they need. by building, a culture of innovation within education, we can improve opportunities for success in learning. Designing for innovation must embrace the need for Key Performance Indicators (KPI), the identification of Critical success Factors (CFs), and efficient communication channels. These enable the measurement of accomplishment levels, the ability to ascertain successful implementation, and the communication of expected program outcomes to relevant stakeholders as a critical part of the process. The ever-changing global scenario for ideas demands \"out-of-the-box\" thinking for innovation in education. students need to be in a learning environment with modern pedagogies and multiple sources of educational materials and curricula that are interactive and engaging and that effectively utilize the technology at hand. Teachers need to assume the role of facilitators and allow learners to drive their own learning process, to be exposed to interdisciplinary and project-based learning, and to tap into the increasingly digital world in which they live. What can make the difference is superior process backed by practical skill-building and supportive leadership. This is a ray of hope for school reforms in India and for the world. Neena Mahajan PRT Khaitan Public s chool, n oidaWhat other teachers say...36 Innovation in EducationInnovative teaching is the process leading to creative learning, implementation of new methods, tools and contents which could benefit learners and thus the creative potential. Innovation in education is the most important component in today's times of \"globalization and education\" and \"globalization of education\". Innovative teachers can generate enlightened minds. They can instill confidence and will power in students to help them realize their dreams and bring about a change. Innovative teaching calls for creativity in teaching. Creativity in teaching favours understanding over memorization. Therefore any learning that does not imply mere content acquisition has a component of creativity. Innovative teaching is both the practice of teaching for creativity and of applying innovation to teaching. both these aspects call for an educational culture that values creativity. Teachers who are the key figures in constructing a creative climate need to be supported by the policymakers and institution. Curriculum and assessment are the key areas that need to be addressed in innovative teaching. Curriculum should undergo a skilful and thorough development, giving importance to every subject, taking creativity into consideration and defining it coherently throughout the curriculum. Curriculum should be such that it allows freedom and time for discovery and takes learners' 'interests 'into account. Assessment on the other hand should allow creativity to flourish both at micro (day to day) and at macro levels (examinations). each of the three functions of assessment i.e. diagnostic, formative and summative must contribute to development of both knowledge and skill. Teaching should be innovative as it allows education to become more relevant. The steps of teaching should be innovative and the process of education should be founded on the ancient platonic principles coupled with the newest contemplative technologies and a host of methodological approaches. Aparna Sharma In-charge sen eicher s chool, Faridabad (Haryana) Technology can be used to teach mathematics by exploring its dynamic nature. Technology can serve at least four roles in the teaching of mathematics. specifically, technology can aid in 1. Mathematical concept and skill development 2. Mathematical problem solving 3. Mathematical reasoning, and 4. Mathematical communication (Kimmins, 1995; Kimmins and bouldin, 1996).July-September 2011 37Technology as an Aid in Mathematical Concept and Skill Development specifically in the area of mathematical concept and skill development, technology empowers students to deal with multiple representations; enhances ability to visualize and increases opportunity to construct mathematical knowledge. eg. GeoGebra can be used in developing mathematical concepts and skills. GeoGebra is an educational software for exploring and demonstrating Geometry and Algebra. It is an open source application and is freely available. It is capable of representing mathematical objects (at present 2-dimensional) algebraically and geometrically. Conclusion Technology can be easily used in teaching mathematics and exploring its dynamic nature. It can be used to build mathematical concepts and skills. Dynamic geometry software can be used to create dynamic simulations which provide opportunities for students to gain mathematical understanding through exploration using multiple representations. Teaching mathematics to students at middle secondary students presents many challenges. engaging these students can be difficult, especially as the mathematics they study becomes more abstract. Dynamic geometry offers opportunities to bring the real world into the mathematics classroom, to add visualization, colour and animation, not possible in a traditional classroom and to deepen the mathematical thinking we except in various topics of the curriculum. Sanjay Gulati PGT shri s hankaracharya Vidyalaya, Hudco, bhilai (CG) Teachers are involved in a man-making factory and that requires sensitivity and subtlety. Computers can control the robots working in an assembly of a car making factory but the big question is \"Are children the same as the cars?\" \"Can computers control a class full of elementary school children each with different individualities and not predetermined mechanical characteristics?\" \"Can human behavior be ever made so predictable that it can be controlled and decoded by a machine?\" If such a thing happens then that would be the beginning of our journey towards the end of human civilization. A computer can have programmed responses to a particular situation but it can not innovate and if it is ever able to innovate then it will also be conscious of its role and power and thus would initiate a process of being its own master rather than allowing us to master it. A computer can never display the warmth and affection of a human touch. A teacher's pat on the back works wonders in motivating a student but a computer cannot replicate that warmth of an affectionate touch. The true purpose of education is to develop the qualities of the head, the heart and the hand. A computer may successfully teach the values of head and hand to human children but it can never teach the values of heart. so computer taught children would lack an understanding of emotions and feelings and how to deal with those.38 Innovation in EducationA computer can be a good teaching aid but no amount of artificial intelligence can replace a good teacher because at the end of the day when all is said and done an artificial intelligence will always be artificial because it will be mere intelligence and no imagination. Mr. Anwar Hussain Mazumder PGT english, Army Public s chool, s hillong, Meghalaya Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) which include radio and television, as well as newer digital technologies such as computers and the Internet have been touted as potentially powerful tool for enabling educational change and reform. When used appropriately, different ICTs are said to help expand access to education, strengthen the relevance of education to the increasingly digital workplace, and raise educational quality by, among others, helping make teaching and learning into an engaging, active process connected to real life. The potential of each technology varies according to how it is used. Learning with the technology means focusing on how the technology can be the means to learning ends across the curriculum. It includes: Presentation, demonstration, and the manipulation of data using productivity tools Use of curriculum-specific applications types such as educational games, drill and practice, simulations, tutorials, virtual laboratories, visualizations and graphical representations of abstract concepts, musical composition, and expert systems Use of information and resources on CD-ROM or online such as encyclopedia, interactive maps and atlases, electronic journals and other references Avinash Agrahari PGT Chemistry, Air Force s chool, Gorakhpur Abrupt rush of schedules from their classes to the computer lab with buzz of the bell suggest that technology conversant learning has the potential to break off lethargic classroom monotony. Conventional teaching day by day is becoming rusty and dull. It has become unable to realize the complete self of the child, unreliable for a teacher in any subject, to attract the attention of present generation learners. All the classroom activities are failing teachers as well as learners, more or less even the curriculum. I find following points to press upon the need for innovation in education: 1. Primary and secondary education in this country is based on learning from 19th century. 2. Regardless of the tradition, we are not teaching kids how to learn.July-September 2011 39barring a few institutions where we have facilities as well as encouragement for innovation on regular basis Government owned institutions give little incentives for innovation. I empirically know how a student feels when he sees documentary from Indian navy, Air Force or Army every fortnight on Video Projector. nevertheless even when he is out of the school after completion of his +2, educational school has practically no control on him, he takes UPsC nDA test in April and try his utmost to clear. such is the impression received that he takes every single chance to be part of a Defence Forces even when there is none to motivate him outside the school. His compassion lies in his build up as we were successful in having him live the life of Armed Forces rather than preaching him to serve the national cause. Sanjay Kumar Shanedilya Assistant Master sainik s chool Gopalganj, bihar A modern classroom is totally different from what it used to be earlier. Teaching is now not just restricted to the dull, boring and monotonous way of lecturing the students, it has been transformed totally. A retired person if asked how an ideal classroom should be; the most likely answer which can be expected is that an ideal classroom is one which consists of a blackboard, chalk, duster and a good teacher. If the same question is put to some young child, he will not be satisfied with this kind of a description of a classroom. Today's students want much more than just a good teacher. The world is developing at a very fast pace and today; the technological advancements have greatly influenced our system of teaching as well. We, all must have heard the concept of smart class which has been introduced in most schools wherein the teacher is able to bring the various subjects to life. The abstract concepts can be visualized by the students which make it easier for students to grasp the concepts and retain them for long. The smart class concept has revolutionized the entire style of teaching. The board which serves as a projector for displaying various modules or power point presentations can be anytime converted into a whiteboard to write. It seems magical and all this makes it very interesting for the students and catches their fancy and hence the attention is sustained. Computer is also widely being used for teaching purposes. Teachers are able to hold group discussions over computers with the students. not only this, the teachers can make the students interact with educational experts directly in the class itself using a webcam along with computers. excursion is yet another way of bringing a boring lesson to life. The students are given a practical experience, rather than giving any theoretical knowledge. They can learn a lot themselves, in this way.40 Innovation in EducationTeaching should be lively, it should be enlightening / illuminating. Thus if the present methods of teaching like the explanation method, demonstration method, inductive - deductive method etc. are supplemented with a few of the above mentioned ways of teaching, it will do wonders and will remarkably improve the performance of the students. Neha Gandhi TGT - english Aadharshila Vidyapeeth Pitampura, Delhi our past experience of teaching History at the secondary and senior secondary levels reveal that by and large the students gradually lose interest in the subject and prefer to cram the facts without their proper understanding, follow shortcut methods, devote little time to understand the subject and also ignore its application and importance in its wider perspective. An effort was recently made to take up an innovative study on 'open ended approach for teaching history at senior secondary level'. Open-Ended Approach : In this approach Learners are encouraged to study the subject at their own pace. Apart from studying the prescribed nCe RT books, they are also motivated to study the supplementary literature on the subject, consult the primary/secondary sources of information visit historical places, use ICT as source for collecting relevant information, using political/physical maps of the World, europe, Asia, India etc. to develop better understanding about the places referred in the text book and honing their mapping skills. open-ended approach in itself is considered to be an innovative method of teaching history. Role of Teacher : The teacher should act as facilitators. In order to imbibe interest among the students and to create congenial environment for learning, the teacher should be free to use composite method of teaching. He can use the combination of Lecture method, Discussion Method, Text book Method, Project Method keeping in view the level of students understanding and comprehension power. or any other locally evolved method of teaching, can be followed. However, teachers should be generally encouraged to use interactive method of teaching; promote study of supplementary literature and above all, use ICT as a tool for making teaching more effective. our basic aim should be to make our teaching student-centered and at the same time allow them to share their experiences and ideas to make the teaching further more joyful and lively. Arun Kumar Sharma Lecturer in History Government Dindigul A skill is the learned capacity to carry out pre -determined results often with the minimum outlay of time. This can also be defined as competent excellence, dexterity etc. Identification of skills in students and encouragement to home such skills at young age will be beneficial to them. sRV, organizes various activities to bring out their innate talents. skill exhibition is one such activity. Student of Soundararaja Vidyalaya, Dindigul during the Skill Exhibition students participated in this exhibition very enthusiastically and exhibited many new and innovative artifacts. exhibits varied from historic collections, which included coins, stamps, facts of events gone into history, achievements of great leaders to toys and dolls, drawings, paintings, craft works, photo collage, photo collage, quotes and thoughts etc. Collections of computer codes and rare photos etc. were also in the game.

First Aid in the School The Renaissance Academy, Tilhar To equip the teachers with the knowledge of dealing with the day to day medical problems and emergencies that may occur with the students during school time, a workshop was arranged in The Renaissance Academy, Tilhar, Distt. shahjahanpur (U.P .). Leading physician of the city Dr. Alok Agrawal conducted a workshop for the faculty of the school with the help of power point presentation and practical demonstration. The salient features of his talk are being reproduced here- 1. Fainting during assembly or while standing for long duration, specially during summers is very common in young children and can be recognised early if child feels dizzy and disoriented, has cold, clammy and pale skin. Remedy would be to make the child lie on a couch, sprinkling water on his face and giving him glucose water or electrolyte solution. 2. If the child appears lethargic, his temperature should be recorded, and if it is more than normal (98.4 F or 37\u00ba C), child should be sent to the doctor. Dr. Agrawal explained in detail about different kinds of thermometer and how to record temperature correctly by demonstrating mercury and digital clinical thermometers. He also explained the difference between centigrade and Fahrenheit systems. 3. Most of the medical emergencies inside the school world over are because of injuries, therefore Dr. Agrawal explained about different kinds of injuries and their remedies- a) Abrasion- It is a breach in the continuity of the skin and requires proper dressing, for which a First Aid box should always be ready in hand. All the components of First Aid box were demonstrated to the faculty and their usage was also explained.82 Innovation in Education b) Contusion or bruise is a blue coloured patch on the skin because of collection of blood, skin being intact. It requires cold compresses and some anti inflammatory drugs. c) Cut and laceration - These are deeper injuries, injured site must be compressed to check the bleeding and dressed and the child must be shown to the doctor. d) Sprain - Very common injury during play or jump from height resulting into swelling and pain at the site of the joint. It is the injury of ligament which connects one bone to another, therefore always occurs at joints. Treatment is to rest the part concerned, cold compresses and elevation of the part with crepe bandaging. Then the child should be attended by a doctor who will prescribe anti-inflammatory drug. Dr. Agrawal stressed that in no case a sprain should be subjected to unqualified quacks who can twist and turn the joint and can make the conditions worse. e) Fracture - May occur on jumping from height or on falling from swings or for any reasons. There is an excruciating pain, sometimes visible abnormality in the proper shape of the limb. Dr. Agrawal showed how to splint the patient with the help of wooden scales and bandage it prior to shift the child to doctor's clinic. Dr. Agrawal also stressed for the safety measures to be adopted in the schools like avoidance of water logging in the campus to avoid a slippery surface, careful and supervised movement of children on staircases and padding of fine sand in the vicinity of the swings. 4. Nosebleeds - These are very common and can occur as a result of injury to nose, very high temperature or with a high blood pressure in older children. It should be dealt with pinching the nose near nasal bone for at least five minutes, asking the child to breathe through mouth, leaning forward to avoid flow of blood to the lungs and to spit out any blood which comes in the mouth. Putting ice over the nose also facilitates early clotting of blood. Doctor must be consulted of course. 5. Epilepsy - This is a very important disease characterized by abnormal jerky movements of limbs usually precipitating in school going age group. Three main types may be found- 83 July-September 2011(A) Generalized Epilepsy - Child suddenly loses his consciousness, whole body becomes rigid for about half a minute followed by jerky movements of all the limbs. Froth can come out from mouth and tongue can be bitten by teeth. Additionally, child can void urine in clothes. Consciousness is regained after few minutes on its own. This sort of fit can occur for the first time in child's life or may occur even if he is on treatment. Here lies the importance of having record of child's medical history with the school. During the fit, child should be made comfortable on a couch to avoid injury to the jerking limbs, folded handkerchief or a towel should be placed between the teeth to keep the tongue safe. no water should be poured in the child's mouth during fit or after that when he is unconscious. When the fit subsides, child should be shifted to the doctor. (b) Focal Epilepsy- The abnormal jerky movements are limited to one part of body like arm or leg or face, child does not lose consciousness and the jerks stop spontaneously in a minute or two. Child should be sent to the physician. (C) Absence Attacks- Child momentarily becomes absent from the surroundings, stares in the space and may drop the things in hand. Knowledge of this type of epilepsy is important otherwise the child may be blamed to be careless or naughty. Ask the parents to consult physician. Dr. Agrawal stressed that ignorant people still consider epileptic fit as some sort of attacks by the evil spirits and family considers discussing about it as a taboo. Using broom or a shoe to make the victim conscious is all superstitious, as the patient always regains consciousness on its own. Dr. Agrawal demonstrated the convulsion or fit on himself, and stressed that every teacher must be well acquainted how an epileptic fit presents, and the first aid which can be rendered to the child at school level.

It was really a moving experience for all of us. This visit to V.M.V. orphanage, Thrissur made us realize the depth of blessings that God almighty has showered on us. Heritage Education at Spring Dale Senior School structured Heritage education at Spring Dale Senior School dates back to the year 1999- 2000. At that time the school had just started its association with sPICMACAY. We had taken up the co-ordination of SPICMACAY activities in Punjab with late Ms. Manveen sandhu appointed as the state-co-coordinator. We were getting exposed and sensitized towards varied forms of our culture and heritage. Classical music, dance, theatre, literature and various art forms in their manifestation in paintings, photography, sculpture, pottery, calligraphy and folk arts and crafts which sPICMACAY brought to schools and colleges offered very exciting possibilities for holistic education. During that time when we traveled to various institutions to start chapters of sPICMACAY, the interaction provided us valuable insights into integrating education with culture and heritage. The broad picture of experiential education and value based integration of arts with mainstream education was taking shape in our minds. The Beginning... Around that time we came to know that some conservation project was on at Kishankot- a small village near sri Hargobindpur about 40 kilometers from Amritsar. A Krishna temple in the middle of the village was undergoing conservation work. A team of conservation artists and restorers was working on the temple and a few young students from Delhi were camping in the village for their research work. It was a great opportunity to expose children to all these learning avenues. The very idea of a Hindu temple being conserved in a village which was inhabited predominantly by sikh community had great educational value. Few Hindu families who used to live in that village were forced to move out during the time of terrorism in the nineteen eighties for fear of their lives. but the sikh community not only preserved the temple but also kept the tradition of lighting the diya in the absence of its caretakers. besides this symbol as a celebration of brotherhood and communal harmony, the village offered various other educational opportunities which we wanted to tap. Logistics were worked out and the students were taken in school vans to Kishankot every saturday. Divided in small groups they had different aspects to study as they visited there week after week along with their teachers. Expanding Horizons... enthused by this experience we continued to organize a diverse range of heritage education programs for students regularly. Most elaborate among these were 'Grassroots in the Desert' a ten day camp of an entire class of students and teachers in village Hamira in Distt. Jaisalmer, Rajasthan to give the students from 'the land of prosperity' an experience of 'the land of scarcity' and 'Rediscovering my Holy City' a heritage survey of the city of Amritsar exploring living, natural and architectural heritage of Amritsar. In the mean time the school developed its Centre for Creative and Performing Arts aiming to integrate cultural and heritage education with the 110 Innovation in Educationmainstream education. Through the traditional arts and crafts learnt from original artisans and trained teachers the children explore nuances of Pottery, Tie and Dye, sculpture, Calligraphy, Paper Craft and many other art forms. In performing arts too Punjabi Dhol, sikh martial art Gatka and different styles of Punjabi folk music and dances are part of the children's learning repertory in the school. C.b.s.e. circular dated Jan 2010 on Heritage education came as a motivation. We felt encouraged that all efforts which we had been putting together all those years were in the right direction. The guidelines given in the circular provided us the framework to further structure and consolidate our heritage program. so the heritage week and heritage day celebration, heritage walks, heritage quiz, the oath taking- everything made sense and fell in place. Reiteration of the same in the Cbse circular of Jan, 2011 and particularly the idea of Adopt a Heritage Scheme, provided the backup strength since we were already in the process of finalizing an agreement with Punjab Heritage and Tourism Promotion Board to be given the responsibility of maintenance, care and promotion of Pul Kanjri - a recently restored and conserved monument belonging to the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh on the Indo-Pak border. adoption of Heritage Site... An MoU was signed and we were officially handed over the custody of this beautiful monument. It consists of a well designed square shaped stepped pond on the eastern side of which stands a temple. There is no deity inside but people of the village tell us that it was a shiva temple. It still has beautiful wall paintings depicting Hindu Gods and Goddesses. The paintings depict Lord Vishnu in various avtars besides scenes of Lord Rama, Krishna, Durga and other mythological Gods on its upper walls and ceiling. outside walls of the temple also have some weather beaten remains of paintings difficult to identify. on the opposite side is an enclosed 'zanana bath' (bathroom for the ladies). on the northern side is a big ramp leading up to the bottom of the pond. The southern side is the entrance to the monument which also has two underground water channels meant to supply water to the pond. school has appointed a chowkidar cum caretaker at the site. He is available there all through the day. He opens the gate in the morning and locks it at night. He attends to the visitors and acts as a guide. In his free time he keeps an eye on the unwanted vegetation growth and cleanliness of the place. During their initial visits some plantation was done by students to beautify the site. The guard acts as a gardener for taking care of the flower beds and plants. since he belongs to a nearby village he is available all seven days. Heritage Education... There are various plans to make educational use of the monument. For the first year though its one visit per class- 6th grade onwards to have a feel of it and its surroundings. surroundings too have huge possibilities. Its unpolluted settings among lush fields, the border fence, a war memorial belonging to 1971 action and the nearby villages offer a plethora of subjects for the visiting students. They will get a real experience of what a historical monument is like, how it suggests information about the era to which it belonged, what is conservation, why we need to protect our historical monuments etc. besides, there is scope for more detailed and research based projects on wall paintings, architectural design, historical perspective, folklore connections, relevance to the 111 July-September 2011villagers and so on. But the ideal outcome would be the germination of thoughts in the minds of students on abstract ideals of life like universality of time, transient nature of possessions, manmade borders and other inspirational thoughts which they carry with them throughout their lives. It was during this time when Ms. Manveen came to know that there was a little known monument in ruins right on the Indo Pak border dedicated to Moran, known as Pul Kanjri. It was like a discovery. she was thrilled with it. The remains of the monument in the shape of a pond and a temple had been in private possession. The land was subsequently bought by the tourism department, Govt. of Punjab. With a grant from Ministry of Tourism Govt. of India the conservation work was handed over to the Archeological Survey of India. but before she could see the realization of her dream projects, tragedy struck claiming her life along with her illustrious husband Dr. shivinder singh sandhu in a car accident on their way back from their favorite heritage site- village Hamira in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan. For almost two years we were not aware what was happening at Pul Kanjri. However just as time was healing the wounds of their sudden departure, painstaking and detailed conservation work was going on in slow pace by expert workers appointed by contractors hired by A sI. The monument was now ready in its original glory standing aloof away from public eye right next to the border fence among lush green fields. Towards the end of 2010 when the monument was nearing completion, the Punjab Heritage and Tourism Promotion board was looking for an agency to hand over the monument for upkeep. At that time the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar knowing spring Dale educational society's interest and commitment for cultural and social causes offered the school to take up responsibility of maintenance promotion of the site. It was like a dream come true for us. soon I had a meeting with Principal secretary Tourism, Govt. of Punjab and we agreed in principle on the terms and conditions. It was followed by an MoU which was signed in January 2011 and the site of Pul Kanjri was handed over to us exactly two years after the demise of Ms. Manveen and Dr. s hivinder. Historical Past... The site acquires its name from its association with an interesting episode in the story the Maharaja and his love for Moran. This place was used as night halt for the Maharaja and his entourage during their travel from Lahore to Amritsar and vice versa. situated on the bank of a canal channel which supplied water to shalimar Gardens in Lahore this place is mid way between Amritsar and Lahore. The Maharaja stayed in a baradari close to the sarovar and the temple on the other side of the channel. The village to which Moran belonged is a few kilometers away. It is said that during his halts Moran would come to meet the Maharaja from her village and she had to cross the channel to reach the baradari. once she is supposed to have lost her silver footwear while crossing it and complained to the Maharaja about it who got a wooden bridge constructed over the water channel. People started calling the place Pul Kanjri which literally means bridge belonging to the nautch girl. A woman, who was denied the honour of being recognized as Maharaja's wife in spite of being his favourite, was made immortal by a bridge which is no more.112 Innovation in EducationNews from Administration PROMOTIONS S.No.Name of Official & DesignationPromoted to 1. sh.

Kapil sibal who in his address appreciated the role of the teachers in shaping personality of the children and congratulated Cbse for such an award. He quoted the following poem by erma bombeck equating children to kites: You spend years trying to get them off the ground. You run with them until you are both breathless. They crash ... they hit the roof ... you patch, comfort and assure them that someday they will fly. Finally, they are airborne. The need more string, and you keep letting it out. They tug, and with each twist of the twine, there is sadness that goes with joy. The kite becomes more distant, and you know it won't be long before that beautiful creature will snap the lifeline that binds you together and will soar as meant to soar ... free and alone. Only then do you know that you have done your job.

We confer on (him) the following exemptions typical of an agrahara ... (this village is) not to be entered by soldiers and policemen : (it is) exempt from (the obligation to provide) grass, (animal) hides as seats, and charcoal (to touring royal offices); exempt from (the royal prerogative of ) purchasing fermenting liquors and digging (salt); exempt from (the right to) mines and khadira trees; exempt from (the obligation to supply) flowers and milk; (it is donated) together with (the right to) hidden treasures and deposits (and) together with major and minor taxes...\" This charter has been written in the thirteenth (regnal) year.

These were made of stone, metal and terracotta. This is an excerpt from one of the earliest reports on excavations at Mohenjodaro, the best-known Harappan site : s addle querns ... are found in considerable numbers ... and they seem to have been the only means in use for grinding cereals. As a rule, they were roughly made of hard, gritty, igneous rock or sandstone and mostly show signs of hard usage. As their bases are usually convex, they must have been set in the earth or in mud to prevent their rocking. Two main types have been found : those on which another smaller stone was pushed or rolled to and fro, and others with which a second stone was used as a pounder, eventually making a large cavity in the nether stone. Querns of the former type were probably used solely for grain; the second type possibly only for pounding herbs and spices for making curries. In fact, stones of which latter type are dubbed \"curry stones\" by our workmen and our cook asked for the loan of one from the museum for use in the kitchen. (i) What are the two types of querns? 2 (ii) What materials were these querns made of? 2 (iii) explain the two ways of classifying finds of excavations. 2 (iv) How do archeologists determine the function of the artefacts and other finds? 2150 Innovation in Education 18. Read the given passage carefully and answer the questions that follow : On Horse and on foot This is how Ibn battuta described the postal system : In India the postal system is of two kinds : The horse-post called 'Uluq', is run by by royal horses stationed at distance of every four miles. The foot-post has three stations permit. It is called 'dawa', that is, one third of a mile ... now, at every third of a mile there is a well populated village, outside which are three pavilions in which sit men with girded loins ready to start. each of them carries a rod, two cubits in length with copper bells at the top. When the courier starts from the city, he holds the letter in one hand and the rod with its bells on the other; and he runs as fast as he can. When the men in the pavilion hear the ringing of bell they get ready. As soon as the courier reaches them one of them takes the letter from his hand and runs at the top speed shaking the rod all the 11 while until he reaches the next dawa. And the same process continues till the letter reaches its destination. This foot-person is quicker than the horse-post; and often it is used to transport the fruits of Khurasan which are much desired in India. (i) n ame the two kinds of postal systems described above. 2 (ii) explain how the foot post worked. 2 (iii) Why does Ibn-battuta think that the postal system in India was efficient? 2 (iv) How did the state encourage merchants in the 14th century? 2 OR The pilgrimage of the Mughal princess Jahanara, 1643 The following is an excerpt from Jahanara's biography of shaikh Muinuddin Chishti, titled Munis al Arwah (The Confidant of s pirits) : After praising the one God ... this lowly faqira (humble soul) Jahanara ... went from the capital Agra in the company of my great father (emperor shah Jahan) towards the pure region of incomparable Ajmer ... I was committed to this idea, that every day in every station I would perform two cycles of optional prayer. For several days ... I did not sleep on a leopard skin at night, I did not extend my feet in the direction of the blessed sanctuary of the revered saving master, and I did not turn my back towards him. I passed the days beneath the trees. on Thursday, the fourth of the blessed month of Ramzan, I attained the happiness of pilgrimage to the illuminated and the perfumed tomb ... With an hour of daylight remaining, I went to the holy sanctuary and rubbed my pale face with the dust of that threshold. From the doorway to the blessed tomb I went barefoot, kissing the ground. Having entered the dome, I went around the lightfilled tomb of my master seven times ... Finally with my own hand I put the finest quality of itar on the perfumed tomb of the revered one, and having taken off the rose scarf that I had on my head, I placed it on the top of the blessed tomb ...July-September 2011 151 (i) How does Jahanara show her devotion to the shaikh? Answer by giving examples. 2 (ii) Why did the dargah attract a lot of devotees? 2 (iii) How do we know that Akbar also had a great regard for the saint? 2 (iv) What other activities were part of the Ziyarat or 'Pilgrimage'. 2 19.

(and) had lunch together. I had to travel from Karachi to London ... at 2.30 a.m. ... At 5.00 p.m. ... I told my friends that they had given me so generously of their time, I thought it would be too much for them to wait the whole night and suggested they must spare themselves the trouble. but nobody left until it was dinner time ... Then they said they were leaving and that I must have a little rest before emplaning ... I got up at about 1.45 a.m. and, when I opened the door, I saw that all of them were still there ... They all accompanied me to the plane, and, before parting, presented me with a small basket of grapes.

Give two points. 1+2 = 3 OR \"There cannot be any divided loyalty\" Govind ballabh Pant argued that in order to become loyal citizen people had to stop focusing only on the community and the self : For the success of democracy one must train himself in the art of selfdiscipline. In democracies one should care less for himself and more for others. There cannot be any divided loyalty. All loyalties must exclusively be centred round the state. If in a democracy, you create rival loyalties, or you create a system in which any individual or group, instead of suppressing his extravagance, cares nought for larger or other interests, then democracy is doomed.

As per the scheme, four Formative Assessments and two summative Assessments would be held in an academic year. The first Summative Assessment (SA-I) for this term for Classes IX and X is scheduled to be conducted in the second half of September, 2011. 3 Under the school based summative Assessment-I, the students will be tested internally based on the following criteria: a) s yllabus and design of the examination Question Paper in different subjects for Classes IX and X summative Assessment(s) will be the same as circulated by the board earlier. The same is also available on Cbse website www.cbse.nic.in under examination Link. b) As was done earlier, the summative Assessment-I will be in the form of a pen-paper test conducted by the schools themselves. c) In order to ensure standards, the Question Paper bank in different subjects would be sent by the board so as to reach schools well in time. d) evaluation of answer scripts will be done by the schoolteachers themselves on the basis of the Marking scheme provided by the board. The school may use the sahodaya school Cluster for spot evaluation so that teachers from other schools are also involved, if they so wish. e) There will be random verification of the assessment procedures of schools by the board officials/ nominees appointed by the board. 4 It has been decided to provide Question Paper bank for english Communicative, English Language & Literature, Hindi-A, Hindi-B, Mathematics, Science, Social Science and Communicative Sanskrit. In respect of other subjects/languages, the schools will administer their own question papers based on sample Question Paper pattern available on the board's website.

OR ii) mix and match the paper by using different questions/sections from different sets of question papers and prepare a question paper based on board's sample paper, design and blue print. OR iii) prepare their own question papers as per sample paper, design and blueprint available on C bse's website (www.cbse.nic.in). However, incase the school prepares its own question papers, the question papers and marking scheme so prepared should be emailed to the board (email id: eoscience@live.com) for its verification within a week of conduct of the respective papers. iv) Every School, Sahodaya Cluster (s) or City may design their own date-sheet for Classes IX and X examination accordingly. 6 The schools need to take out the print of the desired question paper (refer para 5 above) and, thereafter, the required number of prints/copies may be made at the school level. These question papers must be kept in the safe custody carefully. 7 The schools will conduct the SA-I for Classes IX and X during the second half of September, 2011. 8 Another CD containing the Marking Scheme of the main subjects would be sent to every school separately in due course and will reach the schools well in time.9 The answer books should be evaluated by teachers as per the marking scheme provided by the Board.10 KINDLY NOTE THAT ANSWER BOOKS OF SCHOOL BASED SA-I FOR CLASSES IX AND X SHOULD NOT BE SENT TO THE BOARD UNDER ANY CIRCUMST ANCES. However these must be preserved and kept in the safe custody at the school for at least a period of three years (in case of Class IX) and two years (in case of Class X) along with question papers and Marking s cheme for any verification by the board subsequently. 11 It may be noted again that the question papers for Classes IX and X have been designed by the board and are being sent to schools with the purpose of maintaining standards. Depending upon the feedback and suggestions from the stakeholders, the board may reconsider this policy in future, if need be. This maybe brought to the notice of all teachers, students and parents of Classes IX and X.

Subject: 18th National Annual Conference of Sahodaya School Complexes 2011 to be held from 27th - 28th December, 2011 at Chennai (26th -Pre Conference Dinner) Dear All, The Central board of secondary school launched a networking concept among its schools called \"sAHoDAYA\" in the year 1986. The concept of sahodaya is imbued with the spirit of 'caring & sharing' and is meant to facilitate closer networking and collaboration among the schools of the Cbse family aimed at excellence in education. The sahodaya school Complex is a group of neighborhood schools who voluntarily come together to share best practices and innovative strategies in various aspects of school education including curriculum design, evaluation and pedagogy and also in providing support to teachers by regular capacity building exercises. some sahodaya clusters also engage with parents and leaders in the community to build partnerships and network for a larger cause. At present there are around 250 active sahodaya school Clusters across the country with the networking of 4500 schools. In order to bring sahodaya members on a common platform the board conducts a national Annual Conference of sahodaya school Complexes every year on an identified theme of current educational relevance. besides facilitating broad interactions among practitioners, it also serves as an effective channel of interaction between schools and the Cbse and thereby helps the board in formulating its policies in a progressive and pragmatic manner.

A NOTE ON PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING Problem-based learning is a form of learning which helps to develop individual and group skills which are relevant to people in senior management positions. Participants are put into groups. The group is presented with a problem and has to come up with a solution, and then present that solution persuasively. This work is carried out over several days, through a series of tasks. As in real life, there are rules controlling how each task is to be done. Also as in real life, some details of the tasks are only given at the time, without prior warning. In order to complete the challenge successfully, the following rules must be observed. All members of the group have equal status All members of the group must make a full contribution, although the group can agree to allocate particular functions to particular members. Decisions are to be reached by agreement. Any disagreements are to be resolved within the group. The solution presented must be supported by the whole group. Provided that these rules are followed, the group is free to choose its working methods. For example, a group might decide to take turns to act as 'chairman'. A group can decide that for part of the time, they will split up and work on individual tasks before coming together again. A group can take any reasonable steps to complete the tasks well, such as having additional meetings outside the working day, or accessing sources of information.July-September 2011 225INTRODUCING OUR TEAM Dr Raphael Wilkins (Course Leader) Raphael Wilkins is Pro Director (International Consultancy and Knowledge Transfer) and Director of International Affairs in the London Centre for Leadership in Learning, Institute of education, University of London, and is also President of the College of Teachers. before joining LCLL in 2006 his career included teaching; education officer roles in four local authorities including over 12 years in Chief officer level posts; national roles with Parliament and the local authority associations; six years of senior level consultancy, research and writing; and attachments to a number of universities.
