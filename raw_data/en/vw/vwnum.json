In two control zones, a classical single bait distribution was organised during the sameperiods as for the second distribution in the respective test zones. No statistical differences wereobserved for adult foxes or fox cubs sampled in the test and control zones neither for baits uptake norfor seroconversion rate. However, seroconversion rates observed in fox cubs population were sig-nificantly higher ( P< 0.01) in areas vaccinated at the end of May (43 and 56 %) compared with those vaccinated at mid-May (24 and 20%). The vaccinal efficacy of baits was also significantly( P<0.05) increased for the fox cubs in the areas vaccinated at the end of May (46 and 57%) compared with those vaccinated at mid-May (24 and 25%). This increase in immunological response by fox cubswhen vaccinating in late spring must be related to their development. In the early spring, fox cubs aregenerally too young to have access to baits or to be vaccinated when eating them. For most of thesefox cubs, a second distribution will not constitute a booster. Therefore, in order to increase the effi-cient access of fox cubs to vaccine baits, Spring distribution of baits should preferably be organisedduring May or June rather than in April. rabies / oral vaccination / fox cub / delayed double bait distribution Resum\u00e9 - Vaccination orale des renards avec une ou deux successives d'app\u00e2ts au des renards la rage en France au une distribution fin 31 (2000) 339-345 EDP Sciences * Correspondence and reprints Tel.: (33) 3 83 29 89 50; fax: (33) 3 83 29 89 59; e-mail : maubert@fitech.frV.

Following otherEuropean countries, the first French oralvaccination campaigns were organised in1986 [1], review in [5]. Since then, two cam-paigns have been organised annually dur-ing the spring and autumn. Following spring campaigns, 70% of adult foxes but only 20 to 30% of fox cubsconsumed vaccine baits as revealed by tetra-cycline marks in their teeth (a biologicalmarker incorporated in the bait envelope)[15]. In parallel, the proportion of individ-uals with rabies antibodies among thosemarked with tetracycline is lower in foxcubs than in adults [23]. In fact, during thespring, two thirds of the fox population arecubs, therefore the key of a successful oralvaccination program is to give the fox cubsaccess to baits and to immunise them [8,15]. Several methods have been tested for increasing vaccination coverage of fox cubs: - to distribute baits at the entrance of fox dens during June [8, 23, 24], - to distribute baits during the summer when cubs are starting to disperse [18] andas tested by Masson and Aubert in 1994[16] to distribute baits twice during thespring at a two-week interval. By doing so, they hypothesised that fox cubs would havemore of a chance to undertake several baitmeals consisting of primovaccination andboosters. However, due to the effort requiredby the size of the area to vaccinate [3], thevalidity of this assumption was not assesseduntil the study described here which wasundertaken in 1997. The objective was tocompare the bait uptake and seroconversionrates in foxes sampled in areas vaccinatedonce or two times during the spring. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study areas (Fig. 1) The study was carried out on the major part of the 23333 km2vaccinated in France during spring 1997. Tested areas covered7496 km 2(A1: 2 340 km2; A2: 5 12 B2: 2 947 km2). by natural or artificial barriers: rivers,channels and high traffic roads. Two vac-cination campaigns had been carried outsimilarly on these test and control areas pre-viously during the spring and autumn of1996. During the spring of 1997, test areaswere vaccinated two times: A1 on the end ofApril and mid-May; A2 on the end of Apriland end of May. Control areas were vacci-quatre semaines plus tard, fin mai.

B1 dur-ing mid May (corresponding to A1), and B2at the end of May (corresponding to A2). 2.2 Vaccines Double and unique spring vaccinations in the test and control areas used the SAG2(Rabigen \u00aeVirbac) vaccine bait, a highly attenuated double mutant of the alreadyattenuated SAD Bern rabies strain [20]. Theefficacy and innocuity of this vaccine wasdemonstrated in our experimental farm andin the fields [4, 17]. As usual, during thecampaigns, all vaccine batches were care-fully followed and 160 vaccine baits weresampled \"from the helicopters\" before, dur-ing and after were all indi- vidually titrated. The lower titre was 10 8.4 TCID50 per bait which is in compliance with French specifications for vaccination cam-paigns. 2.3. Methods for bait distribution Baits were distributed from helicopters as previously described [18]. This proce-dure revealed to be more cost-effective andreliable than the use of pedestrian teams [5,18, 23]. The flights were recorded using aGPS (Global Positioning System) for assess-ing the uniformity of bait distribution. Baitdensity per square km was 15 and 18 duringApril and May respectively. Figure 1. Location of the areas that were vaccinated in the spring 1997 with SAG2 baits. Test areas: A1: two distributions of rabies vaccine baits (end of April and mid-May); A2: two distributions of rabies vaccine baits (end of April and end of May). Control areas: B1: a single distribution of rabies vaccine baits in mid-May; B2: a single distribution of rabies vaccine baits in end of May.V. Bruy\u00e8re et al. 342 2.4. Follow up of vaccination efficacy From 10 June until 15 September 1997, foxes were shot down during the nightaccording to Roboly [19] in the test and con-trol areas. All were blood sampled justimmediately after death. Only the 200 bloodsamples and fox heads that reached the lab-oratory within less than 48 hours in goodcondition were used for this study. Amongthese samples 58, 29, 68 and 45 were fromareas A1, B1, A2 and B2 respectively. Tetracycline, a biological marker (150 mg per bait), was searched for in thelower jaw and inferior canine of foxes anddetected by ultraviolet light examination ofa section of the canine by inversemicroscopy (model IMT 2-RFL, Olympus).Longitudinal sections of canines and lowerjaws (thickness 500-700 mm) were prepared with a diamond circular saw (modelBuehler-isomet nd). Tetracycline deposits appeared as pale yellow on a blue back-ground [12]. According to Kappeler [13]and Masson [15] bait uptake must be stud-ied in fox cubs (that is in foxes less than 12months of age) and adult foxes separately;therefore, we differentiated both age cate-gories on the basis of histological dentalexamination as described by Johnston andWatt [11]. Sera were titrated for rabies antibodies by an ELISA technique developed by Atana-siu and Perrin [2]. The ELISA test used sen-sitised plates of 96 wells in polystyrene pur-chased from Diagnostics Pasteur, France.The wells of the rabies glycoprotein sensi-tised plates were rinsed eight times with awashing buffer (consisting of NaCl, 0.9%;Tween 20, 0.1%) and shaken until dry. A100 \u00b5l quantity of the prediluted (1:100)sera to be examined, was added. Each serumwas tested at a single dilution in duplicate.After a 1-hour incubation at 37 \u00b0C, serumsamples were removed and the plateswashed 8 times. A 100 \u00b5l sample Horse radish (Biosys,Compi\u00e8gne, France) was added to each wellof the plates, and left for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. After 8 additional washing steps, 100 \u00b5l ofperoxidase substrate (consisting of a mix-ture of 1 tablet of orthophenylenediamineper plate in citrate buffer 0.025 M, 0.025%hydrogen peroxide) was added. The mix-ture was incubated in the dark for 30 minat room temperature. Absorbance adding 50 \u00b5l ofH 2SO44N to each well. The positive reference serum was pre- pared by pooling fields fox positive sera.Eight serial dilutions (the first one being1:1400) of this positive control wereincluded in parallel in each test. The nega-tive control consisted of pooled sera fromunvaccinated foxes tested as negatives bya neutralisation test on cells, then re-testedby ELISA. The negative control was testedin duplicate at the single 1:100 dilution. Foreach tested serum, a specific optical den-sity (OD) was calculated by subtracting thenegative control average OD from the sam-ple average OD obtained for that test. Seratitres were expressed as equivalent units permL (E.U. .mL -1) corresponding to interna- tional units [2] by using the values obtainedby the reference serum. 2.5. Statistical interpretation For each area, three parameters were evaluated separately for adult foxes and foxcubs: the bait uptake rate (that is the per-centage of foxes marked with tetracycline,each tetracycline deposit representing oneor several baits consumed within a shortperiod of time), the seroconversion rate, andthe vaccinal bait efficacy defined as the pro-portion of foxes with rabies antibodiesamong those marked with tetracycline. The variation of these parameters accord- ing to the date and the number of vaccina-tions was compared using the Fisher test[25].Oral rabies vaccination of foxes during the spring 343 3. RESULTS (Tab. I) 3.1. Adult foxes When comparing bait uptake, serocon- version rate and vaccinal bait efficacybetween test and control areas (A1 vs. B1,and A2 vs. B2), no significant differenceswere observed. But when comparing areasvaccinated in mid-May (A1 and B1) vs.areas vaccinated during late May (A2 andB2), the uptake rate was significantly higherin the second case ( P= 0.04). However, antibody rate and vaccinal bait efficacy werenot statistically different (at the P = 0.05 level) according to the date of vaccination inMay. 3.2. Fox cubs For fox cubs, when comparing test and control areas (A1 vs. B1, and A2 vs. B2),bait uptake antibody rate, and vaccinal baitefficacy were not statistically different.However, when comparing areas vaccinatedduring late May (A2 and B2) instead of Mid-May (A1 and B1), the seroconversion ratewas significantly higher ( P= vaccinal efficacy of baits when vaccinat-ing in late May ( P= 0.03). 4. DISCUSSION The bait uptake rate, seroconversion rate and vaccinal bait efficacy in adult and foxcubs are pertinent parameters for compar-ing the efficacy of vaccination campaigns.However because rabies has almost beeneliminated in France since 1996, the possi-ble range of variation in rabies incidence istoo minute to be considered as a parameterallowing comparison between vaccinationprotocols. When comparing test and control areas, no significant benefit for the immunisationof adult foxes has been obtained with anadditional vaccination campaign. As a mat-ter of fact, all parameters are already so highafter a single spring vaccination that pro-ducing any significant increase with an addi-tional treatment appears difficult. Anotherreason for this lack of apparent difference, isthat vaccination campaigns conducted Table I.Tetracycline marking, seroconversion rate, and bait efficacy in adult foxes and fox cubs in test and control zones.

Because fox cubs were not born during previous vaccination campaigns, they onlyresponded to the last spring vaccination. Inwestern Europe, fox birth takes place from15 March to 15 April [14,21] and weaningfour to six weeks later, that is from mid-April to late May. The possible transmis-sion of tetracycline by the mother (duringpregnancy or milk feeding), and any inter-ference between antibody self-productionand antibodies of maternal origin must beconsidered similar in test and control areasbecause these areas were equally vaccinatedduring the previous years. Interferencebetween antibodies of maternal origin andactive immunity after vaccination has beendescribed in several carnivore species [6]and suggested in the fox by Brochier et al.[9] and Vuillaume et al. [24]. The results obtained in fox cubs follow- ing one or two distributions of baits duringspring did not demonstrate any benefit ofdistributing baits two times at a few weekinterval. The proportion of fox cubs that hadaccess to baits distributed during April waslow, as revealed by the lack of any differ-ence when distributing baits once duringMay or twice during April, then May. Theactive transport of entire baits by adult foxesto the den as proven by Vuillaume et al. [23,24] and suggested by this study was not suf-ficient for compensating the limited accessof cubs to the baits distributed by heli-copters. Vaccinating later during the spring did not entail a significantly greater bait uptakein fox cub population but a significantincrease in seroconversion rate. Therefore,we conclude that the benefit of vaccinatinglater founds its origin not from an increasein bait uptake, but in a higher ability for foxcubs to use the baits more efficiently that isthey do not consume the bait envelope with-out chewing the vaccine capsule. Addition-ally, when getting older, fox cubs develop abetter ability to respond to vaccination (that is to produce rabies antibodies). Brochier et al. [10] already hypothesised that when very young, cubs can chew thebaits without puncturing the vaccine cap-sule. In this situation, fox cubs will bemarked by tetracycline without being vac-cinated. Several other explanations for dis-crepancy between high bait uptake by foxcubs and a poor vaccination coverage are:(a)vixens feed their weaning cubs by regur-gitation [14]; regurgitated baits still containtetracycline but the rabies antigen isdestroyed by gastric acidity; (b) tetracyclinecan be transmitted by vaccinated mothersthrough the milk as demonstrated byBugnon et al. (personal communication). The relative inability of fox cubs to respond to vaccination has already beenevoked by Vuillaume et al. [24] when vac-cinating fox cubs by depositing baits at theentrances of fox dens. Difficulties in vacci-nating young foxes have already been men-tioned during early trials in our experimen-tal farm with the attenuated rabies SADstrain [7]. However, with the VRG vaccine,young foxes (6 to 12 weeks old) born fromnon-vaccinated vixens could be efficientlyimmunised [9]. Considering that the key factor for the success of the vaccination campaign is toimmunise fox cubs [8, 15] the most effi-cient and beneficial way of vaccinating dur-ing the spring consists in a single distributionof baits during late May.
