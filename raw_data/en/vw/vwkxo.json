[Education and Training Offered by CFSPH and IICAB](https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/courses/) The CFSPH website had 2.8 million hits in 2020, 60% from outside the U.S. [Transboundary and Emerging Diseases of Animals for Veterinary Students](https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/courses/) The Transboundary and Emerging Diseases of Animals (TEDA) web-based course is currently used at all United States veterinary colleges. The course fulfills the Initial Accreditation Training requirement of the USDA National Veterinary Accreditation Program. The course has been used since 2002 to raise awareness of foreign, emerging, and exotic animal diseases and to prepare veterinarians to recognize and appropriately respond to unusual animal diseases. Veterinary students access the course through a portal on the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges website [www.aavmc.org](http://www.aavmc.org). The CFSPH developed the course content with other academic institutions and manages and continuously updates the course. The USDA APHIS provides support for veterinary colleges to offer the course and distribute a companion textbook. The course is available for continuing education and has been translated into Spanish as well. Email [eeda@iastate.edu](mailto:eeda@iastate.edu) for more information. [Emerging and Exotic Diseases of Animals for Continuing Education](https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/product/eeda-course/) The EEDA web-based course, used at all U.S. veterinary colleges is also available for continuing education credit for graduate veterinarians (up to 18 RACE approved, non-interactive, continuing education hours). [Enfermedades Transfronterizas de los Animales](https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/es/course/enfermedades-transfronterizas-de-los-animales/) Spanish language version of the EEDA course above.

[National Veterinary Accreditation Program (NVAP)](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/nvap/ct_aast) The CFSPH, working with USDA-APHIS has developed APHIS-approved supplemental training materials for the National Veterinary Accreditation Program (NVAP). Veterinarians seeking to renew their USDA accreditation can choose from three different supplemental training formats. There are approximately 60,000 accredited veterinarians in the U.S who are required to have APHIS-approved supplemental training. [Zoonoses: Protecting People and Their Pets](https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/product/zoonoses-course/) Available for veterinary and human healthcare professionals and students to refresh and gain knowledge of key zoonotic diseases. The course includes lessons, case studies, a discussion board, and online resources to assist in conveying zoonotic disease prevention measures to clients. [Zoonoses: Protecting People and Animals in Rural Communities](https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/product/zoonoses-course-rural/) This course is a self-paced, web-based course for animal health, human health, or public health professionals or students, or individuals interested in the prevention of zoonotic diseases. This course overviews the occurrence and impact of zoonotic diseases of agricultural animals, with an emphasis on prevention measures to reduce health risks for people and animals. [IICAB Veterinary Biologics Training Program](https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/IICAB/) The Veterinary Biologics Training Program has been offered every year since 1996. Almost 2100 individuals, including more than 600 attendees from 89 countries, have attended the program. The course gives participants an overview of the scientific principles of vaccines and vaccination and of the USDA regulatory process for assuring the purity, safety, potency and efficacy of veterinary biologics. [Veterinary Immunology & Principles of Vaccination](http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Immunology/full-course.php) This is a web based course presented by Dr. Jim Roth. This course (containing over 17 hours of lectures) is the same as that delivered at Block 1 of the IICAB Veterinary Biologics Training Program. [Introduction to Veterinary Immunology & Principles of Vaccination](http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Immunology/short-course.php) This web based course provides a high-level overview of the above-listed longer course. Dr. Jim Roth in 4.5 hours of lectures introduces how the immune system works, how vaccines prevent disease and why vaccines sometimes fail to protect from disease and occasionally cause adverse reactions.
