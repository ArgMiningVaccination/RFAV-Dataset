Knowing how to choose the best supplement can help you achieve the best therapeutic value and save money. Understanding concepts such as the grade, form, purity, bioavailability and third party verification of supplements helps you choose the best product within your budget. Nutritional supplements are typically available in four different categories: pharmaceutical grade, medical grade, cosmetic or nutritional grade, and feed or agricultural grade. Pharmaceutical grade is the highest quality grade of vitamins. This means the purity, dissolution and absorption will meet the highest regulatory standard and will be verified by an outside party. Pharmaceutical grade vitamins may be available without a prescription, but they are typically only sold by licensed healthcare practitioners. The manufacturers of pharmaceutical grade supplements know their high quality products can have a profound effect on an individual's health. Therefore, they want a licensed healthcare practitioner monitoring their use. Medical grade vitamins are also a high-grade vitamin, although they may not meet all of the standards of pharmaceutical grade vitamins. Prenatal vitamins typically fall into this category. Cosmetic or nutritional grade supplements are typically sold in health food stores. These supplements might not always be tested for absorption, dissolution or purity. Additionally, these supplements do not always have the same concentrations of active ingredients as what is listed on the label. Feed or agricultural grade supplements are produced for veterinary use, and patients should not use this grade of supplement. "}
