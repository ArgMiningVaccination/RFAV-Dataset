Kaposi sarcoma is a disease in which malignant lesions (cancer) can form in the skin, mucous membranes, lymph nodes, and other organs. [Kaposi [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that causes [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) grow in the skin; lining the mouth, nose, and [throat](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439429&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); or other [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The lesions are usually purple and are made of cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), new [blood Kaposi sarcoma is different from other cancers in that lesions may begin in more than one place in the body at the same time. [Human herpesvirus-8](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HHV-8) is found in the lesions of all patients with Kaposi sarcoma. This [virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45941&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is also called Kaposi sarcoma people HHV-8 do not get Kaposi sarcoma. People with HHV-8 are more likely to develop Kaposi sarcoma if their [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is weakened by disease, such as [human immunodeficiency virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44366&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HIV), or by [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) given after an organ [transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46631&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). There are several types of Kaposi sarcoma. The two types discussed in this summary include: Tests that examine the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract are used to diagnose Kaposi sarcoma. In addition to asking about your [personal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [family health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642015&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and doing a [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures: [Chest x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): An [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma in the [lungs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)by a [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to check for signs of cancer. One of the following types of biopsies may be done to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the skin: [Excisional biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46411&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A [scalpel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257527&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is used to remove the entire skin growth. [Incisional biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46698&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A scalpel is used to remove part of a skin growth. [Core biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45657&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A wide needle is used to remove part of a skin growth. [Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45691&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A thin needle is used to remove part of a skin growth. An [endoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or [bronchoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45628&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)may be done to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the [gastrointestinal tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46189&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or lungs. - Endoscopy for biopsy: A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. An [endoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46428&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is inserted through an [incision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(cut) in the skin or opening in the body, such as the mouth. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. - Bronchoscopy for biopsy: A procedure to look inside the [trachea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46623&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. A [bronchoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46496&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the lungs. After Kaposi sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. The following tests and procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body: [Blood chemistry studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A procedure in which a [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. [CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lung, [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [spleen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46593&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized scan): A procedure to find [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)lesions in the body. A small amount of [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET [scanner](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant lesions show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. This [imaging test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689578&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)checks for signs of cancer in the lung, liver, and spleen. [CD34](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45638&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [lymphocyte](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45765&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)count: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of CD34 cells (a type of white blood cell). A lower than normal amount of CD34 cells can be a sign the immune system is not working well. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment options depend on the following: Classic Kaposi Sarcoma Key Points - Classic Kaposi sarcoma is found most often in older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish origin. - Signs of classic Kaposi sarcoma may include slow-growing lesions on the legs and feet. - Another cancer may develop. Classic Kaposi sarcoma is found most often in older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish origin. Classic [Kaposi sarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a rare disease that gets worse slowly over many years. Signs of classic Kaposi sarcoma may include slow-growing lesions on the legs and feet. Patients may have one or more red, purple, or brown skin [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) on the legs and feet, most often on the ankles or soles of the feet. Over time, lesions may form in other parts of the body, such as the [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [intestines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46335&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The lesions usually don't cause any [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) but may grow in size and number over a period of 10 years or more. Pressure from the lesions may block the flow of [lymph](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46305&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the legs and cause painful swelling. Lesions in the [digestive tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46447&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may cause [gastrointestinal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45692&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) bleeding. Another cancer may develop. Some patients with classic Kaposi sarcoma may develop another type of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) before the Kaposi sarcoma lesions appear or later in life. Most often, this [second cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46658&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is [non-Hodgkin lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45148&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Frequent [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is needed to these second cancers. Epidemic Kaposi Sarcoma (HIV-Associated Kaposi Sarcoma) Key Points - Patients with HIV are at risk of developing epidemic Kaposi sarcoma (HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma). - The use of drug therapy called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces the risk of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma in patients with HIV. - Signs of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma can include lesions that form in many parts of the body. Patients with HIV are at risk of developing epidemic Kaposi sarcoma (HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma). [AIDS](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44365&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is and weakens the body's [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A weakened immune system is unable to fight [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and disease. People with HIV have an increased risk of infection and [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A person with HIV and certain types of infection or cancer, such as [Kaposi sarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), is [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) as having AIDS. Sometimes, a person is diagnosed with AIDS and epidemic Kaposi sarcoma at the same time. The use of drug therapy called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces the risk of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma in patients with HIV. [HAART](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306504&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a combination of several [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) used to lessen the damage to the immune system caused by HIV infection. Treatment with HAART reduces the risk of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma, although it is possible for a person to develop epidemic Kaposi sarcoma while taking HAART. For information about AIDS and its treatment, see the [HIVinfo website](https://hivinfo.nih.gov/home-page). Signs of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma can include lesions that form in many parts of the body. The [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma can include [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in different parts of the body, including any of the following: - Skin. - Lining of the mouth. [Lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Kaposi sarcoma is sometimes found in the lining of the mouth during a regular dental check-up. In most patients with epidemic Kaposi sarcoma, the disease will spread to other parts of the body over time. Treatment Option Overview Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with Kaposi sarcoma. - The following types of treatment are used to treat Kaposi sarcoma: - HAART - Radiation therapy - Surgery - Cryosurgery - Chemotherapy - Immunotherapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Targeted therapy - Treatment for Kaposi sarcoma may cause side effects. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with Kaposi sarcoma. Different types of treatments are available for patients with [Kaposi sarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. The following types of treatment are used to treat Kaposi sarcoma: Treatment of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma combines sarcoma with treatment for [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44365&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (AIDS). The treatment used sarcoma include: HAART [Highly active antiretroviral therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306504&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HAART) is a combination of several [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) used to lessen the damage to the [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by [human immunodeficiency virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44366&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HIV) infection. For many patients, HAART alone may be enough to treat epidemic Kaposi sarcoma. For other patients, HAART may be combined with other standard treatments to treat epidemic Kaposi sarcoma. For information about AIDS and its treatment, see the [HIVinfo website](https://hivinfo.nih.gov/home-page). Radiation therapy [Radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. [Internal radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46345&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)uses a [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)substance sealed in needles, [seeds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257219&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), wires, or [catheters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45637&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated. Certain types of external radiation therapy are used to treat Kaposi sarcoma [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Photon radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) treats lesions with high-energy light. [Electron beam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44667&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) radiation therapy uses tiny negatively charged particles called [electrons](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=702062&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Surgery The following [surgical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) procedures may be used for Kaposi sarcoma to treat small, surface lesions: - Local [excision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269459&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The cancer is cut from the skin along with a small amount of normal [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)around it. [Electrodesiccation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46434&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and [curettage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46459&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is cut from the skin with a [curette](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46460&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(a sharp, spoon-shaped tool). A needle-shaped [electrode](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454755&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is then used to treat the area with an electric current that stops the bleeding and destroys cancer cells that remain around the edge of the [wound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441269&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The process may be repeated one to three times during the surgery to remove all of the cancer. Cryosurgery [Cryosurgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45407&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tissue. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy. Chemotherapy [Chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( [systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the [cerebrospinal fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), an [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), tissue, or a body [cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( [regional chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). In electrochemotherapy, [intravenous chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=776353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is given and a probe is used to send electric pulses to the tumor. The pulses make an opening in the [membrane](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46294&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) around the tumor cell and allow the chemotherapy to get inside. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the Kaposi sarcoma lesions occur in the body. In Kaposi sarcoma, chemotherapy may be given in the following ways: - For [local](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46309&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)Kaposi sarcoma lesions, such as in the mouth, anticancer drugs may be injected directly into the lesion ( [intralesional](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)chemotherapy). - For local lesions on the skin, a [topical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45927&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)agent may be applied to the skin as a gel. Electrochemotherapy may also be used. - For widespread lesions on the skin, intravenous chemotherapy may be given. [Liposomal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45753&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) chemotherapy uses liposomes (very tiny fat particles) to carry anticancer drugs. [Liposomal doxorubicin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663502&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is used to treat Kaposi sarcoma. The liposomes build up in Kaposi sarcoma tissue more than in healthy tissue, and the doxorubicin is released slowly. This increases the effect of the doxorubicin and causes less damage to healthy tissue. See [Drugs Approved for Kaposi Sarcoma](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/kaposi-sarcoma) for more information. Immunotherapy [Immunotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45729&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. Immunotherapy with [interferon alfa](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [interleukin-12](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45426&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used Kaposi sarcoma. See [Drugs Approved for Kaposi Sarcoma](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/kaposi-sarcoma) for more information. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). Targeted therapy [Targeted therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. [Monoclonal antibody](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46066&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [tyrosine kinase inhibitors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44833&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (TKIs) are types of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma. Monoclonal antibodies are immune system [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by [infusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). They may be used alone or to carry drugs, [toxins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. [Bevacizumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46115&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is a monoclonal antibody that may be used to treat Kaposi sarcoma. TKIs block signals needed for tumors to grow. [Imatinib mesylate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44893&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is a TKI that may be used to treat Kaposi sarcoma. Treatment for Kaposi sarcoma may cause side effects. For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, see our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects) page. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from [recurring](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI's [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search) webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) website. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer or to find out the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has changed or if the cancer has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back). These tests are sometimes called [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tests or check-ups. Treatment of Classic Kaposi Sarcoma For information about the treatments listed below, see the [Treatment Option Overview](/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/patient/kaposi-treatment-pdq#_59) section. Treatment for single skin [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may include the following: Treatment for skin lesions all over the body may include the following: - Radiation therapy. [Chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Electrochemotherapy. Treatment for that affects [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or the [gastrointestinal tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46189&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) usually includes chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy.

To Learn More About Kaposi Sarcoma For more information from the [National Cancer Institute](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44266&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) about Kaposi sarcoma, see the following: For general [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) information and other resources from the National Cancer Institute, see the following: About This PDQ Summary About PDQ Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq). PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment). Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center) (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
