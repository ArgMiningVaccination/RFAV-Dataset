Point of care resources to identify that supplement your patient is taking but you've never heard of can be really useful. We recently reviewed one useful resource, the [Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database](http://www.imedicalapps.com/2016/05/natural-medicines-comprehensive-database/) app. Here, we'll look at the About Herbs app. I am going to try not to gush over this medical app. Developed by the Integrative Medicine folks at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), the About Herbs app includes information on herbs, supplements, and alternative medicine techniques like acupuncture and acupressure. Pictures are included with each entry that makes the About Herbs app visually delightful. Frankly, they had me at the opening screen. The About Herbs app's greatest strength is in the searchable database of herbal products and integrative therapies. Users can search for a particular item or use the browse feature to peruse a list of topics. The consumer version includes the scientific, common, and brand names for the herbals or supplements, along with information on how the product is thought to work, uses, warnings, side effects, and a \"Special Point\" that often includes a recommendation on whether patients should use or avoid the herb. Users can share the information via email. In contrast, the professional versions of the monographs include scientific, common, and brand names, a clinical summary, mechanism of action, warnings, adverse reactions, herb-drug interactions, and a list of references. Price: Free Likes: - Evidence-based info on alternative medicine. References for the information contained in the app are included. - Excellent interface and visuals make the information readily accessible and the app usable at the point of care Dislikes: - Only available for iOS devices - Bookmarks navigation could be improved - Would benefit from search by use or disease Overall: About Herbs is an excellent tool for a clinician to use to answer those patient questions about efficacy and use of alternative medicine options. The interface is visually appealing and easy to navigate. Also great for patients to use at home and clinicians to share information with patients at the bedside or via email.
