This is not an exhaustive list of what we are capable of handling. Conditions Treated: - Lower Back Pain - Car Accident Injuries - Headaches [Knee Pain](//www.stpaulnaturalhealth.com/knee-pain/) - Disorder](//www.stpaulnaturalhealth.com/chiropractic-therapy-for-attention-addadhd-treatment/) Chiropractic Care The goal of chiropractic care and adjustments is to correct the spinal subluxations, sometimes referred to as misaligned vertebras that are detected during the examination. A doctor of chiropractic performs an adjustment by applying gentle pressure to the vertebrae and unlocking it from it's improper position. The bone will then be free to align itself correctly. Weight-Loss & Weight Management Our clinic has a passion for helping our patients achieve optimal health. Weight management is a huge part of an individual's overall health and wellness. There are so many reasons and factors that affect why someone may not be able to lose or maintain a healthy weight. However, if it is your goal to lose weight and keep it off, then we can help! We meet so many clients that have tried just about every weight loss program. Losing weight is not a \"one size fits all\" process. At St. Paul Chiropractic & Natural Medicine Center we realize that every patient is different, and we work hard to make sure you achieve the results you're looking for. We work one-on-one with you to modify the program to best suit you and your body's needs. Massage Therapy Massage therapy works with an individual's soft tissue including muscle and connective tissue to improve circulation, range of motion, tissue healing, and function while reducing muscle tightness, spasms, pain and promoting well being. Massage involves manipulating the body with pressure, motion and vibration from the therapist hands, elbows or a use of a massage modality. Massage works very well when combined with chiropractic care.
