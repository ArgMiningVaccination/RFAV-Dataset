Under current trajectories, this figure is expected to increase to 69 million metric tons by 2040. By 2040, plastic recycling will have overtaken landfilling, but will remain well below incineration.](#statisticContainer) The plastic waste crisis is a growing concern worldwide, especially in coastal regions. In 2016, an estimated 11 million metric tons of [mismanaged plastic waste](/statistics/1123047/mismanaged-plastic-waste-generated-by-coastal-populations-worldwide/)entered oceans. This quantity is expected to triple by 2040 to almost 30 million metric tons. Open burning is another harmful way that plastic waste is commonly disposed of, especially in developing countries. "}
