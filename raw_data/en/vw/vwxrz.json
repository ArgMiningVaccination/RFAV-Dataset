No Results Found The need to provide vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has presented the pharmaceutical industry with unprecedented challenges. Among them are accelerated timelines for development/approval and unanticipated volumes for manufacture/delivery. Ordinarily for a new drug product, there is ample time for selecting the primary package system and establishing component availability. This is not the case for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, so to quickly meet expected demands, risks must be minimized in every aspect. One of these aspects is availability of package system components, in particular vials. Traditionally, glass vials are used for vaccines; however, the unanticipated volume demand creates the risk of shortages. To minimize this risk, an alternative is needed. This is addressed in a new report by West scientists: [Alternative for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine performance features: In short, Daikyo Crystal Zenith vials potentially are an excellent alternative to glass vials. With West data and support, provided by the Integrated Solutions program, an assessment can be made to determine if a package system based on these vials can meet the requirements of any of the various vaccine platforms under consideration.

Let's face it - we humans love our pets. World pet markets are growing at a dramatic rate, with several countries witnessing higher-than-ever pet ownership and spending. Industry insiders attribute this growth to the humanization of pets. This means that more and more cultures now regard companion animals as beloved family members. Hence, there is a push to increase the standard of living for pets - including higher quality veterinary care products. End-of-line rejections or sterility failures can affect drug availability and patient safety. As drugs evolve, demands on packaging systems increase. To meet the increasing quality needs of customers, West has introduced a line of superior quality elastomeric stoppers: Daikyo D Sigma components.<br /> West celebrated 40 years of successful operations in Kovin, Serbia during the month of October 2021. The West Kovin manufacturing facility specializes in the manufacturing of stoppers and plungers for disposable syringes.

The level of particles in parenteral pharmaceutical formulations is a critical quality attribute. This is no surprise; the clinical consequence of their presence can be very severe, including fatality. In the major pharmacopeia, from the US, Europe, and Japan, there is a specified limit for particles in the final parenteral formulation. Moreover, these pharmacopeia specify two methods for measurement - light obscuration (LO) and microscopic "}
