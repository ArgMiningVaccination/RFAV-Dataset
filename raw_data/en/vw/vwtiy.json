You will be asked a few questions to confirm you are eligible for in-home vaccination. Appointments are limited and individuals with the greatest challenges leaving their homes will be prioritized.

When scheduling, please note how many other adults in the home to include. View our In-home COVID-19 vaccination and boosters FAQ flyer in our [Community Materials flyers section](https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/depts/health/covid-19/vaccine/resources.aspx#flyer).

Drive-through or in-car vaccination is available at the Snoqualmie Valley Hospital (Monday through Friday). More details are below. You will need to bring: - Identification with date of birth: state, tribe, or federal-issued ID. A billing or bank statement with your name and address can also be used. - Wear short sleeves or loose-fitting sleeves that are easy to roll up so that you can get vaccinated in your upper arm. - Authorized adult consent: If you are younger than 18 years old, you may need consent from an authorized adult to get the vaccine. You can consent for yourself if you are emancipated, married to an adult, or the vaccine site determines you are a [mature minor](https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/depts/health/locations/mature-minor-rule.aspx). Not all vaccine sites are able to make mature minor determinations. More information for children and teens, including authorized adult definitions, is included below. If an authorized adult will not attend the vaccine appointment with you, check with your vaccine provider about requirements for showing proof of authorized adult consent or legal emancipation. - Your CDC vaccination card if you are getting a second dose or booster dose. The record of your new dose will be added to the card. How to get there: If you live in King County and need transportation to your vaccine appointment, there are multiple options: - Bus Services: King County Metro offers many transportation options to vaccination appointments, including bus transit, Access paratransit, and Community Van shuttles.

You should get your 2nd dose 21 days (Pfizer and Novavax) or 28 days (Moderna) after the 1st dose. Two doses will complete your primary vaccination series so that your immune system can best protect you. Please Note: People who are immune compromised have [different COVID-19 primary vaccine recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html). Schedule a booster dose Boosters are an additional shot of vaccine to increase the strength and duration of protection. It's especially important for adults over 50 and people with medical conditions to get a booster. Everyone should get a booster dose to keep your immunity up when protection from the primary vaccination series starts to fade over time.
