Many traditions use nuts or fruit as the focus for a meditation on the senses of taste, smell and touch. But you can use any food at all so we developed a meditation based on chocolate. Why not do it now by clicking on the link below? All of the meditations on this page are taken from our book 'Mindfulness: Finding Peace in a Frantic World'. The book contains the complete 8 week mindfulness course developed at Oxford University. Mindfulness Meditation of the Body and Breath Every meditation tradition begins with daily practices that help to focus a scattered mind. A great way of doing this is to focus on a single object that is always with you: the movement of the breath in the body. This eight-minute meditation is a brilliant introduction to Mindfulness. It will begin the process of putting you back in control of your life. All of the meditations on this page are taken from our book 'Mindfulness: Finding Peace in a Frantic World'. The book contains the complete 8 week mindfulness course developed at Oxford University. Body Scan Meditation The Body Scan meditation helps you to explore the difference between thinking about a sensation and experiencing it directly. Many of us spend so much of our time living 'in our heads' that we almost forget about the world experienced directly through our senses. The Body Scan meditation helps to train your mind so that you can focus your attention directly on your bodily sensations without judging or analysing what you find. This helps you to see, ever more clearly, when the mind has begun to wander away by itself, so that you gradually learn to 'taste' the difference between the 'thinking mind' and the 'sensing mind'. It's not unusual to fall asleep when you do this meditation, particularly if you do it lying down. If you do so, try not to criticise yourself but instead congratulate yourself for catching up on some much needed rest. This meditation is taken from our book 'Mindfulness: Finding Peace in a Frantic World'. The book contains the complete 8 week mindfulness course developed at Oxford University. The Befriending Meditation When life really begins to get you down.... When you feel angry, lost or alone... When you feel close to despair... When you feel that you are your own worst enemy... The Befriending Meditation is here for you. Sounds and Thoughts Meditation Sounds are as compelling as thoughts and just as immaterial and open to interpretation. For this reason, the Sounds and Thoughts Meditation is my personal favourite as it elegantly reveals how the mind conjures up thoughts that can so easily lead us astray. Once you realise this - deep in your heart - then a great many of your troubles will simply evaporate before your eyes. All of the meditations on this page are taken from our book 'Mindfulness: Finding Peace in a Frantic World'. The book contains the complete 8 week mindfulness course developed at Oxford University. Three Minute Breathing Space This is a mini-meditation that can put you back in control of your life when it starts to slip between your fingers. It acts as a bridge between the longer, formal meditations detailed in our book Mindfulness and the demands of everyday life. All of the meditations on this page are taken from our book 'Mindfulness: Finding Peace in a Frantic World'. The book contains the complete 8 week mindfulness course developed at Oxford University. [NEW BOOK: Deeper Mindfulness: The New Way to Rediscover Calm in a Chaotic World](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/074995308X/ref=nosim?tag=drdannypenman-21) There are moments in life that decide your fate. They ripple into the future and dictate how you experience the world in the moments that follow; either positive and uplifting, dark and chaotic, or flat and dull. What if you could recognise these moments before they seized control of your life? What if you could use them to set sail for a better future? What if all moments, big and small, could be harnessed this way? In Deeper Mindfulness, Oxford Professor Mark Williams and Dr Danny Penman reunite to present a new eight-week guided meditation programme that takes mindfulness to the next level. Deeper Mindfulness reveals how the latest advances in neuroscience, combined with millennia old wisdom, can be used to transform your life. These discoveries open the doors to a deeper layer of mindfulness known as the 'feeling tone'. This sets the 'background colour' that tinges your entire experience of life. It is also the tipping point from which you can reclaim your life in an increasingly stressful and chaotic world. Proven effective at treating anxiety, stress and depression, the practices in Deeper Mindfulness offer a new and more fruitful direction for both novice and experienced meditators. It also allows the rest of us to approach life with renewed strength, vigour and equanimity. 'They've done it again! Read this book as if your life depended on it' Ruby Wax.
