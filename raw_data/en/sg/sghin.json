As advocatesfor advanced inquiry and creativity, we greatly prizethe curious and exceptionally competent student. We value this moment to introduce students and others to the intellectual vision of the GraduateSchool and the programs and faculty that embodythat vision. The bulletin's offerings demonstrate thatgraduate schools are the intellectual nerve center ofthe modern university. Graduate schools makegroundbreaking discoveries, investigate ideas old andnew, and prepare the next generation of scholars,researchers, thinkers, and teachers. As a matter offact, New York University was a pioneer in graduate education. In 1866, New York Universitybecame the second university in the United States to offer an earned doctorate. In 1886, it for-mally opened a graduate division. Today, the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS)houses 47 programs that offer doctoral and master's degrees and enrolls 4,100 students annu-ally. The pioneering continues. As we chart the course of our Graduate School for a new century, we must fuse the strengths of today with a vision of tomorrow's possibilities. To achieve this fusion, GSAS calls on the abun-dant creative energies of New York City. Even more important, the Graduate School draws on theextraordinary New York University faculty to work with students to become intellectual leaders\u2014no matter what career they might eventually choose. Graduate education depends first and fore-most on an institution's faculty and students, on the brains that power the school. Buoyed by its city, rooted in its faculty, the Graduate School of Arts and Science shares this bulletin with those who seek a range of graduate degrees, a balance of disciplinary andinterdisciplinary work, and the core values of intellectual communities: rigorous inquiry, life-long discovery of ideas, and a commitment to the ethics of scholarship. Sincerely, Catharine R. Stimpson Dean, Graduate School of Arts and Science www.nyu.edu/gsasSchools and Colleges of New York University New York University is an affirmative action/equal opportunity institution.

MacCrackenbelieved that universities shouldrespond to the needs of modernity bygiving unprecedented priority toadvanced research and professionaltraining. Guided by MacCracken'svision, New York University becamethe second university in America toaward a Ph.D. on the basis of academicperformance and examination. In addition to the emphasis on excellence in research, MacCrackenrecognized the urban environment asboth source and inspiration for aca- demic life. He believed that theUniversity's best interests lay in itsinteractions with the city. By the early1900s, the Graduate School had intro-duced courses concerned with majorglobal issues, and the curriculumreflected movement toward progressivevalues. MacCracken's new vision of gradu- ate training attracted ever-growingnumbers of young women and men todoctoral programs. The first femalegraduate students entered theUniversity in 1888. Today, womenconstitute over half of the 4,100 mas-ter's and Ph.D. graduate studentsenrolled in 47 departments and pro- grams, as well as in a growing numberof institutes and interdisciplinaryresearch areas. Mirroring the cultural diversity of New York City, the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science is an urban,diverse, and internationally focusedmajor research center, with studentsfrom more than 100 countries. TheGraduate School still honors the idealexpressed by Albert Gallatin, theUniversity's first president, who artic-ulated the institution's primary goal:\"A private university in the publicservice.\" History of the Graduate School 6 HISTORY OF THE GRADUATE SCHOOL Washington Square by Fernand Harvey Lungren (c.1890).

AFFILIATED FACULTY Thomas Studies; Barbara Krauthamer, History; Emily Martin, Anthropology; Randy Martin, Art and AMERICAN STUDIES 15285 MERCER STREET, 8TH FLOOR NEW YORK, NY 10003-6653 212-998-8538 TProgram and RequirementsAdmission: Admission to graduate studies in the Program in AmericanStudies is based on academic recordsand letters of recommendation. TheGraduate Record Examination (GRE)is required of all students. The basis of the program is multi- disciplinary; therefore it tends toadmit exceptional students who areattuned to working across disciplines. MASTER OF ARTS Course of Study: The terminal M.A. program does not lead directly toPh.D. enrollment, though M.A. stu-dents may apply for Ph.D. study alongwith the general Ph.D. applicant poolin any given year. A total of 32 pointsof course credit\u2014at least 24 taken inresidence at NYU\u2014is required for theM.A. degree. M.A. students mustcomplete the introductory Americanstudies seminar, a research seminar,and three other courses taught by coreprogram faculty, and they mustdemonstrate reading proficiency in aforeign language. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Matriculation: Students may be admitted to the Ph.D. program eitherfollowing M.A. study at NYU or else-where or directly after receipt of thebachelor's degree. In either case, thefirst semesters of enrollment in thePh.D. program must confirm students'readiness for doctoral work. Thus, stu-dents holding the M.A. upon admis-sion must officially apply to matricu-late for the doctorate after completing12 points of course work in Americanstudies at NYU; those entering withonly a bachelor's degree must do soupon completing 32 points of coursework. Approval of matriculation isbased on students' progress to date andon recommendations from facultyfamiliar with their work. Degree Requirements: To qualify for the doctorate, a student must satisfac-torily complete graduate studies total-ing at least 72 points, with a mini-mum of 32 points at the doctoral levelin residence at New York University;pass qualifying examinations; and present an acceptable dissertation.Students who have completed relevantgraduate courses elsewhere mayrequest that such courses be creditedto degree requirements within the sec-ond semester of study. Credits may beearned through courses, independentstudy, and group study. Course of Study: All students must take the introductory Seminar inAmerican Studies (G13.3301), GroupResearch Seminar (G13.2319), andIndividual Research Seminar(G13.2306). Beyond this, studentswork with the director of the program,the director of graduate studies, andcommittee advisers to establish theircourse of study; at least 24 points(generally six courses) in addition tothose entailed by the required semi-nars must be earned in courses offeredby the program's core faculty. The pro-gram offers a range of six fields: (1) culture, work, and consumption;(2) identity, citizenship, and social for-mation; (3) media, communications,and expressive culture; (4) social andpolitical theory; (5) science, technolo-gy, and society; and (6) urban andcommunity studies. Doctoral students choose to concen- trate their course work in two of thesefields and are examined in each. Underspecial circumstances, fields can beconstructed for students with extraor-dinary interests. If they wish, studentsmay concentrate their work in specificdisciplines, although the chief purposeof the field structure is to encouragetransdisciplinary study. Language Requirements: Every matriculant must satisfy the doctorallanguage proficiency requirement.This may be done in one of threeways: (1) demonstrate proficiency at anintermediate level in a second foreignlanguage as described in the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin; (2) demonstrate advanced proficiencyin the same language offered at themaster's level in the Graduate Schoolforeign language proficiency examina-tion; or (3) in special cases, complete ayearlong course (with a grade of B or better) in statistics, computer method-ology, or a technical skill related to thestudent's research, in addition todemonstrating proficiency in a firstforeign language at the master's level. Qualifying Examination: Matriculated students who have completed or arecompleting the appropriate coursesand have already demonstrated knowl-edge of the two foreign languagesmust pass the qualifying examinations.Each candidate for the Ph.D. must sat-isfy the requirements set by the facultycommittee in two fields. For eachfield, the candidate prepares a substan-tial research essay dealing with a widerange of literature in the field, consid-ering questions and topics central to acourse of reading set in consultationwith field examiners. An oral sessionmay be conducted after the work iscomplete. Dissertation: When the student has completed at least one year in resi-dence and all course and languagerequirements, passed the qualifyingexaminations, proposed an acceptablesubject for the dissertation, and beenrecommended by the program, he orshe is formally admitted to candidacyfor the doctorate, and an advisorycommittee is appointed. While mostcommittees are comprised of membersfrom the Program Committee, stu-dents are permitted to work with anyappropriate member of the NYU fac-ulty. Approval of the dissertation bythe committee and a defense of thedissertation examination complete therequirements for the degree.

Myers DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Thomas A. Abercrombie nthropologists are concerned withevery aspect ofhuman life, past and present. This view makesanthropology a complex disci-pline, its theories and methodstranscending the usual bound-aries of natural science, social sci-ence, and the humanities. Cultural anthropologists in the department share a belief thatstudy and research must befirmly grounded in rigoroustraining in general social andcultural theory, both in contem-porary writings and in the clas-sics of anthropology andsociology. The faculty alsobelieves that basic ethnographyremains the cornerstone onwhich all cultural anthropologyrests and are concerned with therepresentation of anthropologicalknowledge in writing and film.There is a commitment to anunderstanding of complex soci-eties that is informed by a com-parative perspective andknowledge of small-scale soci-eties. Recent field research byfaculty and students has beenconducted in Africa, Australia,Oceania, East Asia, India, theMiddle East, Europe, SouthAmerica, the Caribbean, Mexico,and the United States. Faculty interests converge genderrelations; processes; scienceand health; and urban life. Muchfaculty research focuses on themediation of identities throughpopular and public culturalforms\u2014such as art, television,indigenous media, urban space,regional cultures, and ideologiesof language use\u2014in a variety ofchanging social contexts. Linguistic anthropology focuses on how language is usedto create and maintain the socialrelations and symbolic systemsthat constitute everyday life. Stu-dents are encouraged to carry outethnographic studies of languageuse in communities and institu-tions both within and outsideNew York City. Archaeologists in the depart- ment are committed to the beliefthat the material remains ofancient societies provide signifi-cant insights into the dynamicsof sociocultural evolution. Thedepartment has developed anarchaeology program that focuseson evolution; the of artand symbolism; archaeology andgender; the of foodproduction; class urbanism; and the developmentand collapse of chieftaincies andearly states. A diversity of theo-retical perspectives, includingcultural ecology, political econ-omy, and symbolic archaeology,are represented and encouraged.The geographic scope of facultyresearch includes the Near East,Egypt, South Asia, Europe, andNorth America. The biological anthropologists in the department are involved inresearch on primate socioecology,comparative primate morphology,molecular anthropology, paleoan-thropology, primate paleontology,and skeletal morphology. In addi-tion to these specialist areas, fac-ulty research is unified by aconceptual and intellectual foun-dation in genetics, evolutionarytheory, ecology, and behavior.These are core themes in a com-mon enterprise that can bereferred to as evolutionary primatol- ogy\u2014the study of human beings and other primates within anevolutionary context. Facultyresearch is based on a solid foun-dation of traditional approachesand concepts in physical anthro-pology, an appreciation of themultidisciplinarity of the subdis-cipline, and technical and theo-retical proficiency in newlyemerging specialty areas. Theresearch and training program inour department is distinguishedby its unique commitment to RUFUS D.

Programs and RequirementsAdmission: Admission to graduate study is based on academic records,scholarly recommendations, and scoreson the Graduate Record Examination.The department offers the Master ofArts and Doctor of Philosophy degreeswith specialization in various subdisci-plines (see below). The departmentdoes not offer a stand-alone M.A. pro-gram. Instead, the M.A. is awarded asa step in fulfillment of requirementsfor the Ph.D. Applicants should applydirectly to the Ph.D. program. Theywill be formally admitted to the Ph.D.program, however, only after fulfill-ment of requirements outlined below.MASTER OF ARTS A total of 36 points of course work isrequired for the M.A. degree, 12 ofthese being in the core courses. Allstudents in each of the subdisciplinesare required to take certain depart-mental core courses. It is recognized,however, that even at the master'slevel, students usually have definedtheir subdisciplines of interest. Hence,each student follows within a subdisci-pline a structured program to assurecompetence in anthropology by thetime the M.A. degree is completed.The requirements for each of the sub-disciplines are described below.Cultural and Linguistic Anthropology: All students must take (1) Depart-mental Seminar (G14.1000) or an alter-native course approved by the directorof graduate studies and their M.A. advi-sory committee, Social AnthropologyTheory and Practice (G14.1010), andLinguistic Anthropology (G14.1040) an EthnographicTraditions chosen in consulta- tion with their M.A. advisory commit-tee; and (3) History of Anthropology(G14.1636).ANTHROPOLOGY 21Archaeological Anthropology: All students must take (1) DepartmentalSeminar (G14.1000) or an alternativecourse approved by the director of grad-uate studies and their M.A. advisorycommittee, AnthropologicalArchaeology (G14.1020), andBiological Anthropology (G14.1030) astheir core courses (in semesters whenG14.1030 is not offered, studentsshould consult the director of graduatestudies or their M.A. advisory commit-tee); (2) either History of Anthropology(G14.1636) or a course in the history ofarchaeology; (3) one archaeology coursefocusing on a specific geographicregion; (4) one course in archaeologicalmethods; and (5) a supervised field tripexperience approved by their M.A.advisory committee. Biological Anthropology: All stu- dents must take (1) DepartmentalSeminar (G14.1000) or an alternativecourse approved by the director of grad-uate studies and their M.A. advisorycommittee; (2) all three of the NewYork Consortium for Evolutionary Primatology (NYCEP) core courses;and AnthropologyI (G14.3218) or anequivalent seminar approved by theirM.A. advisory committee. On entering the M.A. program, each student is assigned an advisory com-mittee consisting of three facultymembers who meet with the studentonce each semester to plan the stu-dent's course work for the followingsemester. The department evaluates allM.A. graduate courses taken at otheruniversities, and credit may be trans-ferred within the limits set by theGraduate School of Arts and Science. No later than the middle of the term in which all M.A. course workhas been completed, usually the thirdsemester of full-time course work, thestudent selects an M.A. paper commit-tee, consisting of a supervisor and areader, from among the faculty. Thetopic of the paper is selected in consul-tation with the M.A. paper committee,and this committee must approve theM.A. paper before the master's degreeis awarded. Note: Students in the mas- ter's program may take no more than 8points in research or reading courses. During the second year of graduate study, students petition to enter thePh.D. program, as described below.No student may register for more than12 points beyond the M.A. until themaster's paper has been accepted, andshe or he has provisional entry to thedoctoral program.DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY There are two ways to apply for admis-sion into the Ph.D. program. Studentswho already have a master's degree inanthropology apply for admissiondirectly through the Graduate School ofArts and Science. Students enrolled inthe M.A. program petition for entryinto the Ph.D. program at the begin-ning of the fourth semester in resi-dence. To petition, a student mustdevelop a program of study that hasbeen approved by his or her Ph.D. com-mittee, consisting of three facultymembers in the department who for-mally agree to supervise the student'sresearch. The head of the Ph.D. com-mittee is the student's main dissertationadviser. A successful petition consists ofa written statement indicating a plan ofstudy and research, formulated in con-sultation with the proposed Ph.D. com-mittee and then approved by the entiredepartmental faculty. Final acceptanceis conditional upon successful comple-tion of the master's course work andmaster's paper. These course points arethen applied toward the Ph.D., whichrequires a total of 72 points. Studentswho have been formally admitted tothe Ph.D. program may take a maxi-mum of 24 points in research courses. On completion of 64 points or more of course work, a student must takethe written Ph.D. comprehensiveexaminations. These examinationscover work in three areas of specializa-tion. Ph.D. committees may also setother course requirements, dependingon the particular needs of the student.The language requirement must befulfilled as well as an oral defense ofthe dissertation proposal. Once theserequirements are completed, the stu-dent has achieved Ph.D. candidacy andmay pursue dissertation research. Atthis time, the student files for thedegree of M.Phil. After completion ofthe dissertation, the student defendsthe dissertation at a final oral examina-tion conducted by members of thePh.D. committee and two additionalscholars. Three members of the exam-ining committee must be from theanthropology faculty. LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS The department requires that all stu-dents in the Ph.D. program demon-strate proficiency in one foreign lan-guage. The language is usually chosenfrom Arabic, Chinese, French,German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese,Russian, or Spanish. Petitions to takeother languages should be made to thedirector of graduate studies.Students at the master's level are not required to demonstrate compe-tence in a foreign language, but thedepartment recommends that suchcompetence be developed. URBAN ANTHROPOLOGY The special area of study in urbananthropology is open to students in thedepartmental curriculum but has nospecific requirements. It emphasizesapplication of anthropological method-ology to the problems of urban societyin the United States and abroad. NewYork City provides excellent training conditions for studies of urban life, aswell as access to urban institutions andagencies at the local, state, national,and international levels. CERTIFICATE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA (See the Certificate Program in Culture and Media section in this bulletin for further information.) The Departments of Anthropology and Cinema Studies offer a joint course ofstudy, integrated with Ph.D. work ineither of those departments, leading tothe Advanced Certificate in Culture andMedia. Core faculty are Professor FayeGinsburg, director, and AssistantProfessors Margaret McLagan and JeffHimpele of the Department ofAnthropology, as well as Professor TobyMiller of the Department of CinemaStudies. The program is designed forgraduate students in either theDepartment of Anthropology or theDepartment of Cinema Studies; work forthe certificate is integrated with gradu-ate work for either of those departments. The certificate program provides a focused course of graduate studies inte-grating production with theory andresearch. Training in this program willenable students to pursue the following: 1. Production of work in 16 mm film and state-of-the-art digital video basedon their own research, resulting in ahalf-hour documentary. 2. Ethnographic research into the uses and meanings of media in a range ofcommunities and cultures. Studentsfrom the program have been doingPh.D. research on the development ofmedia in diverse settings, from theemergence of media in Papua NewGuinea, to circulation of religious mediain northern Nigeria, to the use of mediain linking the Tibetan diaspora. 3. Teaching the history, theory, and production of ethnographic documen-tary and related issues in cinema andmedia studies.22 ANTHROPOLOGY4.

The program's philosophy takes a broad approach to the relationshipsbetween culture and media in a num-ber of domains including a criticalapproach to ethnographic film's signifi-cance for the fields of anthropology andcinema/media studies; problems in rep-resentation of cultures through media;the development of media in indige-nous, diaspora, and non-Western com-munities; the emerging social and cul-tural formations shaped by new mediapractices; and the political economyshaping the production, distribution,and consumption of media worldwide. Curriculum: The program requires approximately one additional semesterbeyond the M.A. degree and consists ofan original project and eight courses,two of which may be counted towardthe M.A. degree, two toward the Ph.D.Courses include seminars that criticallyaddress the history and theory ofethnographic film and issues in cultureand media, production courses in filmand/or video in the film school, culturetheory and the documentary, and elec-tives on topics such as Third Worldcinema and feminist film criticism.Students may not take courses in theculture and media program unless theyare pursuing an M.A. or a Ph.D. incinema studies or a Ph.D. in anthro-pology at NYU. Students with priortraining in media may be able to sub-stitute other courses from the extensivecurriculum offered in cinema studies,anthropology, or media production\u2014including other forms such as photog-raphy and new media. Internships: The program also arranges supervised internships forcourse credit, tailored to individualresearch and professional interests.Students work in a variety of program-ming and production positions forinstitutions such as the Margaret MeadFilm Festival, the Museum of theAmerican Indian, the Asia Society, andthe Jewish Museum. The program works closely with the Center for Media, Culture, andHistory (see page 23). THE NYCEP PROGRAM New York University participates in theNew York Consortium for EvolutionaryPrimatology (NYCEP), a graduate training program in evolutionary prima-tology that includes City University ofNew York, Columbia University, theWildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo, and the American Museumof Natural History. The consortium pro-vides an integrated training programthat allows students to take courses,seminars, and internships at any of theseinstitutions given by more than 40physical anthropologists, primatologists,and vertebrate paleontologists partici-pating in the program. In addition to the departmental requirements, students in biologicalanthropology must take three NYCEPcore courses. These are the foundation-al courses Primate Behavior, Ecology,and Conservation; EvolutionaryMorphology; and Genetics andEvolutionary Theory. Students alsogain practical experience throughrequired internships, where they workindividually on research projects withNYCEP faculty. Most students areprovided the opportunity to travelabroad during the summer to conductresearch at active field sites. JOINT PH.D. PROGRAM IN ANTHROPOLOGY ANDFRENCH STUDIES The Department of Anthropology and the Institute of French Studies offer ajoint Ph.D. degree for students inter-ested in the anthropology of France.The degree prepares a student forteaching and research as a Europeanistin departments of anthropology or as acivilization specialist in departmentsof French. Students must be admitted to both the Department of Anthropology andthe Institute of French Studies.Fluency in French is required.Students normally begin by complet-ing the M.A. in French studies andpetitioning for admission into thePh.D. program in anthropology in thefall of the second year in residence. Atotal of 72 points is required for thejoint degree, with at least 36 points inanthropology, including courses cross-listed between the department and theInstitute. Course requirements includea two-course sequence in 19th- and20th-century French history, two addi-tional core courses in French studies,the core courses in social anthropologyand linguistic anthropology, History ofAnthropology (G14.1636), one non-Western area anthropology course, and three theory and methods courses inanthropology. Formal exchange agree-ments with the Ecole des HautesEtudes Sociales and the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Paris, per-mit students to take some of theircourse work in France during the thirdyear of study. See the Institute of French Studies section of this bulletin for fur- ther details. ANTHROPOLOGY WITH A FOCUS IN NEAR EASTERNSTUDIES The Department of Anthropology offers Ph.D. candidates a special areaof study with a focus in Near Easternstudies. This emphasis enables anthro-pologists to acquire systematic train-ing in a Near Eastern language as wellas knowledge of the literature, history,and civilization of the Near East. It isintended for both sociocultural anthro-pologists and archaeologists. Requirements include the M.A. core courses in anthropology, one course inNear Eastern archaeology, two coursesin the anthropology of the Near East,and four courses in the Near Easternfield chosen outside the Department ofAnthropology (usually in the history,literature, and civilization of the NearEast).

CULTURAL AND SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY Culture and Media I G14.1215 Open only to graduate students in theDepartments of Anthropology, CinemaStudies, and Performance Studies.Ginsburg, Himpele, McLagan. 4 points. This course offers a critical revision of the history of the genre of ethnographicfilm, the central debates it has engagedaround cross-cultural representation,and the theoretical and cinematicresponses to questions of the screen rep-resentation of culture, from the earlyromantic constructions of RobertFlaherty to current work in film, televi-sion, and video on the part of indige-nous people throughout the world.Ethnographic film has a peculiar andhighly contested status within anthro-pology, cinema studies, and documen-tary practice. This seminar situatesethnographic film within the widerproject of the representation of culturallives, and especially of \"natives.\"Starting with what are regarded as thefirst examples of the genre, the courseexamines how these emerged in a par-26 ANTHROPOLOGY ticular intellectual context and political economy. It then considers the keyworks that have defined the genre, andthe epistemological and formal innova-tions associated with them, addressingquestions concerning social theory, doc-umentary, as well as the institutionalstructures through which they arefunded, distributed, and seen by vari-ous audiences. Throughout, the coursekeeps in mind the properties of film asa signifying practice, its status as aform of anthropological knowledge,and the ethical and political concernsraised by cross-cultural representation. Culture and Media II: Ethnography of Media G14.1216 Open only to gradu- ate students in the Departments ofAnthropology, Cinema Studies, andPerformance Studies. Prerequisite:G14.1215. Ginsburg, Himpele, McLagan.4points. In the last decade, a new field\u2014the ethnography of media\u2014has emergedas an exciting new arena of research.While claims about media in people'slives are made on a daily basis, sur-prisingly little research has actuallyattempted to look at how media ispart of the naturally occurring livedrealities of people's lives. In the lastdecade, anthropologists and mediascholars interested in film, television,and video have been turning theirattention increasingly beyond the textand the empiricist notions of audi-ences (stereotypically associated withthe ethnography of media), to consid-er, ethnographically, the complexsocial worlds in which media is pro-duced, circulated, and consumed, athome and elsewhere. This work theo-rizes media studies from the point ofview of cross-cultural ethnographicrealities and anthropology from theperspective of new spaces of communi-cation focusing on the social, econom-ic, and political life of media and howit makes a difference in the daily livesof people as a practice, whether in pro-duction, reception, or circulation.

Assignmentsundertaken in the fall raise representa-tional, methodological, and ethicalissues in approaching and workingthrough an ethnographic and docu-mentary project. Students develop atopic and field site for their projectearly in the fall term, begin theirshooting, and complete a short (5- to10-minute) edited tape by the end ofthe semester. This work should demon-strate competence in shooting andediting using digital camera/audio andFinal Cut Pro nonlinear editing sys-tems. Students devote the springsemester to intensive work on the proj-ect, continuing to shoot and edit, pre-senting work to the class, and complet-ing their (approximately 20-minute)ethnographic documentaries. Studentwork is presented and critiqued duringclass sessions, and attendance and par-ticipation in group critiques and labsessions is mandatory. Students shouldcome into the class with project ideasalready well-developed. Students whohave not completed the work assignedin the first semester are not allowed toregister for the second semester.

As preeminent examples of small-scale societies, the indigenous people ofAustralia have long been of interest ingeneral social theory for ritual, art, gen-der, and sociopolitical processes. Asencapsulated minorities within theAustralian nation-state, dominated byother cultural traditions, their contem-porary cultural life is equally significantas the capacity and practices ofAboriginal people to reproduce them-selves and their traditions in their ownterms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically rein-forced. This course pursues the range ofAboriginal forms of social being, rang-ing from relatively autonomous foragingsocieties to the indigenous formations ofurban social life where the constructionof Aboriginal identities is central.

During their firstyear, students perform research rota-tions with faculty at NYU or at anNIH campus. The latter usually is anoption during the summers. Afterexploring all the thesis research options available, students select a fac-ulty research supervisor at either theNIH or NYU. Depending on the the-sis research area, students may performresearch at either or both institutionsand have an advisory committee com-posed of both NIH and NYU faculty.After meeting all requirements, stu-dents receive their Ph.D. degree fromNew York University. NYU (Medical Scientist Training Program, orMSTP): This program provides a select group of aspiring medical scien-tists not only with the broad biomed-ical and clinical insights of a physicianbut also with the rigorous researchtraining in a specific discipline that ischaracteristic of a Ph.D. degree pro-gram in basic science. M.D.-Ph.D. students are simultane- ously registered in the School ofMedicine and the Graduate School ofArts and Science (GSAS) of New YorkUniversity. They must meet all therequirements for the Ph.D. degree inGSAS and for the M.D. degree in theSchool of Medicine. The program allowsa limited number of students the oppor-tunity to pursue a combined degree inmedicine and the social sciences. In a typical program, the first 18 to 24 months are devoted to a preclinicalbasic sciences curriculum similar tothat pursued by candidates for theM.D. degree. The student then entersa graduate program in which he or shetakes advanced graduate courses andpursues a research project. M.D.-Ph.D.students usually take their qualifyingexaminations at the end of the thirdyear or the beginning of their fourthyear. Following the completion ofstudies toward the Ph.D. degree, thestudent takes an accelerated specialclinical program and completes theremaining requirements for the M.D.degree in 13 to 18 months.Completion of the requirements forthe M.D.-Ph.D. usually takes six toseven years. All M.D.-Ph.D. candidates receive full financial support, which includestuition, fees, and an annual stipend($25,000 for 2003-2004). Candidatesshould apply for admission to theSchool of Medicine as described in thecurrent bulletin of the school. Thosewho are interested in the combineddegree program can request a supple-mentary application by using the post-card enclosed in the School ofMedicine application. Admission tothe Medical Scientist TrainingProgram is highly competitive, andthe selection committee pays specialattention to the research experience ofthe candidate and to the quality of hisor her scientific preparation. Adescription of the candidate's researchexperience and letters of recommenda-tion from all research supervisors are essential components of the M.D.-Ph.D. application. A summary of theapplicant's scientific interests andcareer plans must also be includedwith the application. Candidates areencouraged to submit their applica-tions as early as July 14 but no laterthan November 14.

FACULTY EMERITI In addition to the general Graduate School of Arts and Sciencerequirements for admission, applicantsare expected to have an average of B orbetter in the sciences and to have com-pleted the equivalent of an undergradu-ate major in biology. Admission tograduate study is based on academicrecords, recommendations, assessmentsof the applicant 's scientific potential, and scores on the Graduate RecordExamination (GRE). The GRE generaltest is required of all applicants to theM.S. and Ph.D. programs. Theadvanced GRE test in biology is alsorequired of all applicants to the Ph.D.program. Consideration is given toapplicants with an undergraduate majorother than biology; remedial work tomake up any undergraduate deficienciesmay be taken prior to, or concurrentwith, the master 's program but must be completed within the first year in thePh.D. program. Applications for graduate study are accepted on a continuing basis. M.S.students may begin study in the fall,spring, or summer semester; however,Ph.D. students may start only in thefall semester. All students with international cre- dentials whose native language is notEnglish should refer to the Admission to Degree Programs section of this bulletin regarding the required Test of Englishas a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Insome cases, prior to taking graduatecourses, students may be required toenroll in noncredit English courses attheir own expense. In special cases, a student may be accepted as a nonmatriculant. A non-degree student may take up to 12points in the Department of Biologybefore applying for matriculated statusin M.S. or Ph.D. program. Theapplication for matriculation is onlyconsidered if the student has received aB or better in each course included inthe 12 points. Deadlines for applyingfor nonmatriculant status are the sameas for the M.S. program. Seminars: All faculty and doctoral students attend the weekly departmen-tal seminar, at which scholars fromother institutions discuss their research findings. In addition, the departmentsponsors special topical seminarsthroughout the year. Special Notes: Although master 's stu- dents may start their program in anysemester, some courses are full-yearcourses and must be started in the fall. Full-time students are expected to carry three courses or the equivalent inapproved research per semester. Allstudents in both programs are expect-ed to maintain a B or better averageeach term. Permission must be received from the director of graduate studies for anycourse work taken outside of thedepartment. MASTER OF SCIENCE The Master of Science program offersthree courses of study: biological sci-ences, computers in biologic research,and recombinant DNA technology. Inaddition, biomedical journalism isoffered jointly with the Department ofJournalism and Mass Communication,and a combined M.S.-M.B.A. programis offered jointly with the New YorkUniversity Leonard N. Stern School ofBusiness. The options are described inthe Graduate Student Handbook, avail- able on request from the Departmentof Biology. Courses numbered in the1000-level and 2000-level ranges areopen to students in the M.S. program. Degree Requirements: Students are awarded a Master of Science degree on(1) completion of 36 points with anaverage of B or better and (2) satisfac-tory completion of a research paper. Ofthe 36 points required, 28 must befrom the Department of Biology atNew York University. Only 8 pointsmay be transferred from outside theUniversity and any other departmentin the Graduate School of Arts andScience. Students working within oneof the special M.S. programs may berequired to take additional courses. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The department accepts a limitednumber of outstanding students intothe Ph.D. program, which is a full- time program. The Ph.D. degree is aresearch degree. To qualify for the doc-torate, a student must satisfactorilycomplete graduate studies totaling atleast 72 points (at least 36 in residenceat New York University), pass a quali-fying examination, and present anacceptable dissertation. Each doctoralstudent is expected to have teachingexperience at the college level; studentsgain this experience through teachingassistantships within the department. Course of Study: Of the 72 points required, a minimum of 36 points mustbe in courses at the 1000- and 2000-level; after review and approval by thedirector of graduate studies, up to one-half of these 36 points may be trans-ferred from outside the department. Theremaining points may be selected fromcourses generally at the 3000-level.Doctoral students are generally requiredto complete Biochemistry I, II(G23.1046, 1047) or the equivalent.Statistics in Biology (G23.2030) or theequivalent must be taken prior to takingthe written qualifying examinations.Also, students doing animal researchmust take Laboratory Animal Science(G23.1119) prior to any work with ani-mals. Doctoral students must also satis-factorily complete the required Predoc-toral Colloquium: Laboratory Rotation(G23.3034-3035) during the first yearof residence and must take PredoctoralColloquium: Graduate Student Seminar(G23.3015) during each semester thatthey are matriculated, beginning in theirsecond year of graduate study. Students in the special collaborative Program in Environmental HealthSciences (EHS) select courses based ontheir interests with the advice andguidance of faculty from both depart-ments. For additional informationregarding the EHS program, studentsshould contact Professor Suse Broydein the department. Students with an interest in BRIDGES should complete G23.1072,G23.1073, and all courses that doctoralstudents are required to complete.Further information on BRIDGES canbe obtained from Professor David Fitch. Programs and Requirements46 BIOLOGYStudents with an interest genetics G23.2130, 2131, and allcourses that doctoral students arerequired to complete. Further informa-tion on developmental genetics can beobtained from Professor Stephen Small. All doctoral students must maintain an average of B or better. Qualifying Examination/Admission to Candidacy: The written Ph.D. quali- fying examination (preliminary exami-nation) is generally taken at the end oftwo years of full-time study (at the com-pletion of the course work phase ofstudy), that is, in the spring semester ofa student 's second year. The examination consists of two parts. The first part is anindependent and original research pro-posal on a topic related to the theme ofthe spring seminar series. The proposalis submitted to an examination commit-tee consisting of three faculty memberschosen by the student. The proposalmay not be in the area of the student 's thesis research. The second part is anoral examination before the examinationcommittee, which is intended to testfurther the student 's understanding of the topics contained in the written pro-posal. Satisfactory completion of thequalifying examination constitutesadmission to Ph.D. candidacy. Students in the special collaborative Program in Environmental HealthSciences must take a two-phase writtenqualifying examination. EHS studentsmust pass sections of the departmentalwritten examination that cover cellularbiology and molecular biology, includ-ing the \"problem \"question (two-thirds of the examination), if given; the second phase is a special version of theBasic Environmental Health Exami-nation, principally covering areas of statistics, toxicology, and oncology. Sometime during the first or second year, the student must secure a facultysponsor and a research advisory com-mittee of at least three faculty mem- bers from within the department whohave formally agreed to supervise thedissertation research. A dissertationproposal for the completion of originalbiological research must be filed andapproved by the sponsor (generallyduring the semester following success-ful completion of the written qualify-ing examination). The student mustthen pass an oral examination on theresearch proposal before the student 's examining committee. Doctoral Dissertation: The plan of study and the dissertation research areformulated in consultation with thefaculty sponsor and the research adviso-ry committee. The dissertation mustrepresent original, independent researchin a significant area of biology at a levelcomparable to research published inrecognized journals or as professionalmonographs. When the dissertation iscompleted and has been approved bythe sponsor and by the research adviso-ry committee, the candidate defendsthe results of the research before a fac-ulty committee and invited outsideexaminers with expertise in the field ofresearch. No less than six months maylapse between the oral proposal exami-nation and the dissertation defense.

The Graduate RecordExamination (GRE) scores from thegeneral test and the advanced chem- istry (or other appropriate advanced-level area) test are required. Students whose native language is not English must submit the scorefrom either the Test of Spoken English(TSE) or the Test of English as aForeign Language (TOEFL).Students beginning graduate study are usually accepted only forSeptember admission. Part-time candidates for the M.S. degree are accepted only if they areable to attend classes in the daytime,since very few courses are offered inthe evening.CHEMISTRY 61MASTER OF SCIENCE Requirements: Students must satis- factorily complete 32 points (at least24 in residence at New YorkUniversity) with a GPA of B (3.0) orbetter, and one of the following alter-natives: (1) presentation of a seminaron an advanced topic in the majorfield; (2) preparation of an interpreta-tive review of the literature of a select-ed area of chemistry; (3) preparation ofa dissertation based on originalresearch; (4) passing an oral examina-tion in the major field. The suggested courses in each field are Organic Chemistry The Doctor of Philosophy is a researchdegree. It signifies that the recipient isable to conduct independent researchand has both a broad basic knowledgeof all areas of chemistry and a compre-hensive knowledge of one field in par-ticular. Since graduate students arrive with a variety of backgrounds, many withM.S. degrees from other institutions inthe United States and abroad, the pro-gram of courses for each student isdesigned in consultation with thedirector of graduate studies, takingeach student's specific background,experience, and interests into account. While there are no specific course requirements for the Ph.D. in chem-istry, students in the Ph.D. programmay choose to participate in one of thefollowing three tracks. Each track rep-resents an area of study reflecting boththe current research foci of the facultyand the evolving interests of studentsand is designed to provide a morestructured academic experience. Eachtrack provides a guideline for 24 ofthe 72 points required for the degree.These tracks may also be modified inconsultation with the adviser and thedirector of graduate studies to betterfit the individual needs of students.Note: Each of the following courses carries 4 points.Organic/Bioorganic Chemistry Track: Organic Reactions (G25.1311) Structure and Theory in OrganicChemistry (G25.1313)Organic Analysis (G25.1326)and 12 points selected from the in Organic 2262)Organic Mechanics (G25.2651)Quantum Chemistry (G25.2665)Quantum Mechanics (G25.2666) Students must satisfactorily complete at least 72 points derived from coursesand research, at least 32 of which mustbe taken in residence at New YorkUniversity. Students usually gain labo-ratory research experience during theirfirst year in one or more groups. Thislaboratory experience provides stu-dents with direct exposure to tech-niques and methodology used in thevarious labs and helps them to choosea thesis adviser. In order to gain matriculation into the Ph.D. program in chemistry, a stu-dent must present a public lecture atthe beginning of the second year andpass a research progress examination atthe end of the second year of graduatestudy. The exam is designed to ensurethat students are ready to embark onserious research and scholarship. Itconsists of a written report (5-10pages) and an oral examination beforea thesis advisory committee (thesisadviser plus two other faculty mem-bers). If performance is not satisfacto-ry, one more attempt is allowed.Students who pass are graduated tothe status of a Ph.D. candidate. A further requirement for the Ph.D. program in chemistry is the prepara-tion and successful oral defense of tworesearch projects. At the beginning of the fourth year of graduate study, awritten and oral research proposalexamination must be passed. Theexam tests student skills in scientificwriting, reasoning analysis, integra-tion of scientific concepts, interpreta-tion of data in the literature, and cre-ativity in the design of new experi-ments. Feedback on student abstractssubmitted prior to the exam is intend-ed to help students identify promisingresearch directions. The final writtenproposal (10-12 pages) and oral exami-nation are evaluated by an appointedcommittee. A passing grade must beachieved at least nine months beforethe thesis defense. The thesis defense,performed before the thesis advisorycommittee, is the last step of thePh.D. program. All doctoral candidates are expected to participate in the seminar programoffered by their division and to attendthe departmental colloquia presentedby distinguished visiting scientists. Doctoral Dissertation: The heart of the doctoral program is the researchleading to the preparation of the dis-sertation. The accumulation of highgrades in formal courses, while impor-tant, is secondary to the demonstrationof a capacity for original thinking andthe completion of an investigationthat contributes significantly to chem-ical knowledge. When a student is for-mally admitted to matriculation forthe doctorate, a committee consistingof the research adviser and two otherfaculty members is selected to advisethe candidate and monitor theprogress of the research by meetingwith the student at scheduled intervalsand whenever requested by the stu-dent. When the dissertation is com-pleted, it is read by the research com-mittee and two additional faculty. Upto two outside readers who are expertsin the field of the dissertation researchmay be appointed as dissertation read-ers. A public oral defense of theapproved dissertation is then held.

CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Associate Professor Chris Straayer DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Richard Allen he Department of Cinema Studies isone of the firstuniversity depart- ments devoted to the history,theory, and aesthetics of film andthe moving image. Theapproach to cinema is interdisci-plinary and international inscope and is concerned withunderstanding films in terms ofthe material practices that pro-duce them and within whichthey circulate. While film con-stitutes the primary object ofstudy, the department also con-siders other media that fall within the realm of sound/imagestudies (e.g., broadcast television,video art, and on-line technolo-gies) to be within its purview. Three graduate programs are offered in the department: theM.A. Program in Cinema Stud-ies, the M.A. Program in Mov-ing Image Archiving andPreservation, and the Ph.D. Pro-gram in Cinema Studies. Graduate students may take a production course only in thesummer through the Depart-ment of Film and Television.Students enrolled in the Certifi-cate Program in Culture andMedia are required to take fur-ther production courses duringthe academic year.Most courses in cinema stud- ies include extensive filmscreenings that are supple-mented by a weekly cinema-theque. Students also haveaccess to extensive film andfilm-related resources in thedepartment's George AmbergStudy Center. In addition, theElmer Holmes Bobst Libraryhouses a substantial video col-lection that is located in theAvery Fisher Center for Music and Media. Other New YorkCity institutions such as theMuseum of Modern Art, theLibrary of the Performing Artsat Lincoln Center, and theAnthology Film Archives offerfurther invaluable resources forthe film student. 721 BROADWAY , 6TH FLOOR NEW YORK, NY 10003-6807 212-998-1600 T FacultyRichard Allen, Associate Professor.

Students also have the opportu-nity to pursue internships for credit atfilm libraries and archives in the city orin the film and media industries inorder to further their professionaldevelopment. Many lecture classes areoffered in the evening for the conven-ience of working students. Graduatesof the program have gone on to suc-cessful careers as film curators, pro-grammers, preservationists, critics, andeducators as well as filmmakers, screen-writers, and industry professionals. The M.A. Program in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation is atwo-year course of study that providesmoving image archivists with an inter-national, comprehensive education inthe theories, methods, and practices ofmoving image archiving and preserva-tion and includes, in addition to film,the study of video, broadcast televi-sion, and digital media. The curriculumcovers all aspects of moving imagearchiving, including film history/his-toriography and film style; conservation, preservation, legal cataloging; studies; program-ming; use of new digital technologies;and access to archival holdings. This program takes full advantage of the New York City area resources.Students work with archives, muse-ums, libraries, labs, and arts organiza-tions. They do internships andpracticums with New York Cityorganizations during two academicyears and with repositories either inNew York or elsewhere during theintervening summer. They also have the opportunity to engage with otherprograms at New York University,such as the museum studies program,the paper-based archives program inthe Department of History, and theconservation program of the Instituteof Fine Arts. Although the program trains stu- dents to deal with all types of movingimage material in all settings, it alsopays attention to problems posed byworks that have no institutional stew-ardship (orphan, independent, avant-garde, documentary, non-institutionalWeb sites, etc.). The program also addresses the ties between the prac-tices of moving image archiving andthe practices of scholarly research. The Ph.D. Program in Cinema Studies prepares students to developteaching competence and to pursueresearch in cinema and media studies.The curriculum draws on the methodsof a number of disciplines, includingart history, cultural studies, Americanstudies, psychoanalytic theory, andphilosophy and involves intensive sem-inar-level study in film theory, history,and research methods. Graduates ofthe program have gone onto positionsof academic leadership in the field. Admission: Although instruction, administration, and financial aid areprovided by the Tisch School of theArts (TSOA), graduate degrees in cin-ema studies are conferred by NewYork University through the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS).Admission is granted by both schools.Applications are processed by theTisch School of the Arts.

They also must complete an inten- sive internship (20-40 hours/week)during the summer at the end of theirfirst year, at a moving image reposito-ry approved by the director. Thoughthe student may specialize in one par-ticular department/task within theinstitution, over the course of thesummer they are expected to obtain abroad knowledge of how the variousdepartments of that institution worktogether. Work done during theinternship experience may serve as thecore research and preparation for thefinal thesis project. Students areencouraged to engage in this intern-ship outside the United States to viewhow repositories operate differently indifferent countries. Thesis or Portfolio: Each student is required to complete a capstone proj-ect in the form of either a well-devel-oped thesis or a portfolio. The studentis expected to work with their adviserbeginning in their second semester tomake sure that their capstone projectreflects their learning experience inthe program. The portfolio mustinclude a written essay synthesizingthe wide variety of topics learned dur-ing the program as well as good exam-ples of projects that the student hascompleted. The portfolio may serve as an example of what the student mightpresent to a potential employer. Theportfolio must be turned in by the10th week of the student's final springsemester, and at the end of that semes-ter the student must orally presentthis portfolio to a committee of facultyand working professionals who evalu-ate whether or not the student is readyto be granted the degree. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY PROGRAM IN CINEMA STUDIES The Doctor of Philosophy degree is conferred for advanced studies inwhich the student demonstrates out-standing original scholarship. It signi-fies the student can conduct independ-ent research and has both a broad basicknowledge of all areas of his or herfield and a comprehensive knowledgeof one field in particular. A doctoral candidate must complete all requirements no later than tenyears from matriculation or seven yearsfrom the time of his or her matricula-tion if the candidate holds a master'sdegree. Course of Study: Students must com- plete 36 points of course work in addi-tion to their M.A. degree (which willbe assessed at 36 points) for a total of72 points; three qualifying exams; aforeign dissertation proposal; dissertation; and a dissertationdefense open to faculty and students.Students are permitted to take up totwo classes outside the department oras independent study. A student inter-ested in independent study must obtainapproval from a full-time faculty mem-ber after submitting a statement ofpurpose and a proposed bibiliography.

DEPARTMENTAL FACILITIES The primary facility for graduate edu-cational and research computing is anetwork of workstations, including sev-eral Sun servers. In addition, individualresearch groups have various othermachines, including Unix workstations(SGIs, IBMs, DECs, and HPs),Macintoshes, and PCs. Access to theInternet is provided through a T3 con-nection. Each doctoral student hasaccess to his or her own dedicated Unixworkstation. Many other researchmachines provide for abundant accessto a variety of computer architectures.For example, the Multimedia Centerfor Advanced Technology and MediaResearch Laboratory has an extensiverange of state-of-the-art graphics equip-ment, as well as a sound studio, andaccess to related facilities at the TischSchool of the Arts. The bioinformaticsgroup has a cluster of fast PCs for com-puting genome mappings. The distrib-uted computing group manages a dedi-cated cluster of PCs and workstationsfor experiments in robust distribution.COMPUTER SCIENCE 91Courses are generally scheduled from 5 to 7 p.m. or from 7 to 9 p.m.; how-ever, honors courses (intended primari-ly for full-time Ph.D. students) areheld during afternoon hours. For courses requiring programming, students may use the Courant Institute'scomputing facilities. Detailed course descriptions may be accessed each semester from the\"Course Home Pages\" links on thedepartment's Web site. PREPARATORY ACCELERATED COURSE (PAC) Applicants to the master's programs who have insufficient background incomputer science but are otherwiseadmissible are referred to PAC. Thesetwo courses (part one, which is offeredin the fall, and part two, in the spring)are designed to fulfill the minimumprerequisites for beginning a master'sprogram in computer science or infor-mation systems. Those admitted to theM.S. program with the requirement tocomplete PAC are considered M.S.degree students while they are enrolledin PAC courses, although the creditsfor the courses do not count towardthe M.S. degree. Applicants should apply for their ultimate degree objective rather thanfor PAC, even if they expect to berequired to take these courses.

CULTURE AND MEDIA 95DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Professor Faye Ginsburg he Departments of Anthropology andCinema Studiesoffer a specializedjoint course of study leading to a New York State Certificate inCulture and Media for New YorkUniversity graduate studentswho are also pursuing their M.A.or Ph.D. in cinema studies orPh.D. in anthropology.25 WAVERLY 212-998-3759 FAX: 212-995-4014 WEB SITE: www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/anthro/programs/cultmedia.htm T The Certificate Program in Culture and Media provides students with afocused course of graduate studiesintegrating media production withtraining in theory and research, whilethey are pursuing their Ph.D. work.Training in this program enables stu- dents to pursue the following: 1. Production work in 16 mm film and state-of-the-art digital video basedon their own research, resulting in ahalf-hour documentary. 2. Ethnographic research into the uses and meanings of media in a range ofcommunities and cultures. Studentsfrom the program have been doingPh.D. research on the development ofmedia in diverse settings, from theemergence of media in Papua NewGuinea to the circulation of religiousmedia in Northern Nigeria to the use of media in linking the Tibetan diaspora. 3. Teaching the history, theory, and production of ethnographic documen-tary and related issues in cinema andmedia studies. 4. Careers in media requiring an understanding of anthropology, such asspecialized programming and distribu-tion of ethnographic film and video,community-based documentary pro-duction, management of ethnographicfilm/video libraries and archives, orwork in new media. The program's philosophy takes a broad approach to understanding therelationships between culture andmedia in a number of domains includ-ing ethnographic film's significance forthe fields of anthropology and cine-ma/media studies; problems in repre- sentation of cultures through media;the development of media in indige-nous, diaspora, and non-Western com-munities; the emerging social and cul-tural formations shaped by new mediapractices; and the political economyshaping the production, distribution,and consumption of media worldwide. INTERNSHIPS The program can arrange supervisedinternships for course credit, tailoredto individual research and professionalinterests. Students work in a variety ofprogramming and production posi-tions for institutions, such as 1. American Museum of Natural History/Margaret Mead Film andVideo FestivalProgram and Requirements96 CULTURE AND MEDIA2. National Museum of the American Indian, Film and Video Center 3. The Asia Society4. The Jewish Museum RESOURCES The Department of Anthropology has a film and multisystem video theatrethat seats up to 40 and has an excellentcollection of over 600 ethnographicfilm and video works. The Departmentof Cinema Studies has a collection ofover 1,000 films. New YorkUniversity's Avery Fisher Music andMedia Center has over 2,000 documen-taries available to students in its videolibrary facility. In addition, some of thebest film, video, and broadcast librariesare available in New York City, includ-ing the Donnell Film Library, Museumof Modern Art Film Library, andNational Museum of the AmericanIndian Film and Video Archive. CENTER FOR MEDIA, CULTURE, AND HISTORY The program works closely with the Center for Media, Culture, andHistory, directed by Professor FayeGinsburg. The Center sponsors fel-lows, screenings, lectures, and confer-ences and integrates concerns of facul-ty and students from the Departmentsof Anthropology, Cinema Studies,History, and Performance Studies aswell as other programs. The Centeraddresses issues of representation,social change, and identity construc-tion embedded in the development of film, television, video, and new mediaworldwide.

This course offers a critical revision of the history of the genre of ethnograph-ic film, the central debates it hasengaged around cross-cultural repre-sentation, and the theoretical and cine-matic responses to questions of thescreen representation of culture, fromthe early romantic constructions ofRobert Flaherty to current work infilm, television, and video on the partof indigenous people throughout theworld. Ethnographic film has a pecu-liar and highly contested status withinanthropology, cinema studies, and doc-umentary practice. This seminar situ-ates ethnographic film within thewider project of the representation ofcultural lives, and especially of\"natives.\" Starting with what areregarded as the first examples of thegenre, the course examines how theseemerged in a particular intellectual context and political economy. It thenconsiders the key works that havedefined the genre and the epistemo-logical and formal innovations associ-ated with them, addressing questionsconcerning social theory, documentary,as well as the institutional structuresthrough which they are funded, dis-tributed, and seen by various audi-ences. Throughout, the course keeps inmind the properties of film as a signi-fying practice, its status as a form ofknowledge, and the ethical and politi-cal concerns raised by cross-culturalrepresentation. Culture and Media II: Ethnography of Media G14.1216 Ginsburg, Himpele, McLagan. 4 points. In the last decade, a new field\u2014the ethnography of media\u2014has emergedas an exciting new arena of research.While claims about media in people'slives are made on a daily basis, surpris- ingly little research has actuallyattempted to look at how media ispart of the naturally occurring livedrealities of people's lives. In the lastdecade, anthropologists and mediascholars interested in film, television,and video have been turning theirattention increasingly beyond the textand empiricist notions of audiences toconsider, ethnographically, the com-plex social worlds in which media isproduced, circulated, and consumed,at home and elsewhere. This work the-orizes media studies from the point ofview of cross-cultural ethnographicrealities and anthropology from theperspective of new spaces of communi-cation focusing on the social, econom-ic, and political life of media and howit makes a difference in the daily livesof people as a practice, whether in pro-duction, reception, or circulation. Courses CULTURE AND MEDIA 97Cultural Theory and the Documentary H72.2001 Miller. 4points. Advanced seminar that considers anthropological, historical, gender, sci-ence, sociological, and cultural studiestheory in the light of a range of docu-mentary genres: counter-colonial,direct cinema, ethnographic, instruc-tional, historical, and auteurist. Television: History and Culture H72.1026 McCarthy. 4 points. Examines the background, context, and history of radio, television, video,and sound. Topics include politics andeconomics of media institutions; audi-ences and reception; cultural andbroadcast policy; aesthetic modes andmovements. Social Anthropology Theory and Practice G14.1010 Myers. 4 points. This course is intended to acquaint graduate students in anthropologywith some core issues in social/culturalanthropology. It cannot pretend to bea comprehensive introduction to thediscipline; matters are too complex.Instead it seeks to highlight basicissues in social theory and the relation-ship of theory and ethnographic prac-tice. It proceeds through a considera-tion of key controversies within thefield and through mapping some con-temporary directions. Although thecourse covers material from the 19ththrough the 20th centuries, it is not ahistory of anthropological thought; students are expected to complementthis course with History ofAnthropology (G14.1636) and a life-time of reading in anthropology andrelated fields. The Language of Sight and Sound H72.1998 Taught by Tisch School of the Arts faculty. 8 points. Intensive six-week hands-on summer production course (early June to mid-July) in practical 16 mm filmmaking.Students are required to complete fiveshort films using equipment andmaterials provided. Emphasis is ini-tially on documentary techniques,which rely on editing for meaning.Students then move on to the scriptednarrative. The goal is to develop tech-nical skills while exploring creativepossibilities. Early application isencouraged, as this is a limited-enroll-ment workshop. Video Production Seminar I, II G14.1218, 1219 Open only to students in the Program in Culture and Media.Limited to 10 students. Prerequisites:G14.1215, H72.1998, and permission ofthe instructor. Ginsburg, Himpele,McLagan. 4 points per term. Yearlong seminar in ethnographic doc- umentary video production using state-of-the-art digital video equipment forstudents in the Program in Cultureand Media. The first portion of thecourse is dedicated to instruction, exer-cises, and reading, familiarizing stu- dents with fundamentals of video pro-duction and their application to abroad conception of ethnographic anddocumentary approaches. Assignmentsundertaken in the fall raise representa-tional, methodological, and ethicalissues in approaching and workingthrough an ethnographic and docu-mentary project. Students develop atopic and field site for their projectearly in the fall term, begin theirshooting, and complete a short (5- to10-minute) edited tape by the end ofthis semester. This work shoulddemonstrate competence in shootingand editing using digital camera/audioand Final Cut Pro nonlinear editingsystems. Students devote the springsemester to intensive work on the proj-ect, continuing to shoot and edit, pre-senting work to the class and complet-ing their (approximately 20-minute)ethnographic documentaries. Studentwork is presented and critiqued duringclass sessions, and attendance and par-ticipation in group critiques and labsessions is mandatory. Students shouldcome into the class with project ideasalready well-developed. Students whohave not completed the work assignedin the first semester are not allowed toregister for the second semester. Thereis no lab fee, but students are expectedto provide their own videotapes. Inaddition to class time, there are regulartechnical lab sessions on the use ofequipment.CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Mark Gertler DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES, M.A.: Clinical Associate Professor David A. Harper DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES, PH.D.: Professor Debraj Ray he Department of Economics has aninternational rep-utation for the quality of its faculty and educa-tion. The department's Ph.D.program trains students to con-duct research in the major fieldsof economics, especially eco-nomic theory (including gametheory), macroeconomics, inter- national economics, labor eco-nomics, development economics,industrial organization, and Aus-trian economics. Graduates ofthe Ph.D. program are preparedfor research careers in universi-ties, government, and business. The M.A. program is more applied. It is one of the very fewstand-alone master's programsoffered by a top-ten economicsdepartment. It is specially tai-lored to meet the needs of pro-fessional economists,government officials, and eco-nomic consultants. An increas-ing number of M.A. students arealso using the M.A. degree as groundwork for pursuing gradu-ate programs elsewhere in theUnited States. The M.A. pro-gram may be taken on a full-time or part-time basis. TheM.A. program also offers concen-trations in international econom-ics and development economics. The C. V . Starr Center for Applied Economics providessupport for the research activitiesof the department. The Centerorganizes conferences, publisheselectronic working papers, pro-vides faculty with computer sup-port and research assistance, andhosts visiting academics. 269 MERCER STREET, 7TH FLOOR NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687 212-998-8900 WEB SITE: www.nyu.edu/econ time economet- rics; empirical Professor.

Admission: Admission to graduate studies in economics is limited to stu-dents of outstanding promise. Allapplicants must take the general testof the Graduate Record Examination(GRE), administered by theEducational Testing Service,Princeton, NJ 08540. All internation-al students must take the Test ofEnglish as a Foreign Language(TOEFL). Exceptions to this ruleinclude students who attendedEnglish-speaking college-level institu-tions. Students from English-speakingcountries, such as the UnitedKingdom or Ireland, are also exemptfrom taking the TOEFL. The M.A. program is designed to accommodate both full-time and part-time students. The Ph.D. program isdesigned for full-time students only.Applicants for the M.A. programshould have mastered intermediatemicroeconomics, intermediate macro-economics, at least one semester of cal-culus, and a course in statistics\u2014allwith a grade of B+ or better. Theymust also obtain GRE quantitativeand analytical scores in the 75th per-centile and above (e.g., over 700) andhave GRE verbal scores in the 50thpercentile and above (e.g., over 500).GMAT scores will be accepted in lieuof the GRE. International studentsshould aim for TOEFL scores above270. Successful applicants may also berequired to take a diagnostic languageevaluation test at the AmericanLanguage Institute at NYU and addi-tional English language courses tai-lored to the needs of graduate stu-dents. Applicants should have a gradepoint average of at least 3.25 in theirundergraduate work. For studentsapplying to the Ph.D. program, theM.A. requirements should be supple-mented by at least one additionalsemester of calculus and one course inlinear algebra. In evaluating applicantsfor either of the above programs,members of the departmental admis-sions committee consider the follow-ing criteria: previous academic per-formance, quantitative GRE scores,letters of recommendation, personalstatement, and economics as well asmathematics backgrounds. Because of the diverse nature of such information,the admissions committee does notadhere to strictly defined cutoff pointson grade point averages or GREscores. All incoming Ph.D. students are guaranteed financial aid, renewable forfour years, conditioned on satisfactoryacademic performance. Financial sup-port includes certain obligations toprovide teaching assistance and may beconditioned on the presence or absenceof outside funding. There is no fund-ing for M.A. students. It is important to note that students who want to enter the Ph.D. programshould notstart off with the M.A. pro- gram. The Ph.D. and M.A. programsare separate and distinct; entry intothe M.A. program does notguarantee entry into the Ph.D. program. MASTER OF ARTS A master's degree in economics is anincreasingly essential degree in a glob-al economy. The M.A. program in eco-nomics at New York University com-bines analytical rigor with an appliedfocus. It provides students with a solidbackground in advanced economics fora career in business and government.It enables students to upgrade theirtechnical skills in applied economicand statistical analysis. It is also anexcellent preparatory degree for gradu-ate programs (e.g., Ph.D. in econom-ics, law degree) elsewhere in theUnited States. Graduates have been employed at Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg, Citicorp,and Credit Suisse. Other graduateshave been admitted to Ph.D. programsin economics (e.g., Boston University),law schools (e.g., ColumbiaUniversity), and public policy schools(e.g., Syracuse University). The M.A. degree in economics requires a minimum of three semestersof full-time study. The time limit forcompletion of the degree is five yearsfor both full- and part-time students. Course of Study: Formal require- ments for the Master of Arts degree ineconomics are the satisfactory comple-tion of graduate studies totaling atleast 32 points and the writing of a special project report. In order tograduate, students must complete atleast 24 points within the Departmentof Economics at New York University(i.e., courses with a G31 prefix).(Transfer credits do not count towardthis requirement.) Most courses carry3 points; the special project carries 2points. Students must have a cumula-tive GPA of at least 3.0 (B) with 18points of B (3.0) or better. Studentsmay take 8 points outside theDepartment of Economics. The M.A. degree requires five core courses, five elective courses, and aspecial project in economic research. The five core courses are Mathematics for Economists (G31.1001),Microeconomic Theory (G31.1003),Macroeconomic Theory I (G31.1005),Applied Statistics and Econometrics I(G31.1101), and Applied Statistics andEconometrics II (G31.1102). Special Project in Economic Research (G31.3200) is taken in thefinal or penultimate semester. The aimof the course is to integrate materialand tools that have been taughtthroughout the M.A. program inaddressing applied economic and poli-cy problems. Students are encouragedto approach research questions fromoutside a narrow specialization and toconsider linkages between differentfields. Elective courses are selected from the department's regular course offer-ings. Students may also select relevantcourses at the NYU Leonard N. SternSchool of Business. This strategy isdesigned to give students a well-rounded education that will be usefulafter graduation in the nonacademicworld. In addition to regular coursesin economics, students take courses infinance, accounting, internationalbusiness and operations research atStern. Highly qualified M.A. studentspreparing for a Ph.D. program mayalso take courses in the graduate divi-sion of the Department of Mathematicsat the Courant Institute ofMathematical Sciences, which offersbalanced training in mathematics andits applications in the broadest sense. Programs and RequirementsECONOMICS 101MASTER OF ARTS AND ADVANCED CERTIFICATEPROGRAM IN APPLIED ECONOMIC ANALYSIS The department offers specialized pro- grams in economic development andinternational economics. Participatingstudents must take the required corecourses (listed above) and complete theM.A. special project report. Afterreceiving the M.A. degree, studentsmay continue their studies to earn anadvanced certificate with the opportuni-ty to focus on one of the following areasof study. (The advanced certificateoption is also available to qualified mas-ter's-level students holding degrees frominstitutions other than New YorkUniversity.) A minimum of six special-ized courses is required. When certainrequired courses are not offered, thedepartment may substitute other appro-priate courses to satisfy the require-ments for the advanced certificate. Economic Development : This area of study is designed for those concernedwith economic study of developmentpolicies in the less developed coun-tries. It is geared to those planningcareers with governments of develop-ing countries, the United Nations andother international institutions, U.S.government agencies concerned withdevelopment and foreign assistance,and corporations doing business in theless developed countries as well asother private organizations. Requirements include the core courses; G31.1603; where appropriate,G31.3001, 3002; additional electivepoints to complete 32 points; and aspecial project report.

A total of 41 pointsat minimum is required for the M.A.and the advanced certificate. International Economics: The objec- tive of the international economicsarea of study is to train economists tofunction effectively in internationalorganizations such as the UnitedNations and its related agencies,regional economic groups such as theEuropean Union or the LatinAmerican Free Trade Association,national government bodies such ascentral banks and trade ministries, andcompanies in the private sector. Requirements include the core courses; G31.1505; G31.1506;G31.1402; and, where appropriate, G31.3001, 3002. A total of 32 pointsand a special project report completethe requirements for the M.A. For the advanced certificate, three additional courses must be selectedfrom G31.1603; where appropriate,G31.3001, 3002; andInternational Financial Management(B40.3388). A total of 41 points atminimum is required for the M.A. andthe advanced certificate. Note: Courses designated by num- bers beginning with the letter B areoffered by the Leonard N. Stern Schoolof Business. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy is a researchdegree. It signifies that the recipient isable to conduct independent researchand has both a broad basic knowledgeof all areas of economics and a compre-hensive knowledge of one area in par-ticular. To qualify for the doctorate, astudent must satisfactorily completegraduate studies totaling at least 72points (at least 64 in residence at NewYork University), pass three Ph.D. comprehensive examinations (in micro-economics, macroeconomics, and onearea of specialization), write and pres-ent a third-year paper and, finally,defend an acceptable dissertation.Fields of specialization include eco-nomic theory (including game theory),monetary theory and macroeconomics,political economy, econometrics, indus-trial organization, international eco-nomics, labor economics, developmenteconomics, and Austrian economics. After passing all three Ph.D. com- prehensive examinations and havingcompleted 72 points of graduate work,a student is asked to submit a formaldissertation proposal. This serves asthe basis for a preliminary oral exami-nation. When the dissertation is com-pleted and approved by three facultymembers, a public oral examination isheld, at which research results are pre-sented and defended by the candidatebefore a faculty committee. Reading proficiency in a foreign language is required, demonstrated byany of the methods described in theDegree Requirements section of this bulletin. Course requirements include Mathematics for Economists I(G31.1021) and II (G31.1022);Microeconomic Theory I (G31.1023)and II (G31.1024); Macroeconomic Theory I least two 3000-level courses (advancedcourses, seminar/workshops).

V . StarrCenter for Applied Economics.Students have the opportunity to asso-ciate with the Center's prominent visi-tors and distinguished research scholars. PURPOSE The C. V . Starr Center for AppliedEconomics is the research branch ofthe Department of Economics at NewYork University. The Center seeks to bridge the gap between academicresearch and economic decisions inboth business and government. TheCenter analyzes issues of importanteconomic and social consequences to improve tomorrow's economic deci-sions. These goals are pursued by theCenter in three ways: analysis of cur-rent economic issues, design of tools tofacilitate economic decision making inthe future, and wide dissemination ofresearch results through publications,seminars, and conferences. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES The research activities of the Centerare organized into two categories:short-term projects and long-termprojects. Short-term projects are major research projects that seek to completea specific piece of applied economicresearch in a period not exceeding 12months. Long-term projects are major research endeavors focusing on topicsof such fundamental intellectualimportance that one can expect theproject will be continued past the ter- mination of the Center's funding.These projects typically involve atleast two members of the Center/Department of Economics at NewYork University. VISITORS PROGRAM Since its inception, the Center has funded a vigorous visitors program forleading academics from both theUnited States and abroad. These visi-tors have immersed themselves inmany Center research activities,including seminar presentations,working paper publications, andresearch collaborations. Because of theCenter's close affiliation with theDepartment of Economics, graduatestudents have the opportunity toexchange ideas with these distin-guished visitors.ECONOMICS 103Economic Analysis of Law G31.2047 3points.

Schain ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER: Professor Jan Tomasz Gross he Center for European Studies(CES) supportsand promotes the study of contemporary Europe,both West and East, within theCollege and the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science and betweenthe latter and the professionalschools of the University. Itcomplements existing Europeanprograms in both the humanitiesand the social sciences, such asthe Institute of French Studies,the program in Italian studiescoordinated by the Casa ItalianaZerilli-Marim\u00f2, and the Alexan-der S. Onassis Program in Hel-lenic Studies, by offering coursesand lectures on other majorWestern European societies and cultures as well as on Centraland Eastern Europe. It also offerscourses, research opportunities,and noncurricular lectures and seminars on the European Com-munity and on European issuesthat transcend national borders.Normally the Center does notoffer courses in subjects that arecovered by other departments.The Center offers an undergrad-uate major and minor in Euro-pean studies as well as a Masterof Arts program. The programs, activities, and funding opportunities offered bythe Center and listed below arepartly supported by funds fromthe U.S. Department of Educa-tion, which in 1991 designatedthe Center, along with Europeancenters at Columbia Universityand New School University, as aNational Resource Center forWestern Europe, which adminis- ters the Foreign Language andArea Studies (FLAS) FellowshipProgram. The three units oper-ate together as the New YorkConsortium for European Stud-ies in outreach efforts towardother schools and colleges in theregion, research planning, andthe sharing of visiting lecturers. In 2001, the Center for Euro-pean Studies, together with NewSchool University and City Uni-versity of New York, was redes-ignated one of 15 Centers ofExcellence for the Study of theEuropean Union in the UnitedStates. The Center was also awarded two additional grants from theFund for the Improvement ofPostsecondary Education (FIPSE)to fund two projects that providegraduate training to studentsinterested in comparing theEuropean Union and the UnitedStates as federal systems and tothose interested in issues oftransnationalism, internationalmigration, race, ethnocentrism,and the state. The Center represents the University in the Council forEuropean Studies, a nationalassociation of European pro-grams, and in expanding rela-tions with similar programs inEuropean universities. 58 WEST 10TH STREET NEW YORK, NY 10011-8702 212-998-3838 FAX: 212-995-4188 TPrograms and RequirementsMASTER OF ARTS The Master of Arts program in European studies is an interdisciplinaryprogram in the social sciences andhumanities designed to prepare stu-dents for professions requiring anadvanced understanding of Europe.The program draws upon the estab-lished resources of existing countryprograms in French studies, Italianstudies, and Hellenic studies, as well asthe disciplinary programs, and alsooffers courses of its own. M.A. studentschoose one of three tracks for special-ization: European politics and societyor humanities, cultural trends inWestern and/or East Central Europe, and European Union studies. Specialprograms of study are also possible. Ten courses (40 points) as well as a thesis and an oral examination arerequired for the M.A. degree.Knowledge of a European language(other than English) at the advancedlevel is also required. Students canprove this advanced knowledge eitherby having completed during theirundergraduate studies an advanced-level language course or by passing theGSAS language requirement examina-tion prior to graduation. Knowledgeof a second European language is alsoencouraged. An internship approvedby the M.A. adviser is recommended. Of the 10 courses, two (one in his- tory, the other a seminar in Europeanstudies) are required, and two othersmust be chosen from the program'score courses in either the social sci-ences or the humanities, depending onwhich of the two tracks the studentchooses for specialization. Five addi-tional courses are taken in the chosentrack. An internship (4 points/onecourse), arranged and approved by theCenter, is accepted as the final course.Students may take a research seminarin lieu of an internship, with theapproval of the Center. The M.A. the-sis, normally the revised version of aresearch paper completed in the field,is defended at an oral examination.STUDY ABROAD Candidates for the M.A. degree inEuropean studies are encouraged tospend one semester abroad. TIRES Consortium: The Center for European Studies at NYU, as part ofthe TIRES (Transnationalism,International migration, Race,Ethnocentrism and the State) consor-tium, representing eight U.S. andEuropean universities, received athree-year grant from the Fund for theImprovement of PostsecondaryEducation (FIPSE, U.S. Department ofEducation) for a program to promotecollaborative teaching and research onissues related to TIRES. The consortium's focus is on train- ing students to understand the dynam-ics of state policies' on refugees andimmigrants, especially with regard tohow these are evolving under theimpact of increasing transnationalintegration and popular reactionsagainst expanded immigration. Thesereactions have sometimes taken theform of extreme xenophobic or nativistsocial movements. NYU students may take courses at the Europa-Universit\u00e4t Viadrina in CES/NYU offers students asecond study abroad opportunity. Aspart of the Comparative FederalismConsortium (COMFED), the Centerfor European Studies offers a programthat promotes collaborative teachingand research on issues related to thecomparison of the United States andthe European Union as political, eco-nomic, and legal systems. The under-lying objectives of the project are toenhance scientific knowledge of thefield of comparative EU-U.S. studies,to educate a new generation of futureacademic and policy leaders in boththe United States and the EuropeanUnion about the similarities and dif-ferences between the two systems, andto promote better understanding between the two sides. NYU students may take courses at the University of Birmingham, UnitedKingdom; the WORKSHOPS AND EVENTS Research Workshops: These ongoing study groups are made up of facultyand graduate students, principallyfrom New York University and NewSchool University, and aim to helprefine and design research projects,both individual and collective.Application for membership in anyone academic year may be made to theworkshop directors noted below. Currently the organized workshops are as follows: European Culture andArts (Dorothy Nelkin, Sociology; VeraZolberg, New School Transaction andCentral Gross, Politics;Andrew Arato, New SchoolUniversity); European Security Politics(Dick SUNY Stony Brook);Marxist Theory Workshop (BertellOllman, Politics). Faculty Colloquia: Two series of pub- lic lectures are organized by theCenter, primarily to bring specialistsfrom Europe and from other Americanuniversities to the NYU community.The Colloquium on East EuropeanPolitics and Society provides a forumfor comparative discussion of the polit-ical, economic, and social transitionsoccurring in the region and the con-tinuing evolution of governmentsthere. 126 EUROPEAN STUDIESDiverging patterns of U.S. and EUpriorities for economic developmentand international trade.

Admission: In addition to the require- ments for admission to the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science (see theAdmission section of this bulletin), candi- dates for the Institute of Fine Arts musthave a good background in the liberalarts, normally including at least fourcourses of undergraduate art history. TheGraduate Record Examination isrequired of all applicants. The examina-tion must be taken sufficiently inadvance to ensure that the scores appearon the application when reviewed. (SeeSpecial Programs, below, for additional requirements for admission to the con-servation program.) Applicants arerequired to make up deficiencies in theirpreliminary preparation. As part of the admission procedure, applicants with a master's degree arerequested to provide a copy of theirthesis or another research paper to beread by a faculty member in the appro-priate field. For further admission information, consult the Academic Office, Instituteof Fine Arts, 1 East 78th Street, NewYork, 5800; E-mail: ifa.program@nyu.edu. Also the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid. Registration: Fall, spring, and limited summer registration takes place byappointment made through theAcademic Office. Students from otherNew York University programs mustconsult the Academic Office before regis-tering for a course at the Institute. (Seethe calendar in the Announcement of Courses for details on the registration periods.) Visiting Students: A matriculated stu- dent in another university's graduate arthistory program may register for coursesat the Institute by applying for visitingstudent status through the GraduateEnrollment Services office of theGraduate School of Arts and Science. Advisement: Each student in the first semester is assigned a member of thefaculty as the adviser with whom he or she plans a program and consultsregularly. Minimum Program: During the first two years of study, each student regis-ters for a minimum of two courseseach semester. Exceptions are madeonly for urgent reasons and must havethe approval of the director of gradu-ate studies. The conservation trainingprogram must be followed on a full-time basis only. MASTER OF ARTS Languages: A reading knowledge of both French and German must bedemonstrated by passing written testsgiven by the Institute in the fall, winter,and spring. (See Academic Calendar for exact dates.) Students sign up for theexaminations in the Academic Office atthe Institute. One test must be taken atthe start of the first semester of study atthe Institute; a failure in it must bemade up the following semester. Theother examination must be taken nolater than the beginning of the secondyear and a failure made up the followingsemester. Application to the faculty isrequired in order to take either languageexamination a third time. Those students who fail the German examination are required to follow aplan of study approved by the faculty. Alist of approved courses and tutors maybe obtained from the Academic Office.The Institute offers a course in Germanreading comprehension. The course,taught by Deutsches Haus staff, meetsfor two hours twice a week. There is anominal charge. Students who wish tofollow a plan of study not alreadyapproved by the faculty must submitthe plan to the faculty in writing. A student entering with an M.A. degree from another institution mustsatisfy the language requirementswithin the first year of study and priorto the Ph.D. candidacy interview.Students with a foreign baccalaureatemay petition for the substitution of their native language for either Frenchor German on the M.A. level only.Before applying to matriculate for thePh.D. program, international studentsmust pass tests in both French andGerman. Students in the East Asianart program may petition to substituteproficiency in Chinese or Japanese forone of the required languages. First-Term Paper: During the first term, all students are required to sub-mit a written paper, the topic chosenin consultation with an Institute facul-ty member. In the case of studentsholding an M.A. degree obtained else-where, a thesis or paper written inconjunction with his or her work forthe M.A. degree may be submitted asthe first-term paper. Timi ng: Completing the requirements for the M.A. degree should not exceedtwo years. Students in the conservationprogram normally complete the M.A.degree requirements in five semesters. Academic Standards: Each student's record is subject to review after thecompletion of the first semester andfirst year of study. A student mustachieve a B+ or better average. Failureto do so results in automatic proba-tionary status. A student on probationis expected to attain a B+ averagewithin one semester. Distribution of Course Points: A total of 36 points (nine courses) isrequired for the M.A. degree. Of these,8 points must be in two classroomseminars in different major areas asdefined below. Of the 36 points takenin lecture courses, seminars, colloquia,and reading courses for independentstudy, at least one course must betaken in four of the six followingmajor areas: (1) East Asia, India, andIslam; (2) ancient Near East, Egyptian,Greek, and Roman; (3) Early Christian,Byzantine, and Western medieval artto 1400; (4) Western art, 1400 to Programs and Requirements132 FINE ARTS1780; (5) Western art, 1780 to the present; and (6) arts of Africa, Oceania,and the Americas. In addition, onecourse must be taken in the conserva-tion of works of art. Students planning to specialize in East Asian art may, with the writtenapproval of their advisers, take two ofthe distribution requirement courseslisted under (1) above. Two Qualifying Papers for the Master's Degree: One qualifying paper is required in each of two differ-ent major areas, as defined above. Eachpaper is written under the direction ofa different instructor. The papers mustbe in publishable form. Topics may bedeveloped from seminar reports, fromthe first-term paper, in connectionwith a lecture course, or independentlyin consultation with a faculty member.For students enrolled in the conserva-tion training program, one qualifyingterm paper may be supervised by amember of the conservation faculty. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Qualifying as a Matriculant for thePh.D. Degree: The applicant must have fulfilled all requirements for theM.A. degree in art history and be spon-sored by a faculty member. A studententering the Institute with a master'sdegree must complete all M.A. degreerequirements of the Institute of FineArts (or provide evidence of equivalentwork) within one academic year.During this probationary period, thestudent must also find a faculty spon-sor. Students may be requested to showa reading knowledge of languages nec-essary for their special fields of study. Students completing the master's degree at the Institute may take up to8 points of additional course workbefore acceptance into the Ph.D. pro-gram. These courses are taken entirelyat the student's risk and must beapproved by the director of graduatestudies and the student's adviser. Candidacy Interview and Faculty Review: Acceptance into the Ph.D program is determined by (1) an inter-view with a three-member faculty com-mittee at the time the student com-pletes all Institute of Fine Arts require-ments for the M.A. degree and (2) anall-faculty review of the student's recordand the results of the interview. Timing: The interview must be held before the end of the first term aftercompleting the requirements for theM.A. degree, except in the case of stu-dents holding an M.A. degreeobtained elsewhere, who must sched-ule the interview no later than the endof their second term of residence. Reviews by the full faculty are sched-uled in September, January, and Mayof each year. (See the calendar in theAnnouncement of Courses for dates.) Sponsorship: Application for the inter- view must be sponsored by a regularmember of the Institute faculty.Institute lecturers associated part-timewith the Institute may serve as cospon-sors only if a regular faculty memberhas first agreed to serve as sponsor.Advisers from other institutions canserve as dissertation advisers onlythrough prior arrangement between aregular faculty member and the studentand with the permission of the directorof graduate studies. Character of the Interview: The inter- view is administered by a committee ofthe faculty and is oral. The student dis-cusses his or her proposed program ofstudy, i.e., choice of major and minorconcentrations and possibly the subjector area he or she expects to treat in thedissertation. The committee, in review-ing the student's record, assesses his orher basic knowledge of the history of artas well as intellectual qualifications andunderstanding of the areas in which thestudent plans to work. A major factor indetermining the student's eligibility formatriculation for the Ph.D. degree isthe evaluation of the student's proposedprogram in relation to the quality of hisor her previous qualifying papers, semi-nar reports, and course work. For those entering with an M.A. degree, admission to the Institute doesnot imply acceptance of all graduatecourses taken prior to enrollment at theInstitute. If transfer of such courses isdesired, the candidate must petition thefaculty for approval immediately follow-ing acceptance into the doctoral program. Distribution of Course Points: A total of 72 points is required for thePh.D. degree, including the 36 requiredfor the M.A. degree. At least 24 points(or 16 beyond the M.A. degree) must bein classroom seminars, 8 of these outsidethe student's major area of study. Of thetotal 72 points, 8 may be taken as theinternship in curatorial studies. With the prior written consent of the director of graduate studies and aninstructor, one or more Special Problemscourses may be taken individually with afaculty member in lieu of lecture coursesor, in exceptional cases, of a seminar. Students specializing in East Asian, ancient Near Eastern, Egyptian, andIslamic art may be allowed up to 16points for undergraduate languagestudy in their field; 8 of these may betaken for the M.A. degree. Final Examination in Major and Minor Concentrations: Students matriculated for the Ph.D. degree arerequired to pass the final examinationin one major and two minor concen-trations. A candidate may not take thefinal examination, or any part thereof,more than twice. Timing: A student may take the oral and written portions of the examinationin the major and related minor concen-trations in the term in which therequired classroom courses are complet-ed, but no later than the followingterm. Note that the final examinationis not completed until the unrelatedminor portion is also satisfied. Character of the Examination: There are three components to the final examina-tion: an oral session on the major andrelated minor, a two-week written paperon questions designed for the individualstudent immediately after the oral por-tion, and a written examination in theunrelated minor. Students may requestexemption from the examination in theunrelated minor if they have completedthree courses (including a seminar)within the respective concentration withan average of B+ or better. Major and Minor Concentrations: Each field listed constitutes a minor concen-tration. Normally two contiguous fieldsconstitute a major concentration. Anadditional concentration, the relatedminor, must be directly related to themajor, while a second concentration, theunrelated minor, should be distinctlyremoved from the major. A relatedminor outside the history of art isencouraged, and, in the special areas ofstudy of East Asian art and archaeology,classical art and archaeology, and NearEastern art and archaeology, it isrequired. The minor fields from which astudent selects the major and minorconcentrations for examination are (1) prehistoric and protohistoric art ofthe Old World; (2) African and Oceanicart; (3) pre-Columbian art; (4) earlyChinese art through the Han Dynasty;(5) Chinese art from the Northern andSouthern Dynasties to the YuanDynasty; (6) later Chinese art, MingDynasty to the present; (7) Chinese pic-torial art; (8) Japanese art, ca. 600-1300; (9) Japanese art, ca. 1300 to thepresent; (10) Buddhist art; (11) Indianart (non-Muslim); (12) of Eastern art; (15) Aegean art; (16) Greek art; (17) Roman art; (18) early Christian through Carolingianart; (19) Byzantine art; (20) Islamic artto the Mongol conquest, 690-1250; (21) Islamic art after the Mongol con-quest, 1250-1800; (22) Romanesque art;FINE ARTS 133(23) Gothic art; (24) from 1300 to1500; (25) Italian art of the16th century; (26) art outside Italy from1400 to 1600; (27) art in Italy, France,and Spain from about 1580 to the endof the 17th century; (28) art of theNetherlands, Germany, and Englandfrom about 1580 to the end of the 17thcentury; (29) European (includingEnglish) and American art from 1660 to1780; (30) European (includingEnglish) and American art from 1780 tothe end of the 19th century; (31) art ofthe 20th century; (32) Latin Americanart; (33) conservation and technology, inrelation to a field or fields designatedabove, upon petition to the faculty. Dissertation Proposal: A dissertation proposal must be approved by theentire faculty, usually prior to the majororal examination. A Special Problemscourse may be taken with the adviser inpreparation of the proposal. The pro-posal consists of a statement describingthe project and current research (1,000words maximum), a chapter outline(one page), a short bibliography, and, ifappropriate, a single image. Twentycopies of the proposal, approved andsigned by the Institute faculty sponsor,should be provided to the AcademicOffice for distribution to the faculty. Ifthe topic should change substantially inthe process of research, it may be neces-sary to submit a new proposal. Dissertation: The dissertation is nor- mally no longer than 250 pages of text.Permission to exceed this limit can begranted only through petition to thefaculty. It is expected that the complet-ed dissertation will be submitted with-in four years of the completion of themajor oral examination. In addition tothe copy of the dissertation required bythe Graduate School of Arts andScience, candidates are required to filea second copy with the Institute ofFine Arts. Further information may beobtained from the Academic Office. Final Oral Defense of the Dissertation: Each candidate in the Institute of Fine Arts submits to a finaloral defense of the dissertation before acommittee of five scholars, three ofwhom are members of the GSAS facul-ty. Scholars who are not members ofthe Institute may be invited to consid-er the dissertation and take part in theproceedings. SPECIAL AREAS OF STUDY Special areas of study follow the nor-mal requirements for the Ph.D. degreein fine arts and should include themodifications outlined below. Studentsmust consult their advisers before reg-istering for any courses given outside the Institute. Students interested inany of the areas listed below shouldconsult the appropriate adviser. Classical Art and Archaeology: Students wishing to earn the Ph.D.degree with a specialization in classicalart and archaeology may do so eitherbased on art historical and archaeologicalcourse work or by way of interdepart-mental studies, i.e., with courses takenin classics, ancient history, and classicalart and archaeology. A faculty committeedecides on this course of study in accor-dance with the applicant's educationalbackground and special interests. Combined Studies in Near Eastern Art and Archaeology: This area of study for students working toward thePh.D. degree in fine arts includes thefollowing combinations: Byzantine/earlyIslamic; early Christian/early Islamic. The curriculum for each combined area of study includes at least 40 pointsin classroom art history courses and atleast 16 but no more than 32 points inthe languages and civilizations of thecombined area of study (of these, up to16 points may be allowed for under-graduate Near Eastern language study).Students should decide where theirprincipal interest lies within the com-bined area of study and then study theappropriate language or languages. Atleast 16 but no more than 20 pointsmay be in the history of postclassicalWestern art. The total of these courses must be 72 points. East and South Asian Art: Students working toward the Ph.D. degree in finearts with a specialization in this areashould take at least 48 points in class-room art history courses; they may takeup to 20 points in Special Problemscourses (8 points for the M.A. degreeand 12 additional points for the Ph.D.degree) and up to a total of 16 points incredit courses in language and culture(of which up to 12 points may be forundergraduate study in language). Architectural Studies: This area of study offers the possibility for studentsto earn the Ph.D. with a specializationin the history of architecture and urban-ism. The purpose of the program is toprepare students for research, teaching,and curating in this area in academicdepartments, schools of architecture,and museums. Study may includearchaeological work as well as courses given outside the IFA framework in both architectural programs and art his-tory departments where such cross-reg-istration is allowed, such as at ColumbiaUniversity. Certain courses in history,philosophy, and the social sciences mayalso considered relevant to this program.In formulating the areas for which thestudent is responsible in the Ph.D. oralexamination, architecture and urbanismmay be given greater than normalweight. All such decisions regarding thestudent's course of study are determinedby a special faculty committee in accor-dance with the applicant's backgroundand special interests. CURATORIAL STUDIES PROGRAM This program is open only to candi- dates for the Ph.D. degree in the his-tory of art at the Institute. The pro-gram is offered jointly by the Instituteof Fine Arts and the MetropolitanMuseum of Art, under the supervisionof the Joint Committee on CuratorialStudies, which is composed of facultyand curators and includes the directorsof both institutions. The purpose of the program is to prepare students for curatorial careers.Problems of museum education andgeneral administration are not empha-sized. The course of study normallyrequires three and one-half to fouryears, including the master's degree inart history. The Certificate inCuratorial Studies is awarded at thecompletion of all requirements. Requirements: 1. Curatorial Studies I (G43.2037): This colloquium, focusing on the role andresponsibilities of curators in art muse-ums and emphasizing connoisseurshipand research methods, is required foradmission to the program; it is also opento students who do not intend to pursuethe full Curatorial Studies Program. Thecourse meets in the spring term in thegalleries, storerooms, and conservationlaboratories of the MetropolitanMuseum of Art and may be taken at anytime before applying for the curatorialstudies interview (see below). 2. Materials, Media, and Techniques: Technical Considerations for the Art Historian (G43.2539): A colloquiumdesigned to acquaint art historianswith the nature and use of materials inart and archaeology. Other courses inconservation open to art historiansmay be substituted with the approvalof the program director. 3. M.A. degree in art history: All requirements for the Institute's rigor-134 FINE ARTSous master's degree must be completed as the foundation of the program. Seethe Admission paragraph and Master of Arts section for a description of the admission and degree criteria. 4. Ph.D. candidacy interview: Whether or not the student intends to pursuethe doctorate as well as the curatorialstudies certificate, he or she must beaccepted by the faculty as being capa-ble of doing Ph.D. work throughacceptance into the Ph.D. program. Seethe Doctor of Philosophy section for a description of the necessary qualifica-tions and the candidacy review process. 5. Curatorial studies interview: Students interested in pursuing thecuratorial studies certificate must beaccepted into the program by the JointCommittee on Curatorial Studies.Interviews are scheduled at the begin-ning of each academic year. Studentsare asked to discuss their long-termcareer goals, areas of special interest,and their preparation to date, includ-ing academic work and a demonstratedinterest in curatorial issues. Normallythe interview is held after the require-ments listed above have been met andbefore Curatorial Studies II is taken. 6. Curatorial Studies II (G43.2537): A colloquium, conducted by a full-timecurator from the Metropolitan Museumof Art, with additional lectures by con-servation and visiting outside special-ists, as appropriate, introduces studentsto curatorial responsibilities throughhands-on involvement with originalworks of art in the context of an actualexhibition or cataloging project at themuseum. The topic and the supervis-ing curator vary from year to year. Thecourse meets in the fall, and admissionis determined by interview. 7. Six courses beyond the nine required for the master's degree are chosen inrelation to the student's specialty andmay include Curatorial Studies I and II. 8. Curatorial Studies III (G43.3037): Normally a nine-month internship,designed to provide maximum practicalexperience in each student's area of spe-cialization. Completion of CuratorialStudies I and II is a prerequisite, andusually the internship is elected aftercompletion of all course work. Studentsshould apply to the director of the pro-gram to make internship arrangementsat least six months in advance of thedesired starting date. The internship maybe in a department at the MetropolitanMuseum of Art or at another museum asappropriate to the student's interests. Asubstantive written project is required.Recommendations: Students should seek out courses in art history that con-sider objects in the original and shouldtake full advantage of the opportunityto study and work with Institute facul-ty who are active in museum projects.Relevant work experience is encour-aged. Students are urged to avail them-selves of appropriate courses in conser-vation beyond the required minimum. Financial Assistance: For the intern- ship, fellowships are available on a com-petitive basis up to the level of top dis-sertation grants. Other aid may beawarded on the same basis as for stu-dents in other programs at the samegeneral point of progress in their studies.Applications should be made throughregular Institute of Fine Arts channels. Questions about the Curatorial Studies Program offerings should be directedto the Academic Office at the Instituteof Fine Arts, 212-992-5800. CONSERVATION CENTER The Institute's Conservation Center at14 East 78th Street is dedicated to thestudy of the technology and conservationof works of art and historic artifacts. TheCenter prepares students for careers inconservation through a four-year pro-gram that combines practical experiencein conservation with art historical,archaeological, curatorial, and scientificstudies of the materials and constructionof works of art. Students participate inresearch projects, laboratory work, andseminars in special areas of conservation,such as climatology or the problems ofethnographic and archaeological arti-facts, and gain intensive conservationexperience through advanced fieldworkand an internship. Conservation studentsmay elect to obtain additional conserva-tion experience during summer archaeo-logical excavations or other formal workprojects. The Center provides special courses for students pursuing studies in art his-tory, archaeology, and curatorial studies,which are intended to acquaint themwith the physical structure of works ofart, the need for conservation, and thepossibilities and limitations of conser-vation. These students participate inresearch projects, laboratory work, andcourses dealing with materials, care,repair, and presentation of objects. Admission: Candidates for admission to the conservation training programmust first satisfy the requirements foradmission to the Institute of Fine Artsas candidates for the M.A. degree inthe history of art as described above.In addition, applicants must have aminimum of four semesters of science (two semesters must be in organicchemistry) at the college level withgrades of B or better. Candidates mustalso present evidence of familiaritywith a range of artists' materials asdemonstrated by a portfolio. Candidates for the master's degree in art history at the Institute may applyfor transfer to the conservation trainingprogram after completing the requisitescience and studio preparation. The maximum number of students admitted per year is eight. One or twoself-supported students from abroadmay be accepted each year as specialstudents or observers. Course of Study: A total of 69 points is required for the combined M.A.degree in art history and AdvancedCertificate in Conservation. Six art his-tory courses (24 points) in three majorareas must be taken, including at leasttwo seminars that must be in two dif-ferent areas. Fifteen conservation cours-es (45 points), a noncredit course inmicroscopy, and a noncredit internshipmust also be taken. The student normally registers for two consecutive semesters for the internship,which may be taken in a conservationestablishment, either in this country orabroad, selected to afford the best possi-ble training in the student's area of spe-cialization. Arrangements are made inconsultation with the chair of theConservation Center. All requirements for the M.A. degree offered by the Institute, includ-ing languages, first-term paper, tim-ing, academic standards, and two qual-ifying papers, apply equally to studentsin the conservation training program. The program may be followed only on a full-time basis and is normallycompleted in four years. The first twoand one-half years typically are spentin residence at the ConservationCenter. The program leads to the M.A.degree in the history of art after thefirst five semesters and to theAdvanced Certificate in Conservationupon completion of the program.Those students holding an M.A. degreein the history of art accepted by thedirector of graduate studies may com-plete the program for the AdvancedCertificate in Conservation in threeyears, including the internship. Community Service: As part of a cooperative effort and learning experi-ence, students in their first two yearsof residence at the ConservationCenter are expected to assist facultyand administration in teaching and inmaintaining the laboratories.ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXCAVATIONS At present the Institute conducts three excavations: at the Sanctuary of theGreat Gods at Samothrace; in coopera-tion with the Faculty of Arts andScience, at Aphrodisias in Turkey; and,in cooperation with the University ofPennsylvania and Yale University, atAbydos in Middle Egypt. Advancedstudents are invited to participate inthese excavations and may be support-ed financially by the Institute.

Neither Nomads nor Nationalists: Identity Redefined in RecentFrancophone Writings Dash. 4points.

In manyways, this writing emerges in thewake of the postmodern insistenceon the nontranscendental and theparticular as well as on the absenceof grand narratives for contempo-rary writing.

For texts stemming from the Franco-Algerian nexus, it nowseems appropriate to deemphasizetheir sense of belonging to a com-munity (as in a collective history) infavor of a problematics that givesfull stress to the absence or theaddition of other languages (mostoften oral) in so many novelists,poets, and dramatists. Thus, follow-ing the example of the duoCamus/Kateb, this course studiesDib, Ferraoun, Boudjedra, andBelamri on the but opposed to Senac, Pelegri,and Millecam.

Programs and RequirementsFaculty146 FRENCH STUDIESADVISEMENT The limited enrollment in Institute programs allows close supervision ofstudent progress and careful advise-ment on the choice of courses and thetraining required for various careergoals. Each M.A. student is advised bya member of the Institute faculty,while each doctoral candidate normal-ly has two advisers: one from theInstitute and one from the departmentmost related to the student's disserta-tion field (i.e., anthropology, French,history, politics). THE MASTER'S PROGRAMS Master of Arts Program in French Studies The M.A. program is designed for stu- dents interested in careers in interna-tional business and banking, themedia, government, and culturalorganizations or in teaching Frenchcivilization in secondary schools ortwo-year colleges. The M.A. programoffered by the Institute can also com-plement work done toward a graduatedegree in French language and litera-ture. Full-time students can completethe M.A. degree in one calendar year ifthey attend the Institute's summerprogram in Paris. Those who do notparticipate in the summer programcomplete their M.A. requirements inthree semesters of study at NYU.Part-time students normally take twoyears to meet the course requirements. Course of Study: The program requires successful completion of eightcourses (32 points) and a comprehen-sive examination. The latter coversthree of the four basic fields in Frenchstudies: (1) French history since theAncien R\u00e9gime; (2) French society;and either (3) French politics and theeconomy since 1945 or (4) French cul-ture in society. Of the eight courses, atleast four must be chosen fromInstitute core courses.

In most cases,both approvals will be granted at thetime of acceptance to the IFS, butpartner departments will sometimesdefer approval until the second orthird year of study. (Students applyingfor the Ph.D. degree in French studiesrequire acceptance only by the IFS.)Students initially admitted to an M.A.program who wish to continue on to aPh.D. must formally apply for thePh.D. program of their choice. Only afew such applications will beapproved. Course of Study: The Ph.D. pro- grams all require successful comple-tion of 72 points of course work, awritten and oral qualifying examina-tion, and a doctoral dissertation. Allstudents must first complete therequirements for the master's degree(see M.A. course requirementsdescribed above). Remaining coursework is chosen from Institute offeringsand from courses offered by otherdepartments (mainly anthropology,French, history, or politics) accordingto the kind of doctorate pursued, thearea of specialization, and career inter-ests of the student. Full-time studentsusually take three courses per term andfinish their course requirements inthree years. Most doctoral students spend one or two semesters of their third year inParis, where they take courses at theFrench institutions with which theInstitute has formal exchange agree-ments: the Ecole des Hautes Sociales, the and the Ecole NormaleSup\u00e9rieure. Full New York Universitycourse credit is given for courses suc-cessfully completed in Paris. Withtheir adviser's permission, studentsmay work at other Paris institutions,such as the University of Paris. After returning to New York, Ph.D. candidates who have completed 72points of course work design a disser-tation research project and take the written and oral qualifying examina- tion for the Ph.D. After successfullycompleting this examination andobtaining approval of a dissertationproposal, students generally spend ayear in France (normally their fifthyear of matriculation) conducting dis-sertation research. Sixth-year studentstypically have completed their researchand spend the year writing their dis-sertation. Once the dissertation hasbeen accepted, all Ph.D. candidatesmust defend their work in a final oralexamination. The Ph.D. therefore nor-mally requires six to seven years offull-time study. Ph.D. Program in French Studies The Ph.D. program in French studies provides the student with a broadknowledge of French society and cul-ture as well as a concentration in aspecialized field of interest to bedefined in consultation with facultyadvisers. This program prepares gradu-ates for teaching French studies coursesin French departments. Joint Ph.D. Programs The joint Ph.D. programs in French studies and anthropology, French, his-tory, and politics combine multidisci-plinary approaches to the study of con-temporary France with rigorous disci-plinary training in one of the socialsciences, history, or literature. Jointdegree candidates normally pursueprograms supervised by advisers fromboth the Institute and the disciplinarydepartment concerned. Joint degreesprepare students for teaching in histo-ry or social science departments and/orin the \"civilization \"track of French departments. The joint degree withFrench prepares for teaching in boththe civilization and literature tracks inFrench departments. Students in joint degree programs divide their 72 points of course workevenly between the Institute and thedisciplinary department, with mostInstitute course work being completedprior to receiving the M.A. degree andmost disciplinary work being complet-ed after receiving the M.A. degree.The Ph.D. qualifying examination foreach of the joint programs consists ofsections on French studies, on the dis-cipline in question, and on the inte-gration of the two. Examiners includefaculty from both the Institute and therelevant department. Similarly, thedissertation defense committeeincludes faculty from both units. For more details on the current regulationsfor these joint programs, contact theInstitute of French Studies. THE CERTIFICATE PROGRAM The Institute offers a certificate pro-gram in French civilization designedfor (1) students in other doctoral orprofessional programs having aresearch or career interest relating toFrance; (2) individuals teaching orplanning to teach French in universi-ties, colleges, or secondary schools whodesire intensive training in French civ-ilization to complement their educa-tion in language and literature; and (3) professionals working in business,cultural organizations, government,the media, and other areas requiringexpert knowledge of contemporaryFrench culture and society.

HISTORY 165CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Thomas Bender DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Martha Hodes he Department of History offersmaster's and doc-toral programs in national, international, and com-parative fields, including the his-tory of the United States, LatinAmerica, medieval Europe, earlymodern Europe, modern Europe,Middle East, East Asia, Africandiaspora, Africa, and theAtlantic world. There are jointPh.D. programs in French his-tory, through the Institute ofFrench Studies; in Hebrew andJudaic studies and history,through the Skirball Depart-ment of Hebrew and JudaicStudies; and in history and Mid-dle Eastern studies, with theDepartment of Middle Easternand Islamic Studies. Studentsmay choose to emphasize com-parative or thematic approaches,either within their areas of spe-cialization or as a second field.The faculty is large, diverse, and distinguished. Their inter-ests cover the spectrum of his-torical research, and nomethodological or historio-graphical approach is favored orexcluded in the work of thedepartment. Though the gradu-ate programs are built aroundcolloquia and seminars withinthe department, they ofteninclude faculty from otherdepartments as well as manydistinguished international vis-iting scholars. Students are encouraged to think comparatively\u2014acrosstime as well as space\u2014and todefine comparative concentra-tions. This emphasis is furtheredby a associ-ated members\u2014histori-ans, anthropologists, politicaltheorists, others\u2014from theDepartment of Comparative Lit-erature, the Alexander S. Onas-sis Program in Hellenic Studies,the Center for Latin Americanand Caribbean Studies, the Pro-gram in Africana Studies, theCenter for European Studies, theInstitute of French Studies, the Department of Middle Easternand Islamic Studies, the Pro-gram in East Asian Studies, theSkirball Department of Hebrewand Judaic Studies, and the Pro-gram in American Studies. Graduates of the Department of History teach at respectedcolleges and universities, includ-ing Harvard University,Amherst College, Boston Col-lege, Columbia College, RutgersUniversity, Lafayette College,Southern Methodist University,University StateUniversity New York, Con-necticut College, Hofstra Uni-versity, University of Vermont,Wesleyan University, University of Pennsylvania, University ofCalifornia (Irvine), University ofTexas (San Antonio), Lehigh University, Skidmore College,and University of Michigan.Others have careers in historicalorganizations, archival manage-ment, historical editing andpublishing, and university andfoundation administration. 53 WASHINGTON SQUARE SOUTH, 7TH FLOOR NEW YORK, NY 10012-1098 212-998-8600 T166 HISTORYJane Burbank, Professor, History, 1981,M.A. 1971, Harvard; M.L.S. 1969,Simmons College; history; legal culture; imperial polities; peasants.

Consultthe GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid for application deadline information. MASTER OF ARTS The program for the master's degree inhistory offers students graduate workthat serves a variety of needs and pur-poses. It can be an end in itself for stu-dents whose personal and/or professionalgoal is an M.A. degree. It can be com-bined with a certificate in the archivesor public history, or world history pro-gram. It can be used to earn a special-ized degree in world history. Last, theM.A. can be a preparatory graduatedegree en route to the doctorate. Thus, many NYU students enroll in the M.A. program because they needbackground for their interests andcareers, for example, as secondaryschool teachers, writers, or filmmakersor in public service. A significant pro-portion of these students begin mas-ter's work after being out of academiafor some time, and many elect tostudy part time while maintaining afull work schedule. The departmentparticularly encourages nontraditionalstudents who are studying part time toattend graduate student events whenpossible, get to know their colleagues,and take time to work with theiradvisers and with the faculty and torecognize their own valuable andrespected presence in the department. The Master of Arts degree requires the completion of 32 points, of whichat least 24 must be within the historydepartment. No more than 8 pointsmay be transferred from other gradu-ate schools. A request for transfer cred-its must be made within the first yearof enrollment. There is no area special-ization requirement at the master's level, but students must take at leastone seminar in which a substantialresearch paper is completed. The stu-dent must achieve a grade of B or bet-ter in the seminar. There is no general language require- ment. However, a student specializingin Middle Eastern history for an M.A.degree must demonstrate proficiency inArabic, Persian, or Turkish by passing,with a grade of B or better, at least twocourses at the advanced level or beyondin one of those languages. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The program for the Ph.D. degree pro-vides a framework within which stu-dents can acquire the following train-ing and experience: (1) broad exposureto a general area of interest and to itscurrent literature and controversies; (2) more intense training in the specialfield in which the student intends toconduct research and do his or her pri-mary teaching; (3) a sound but morelimited introduction to a second field;(4) training in research procedures andmethods; (5) an appropriate linguisticcompetence; and (6) the completion ofa dissertation judged to be a significantpiece of historical research and writing. To achieve these aims, the program is made up of the following compo-nents. (For a more complete discus-sion, see the Handbook for Graduate Students, available in the Department of History.) Ph.D. Fields:1. Medieval Europe (fall of Rome to 1453) 2. Early modern Europe (1400 to 1789) 3. Modern Europe (1750 to present)4. United States (contact to present)5. Latin America and the Caribbean6. Modern Middle East7. East Asia8. Early modern Middle East (c. 1200- 1800) 9. Islamic History (600-1200)10. African diaspora11. Atlantic world12. AfricaCourse of Study: Ph.D. students must complete 18 courses (72 points),which is the equivalent of six full-timesemesters. All students must take theone-semester course Approaches toHistorical Research and Writing intheir first year and a dissertation writ-ing seminar in their third year. Thereis no limit on the number of coursestaken within the consortium memberuniversities; nonetheless, each studentshould consult with his or her adviseron the appropriateness of the coursesand their relationship to the student'scourse of study. Such courses cannot betaken in a student's first year of gradu-ate work without special permission.Doctoral students can transfer no morethan 40 points from outside thisdepartment. The request for transfer ofcredits must be made within one yearof enrollment. Language Requirement: This requirement should be satisfied withinthe first year of graduate study andmust be satisfied by the completion of48 points. The minimal departmentalrequirement is one modern foreignlanguage; additional languages may berequired by the student's advisorycommittee. Students who choose theMiddle East as their major field mustfulfill the language requirements spec-ified for the joint Ph.D. program inhistory and Middle Eastern studies; fordetails, see the Department of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies section in this bulletin. Other areas requiring aforeign language for research may setparticular additional requirements.Students should consult their advisersabout what rules apply in their case. Students must demonstrate profi- ciency in one of the following lan-guages: Arabic, Chinese, French,German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian,Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian,or Spanish. Consent of the director ofgraduate studies must be obtained tosubstitute a language not on this list.Students may satisfy proficiency in oneof the following ways: (1) by passingthe examination in the language givenby the Graduate School of Arts andScience; (2) by passing the depart-ment's examination, given each term,based on the translation and explica-tion of scholarly texts (dictionaries andword processors are permitted); or Programs and RequirementsHISTORY 169(3) by having earned a grade of B+ or better in an intermediate or advancedlanguage course in a college or univer-sity no more than two years prior toenrollment. Exceptions may be madefor languages required for primaryresearch, by which a student's advisermay specify the department's examina-tion, or some other procedure, as nec-essary to demonstrate sufficient com-petence. The language examination isoffered by the department in the falland spring and by the GraduateSchool three times a year. Qualifying Examination: Students must pass a written qualifying exami-nation in a broad area of interest (U.S.history, medieval Europe, early mod-ern Europe, modern Europe, LatinAmerica, Middle East, Atlantic world,African diaspora, Africa, or East Asia).The students' second field is alsoexamined. Full-time students enteringwith a bachelor's degree take thisexamination at the end of the secondyear of study; other students take theexamination within one semester afterthe completion of 12 courses (48points). Those entering with an M.A.degree from outside the historydepartment are normally expected totake the qualifying examinationdirectly after they have completed sixcourses, of which one must be a \"liter-ature of the field\" course. Studentswho have done graduate work else-where must, before sitting for theexam, complete all work for the num-ber of courses the director of graduatestudies has determined to be appropri-ate in each case. A student who doesnot pass the examination has the rightto retake it once. The qualifying examination is not a comprehensive examination. It isintended to test how well each studentunderstands and can explain historicalarguments and issues and bring tobear pertinent information and knowl-edge in discussing them, not howmuch he or she knows. Prospectus Defense and Major Field Examination: Each student must pass a 90-minute oral examination in his orher major field after the language andcourse requirements have been com-pleted. Full-time students normallytake this examination at the end of thethird year of study. Those enteringwith a master's degree should take theexamination at the end of the secondyear. For other students, the precisetime is arranged with the director ofgraduate studies, but it must be assoon after the completion of coursework as is practicable.The student must submit a disserta- tion prospectus prior to the examina-tion. The discussion of this proposalwill be a major component of theexamination. The committee for theexamination consists of three facultymembers, of whom one is the student'smajor adviser, and the other two arenormally readers of the dissertation.Where appropriate, one member of thecommittee may be from outside thedepartment. No student may sit forthe major field examination withoutthe previous completion of the lan-guage proficiency specified for thatfield. (As with the qualifying examina-tion, students who fail the major fieldexamination may sit for it one moretime, in the following fall term.) Dissertation: Each student must write a dissertation under the supervi-sion of a member of the department(joint advisers are permitted). The dis-sertation committee, including theadviser, has five members, of which aminimum of three must be GSAS full-time faculty. Planning a Program: Ph.D. students should arrange their schedules so thatthey can complete the required \"litera-ture of the field\" courses and at leastone seminar by the end of the firstyear. Although the qualifying exami-nation is likely to be a major concernof doctoral students in the first twoyears, students should also ensure thatthey begin serious work in the majorfield during these years, for the sake oftheir overall professional developmentand because a student's progresstoward these goals is taken intoaccount during the general evaluationthe department undertakes for eachstudent following the qualifyingexamination. The third year should be devoted primarily to the student's major field,including the planning of the disserta-tion project. It may also, if necessary,be used for completing the secondfield. Choosing a Major Field: Each doctor- al student must designate a major field,within which the subject of his or herdissertation falls and presumably thefield in which the student expects to beprincipally involved as a writer andteacher. Major fields should be broadenough so that they can prepare stu-dents to teach an upper-level under-graduate course or a graduate colloqui-um, but narrow enough so that stu-dents can develop professional compe-tence in a body of literature and eachstudent's own primary research can con-tribute to the preparation. Major fields may be defined in chronological andgeographical terms, or they may bepartly topical. In each case, a student'smajor field should be worked out indiscussion with his or her adviser andwith one additional faculty memberwho has agreed to participate in exam-ining it. Each field must be approvedby the director of graduate studies. Here are some examples of major fields: colonial and RevolutionaryAmerica; the Civil War andReconstruction; the United Statesfrom World War I to the end of the20th century; industry and labor inAmerica, 1890 to the present; theAmerican South from colonial times women in the United Statessince 1890; the 19th-century Spanish Caribbean;the medieval monarchy the church and religious lifein 17th-century England; RenaissanceItalian cities and their cultures; Reformation;France in the Old Regime; France,1750-1914; Germany, 1815-1945;politics and diplomacy in 19th-centu-ry Europe; thought and culture inFrance and Germany between thewars; Russia from Alexander II toGorbachev; China from imperialism torevolution; Japan since the Meijirestoration; Brazil in the 20th century. Setting Up a Second Field: Each doc- toral student must choose, by the endof the third semester, a second field anda second field adviser. The second fieldadviser has responsibility for ensuringthat the student presents a coherentsecond field program and for examiningthe student in the qualifying exam.Normally the program consists of threecourses. The second field is tested onthe qualifying examination. A second field may have the same dimensions as the major field, or it maybe more purely topical, where such afield seems the best way to foster a stu-dent's development. In every case, how-ever, the second field may not be con-tained within the student's major field,but must introduce some significantnew area or dimension. Second fieldsmay also be arranged in some fields inwhich no major fields are available andmay be comparative. Archival manage-ment and historical editing also qualifyas second fields, without respect to themajor field. Women's history and pub-lic history, if comparative, also qualifyas second fields without respect to themajor field.170 HISTORYTransnational Fields: Historians are increasingly moving away fromapproaches that focus exclusively onthe internal development of onenational tradition and toward treat-ments that recognize the interconnect-edness of the early modern and mod-ern worlds and the great themes\u2014themovement of peoples both free andunfree, economic interdependence,religious transformations, intellectualcurrents, and mixing of plants, ani-mals, and microbes\u2014that cut acrossboundaries and forced new forms ofconsciousness. In response to thistrend, New York University'sDepartment of History instituted thetwo doctoral fields African diasporaand Atlantic world. Students whoelect either of these transnationalfields are encouraged to develop, inconsultation with their major adviser,a focus within the broad field and tocombine courses to allow them to pur-sue the particular themes they haveidentified. This focus complements thestudents' field in a national or regionalhistory. As they develop dissertationtopics, they take a methods course thatemphasizes transnational themes andcomparative history. Students whochoose African diaspora or Atlanticworld as one field take their secondfield in a traditional national program.Half of their general examinationsfocus on the transnational field, andthe other half focus on the traditionalfield (American, African, LatinAmerican, European, etc.) that mostclosely corresponds to the students'period of focus. African diaspora orAtlantic world may also be selected asa second field. African Diaspora: The African dias- pora field focuses on the dispersal andactivities of people of African descent, their role in the transformation andcreation of new cultures, institutions,ideas outside of Africa, and the prob-lems of creating transnational commu-nities in a modern world in whichnation, race, ethnicity, gender, andclass have been the cornerstones ofidentity formation. Extending fromthe 15th century to the present andincorporating Africa, South America,the Caribbean, North America, andEurope, the African diaspora field isprimarily a study of connections.Students examine, among otherthings, the historical construction ofdiasporan identities; the role of blackmigrant/colonial intellectuals torethinking the modern West; and thecontinual reinvention of Africa and thediaspora through culture, politicalmovements, migrations, transforma-tions in communication, and the glob-alization of the economy. Atlantic World: Newer comparative analysis builds on studies treatingdevelopment within one system andtherefore complements rather thanreplaces traditional work. The Atlanticworld field builds on the contributionsof both the older imperial school andthe more recent local studies andincorporates the perspective of newermethodologies such as ethnohistory.All of the continents that rim theAtlantic are seen as equally involvedin the creation of the early modernand modern systems; no one traditionis privileged over the others. Thedepartment allows students maximumflexibility in shaping this field, so thatthey can take full advantage of therich resources of NYU and followtheir own interests. Students who electthe Atlantic world field are encour-aged to develop, in consultation with their major adviser, a focus within thebroad field and to combine courses toallow them to pursue the particularthemes they have identified. Thisfocus complements the students' fieldin a national or regional history. Asthey develop dissertation topics, theytake a methods course that emphasizestransnational themes and comparativehistory. FINANCIAL AID, ASSISTANTSHIPS, ANDEXTERNAL FUNDING Students are admitted into the Ph.D. program only if they receive a fellow-ship from New York University. NYUfellowships are five-year packages thatrequire students to work as teachingassistants for three years. Students whohave outside fellowships (e.g., JavitsFellowships) are also considered. There is some financial aid available for M.A. students in the archives pro-gram, but not for other M.A. students. Graduate students studying Arabic, Persian, or Turkish may be eligible fora Foreign Language and Area Studies(FLAS) Fellowship; for details, contactDirector, Hagop Kevorkian Center forNear Eastern Studies, Faculty of Artsand Science, New York University, 50Washington Square South, New York, NY 10012-1073. Graduate students are encouraged to seek external sources of funding,whenever and wherever possible. Thedirector of graduate studies makesavailable to graduate students an up-to-date list of grants and fellowships.Smaller grants for special purposes arealso available. Courses are of several kinds: 1. Colloquia, dealing with specific peri- ods or problems, based on commonreading and discussion (in some casessupplemented by occasional lectures),and in which students normally writeinterpretive papers, book critiques andreview essays, and/or bibliographicalsurveys. 2. Seminars, in which, after an initial period of common readings, studentswork primarily on a research project.

Senior members of the Facultyof Arts and Science with strong com-mitments to interdisciplinary scholar-ship, master teachers play an impor-tant role in shaping the DraperProgram. In addition to teachingcourses and advising students, masterteachers provide curricular guidanceand help to maintain connections tothe rest of the Graduate School. A Draper faculty fellow is also cho- sen for each area of inquiry. Facultyfellows are top-ranked junior scholars,selected through national searches,who are in residence at the DraperProgram for three years. They teach,advise students, supervise research, and keep the program at the vanguard ofcurrent scholarship. Outstanding faculty from many departments and programs in theGraduate School of Arts and Scienceparticipate in the Draper Program.Professors from Africana studies,American studies, anthropology, biolo-gy, cinema studies, comparative litera-ture, English, Hebrew and Judaicstudies, history, journalism and masscommunication, performance studies,philosophy, physics, politics, and soci-ology regularly teach in the program,but in any given semester almost anydiscipline in the Graduate School maybe represented by the Draper Program faculty.

G65.1006 Interrogates the notion that one's life ought to be understood as a work ofart. This idea has evolved in tandemwith the breakdown of boundariesbetween art and life in various van-guard art-making practices. Thiscourse investigates (1) to what extentindividuals can be understood as\"authors\" of their lives; (2) to whatextent this can be understood as anideological fantasy of late capitalism;and (3) what implications the notionof one's life as a work of art may havefor progressive political change. Introduction to Art Worlds I G65.1106 The first of a two-course sequence designed to explore debates about theproduction, consumption, distribution,and interpretation of the arts.Incorporating methods and insightsfrom anthropology, history, philosophy,and sociology, this course introducesstudents to issues in and methods forcultural analysis. Readings includetexts by Adorno, Benjamin, Becker,Bourdieu, Weber, Williams, and others. Introduction to Art Worlds II G65.1116 Focuses on questions of reception and interpretation, particularly on the dis-tinctions between \"high\" culture andother cultural designations. How haveavant-garde notions and systems con-tributed to the \"culture wars\"? Whatrole do class distinctions have in theevolution of cultural controversies?How do notions of good and poor\"taste\" emerge, and how are theydefined? To what extent do debatesover cultural freedom serve as proxiesfor other political struggles? Possession and Performance: Penetrable Selves the delineations ofindividual identity. This course recon-siders the relationship between spiritpossession as registered in diverse cul-tural contexts and the political demar-cation of the individual and communi-ty. Students examine ethnographies, film, and psychological analyses of thesignificance of possession and try to tiethis discussion to current debates sur-rounding the construction of national,racial, and sexual identity. THE CITY Introduction to the City I G65.1108 Introduces a wide range of approaches to the study of the city, which isdefined in very different ways by dif-ferent disciplines. Students read textsby scholars from a broad range of dis-ciplines, including geography, urbanplanning, anthropology, sociology, lit-erary criticism, and history. The aim isto give students a broad overview ofapproaches to the city and an under-standing of the connections betweenthe city as a physical object, a culturalphenomenon, and a social and eco-nomic force. Gender, Sexuality, and the City G65.1111 The anonymity of the modern city has made it a space of illicit sexualitiesand nonconformist gender practices.At the same time, the structures andcultures of cities inscribe normativegender and sexuality. Through read-ings in feminist and queer theory,urban theory, social history, geography,and sociology, this course explores howgender and sexuality are constitutiveof, and are constituted by, urban formand urban life. The Public City G65.1115 Urbanity centers on public and semi- public spaces, including streets, plazas,boulevards, parks, caf\u00e9s, and shops.This course explores the contestednature of the \"public,\" what defines aspace as public, who \"the public\" is,and the mechanisms and nature of thepublic sphere. These questions are setin the context of historical and contem-porary case studies of public space andthe public sphere in urban contexts. Garbage in Gotham: The Anthropology of Trash G65.1813 Traces changing definitions of value and worthlessness throughEnlightenment, modern, and post-modern theory. Considers thesethrough the perspective of trash,which is read as a reflection of contem-porary social mores, time/space com-pression, and fragmentations of cultur-al identity, among other themes. UsesNew York City as a case study.Introduction to the City II G65.2108 Students learn about and experiment with a wide range of methods forstudying the city. We explore whatcan be learned through various histori-cal records, from novels and films,from the physical city itself, and fromobserving and interviewing citydwellers, and read analyses of urbanlife that use these different methods. GENDER POLITICS Introduction to Gender Politics IG65.1205 Investigates the relationship of the shape of the body to the shape of theself. Focuses on psychoanalytic dis-course and its legacy in academic,artistic, and popular culture. Studentsread texts by Freud, Riviere, Fanon,Butler, Segwick, and others, and studymaterial representations of sexuality infiction, philosophy, photography, anddance. Sexuality in Culture and Politics: The Explanation for EverythingG65.1207 Explores current critical literature that uses sexuality to engage importantsubjective, cultural, and political phe-nomena. What is \"sexuality\" and whatcan it explain? What tools can sexuali-ty studies offer for thinking aboutmodern life, about global politics, andabout scholarly work? Topics erotics of colonialism;and the queer renaissance of the 1990s. Introduction to Gender Politics II G65.1215 Focuses on Foucault's thinking about sexuality, power, knowledge, and thebody. Students read several ofFoucault's most influential works anddiscuss the critical reception of hisideas and their application by a rangeof scholars in the decades since hisdeath. GLOBAL HISTORIES Introduction to Global Histories IG65.1107 Surveys world historical trends by examining spaces and practices outsidethe normative expectations of nationalhistories. Students read accounts ofhuman encounters on and across theworld's major seas and oceans\u2014\"con-tact zones\" that blur conventional ter-ritorial and cultural definitions\u2014andCoursesHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL THOUGHT 185review related concepts, tools, and methodologies. History of the News G65.1120 Identical to G54.0018. Broadly examines the cultural founda- tions of modern journalism; exploresassumptions built into the communica-tion called \"news.\" Particular attentionis paid to ways in which the mediumaffects content and perspective. African Slavery and the Atlantic Slave Trade G65.2051 Identical to G57.2555. Examines the institution of servitude and slavery in tropical Africa sinceclassical antiquity. Includes study ofmaster-servant relationships, theAtlantic slave trade, and its impact onthe political, social, and economicorganization of Africa. Introduction to Global Histories II G65.2107 Examines accounts of travel, conquest, and migration between distant landsand populations from the 16th centuryonwards. While these migratory prac-tices appear as exceptional events innational histories, they appear in glob-al history as recurrent and constitutivefeatures of modern society. Urban Blacks in 20th-Century America G65.2714 Identical to G57.2714. Considers black Americans within the transformation of wealth, power, andpopulation in the United States duringthe 20th century. Provides backgroundand historical context on blacks priorto the 20th century but concentrateson developments after the turn of thecentury. LITERARY CULTURES The Passions of the Mind: Affect,Literature, and Music in Europe,1600-1850 G65.1005 Explores relations among affect, litera- ture, and music in the theory andpractices of early modern Europe.Examines the theory of the passions inexplicit contrast with the late modernconstructions of emotion.Introduction to Literary Cultures I G65.1301 Examines major concepts in contem- porary literary and cultural theorythrough readings of works from through the Renaissance.Engaging investigate therelation of language to the formationof the subject and the social networksthat claim that subject. The Ethics of Literary Interpretation G65.1305 Explores the relation of \"theory\" to \"practice\" as the space of an ethics ofinterpretation. Focuses on the ethicalimplications of the performative act ofinterpretation itself with particularattention to the concurrent yet some-times competing claims of text andcontext. Readings include texts Lacan, others. Posthumanism G65.1306 What is posthumanism? While the term has gained currency across thehumanities and the social sciences, itcasts such a wide semantic and theo-retical net as to remain fairly obscure.To address the questions and problem- atics introduced by the circulation ofthis term, students read a variety ofworks from a number of disciplines,including literature, philosophy, polit-ical theory, psychoanalysis, film, andcultural studies. Introduction to Literary Cultures II G65.1321 Interrogates the relation of \"literature\" and \"culture\" by examining the regimeof reason and the self-possessed subject,from the Enlightenment and its precur-sors through the subsequent anxieties ofmodernity and beyond. Readingsinclude literary, philosophical, theoreti-cal, and psychoanalytic texts.Law and Mass Communication G65.2070 Identical to G54.0011. Acquaints students with basic protec- tions and restrictions of the law asapplied to the institutional press.Discusses First Amendment principlesand issues of libel, privacy, copyright,obscenity, fair trial, free press, reporter'sprivilege, and rules of broadcast.

Introduction to Science Studies I G65.1109 Surveys science from a variety of philo- sophical, sociological, historical, lin-guistic, anthropological, and criticalperspectives. Explores relativism, and theuses to which scientific knowledge isput by examining how cultural bound-aries between science and nonscienceare constructed and maintained. Introduction to Science Studies II G65.1110 Examines how new and emerging knowledges and technologies, such ascold fusion, genetics, cloning, organtransplantation, and assisted concep-tion, are problematizing boundariesthat are assumed to be natural andfixed, while at the same time remak-ing the social structures that supportscience. Science and Culture: Who Controls the Body? G65.2103 Examines controversies over the own- ership and control of the body thathave resulted from advances in genet-ics, biotechnology, and reproductivetechnology.CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor John Freccero DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Assistant Professor Maria Luisa Ardizz one he Department of Italian Studies atNew York Uni-versity is recog- nized as one of the finest Italianprograms in the country.

We want to educatethose who agree. Opportunities abound in the media world, but the opportu-nity to do compelling work thatinforms, engages\u2014and matters\u2014 is what drives our faculty, moti-vates our students, and informsour entire approach. Great journalism has always come from the great cities of theglobe, and there is no betterplace to learn the craft than thecity of New York\u2014where powerand wealth concentrate, news andculture originate, and dailyevents in Manhat- tan's Greenwich Village, thedepartment immerses students inthe richness and vitality of thecity, while attracting to campusmany of the leaders and thinkersin the journalism profession.New York City is our labora-tory\u2014and our inspiration. Thevery first lesson we offer studentsis: Tap into it, with our help. NYU students study as interns in almost every major newsorganization in the city. Theyoften graduate to jobs in news-papers, magazines, broadcast out-lets, and on-line operationsheadquartered in New York,though some choose to go else-where. And every day, studentsmove outward from the classroomto the city, on assignments thattake them all over town. The full-time faculty is itself of national stature in the journalismworld. As writers, reporters, pro-ducers, and critics, NYU profes-sors continue to practice thejournalism they teach andpreach, holding the profession toits highest standards of public service. The adjunct faculty, ourteaching professionals, featuresworking journalists from all themajor news media, who sharetheir wealth of experience and acommitment to craft. Major areas of study are in newspaper, magazine, and broad-cast journalism, along with agrowing list of courses in journal-ism for the digital age. Each areapairs accomplished faculty whohave worked in the field withstudents who seek practicalinstruction and intellectualdepth. Most classes are kept small(12 to 18 students) to allow forone-on-one instruction. In addi-tion to the general M.A. pro-gram, the department offersspecialized curricula based onsubject matter: a concentration reporting acertificate program businessand economic reporting; and acertificate program in science andenvironmental reporting. Stu-dents may also enroll in one ofthe department's four joint pro-grams: journalism and LatinAmerican and Caribbean studies;journalism and Near Easternstudies; journalism and Frenchstudies; or biomedical journalism. Course work begins with the basic skills of reporting, writing,and research, but simultaneouslystudents are taught what journal-ism at its best can be\u2014and whatit should accomplish in a freeand democratic society. They are Aalso encouraged to publish their work, with assignments, intern-ships, and on-line projects gearedto this end. Housed within the arts and sciences core of a leading univer-sity, the department sees journal-ism as an essential strand in theliberal arts tradition and a criticalfactor in public culture. But wealso recognize that news thesedays is a business. When our skilled graduates enter that busi-ness, they are prepared toimprove and enliven it. Department facilities include state-of-the-art computer equip-ment; classrooms fashioned togenerate an authentic newsroomatmosphere; the Center forOnline Research, which offersNEXIS/LEXIS and DIALOGcapabilities; and a fully equipped broadcast facility with a TV stu-dio and linear and nonlinear edit-ing and digital and beta fieldequipment. The department isalso home to the Center for War,Peace, and the News Media,which works to improve foreignnews coverage in the U.S. mediaand conducts media assistanceprograms throughout the world.

Heydebrand.204 LAW AND SOCIETYThe Institute's academic program offers a Ph.D. degree in law and socie-ty, a Ph.D.-J.D. dual degree, and anM.A.-J.D. dual degree. The Law andSociety Program (LSP) is designed tostudy law in light of changing cultur-al, economic, social, and politicalforces. In addition, the Institute sup-ports a colloquium, a workshop, con-ferences, and visiting scholars. The graduate program locates disci- plinary studies of law, such as law andpolitics, legal anthropology, economicanalysis of law, sociology of law, crimi-nology, and legal history in a coherentsociolegal program at the graduatelevel. The program facilitates the edu-cational goals of students who plancareers in a number of academic disci-plines including social science fields,law at the undergraduate level as wellas in professional law school, policyanalysis, and applied research on law-related issues. Essentially, three student groups are served by the program: (1) Ph.D. stu-dents seeking a multidisciplinaryapproach to the study of law; (2) J.D.students who want to expand theirtheoretical and empirical knowledge ofsociolegal research by obtaining anM.A. degree in law and society; and(3) students who would like to com-bine J.D. and Ph.D. studies. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Degree Requirements: To qualify for the doctorate, a student must satisfacto-rily complete graduate studies totalingat least 72 graduate credits, with a min-imum of 32 credits at the doctoral levelin residence at New York University;pass comprehensive qualifying examina-tions; and present an acceptable disser-tation. Most graduate courses carry 4credits. Students who have completedrelevant graduate courses elsewhere mayrequest that such courses be creditedtoward the degree requirements. Thismust be approved by the director ofgraduate studies and completed by theend of the first year of study. Course of Study: Each student is assigned an adviser on entering theprogram. Students enrolled in the Lawand Society Program may take up to12 credits in the School of Law afterconsultation with their adviser andwith the permission of the instructor.Students work with a committee ofadvisers to establish their course ofstudy, but all students should do somecourse work for general backgroundpreparation in the Law and SocietyProgram fields, which include sociole- gal theory; social and legal policy; andcomparative and global perspectives.All students are required to take thetwo-semester Sociolegal Studies I andII, designed to provide students with afoundation in social theories, concepts,approaches, and methodologies. Allstudents are required to take twosemesters of graduate-level methodscourses from the LSP methods lists.Students are further urged to studyquantitative methodology so as toacquire basic competency and literacywith terminology, applications, etc.Students are also required to attend theLaw and Society Workshop during thefirst year. Language Requirement: Proficiency in at least one language other thanEnglish is required of all doctoral can-didates. Foreign language proficiencyexaminations are at once an examina-tion of both the foreign language andEnglish. Currently, a student maychoose to demonstrate proficiency inancient Greek, French, German,Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin,Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, orSpanish. Students who use a foreignlanguage other than the above as anintegral part of their dissertationresearch may petition for a substitu-tion. Language proficiency may bedemonstrated by any of the following:(1) passing the foreign language profi-ciency examination given by theGraduate School of Arts and Science(GSAS); (2) passing the departmentalexamination, if one is regularly sched-uled by the department in which thestudent is registered; or (3) complet-ing, or having completed, not morethan two years before matriculation,with a grade of B or better, a full orfinal intermediate-level college coursein the language. Students who havemet the language requirement inanother graduate school not more thantwo years before matriculation inGSAS may request that such creden-tials be accepted, with the approval ofthe dean. Qualifying Examinations: As part of the requirements for the doctoral pro-gram, students must pass the LSPcomprehensive qualifying examina-tions in three fields: (1) the law andsociety field; (2) an area field; and (3) adiscipline subfield. The comprehensiveexaminations are given twice a year.The four-hour written or 24-hourtake-home examinations are given oneweek prior to the start of the LawSchool's fall and spring semesters, and oral examinations take place withinthe first month of each semester.Students who fail an examination maypetition the DGS to take it again.Students are not permitted to retakean examination more than once. 1. Law and Society Field ExaminationThis examination tests students' com-prehensive knowledge of theoreticaland empirical approaches in the LSPsubfields: (1) sociolegal theory; (2) social and legal policy; and (3) comparative and global perspec-tives. The examination covers materialand supplementary reading lists fromthe required LSP courses (TheSociolegal Seminar and Law and SocialPolicy) and other material, as specifiedby the adviser and the law and societyexamination committee. Students mustsubmit the law and society field exami-nation form to the DGS for approvalone month prior to the examination.Students may choose to take a four-hour written examination or a 24-hourtake-home examination. Each academicyear, the director of the Institute forLaw and Society appoints a law andsociety examination committee, in con-sultation with the associate director.Two members of this committee, along with the student's adviser, write andevaluate the examination. 2. Area Field Examination In consultation with the adviser, stu-dents identify an area of study aboutwhich they will develop comprehen-sive knowledge that is related to oneor more frameworks or backgroundthemes important to their researchinterests. The adviser, in consultationwith the student, identifies two mem-bers of the NYU faculty, in additionto the adviser, to sit on the area exami-nation committee. The student mustreceive approval of the area field fromthe adviser and the DGS by submit-ting the approval of area field form.Students submit a concept paper (15-20 pages plus a bibliography), whicharticulates the main theoretical con-cepts, methods, debates, and futuretrajectory of the area. They then take atwo-hour oral examination. 3. Discipline Subfield Examination In consultation with the adviser, stu-dents identify a discipline other thanlaw and society (e.g., political science,sociology, anthropology, psychology,economics, history, or law) and selectone subfield within that discipline in Programs and RequirementsLAW AND SOCIETY 205which to take a comprehensive exami- nation. Approval by the LSP-DGS isrequired; the discipline subfield exami-nation form must be submitted onemonth prior to the examination. Theadviser, in consultation with the LSP-DGS, makes appropriate accommoda-tions so that the comprehensive exami-nation procedures of the disciplineselected are followed and the format,timing, and evaluation of the examina-tion are congruent with the rules, poli-cies, and procedures of the discipline. Students complete their doctoral com-prehensive examinations no later thanthe end of the third year of graduatework. Dissertation: When the student has prepared an acceptable dissertationprospectus, describing his or her proj-ect, and it has been recommended bythe student's three-member disserta-tion committee, he or she submits tothe DGS a copy of the dissertationproposal, an abstract, and the disserta-tion committee form. The dissertationabstract is distributed to all Institutefor Law and Society faculty members.At this point, the student is formallyadvanced to candidacy for the doctor-ate. Once the adviser has approved acopy of the completed dissertation, thestudent submits copies of the disserta-tion to all members of his or her dis-sertation committee. A two-hour oraldissertation defense is then scheduled,to include the dissertation committee,two additional faculty (selected by theadviser and the student), and the stu-dent. The dissertation should be com-pleted and the degree awarded no laterthan the end of the eighth year ofgraduate work. DUAL JURIS DOCTOR AND DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Admission: Students with a special interest in law may wish to pursue thedual degree program leading to theJ.D.-Ph.D. degrees in law and society.Students who wish to enroll in thedual degree program must apply sepa-rately to the School of Law and to theGraduate School of Arts and Science(GSAS). Students may apply to bothschools simultaneously or to oneschool while in the first year of studyat the other. There are no specificadmission standards or applications fordual degree applicants at either school.Once admitted to both schools, thestudent qualifies for the dual degreeJ.D.-Ph.D. program. Degree Requirements: The School of Law requires the completion of 82credits in six semesters of full-timestudy for the J.D. degree. Full-timestudy is defined as 12 or more credithours per semester, primarily in cours-es commencing prior to 6 p.m. Onesemester of full-time graduate study, orup to 12 credits, from the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science is countedtoward the J.D. degree. Thus, at leastone of the student's semesters in GSASmust be full-time and consist of amajority of credits in daytime courses.For a complete description of coursesrequired for the J.D. degree, consultthe School of Law Bulletin. As stated above, the Ph.D. degree requires 72credits of graduate study, of which 12credits are accepted from the School ofLaw. The two degrees therefore requirea total of 130 credits (70 at the Schoolof Law and 60 at the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science). Because some ofthe credits earned in each program arecounted toward the other degree, it ispossible to complete the courserequirements for both degrees in fiveyears of full-time study. Course of Study: Normally, students pursuing the dual degree programspend their first year completing mostof the first-year curriculum at theGraduate School of Arts and Science,including the two required sociolegalseminars. Thereafter, the course of studyis constructed in consultation with thestudent's adviser. Students are alsorequired to attend the Law and SocietyWorkshop during the first year. All other course requirements for the Ph.D.degree are the same as those indicatedabove. For the J.D. degree, consult theSchool of Law Bulletin for more details. Language Requirement: Proficiency in at least one language other thanEnglish is required of all doctoral can-didates in the J.D.-Ph.D. program. SeeLanguage Requirement under Doctor of Philosophy, above. Qualifying Examinations: Students enrolled in the J.D.-Ph.D. dual degreeprogram take their comprehensiveexaminations no later than the end ofthe fifth year of enrollment in the pro-gram. See Qualifying Examinations under Doctor of Philosophy, above. Dissertation: The dissertation should be completed and the degree awardedno later than the end of the ninth yearof work for those also enrolled in thedual degree program. See Dissertation under Doctor of Philosophy, above. DUAL JURIS DOCTOR AND MASTER OF ARTS Admission: Students who wish to enroll in the J.D.-M.A. dual degreeprogram must apply separately to theSchool of Law and to the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science. Studentsmay apply to both schools simultane-ously or to the Graduate School of Artsand Science when in the first or secondyear of study at the School of Law.There are no specific admission stan-dards or applications for dual degreeapplicants at either school. Onceadmitted to both schools, the studentqualifies for the dual degree program. Course of Study: The School of Law requires 82 credits of study for theJ.D. degree; however, in the dualdegree program, 8 credits for coursestaken in the Graduate School of Artsand Science are applied to the J.D.degree. The Graduate School requires32 credits of study for the M.A.degree; however, in the dual degreeprogram, 8 credits for courses taken inthe School of Law are applied to theM.A. degree. Students in this programare required to take a total of 98 cred-its for the two degrees (74 and 24credits, respectively). Typically thefirst year is spent at the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science; during theremaining years, courses are taken atboth schools. Students are alsorequired to attend the Law and SocietyWorkshop during the first year. It is possible to complete this program infour years. Language Requirement: Reading proficiency in a foreign language isrequired, demonstrated by any of themethods accepted by the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science. SeeLanguage Requirement under Doctor of Philosophy, above. DEPARTMENTAL FELLOW- SHIPS, PRIZES, AND AWARDS A comprehensive list of University and Graduate School fellowships,prizes, and awards appears in the School of Law Bulletin and in the Financing Graduate Education section of the GSAS Application for Admission andFinancial Aid. Only students admitted to the Ph.D. or J.D.-Ph.D. degree pro-gram qualify for awards from theGraduate School. 206 LAW AND SOCIETYThe semester at the School of Law starts and ends approximately oneweek earlier than that of the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science. Contactthe Institute for Law and Society forspecific dates. Courses offered in the Law and Society Program combine theoreticaland empirical approaches to studyinglaw in its social context. They can begrouped under the following three head-ings: (1) Sociolegal Theory, (2) Social andLegal Policy, and (3) Comparative andGlobal Perspectives.

SOCIOLEGAL THEORY The Sociolegal Seminar G62.1001 (Law and Society)/G53.2358(Politics)/L06.3570 (Law) Chevigny, Harrington, Upham. This seminar (1) surveys approaches for understanding the relationshipbetween social and legal thought and(2) examines their methodologies.Readings examine the extent to whichsocial science and law have commontheoretical and methodological foun-dations. Focus is on analytical, doctri-nal, institutional, and philosophicalperspectives and approaches to thestudy of law and society. The interfacebetween legal and social, cultural, eco-nomic, and political phenomena isstudied through critical debates aswell as from a historical and compara-tive perspective.Introduction to Legal Philosophy G62.1003 (Law and Society)/L06.3005(Law) Murphy. Survey of 20th-century contributions to legal philosophy. In addition to the cen-tral debate between H. L. A. Hart andRonald Dworkin over the concept oflaw, students discuss natural law theory,legal realism, critical legal studies, femi-nist jurisprudence, critical race theory,and some aspects of postmodern legaltheory. The course begins with an intro-duction to the methods of moral andpolitical theory. Sociology of Law G62.1103 (Law and Society)/G93.2434 (Sociology)Dixon, Greenberg. Designed to provide a broad theoretical framework for analyzing and interpret-ing the interrelationships between law,politics, and society. Begins with a con-sideration of the intellectual andmethodological differences between lawand social science; then examines theinterface between law and social sciencefrom two perspectives. First, the rela-tionship between law and society istraced from the point of view of theinfluence of norms and customs, socialstructure, and class and power on thedevelopment, form procedure, and sub-stance of law. Second, the impact of lawon society is examined in the areas ofrights and social movements, race dis-crimination, gender discrimination, andcrime and justice. Critical race theoryand critical gender theory receive spe-cial attention here. A section on law,courts, and the administration of justiceexamines the institutional structure andtransformation of the American legaland judicial system, and a final sectionon the legal profession, legal education,and critical legal theory deals with thecontradictory role of lawyers as agentsof the status quo and of social change. Seminar in the Sociology of Law G93.3534 (Sociology) Dixon, Garland, Greenberg . This course is designed to allow stu- dents to conduct research on a topiccovered in G62.1103. Students arerequired to enter the course with awell-formulated research proposal. Law and Modern Society G62.1004 (Law and Society)/L06.3560 (Law)Garland. This seminar explores the changing forms and functions of law in modernsociety and the sociological theoriesthat seek to interpret these develop-ments. The concept of modernity forms the background for the first halfof the course, in which the work ofDurkheim, Marx, and Weber arereviewed in some detail. Thereafter theclass addresses a body of work, bywriters such as Foucault, Selznick, andTeubner, that argues that the character of modern law\u2014and modern society\u2014is changing in ways that require us torevise our understanding of the rela-tionship of \"law\" to \"society.\" Themesinclude the decline of the rule of law;the emergence of responsive or reflex-ive law; law in the welfare state; laws,norms, and discipline; the relationbetween law and other systems of reg-ulation; and the idea of postmodernityas it applies to the legal sphere. Thecourse does not presuppose any priorknowledge of social theory. Classic Sociological Theory G93.2111 (Sociology) Garland. Examines major figures of modern sociology, including Marx, Durkheim,Weber, Simmel, Mead, Freud, and Parsons. Focuses on the conditions andassumptions of social theory, theprocess of concept formation and theo-ry-building, general methodologicalissues, and the present relevance of theauthors examined. An effort is made tospeculate on the nature of the growthof knowledge in sociology. Advanced Theory Seminar: Foucault G62.1010 (Law and Society)/G93.3112 (Sociology)Garland. This seminar is concerned with devel- oping an in-depth understanding ofthe work of Michel Foucault and itsimplications for social and historicalresearch. The class studies several ofhis substantive historical studies(Discipline and Punish, Madness andCivilization, The Birth of the Clinic, and The History of Sexuality) and explores key concepts in Foucault's work, suchas archaeology and genealogy,power/knowledge, discussed, as areattempts by other authors to putFoucaultian concepts to their own use. Culture and Disputing G62.1301 (Law and Society)/L06.3500 (Law)Bruner, Chase, Chevigny. Study of various types of dispute reso- lution found in societies ranging fromprimitive to technocratic as well asvariations in disputing models withina given society. In order to give theo- CoursesLAW AND SOCIETY 207retical grounding to the foregoing, selections from texts on anthropology,law, and society and from the work oflegal comparativists are assigned. Thegoal is to obtain a deeper understand-ing of the cultural relativism of legalinstitutions. Alternative Dispute Resolution L09.3523 (Law) Chase. This course concerns \"alternate\" meth- ods of dispute resolution. By this ismeant the processes used to resolvedisputes that are different from, andtherefore alternative to, formal civillitigation. These \"alternate\" processesinclude arbitration, mediation, andnegotiation. This course focuses on thelegal rules that regulate the use andmethodology of these processes. It alsoexplores the policy justifications andthe problems that are raised by thesealternatives: To what extent shouldsuch alternatives be permitted, encour-aged, or required by government?Further, the course tries to understandthe social forces that further or impedetheir adoption. Language and Problem Solving: The Legal Process and NarratedSelfG14.1702 (Anthropology) Schieffelin. Analysis of language as a particular type of problem-solving activity. Viewslanguage as a significant form of socialaction and, as such, as a resource forparticipants and researchers. Groundingthemselves in comparative materials,theories, and methodologies drawnfrom the literature on comparativestudies of dispute resolution, symbolicinteraction, political economy of lan-guage, narrative, and the \"narratedself,\" students explore how two speechgenres\u2014disputing and narrating\u2014come together in the context of smallclaims court, an important legal insti-tution in contemporary American soci-ety. This course introduces students toresearch in the ethnography of speak-ing, pragmatics, conversation analysis,narrative analysis, and interpretivesociolinguistics. Politics of the Legal Order G62.1101 (Law and Society)/G53.2355 (Politics) Harrington. The role of law in politics. Overview of approaches that shape the theoreti-cal and empirical contours of the pub-lic law field and contribute to multi-disciplinary law and social sciencestudies. Examines institutional, judi-cial behavior, legal impact, disputeprocessing, ideological, and neoinsti-tutional approaches. Studies multidis- ciplinary political movements anddebates, such as liberal legalism, legalrealism, legal pluralism, law and socie-ty, law and economics, feministjurisprudence, critical legal race theo-ry, and interpretive sociolegal theory.Focus is on legal and political develop-ment, legal institutions, judicial poli-tics, litigation, and legal-politicalmobilization. The object is to investi-gate both the politics of law and thelaw of politics. State, Law, and Politics in Society G62.1102 (Law and Society)/L06.3565(Law)/G53.2356 (Politics) Chevigny, Harrington. Examines the relationship between law and the state by asking whether andhow law is autonomous from the polit-ical powers of the state. Studies theinstitutional powers of the legal profes-sion and the judiciary, doctrinal, andlegal rights. Examines sociolegal theo-ries of interpretation. Investigates theideology of law in legal formalism,both contemporary and in the past; lawand society; and critical legal studies. The American Constitution G53.2350 (Politics) Randall. Analysis of the political, social, eco- nomic, cultural, and legal circum-stances surrounding the great conflictsin American constitutional develop-ment. Particular attention is given tohow those conditions and eventsaffected and were affected by theConstitution and its interpretation, inhistorical context and in Americanpolitical thinking. The American judi-cial tradition and its discontents areexplored through the work of individ-ual justices of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court and the Constitution G53.2359 (Politics) Randall. Examines the third branch of govern- ment as chief interpreter of theConstitution and reviewer of the work ofgovernment. The structure, procedures,personnel, and informal organization ofthe Court are considered along with theappointment process. Some attention isgiven to the impact of the Court's deci-sions and to public opinion about theCourt. Emphasis is on the Court's politi-cal role in a democratic polity.Current Constitutional Issues G62.1201 (Law and Society)/L01.3536.01 (Law) Bell. Students learn best by doing, that is, by active participation in the subjectmatter. Using simulation models, stu-dents perform the functions of bothjustices of the U.S. Supreme Court andattorneys handling litigation beforethat Court. By simulating the Court'sperspective, on the litigation in whichit grants or denies remedies, studentsbetter understand the often opaquereasoning the Court provides in adopt-ing or rejecting principles, doctrines,and standards. This structure enablesparticipants to gain a good under-standing of how factors, neither statednor even recognized, can influence thejudicial process. Constitutional Theory of Emergency Powers L01.3533 (Law) Ferejohn, Pasquino. The seminar discusses from a historical perspective models of constitutionaliza-tion of emergency power, specifically:the Roman dictatorship; Machiavelli,Rousseau, and the revival of the consti-tutional emergency power in the repub-lican tradition; Locke and the Montesquieu, the \"suspension\" of theconstitution during the FrenchRevolution (the Revolutionary govern-ment); Lincoln and the suspension ofhabeas corpus during the AmericanCivil War; Carl Schmitt and theDiktaturgewalt of Article 48 of theWeimar Constitution; De Gaulle and Article 16 of the constitution theFrench Fifth Republic; Article 115a ofthe Bonner Grundgesetz; emergencypower Israel, Northern Ireland,and Latin America. The seminar consid-ers, moreover, the recent Americandebate: Guantanamo and after. State and Local Government G62.1105 (Law and Society)/L01.3016(Law) Jacobs, Viteritti. Explores the power that state and local governments have to regulate, providepublic services, redistribute wealth,spend, finance private projects, tax,and borrow, and ways in which lawtries to keep that power accountable.Some of the doctrinal issues consideredinclude conflicts between state andlocal authority, controls imposed asconditions on federal or state grants,limits on borrowing and deficit spend-ing, direct democracy, nondiscrimina-tory access to services, and local gov-ernment liability for damages for viola-tions of civil rights and antitrust law. 208 LAW AND SOCIETYThe Law of Democracy L01.3010 (Law) Pildes. The democracy we experience is a product not of innate cultural forces,but of legal rules and institutionalstructures. This course seeks toenhance understanding of the ways inwhich the law might structure democ-racy, as well as to explain the histori-cal, institutional, and legal forces thathave shaped the democracy the UnitedStates has today. The course is anapplied course in democratic theoryand history. Topics include the 2000presidential election dispute; thedesign of democratic institutions,including the development of the one-vote, one-person doctrine; the consti-tutional of direct democracy; institutions; history of theright to vote; and similar issues. Thecourse should be considered anadvanced course in constitutional law. Seminar in Labor Law Theory G62.1026 (Law and Society)/L07.3560(Law) Estreicher. Theoretical perspectives in the study of labor and employment law. Topicsinclude the theory of the Wagner Act,reformist perspectives, economic cri-tiques of regulation of labor markets,the critical legal studies movementchallenge, and comparisons with laborand employment law systems of othercountries. Law and Economics G62.1024 (Law and Society)/L06.3020 (Law)Kornhauser. The first part of this course is a survey of intermediate microeconomic theory,with an emphasis on welfare econom-ics. It provides a framework for thesecond part of the course, which is aneconomic analysis of tort and propertyrules and consideration of similarproblems in law and economics. Voting, Game Theory, and the Law G62.1025 (Law and Society)/L06.3035(Law) Beno\u00eet. This course first addresses the proper- ties of various voting methods andprocedures. It considers desirableproperties that a voting method mightpossess and determines which meth-ods, if any, have these properties. Theideas developed are used to analyzepractical problems, such as voting inunion elections and the provision ofminority representation within thecontext of the Voting Rights Act. Next, the course considers the conceptof power and examines the distribu-tion of power among voters in differ-ent states and within voting bodies,such as the United Nations SecurityCouncil and congressional committees.Finally, the course develops conceptsrelated to strategic thinking used ingame theory and applies these con-cepts to voting situations and legalproblems. Law and Social Science G62.1403 (Law and Society)/L06.3008 (Law)Tyler. Introduction to the interface between law and the social sciences. Exploresthe use of social science research find-ings in a variety of areas of the law.These areas include jury decision mak-ing; the use of profiles in identifyingsuspects; evidence such as lie detec-tors, eyewitnesses, and repressed mem-ories; trademark confusion; psycholog-ical assumptions underlyingConstitutional law; citizen dissatisfac-tion with the law and legal authori-ties; and a variety of other topics. Justice and Authority in Groups G62.1029 (Law and Society)/G89.3404 (Psychology) Tyler. Introduction to psychological research on social justice. Three areas of justiceare considered: distributive justice,procedural justice, and the impact of people's assess-ments of the fairness of the distribu-tion of resources or opportunitieswithin groups, organizations, or soci-eties. Procedural justice examines theimportance of judgments about thefairness of decision-making proce-dures. Retributive justice explorespeople's views about fair ways to pun-ish those who break social rules.Emphasis is on reading and discussingrecent theoretical and empirical writ-ings on these topics. American Legal History G62.1202 (Law and Society)/L06.3010 (Law)Reid. Beginning with the colonial period and emphasizing the 19th century,this course covers the formative era ofAmerican law in early MassachusettsBay; the constitutional controversyleading to the American Revolution;the growth of law in the early repub-lic; the law of the clan and of theblood feud among the Cherokees; theAmerican law of slavery; and the fugi-tive slave controversy.Readings in American Legal History G62.1203 (Law and Society)/L06.2521 (Law) Prerequisite: U.S. Constitutional Law or permission ofinstructor. Reid. Readings in the history of American law, with emphasis on studies castinglight on the nature of law and its rela-tionship to society.

Seminar in Sociology of Law: Gender Politics and Law G62.1021 (Law and Society)/G93.3534(Sociology) Dixon. More than statutes, rules, and court cases, law constitutes a discursive fieldwhere structured inequalities andshared cultural understandings aredefined, reinforced, and transformed.This course focuses on the develop-ment and changes in U.S. legal dis-courses and how these debates producethe context for the development,administration, and interpretation ofgender relations. Students explore thehistorical development of the liberallegal system in the United States as itrelates to gender as well as critiques ofliberal legalism from the standpoint oflegal realism, critical legal theory, andliterary criticism. In addition, studentsexamine legal debates in various sub-stantive areas, such as constitutionallaw, abortion, reproduction, homosex-uality, domestic and sexual violence,employment discrimination, divorce,and custody. Gender Issues in Law and Culture G62.1028 (Law and Society)/L06.3567(Law) Bruner, Gilligan, Richards. This seminar explores, from both a historical and contemporary perspec-tive, the role of various interpretiveperspectives on gender in law and cul-ture as tools for the understanding,diagnosis, and remedy of racism andsexism as interlinked evils that afflictboth men and women, heterosexualsand homosexuals. Its central topic isthe terms of the struggle to introduceLAW AND SOCIETY 209unconventional, gender-subversive voices and topics into public discourse,criticizing cultural racism, sexism, andhomophobia. Race and Legal Scholarship G62.1022 (Law and Society)/L06.3545(Law) Caldwell. This seminar considers how concepts of prejudice and theoretical work onthe operation of racial ideology affectdevelopments in the law concerningthe protection against racial discrimi-nation afforded by specific constitu-tional and statutory laws as well asinterpretations of the impact of racegenerally in other substantive legalareas. Recent developments in thestudy of race in the social sciences areconsidered. Students examine contem-porary problems in race relations inlight of the theoretical foundations ofclassical legal scholarship, law and eco-nomics, critical legal scholarship, andthe emerging critical scholarship onrace\u2014much, but not all, of which iswritten by legal scholars of color. Race, Values, and the American Legal Process G62.1023 (Law and Society)/L06.3512 (Law) Higgenbotham Jr. This seminar examines the use of the law to both perpetuate and eradicateracial injustice in the United Statesfrom the inception and rise of slaveryduring the colonial period through theU.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. The major institutions studied are thecourts and the legislatures (predomi-nantly at the colony or state level). Thecourse explores both criminal and civillaw and focuses particularly on theirrole in the preclusion or allowance oftraditional family relations, educationoptions, due process in the courts, andother \"rights\" for blacks. Large-Scale Organizations G62.1104 (Law and Society)/G93.2132 (Sociology) Dixon, Guthrie. Introduction to the rapidly changing field of large-scale organizations.Begins by locating the field at theintersection of various social sciencedisciplines as well as business manage-ment, public administration, the anar-chist theory of organization, Marxism,and critical theory. Major organization-al theories and approaches discussedinclude Weber, scientific management,human relations, decision theory andsystems models, contingency theory,resource-dependence and strategicchoice, institutionalism, populationecology, and the phenomenology of organizations. After considering vari-ous methods of organizational analysis,the course focuses on a number of orga-nizational environments, with particu-lar emphasis on the political economy,the policy networks of the state, andthe transformation of the judiciary andthe courts. Finally, certain dimensionsof internal structure and change arediscussed, particularly organizationalcontrol structures from markets andhierarchies to technocratic corporatismand democratic participation. Law and Literature L06.3510 (Law) Gillers, Stimpson. How does literature use law as a source of structure and theme? Howdoes literature view law and legalinstitutions? What can literature andliterary imagination bring to the per-formance of legal tasks, including\"telling stories\" about cases? Whatdifferent critics employin construing a text? How are humanpassions and the human condition dif-ferently described and treated in lawand literature? In fall 2002, the classread Merchant of Venice, several Sherlock Holmes short stories, A Jury of Her Peers (Susan Glaspell), The Trial (Franz Kafka), Lawyerland (Lawrence Joseph), Bartleby the Scrivener (Herman Melville), The Death of Ivan Ilych (Leo Tolstoy), Anatomy of a Murder (Robert Traver), and Brothers and Keepers (John Edgar Wideman). II. SOCIAL AND LEGAL POLICY Law and Social Policy G62.1002 (Law and Society)/G53.2360 (Politics)/G93.3534 (Sociology)/L06.3580 (Law)Dixon. Scholars have debated for centuries whether law leads or follows changesin society. Regardless, most agree thatlaw and society are interwoven suchthat law constitutes a field where socialpolicies are created, reinforced, andtransformed. This course is dividedinto three parts, each using social poli-cy as a venue for examining the rela-tionship between law and society. Thefirst part analyzes the potential andlimitations of law for dispute resolu-tion, social control, and social change.The second part explores the relation-ship that law and social policies haveto legal professions, legal organiza-tions, interest groups, and social move-ments. The third part examines lawand social policies in transitional soci- eties such as postcommunist regimes,across cultures, across historical peri-ods, and in the context of globaliza-tion. The course analyzes substantivesocial policies such as (1) crime controland criminal justice (policing-courts),(2) family (divorce-custody-domesticviolence), and (3) race, sex, and gender(affirmative action-pregnancy-abortion-gay marriage). Criminology G62.2021 (Law and Society)/G93.2503 (Sociology) Dixon, Greenberg, Garland. This course provides a critical evalua- tion of the historical development ofthe study of crime. The readings offera variety of theoretical and method-ological approaches to the analysis ofvarious areas of crime (violent\u2014prop-erty\u2014victimless\u2014white collar). Theclass provides a forum for criticallydiscussing the variety of theoreticalframeworks, issues, research method-ologies, and findings used in examin-ing the construction, violation, andpunishment of crime. Seminar in Criminology G93.3513 (Sociology) Dixon, Garland, Greenberg. This course is designed to allow stu- dents to conduct research on a topiccovered in G62.2021. Students arerequired to enter the course with awell-formulated research proposal. Juvenile Justice L04.3019 (Law) Jacobs. This course covers the full range of criminal procedures applicable to juve-niles: searches and seizures, pretrialinterrogation, confidentiality, diver-son, pretrial detention, transfer toadult court, right to counsel, sentenc-ing, conditions of confinement, etc. Inaddition, the casebook is augmentedwith some materials on juvenile crime,juvenile criminal records, and the han-dling of juvenile offenders in othercountries.

This seminar discusses the literature of the sociology of punishment and thevarious theoretical traditions throughwhich the institutions of penality havebeen understood. It is particularlyconcerned with developing a sociologi-cal account of contemporary patternsof penal practice in the United Statesand elsewhere. Criminal Sanctions G62.2022 (Law and Society)/ L04.3525 (Law)Garland. This seminar examines current issues in the sentencing and sanctioning ofoffenders. Using historical, sociologi-cal, and philosophical approaches, itaims to develop a critical understand-ing of contemporary policies and prac-tices of punishment. Readings dealwith policies such as incapacitation,just desserts, expressive justice, andretribution and look at the decisionmaking and practices of the institu-tions that implement them. The aim isto ground normative analysis (as devel-oped by the philosophical literature) ina more empirical knowledge of howpenal institutions actually work. Death Penalty G62.2028 (Law and Society)/L06.3577 (Law) Garland. The aim of this seminar is to develop an in-depth analysis of the institutionof capital punishment and to address aseries of questions to which it givesrise. Using historical and sociologicalresearch, the seminar explores how theforms, functions, and social meaningsof capital punishment have changedover time and what social forces havedriven these changes. Thereafter, thecourse focuses on the modern Americandeath penalty and the specific charac-teristics of the institution that hastaken shape in the post-Furman era. Race, Poverty, and Criminal Justice G62.2027 (Law and Society)/L04.3512(Law) Stevenson. Examines the influence of race and vic- tim-offender economic status in theadministration of criminal justice.Conscious and unconscious racism aswell as overt and more complicatedmechanisms for creating bias againstthe poor are explored. Students studyracial disparities in charging, discre-tionary judgments in the prosecution ofcriminal cases, sentencing, and the for-mulation of crime policy in the UnitedStates, and discuss issues of race and class in criminal case court decisions.Students assess the effectiveness ofantidiscrimination law in the crime andpunishment area and review data andempirical studies on a variety of issuesthat impact the poor and people ofcolor in the criminal justice system.Particular attention is paid to the roleof legislators, prosecutors, state andfederal judges, defense attorneys, andjurors, and litigation and other reformstrategies aimed at bias against racialminorities and the poor are discussed. Policing in Democratic Societies G62.2023 (Law and Society)/L04.3533(Law) Fijnaut, Skolnick. What are the origins of democratic policing? How are police organized,and how do they function? Why dolaw enforcement officials act the waythey do, in patrolling, searching, seiz-ing, interrogating? What are the occa-sions, explanations, and remedies forpolice brutality, corruption, and per-jury? What kinds of rules, organiza-tions, and institutions are appropriateand effective for maintaining policeaccountability in a democratic society?Although students discuss some con-stitutional cases, this is not a system-atic seminar in the doctrine of policepractices. Rather, the focus is on thehistory, sociology, and politics of thepolice. Police accountability throughpolitics and law is a major concern. Gun Control G62.2025 (Law and Society)/L04.3525 (Law) Jacobs, Noble. This seminar examines the problem that firearms and other weapons posefor contemporary society and the con-stitutional, statutory, administrative,and court-made laws relating to theregulation of firearms and otherweaponry. Topics include firearms andcrime; firearms and self-defense; theSecond Amendment as a limitation oncongressional regulation; federalismand the federal role in the regulatingof firearms; the role of the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; theconflict between state and local gov-ernment in regulating firearms; crimi-nal law issues (including aggravatedoffenses, prophylactic offenses, andpresumptions); sentencing law issues(bootstrapping and other enhance-ments for crimes committed withfirearms); the prohibition and regula-tion of subcategories of firearms (e.g.,\"Saturday night specials\" and \"assaultrifles\"); products liability and guncontrol; controls on ammunition; con-trols on less lethal weaponry (knives, mace, and brass knuckles); and con-trols on more lethal weaponry (explo-sives and military weapons). Regulation of Vice G62.2024 (Law and Society)/L04.3559 (Law) Skolnick. What is vice and how does it differ from crime? If we criminalize it, canwe regulate it? And if we decriminalizeit, how shall we regulate it? This semi-nar discusses a range of \"vices\" and reg-ulatory strategies that might beapplied. Because students need to knowmuch about the nature of the \"vice\" inorder to sensibly discuss policy options,there is considerable reading, some of itrequired, others recommended. Corruption and Corruption Control G62.2026 (Law and Society)/L04.3510(Law) Goldstock. This seminar examines the pervasive problem of official corruption and thevarious bodies of law and legal institu-tions that exist to prevent, detect, andpunish corruption. Topics includebribery and antigratuity statutes; thefederal role in investigating and prose-cuting state and local corruptionunder the Hobbes Act and mailstatutes; conflict of interest government service administrativeenforcement strategies and sanctions. Deviance and Social Control G62.2020 (Law and Society)/G93.2160 (Sociology) Greenberg. Broad, introductory course in the soci- ology of deviance and social control.Students read and analyze classical andcontemporary texts representing dif-ferent theoretical and research tradi-tions, dealing with the designation ofsome types of behavior and conditionsas deviant; ideologies and methods ofsocial control; the etiology of deviance;deviant subcultures; and the politics ofdeviance. An attempt is made toexamine a wide range of normativeviolations, such as crime, mental ill-ness, witchcraft, scientific deviance,alcohol and drug use, and varioustypes of sexual deviance. Health Law G62.2002 (Law and Society)/L13.3525 (Law) Law. Considers how the law influences the availability, quality, and cost of med-ical care, and demands a sophisticatedLAW AND SOCIETY 211understanding of many bodies of law, including the Constitution; state andfederal administrative law; the regula-tion of insurance; the defining benefit and regulato-ry programs; tort principles of duty,consent, confidentiality, and malprac-tice; corporate law (profit and not-for-profit); labor law; tax law; and more.However, the focus is not primarilylegal. Rather, the effort is to grapplewith defining life experiences and toexplore the political, philosophical,and personal values that shape theseexperiences. Statutes, regulations, andjudicial decisions are primary sourcematerials, but these are placed in anempirical policy context. Empirical Issues in Land Use and Environmental Law G62.2004 (Law and Society)/L10.3501 (Law) Been. This seminar explores the empirical assumptions that underlie leading the-oretical justifications for variousaspects of land use and environmentallaw, survey and critique existingempirical evidence bearing upon thoseassumptions, and formulate researchplans for further tests of the assump-tions. Particular attention is given tothe empirical bases for various theoriesregarding when compensation shouldbe paid for environmental and land userestrictions imposed upon property.The course does not assume statisticalor econometric knowledge, nor arestudents asked to conduct statisticaltests. Instead, the emphasis is onlearning to identify often hiddenempirical assumptions, gaining rudi-mentary understanding of empiricalmethodologies, and developing anability to formulate research questionsfor persons (such as expert witnesses)who do have the econometric skillsnecessary to actually execute the stud-ies. Students prepare short critiques ofexisting empirical studies and presenta proposal for an empirical study.Students who wish to use the seminarfor a part A paper may use the propos-al as the springboard for a longeranalysis. The seminar lays the ground-work for developing a clinic in whichstudents provide empirical analysesnecessary for informed land use andenvironmental policy discussions.Although a background in land use orenvironmental law is not an absoluteprerequisite, some familiarity with atleast one of those areas is desirable.Land Use, Housing, and Community Development in NewYork City G62.1106 (Law and Society)/L10.3506 (Law) Schill, Upham. Overview of the theory and practice of urban development in low- and mod-erate-income neighborhoods. Focus ison three specific subject areas: landuse, housing, and community develop-ment. Begins with background read-ings on the growth of cities and urbaneconomies, the interaction of demo-graphics and markets, and the legalframework of local government in gen-eral. Then looks in detail at a series ofcase studies selected to illustrate thefundamental legal, political, and eco-nomic issues in land use and housing.The primary goal for the seminar isthe familiarization of the studentswith the legal and political frame-works within which developmenttakes place in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in New YorkCity. A second goal is the explicationin several concrete settings of the rela-tionship between legal doctrine\u2014thepresentations of \"legal frameworks\"that begin the seminar and each casestudy\u2014and what actually results fromthe interaction of legal, political, andeconomic forces. A third goal is thetraining of students in empirical field-work and sociolegal methodology.Fieldwork reports provide an opportu-nity for students to integrate empiricalinvestigation with theory building. Sex Discrimination Law G62.2006 (Law and Society)/L08.3508 (Law)Ellis, Goldscheid. Taught by feminist practitioners, this course seeks to integrate feminist theo-ry with the practice of women's rightslaw by examining a wide range of con-temporary women's rights legal issues.Beginning with the development ofconstitutional protection for genderdiscrimination, the course examinestopics such as reproductive rights,educational equity, violence againstwomen, employment, and gender biasin the courts, with attention to howwomen's rights concerns intersect withissues of race, class, and sexual orienta-tion. The course discusses how litiga-tion, public policy, and legislativestrategies have and can be used toachieve feminist visions of equality.Sexuality and the Law G62.2007 (Law and Society)/L08.3509 (Law)Ettelbrick. Begins with the development of consti- tutional, medical, and theoretical con-structions of sexuality. The question ofhow state regulations and legal analysispromote or reflect certain views of sex-uality, gender, and sexual orientation iscentral to discussion and study. Thelater part of the course applies thisbackground to three specific institu-tional contexts in which the socialrules of sexuality and gender are chal-lenged and charged through the legalprocess: the military, marriage and thefamily, and the workplace. Intimate and Family Violence L08.3501 (Law) Mills. Lawyers and social workers are often unprepared for the unique emotional,legal, and cultural challenges posed byworking with survivors of intimateabuse. In part, the tension lies betweenthe public feminist discourse ondomestic violence and the individualrealities of battered women's lives.Drawing on legal and related socialwork research and methods, this inter-disciplinary course for law and socialwork students explores how to recon-cile cultural, political, mental health,and safety concerns as they are reflect-ed in the movement to address domes-tic violence. Using empirical studies asa platform for exploring diverseapproaches to working with batteredwomen, their batterers, and their chil-dren, this course develops a methodthat lawyers and social workers can useto traverse such issues as the batterer'srecidivism and the victim's autonomy.Developing a critique of feminist theo-ry from the survivor's point of view iskey to improving existing strategiesfor addressing domestic abuse. Rights of the Mentally Disabled G62.2008 (Law and Society)/L08.3535(Law) Levy. Study of the delicate balance between government benevolence and individ-ual autonomy. This seminar considersthe rights of persons with mental dis-abilities in institutional and communi-ty settings and explores issues involv-ing psychiatric expertise, involuntarycommitment, the right to treatment,the right to refuse treatment, discrimi-nation, the rights of newborns withmental disabilities (the \"Baby Doe\"cases) and medical decision making forincompetent persons (Cruzan, et. al.).212 LAW AND SOCIETYStudents examine the development of case law and statutes and the socialpolicies underlying them, analyzebriefs and transcripts from selected cases,and attend a commitment hearing. Free Speech, Censorship, and Culture G62.1204 (Law and Society)/L01.3502 (Law) Adler. Examines the law of free speech and censorship from an interdisciplinaryperspective. Explores the followingquestions: What are the roots of theimpulse to censor? What culturalassumptions are embedded in FirstAmendment law and theory? Howdoes censorship law reflect or reinforcecultural anxieties about certain sub-jects, such as gender and class, andabout certain forms of expression, suchas technology and art? In what waysdoes censorship law shape literature,art, and popular culture? Readingsinclude First Amendment case law andtheory as well as selections from otherdisciplines III. COMPARATIVE AND GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES Comparative Law and Social Change G62.3001 (Law and Society)/G93.3534 (Sociology) This seminar explores the historical and structural interrelationshipsbetween law, politics, and economy inthe United States and Europe in the20th century. Starting with the theo-ries of Marx and Weber and the his-torical work of Horwitz, Hurot,Merryman, and Tigar and Levy, thefocus is on the analysis of 20th-centu-ry developments such as legal realism,the legal process approach, feministjurisprudence, critical legal studies,and the economic analysis of law.Parallel jurisprudential movements areanalyzed for Europe (e.g., the work ofthe early critical legal theoristsFraenkel, Kirchheimer, and Neumannand the theories of Luhmann, Teubner,and Habermas). Concludes with aninquiry into the underpinnings ofstate socialist, fascist, and postsocialistlegal systems. History and Theory of International Law L06.3539 (Law) Kingsbury. This course explores the intellectual foundations of contemporary interna-tional law. The aim is to embed think-ing about international law in widerbodies of political and legal theory.The course considers the competingapproaches to international order developed by Grotius, Pufendorf,Hobbes, and some of their modernsuccessors, including fundamentalconcepts of sovereignty, anarchy, andsociety, and rights and law in interna-tional relations; the approaches toimperialism and colonial expansiontaken by Vitoria, Gentili, Locke, and19th-century British international law withcolonial and postcolonial projects; thevitality of alternative models of inter-national order and alternative historiesof international law; the theoreticalunderpinnings of the positivist-pro-gressivist mainstream of internationallaw in the 20th century, with a partic-ular focus on Oppenheim and on therelations of law to power; the imagina-tion and problems of international lawas law and as a discipline and of theroles of international lawyers. Indigenous Peoples in International Law L05.3547 (Law) Kingsbury. Issues concerning indigenous peoples (including descendants of precolonialinhabitants in the Americas andAustralasia and groups in Asia andelsewhere) are increasingly significantin many countries and in the UnitedNations, the World Bank, theOrganization of American States, andother international institutions. Thisseminar discusses challenges to thestandard liberal concepts and to demo-cratic theory posed by such issues asthe meaning and problems of the con-cept of indigenous rights; the natureand meaning of the right to self-deter-mination (including native peoples'self-determination if Quebec secedesfrom Canada and important develop-ments in indigenous peoples' rights inLatin American states); tensionsbetween individual rights and grouprights in minority rights envi-ronmental law; and indigenous peo-ples' rights under international tradeand intellectual property regimes. Children's Rights in International Law L05.3563 (Law) Alston. This seminar focuses on the evolution of children's human rights within thecontext of international law and theextent to which they have influencedthe content and institutional arrange-ments for the promotion of humanrights. The Unites Nations conventionon the Rights of the Child, the most widely ratified human rights treaty inhistory, provides the framework for dis-cussions. The seminar considers thebackground drafting of the 1989Convention and ways in which thebroader international law frameworkimpacts upon children. It explores con-ceptual dilemmas involved in therecognition of these rights; the contentof the major principles enshrined inthe Convention (notably the principlesof nondiscrimination; the best interestsof the child; and children's right toparticipate). The focus exploitation. International Human Rights L05.3034 (Law) Alston. This course provides a general intro- duction to the role of human rights inthe 21st century.

Themes that runthroughout the course include culturalrelativism, the relationship betweenrights and duties, the \"public-private\"distinction, and the changing concep-tions of statehood and sovereignty.The course concentrates on the UnitedNations system, dealing with bothcharter-based and treaty-basedarrangements. In order to illustratethe functions and processes of institu-tions, the course looks at issues such asdisappearances, arbitrary detention,female circumcision, homosexuality,political participation, and democrati-zation. The role of nonstate actors, andcorporations in particular, is examined. War Crimes and International Criminal Courts L05.3552 (Law) Alston. This seminar traces the evolution of International Humanitarian Law fromthe 19th century through Nuremburgto its current application by the inter-national criminal tribunals. Particularemphasis is on aspects of theInternational Criminal Court, whichwill be in the process of being estab-lished as the seminar progresses.

Morespecifically, students read and discussopinions of the courts and analyze therole these institutions play in thestructure of constitutional govern-ments. The origins of judicial reviewand tensions between democraticaccountability and constitutional adju-dication are also discussed. Law and Development L06.3554 (Law) Holmes, Upham. This course examines the various theo- ries of the role that law and legal insti-tutions play in national economic,social, and political development anduse empirical evidence from selectedcountries to critique these theories.Approaches range from neoclassicaleconomics to cultural determinism toinstitutional sociology and include thework of authors like Douglas North,Amartya Sen, Chalmers Johnson, andHernando de Soto.

Islamic Law and Society G62.3006 (Law and Society)/G77.1852 (MiddleEastern and Islamic Studies)/L05.3560(Law) Haykel. The aim of this seminar is to expose graduate students to a variety of writ-ings in and on Islamic law. The firstreadings consist of introductory sur-veys. These are followed by recentstudies on the theoretical foundationsof Islamic law (usul alfiqh). Students then sample some substantive legalmaterial as it is presented in the classi-cal legal manuals. The aim here is to give a sense of the way in whichIslamic law was traditionally presentedand how these manuals were then usedby scholars. This is followed by anexamination of the methods and formsof transmission of Islamic legal knowl-edge and expertise. Students then lookat a number of studies that depictIslamic law as it was understood, prac-ticed, and enforced. Next, studentslook at the treatment of Islamic juristsof marginals and minorities in theoreti-cal writings as well as historical experi-ence in order to explore how normswere established and enforced and howthose who did not fully fit these wereconceived and treated by the law.Finally, students survey the attempts toreform Islamic law in modern times. Women and Islamic Law G62.3007 (Law and Society)/G77.1854 (MiddleEastern and Islamic Studies) Haykel. Acquaints students with the ways Islamic law has treated women in the-ory and practice.

In addition, students lookat the ways in which modern legisla-tion in the Muslim world has treatedwomen and discuss the debates overtheir rights and identity that havetaken place amongst feminists (bothMuslim and non-Muslim) andIslamists and in international bodiessuch as the United Nations. Comparative Criminal Justice Clinic: Focus on Domestic ViolenceL02.2504 (Law) Das Dasgupta, Maguigan. Domestic violence occurs everywhere, with different resonances in differentcultures. Every country has a criminaljustice system, but the attempt to usearrest and prosecution as tools againstdomestic violence is far from universal.Within each nation where domestic violence is prosecuted, there is debateabout whether a criminal-courtapproach will ever make more than amarginal difference. This debate, examined in a comparative and inter-disciplinary context, is the focus of theweekly seminar. Specific areas ofinquiry include mandatory arrest,prosecutorial discretion, no-drop poli-cies, and mandatory reporting to lawenforcement by health care providers.The main points of comparison areIndia and the United States. Legal Changes After Communism L05.3522 (Law) Holmes.

The Graduate RecordExamination is required of all applicants. The department has two different degree programs, and applicantsshould specify the degree program forwhich they are applying. The depart-ment's principal degree program is theM.A.-Ph.D. program, for studentsinterested in a career in research. Moststudents admitted to the departmentenroll in this program. Exceptionally, students may enroll in a terminal M.A. program. A stu-dent who is permitted to enroll in theterminal M.A. program and who sub-sequently wishes to enter the M.A.-Ph.D. program must apply to thedepartment for admission to the latteralongside all new applicants.Acceptance is not automatic. MASTER OF ARTS A student enrolled in the terminalM.A. program must select a track inaccordance with the student's interests.Upon selecting a track, the studentthen selects an adviser who specializesin that area. Degree Requirements: 1. Satisfactory completion of graduate studies totaling at least 32 points ofapproved courses (at least 24 in resi-dence at New York University).Course work in a field other than lin-guistics must be approved in advanceby the student's adviser. The M.A. program is organized by track. Each track has its own courserequirements, which add up to 24 ofthe 32 points required for the M.A.The courses that the student takes forthe remaining 8 points are determinedby the student in consultation withthe student's Linguistics: G61.1210, G61.1220, G61.1310, G61.1310, the following:G61.1220, G61.1410, G61.1510, orG61.1830. Any proposed substitution of some other course for a \"track\" course mustbe approved both by the student'sadviser and the director of graduatestudies. 2. Reasonable proficiency in a foreign language of clear relevance to the stu-dent's research, subject to approval bythe director of graduate studies.Proficiency can be demonstrated eitherby earning a grade of B or better in atleast the fourth term of a college for-eign language course completed notmore than two years before the stu-dent's admission to the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science, or by pass-ing the appropriate Graduate School ofArts and Science foreign language pro-ficiency examination. When proficien-cy has been demonstrated in someother way (e.g., when a student hasreceived an undergraduate degree froma foreign university where the languagein question was the medium of instruc-tion for the student's course of study),the director of graduate studies mayforward to GSAS a request for a waiverof the foreign language examination. 3. Passing a written examination that should be taken during the term inwhich course work is completed (andmust be taken for the first time nolater than the term following the onein which course work is completed).Students may take the examination asecond time if necessary. MASTER OF ARTS-DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY M.A. Degree Requirements: 1. Satisfactory completion of graduate studies totaling at least 32 points ofapproved courses (at least 24 in resi-dence at New York G61.1210, While onlyone of the last four courses is requiredfor the M.A., all four of them arerequired for the Ph.D. Therefore, anyof these four courses not taken for theM.A. should be taken as soon as possi-ble thereafter. Students wishing to specialize in syntax or semantics are required totake G61.2370. Students takingG61.2370 must take it in the semesterimmediately following G61.1340. The department recommends that students wishing to specialize in soci-olinguistics take at least two courses inlinguistic anthropology, specificallyLinguistic Anthropology (G14.1040)and one other from the following:Ethnographic Methods (G14.2700),Identity and Language (G14.3392), orLinguistic Field Methods (G14.3394). The department does not normally transfer credits for previous graduatecourse work. In exceptional circum-stances, a small number of graduatecredits may be transferred. The stu-dent will be advised by the director ofgraduate studies concerning equivalen-cies. Requests for transfers of creditsfor particular courses must be madewithin the student's first year in thedepartment. 2. Reasonable proficiency in a foreign language of clear relevance to the stu-dent's research, subject to approval bythe director of graduate studies.Proficiency can be demonstrated eitherby earning a grade of B or better in atleast the fourth term of a college for-eign language course completed notmore than two years before the stu-dent's admission to the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science, or by passing theappropriate Graduate School of Arts LINGUISTICS 217AFFILIATED FACULTY IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS Doris R.

When proficiency hasbeen demonstrated in some other way(e.g., when a student has received anundergraduate degree from a foreignuniversity where the language in ques-tion was the medium of instruction forthe student's course of study), the direc-tor of graduate studies may forward toGSAS a request for a waiver of the for-eign language examination. 3. An article-quality paper in which the student demonstrates the ability tocarry out original research. This is thestudent's first qualifying paper; thePh.D. degree requires a second one. Therules and timetables for the two qualify-ing papers are spelled out together initem 4 of the Ph.D. requirements. Ph.D. Degree Requirements : 1. A Master of Arts degree in linguis- tics, as described above. 2. Completion of 40 points of approved course work beyond the mas-ter's degree, including G61.1340,G61.1410, G61.1510, and G61.1830,if the student did not take them at theM.A. level. Students must offer a totalof 72 points of course work includingwork required for the master's degreeor its equivalent. 3. In addition to the foreign language requirement for the M.A. degree, thestudent must demonstrate reasonableproficiency in a second foreign lan-guage of clear relevance to the student'sresearch, subject to approval by thedirector of graduate studies. Proficiencycan be demonstrated either by earninga grade of B or better in at least thefourth term of a college foreign lan-guage course completed not more thantwo years before the student's admis-sion to the Graduate School of Arts andScience, or by passing the appropriateGraduate School of Arts and Scienceforeign language proficiency examina-tion. When proficiency has beendemonstrated in some other way (e.g.,when a student has received an under-graduate degree from a foreign univer-sity where the language in question wasthe medium of instruction for the stu-dent's course of study), the director ofgraduate studies may forward to GSASa request for a waiver of the foreign lan-guage examination. 4. Qualifying papers in two different areas of linguistics. A qualifying paper(QP) is called \"qualifying\" because by ita student demonstrates that she/he isqualified to do a dissertation. It containsoriginal thought, a command of the lit-erature, sound linguistic analysis andargumentation, and clear presentation. Length of the paper. Each paper must be no more than 50 pages, double-spaced, in length (tables, charts, spec-trograms, footnotes, and bibliographyincluded). Qualifying paper committee. Each qualifying-paper committee will con-sist of the committee chair and twoother faculty members. The timetable for submission. The stu- dent will submit the first QP in thefourth semester of the student's careerand the second in the fifth semester. Ifone of the QPs contains an extensiveempirical component, one semester isadded to that QP's timetable. Thus, ifit is the second QP , it will be due inthe sixth semester rather than thefifth. This alteration of the timetablemust be agreed upon by the adviserand the director of graduate studies nolater than the beginning of the semes-ter when the QP would otherwise havebeen due (e.g., the beginning of thefifth semester in the example justmentioned). Students are expected to submit acceptable QPs on time. If a student'spaper is either not submitted on timeor submitted but not deemed accept-able by the student's committee, thenthe student is placed on academic pro-bation prior to the end of the semester.If the student fails to submit anacceptable paper in the followingsemester, then the student is terminat-ed. When a student on academic pro-bation submits an acceptable QP andreturns to good standing, the student'sQP timetable is adjusted by onesemester. However, if a student was onacademic probation for the first QP ,the student will not be permitted togo on academic probation because ofthe nonsubmission, lateness, or unac-ceptability of the second QP; instead,the student will be terminated. Insum, the first time a student fails tosubmit an acceptable QP on time, thestudent goes on academic probation.The second time this happens in thecourse of a student's career (whether itis on the first QP or the second), thestudent is terminated. The student's QP committee, in evaluating the QP , will ordinarilydeem it either acceptable or notacceptable. However, student's QP committeemay QP \"acceptable uponrevision.\" In this case, the committeewill provide the student with a state-ment of the needed changes. The stu-dent will have four weeks from receiptof the committee's decision to makethe indicated changes. In this case, astudent whose revised version is accepted does not go on academic pro-bation, and the student's timetable isnot affected. Thus, if the QP in ques-tion is the student's first, the secondQP is still due in the next semester.On the other hand, if the revisions arenot deemed acceptable by the commit-tee, then the student's paper is notaccepted, and the student will go onacademic probation and be required tosubmit an acceptable version duringthe following semester. Probation isregulated by GSAS. The M.A. degree for students in the M.A.-Ph.D. program. When a student's first paper is accepted, the student will be eligible for an M.A. degree,provided that the student has met theM.A. course and foreign languagerequirements. Changing topics. If a student's first submission is not accepted, the stu-dent is permitted to change the topicor even the area of linguistics, provid-ed that the student's two acceptablequalifying papers are in two differentareas of linguistics. Changing thetopic does not alter the student'stimetable or the student's status rela-tive to academic probation or termina-tion. If a student changes the topic orarea after the first submission is notaccepted, the second submission isprecisely that, a second submission ofthe first QP . The relationship of a student's advisers to the student's qualifying-paper commit-tees. One of the student's overall advis- ers may additionally function as amember of one or both of the student'squalifying-paper committees (and asthe chair of one of them). It is, howev-er, not presumed that an adviser willdo so, and students are encouraged toinvolve a wide range of faculty mem-bers in the preparation of their quali-fying papers. 5. Dissertation proposal. After a stu- dent has completed the second quali-fying paper, the student then beginswork on a dissertation proposal. Oncethe student has selected the area inwhich she/he wishes to write a disser-tation, the student should meet withher/his potential dissertation adviserand obtain that faculty member'sagreement to serve in that capacity.Together the student and the disserta- tion adviser will explore potential top-ics for the dissertation. Students may incorporate one (or both) of the qualifying papers into thedissertation proposal if appropriate.Similarly, it is fully expected that largesections of the dissertation proposalLINGUISTICS 219will go directly into the dissertation. The timetable for submission. A stu- dent may hand in a dissertation pro-posal at any time during the fallsemester; during the spring semester,the proposal must be handed in by theMonday immediately following springbreak. The timetable for completion of the dissertation proposal is sensitive to thetimetable for QPs (above). Specifically,it is sensitive to whether or not one ofthe student's QPs contained extensiveempirical content and therefore tookan additional semester to complete. If neither of the student's QPs con- tained extensive empirical content, thestudent will submit the dissertationproposal during the fourth year. Thestudent's dissertation proposal has tobe submitted and accepted by the endof the first semester of the fifth year. Ifthat does not happen, then the studentwill be placed on academic probationthe following semester. If the student'sproposal is not submitted and accept-ed in the student's first semester onacademic probation (i.e., the secondsemester of the fifth year), then thestudent will be terminated. If one of the student's QPs con- tained extensive empirical content, thestudent will submit a dissertation pro-posal during the fourth year or, at thelatest, by the end of the first semesterof the fifth year. The student's disser-tation proposal has to be submitted and accepted by the end of the fifthyear. If that does not happen, then thestudent will be placed on academicprobation the following semester. Ifthe student's proposal is not submittedand accepted in the student's firstsemester on academic probation (i.e.,the first semester of the sixth year),then the student will be terminated. All students should note that the timetable for dissertation proposals isnot adjusted for a student who hadearlier been on academic probation forfailure to get a QP accepted in thesemester in which it was due.Regardless of a student's QP history,the timetable for dissertation proposalsis that which is stated above. Evaluation of the proposal. Once a stu- dent submits a proposal, then the stu-dent's committee will evaluate it. Ifthe committee finds the proposalacceptable, then the student may pro-ceed to work on the dissertation. If thecommittee does not find the proposalacceptable, it will notify the student asto what changes it recommends. Thestudent may then submit a revisedproposal in the following semester. Completion of other requirements. Ordinarily, a student whose disserta-tion proposal has been accepted hasalready met the other nondissertationrequirements for the Ph.D. (i.e., theforeign language and course require-ments). A student who has reached this level and has not yet met theserequirements is encouraged to do so atonce. 6. Defense of the dissertation is during a final oral examination. Full-time status: To qualify for full- time status, M.A.-Ph.D. studentsenroll in courses according to the fol-lowing schedule. The three coursescompleted in the fourth and fifth yearsmust be seminars; they cannot bereading courses. First Year: fall, 12 points; spring, 12 points. Second Year: fall, 12 points; spring, 8 points. Third Year: fall, 8 points; spring, 8 points. Fourth Year: fall, 4 points; spring, 4 points. Fifth Year: 4 points.

Newman DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE: W. Ste phen Childress CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Joel H. Spencer DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Fedor A. Bogomolov he Department of Mathematics ofthe Courant Insti-tute Mathemat- ical Sciences offers several degreeprograms. Ph.D. programsoffer research opportunities andinstruction at the highest levelin a range of core, multidiscipli-nary, and computational mathe-matics. In addition to the Ph.D.programs in mathematics, thedepartment cooperates in aPh.D. program in atmosphereocean science and computation andmathematical computa-tional techniques of scientificcomputing, as well as in tradi-tional core areas of mathematics.A new master's program in com-putational biology is planned. The philosophy of the Courant Institute, developedover several decades, has been tomaintain a balance and interac- tion between pure and appliedmathematics. The Institute haslong been a leader in mathemat-ical analysis, applied mathemat-ics, and computational science.In core mathematics, systems. theInstitute's encompassesresearch activities inmost ocean science,mathematical biology, financialmodeling, and materials science.Much of the research is exter-nally funded and involves post-doctoral scientists. There is anactive program of research semi-nars, and participation by stu-dents is strongly encouraged. New York University is a member of the Inter-UniversityDoctoral Consortium (see page324 of this bulletin), whosemembers include City Univer-sity of New York Graduate Cen-ter; Columbia, Fordham, NewSchool, Princeton, Rutgers, andStony Brook Universities; andTeachers College, Columbia University. With permission,doctoral students may cross-reg- ister for courses in these institu-tions and thus have access to avery broad range of mathematicsand related fields. The Department of Mathe- matics is housed in WarrenWeaver Hall, which contains a mathematical sciences library of64,000 volumes, over 275 jour-nals, extensive back files, and agrowing array of electronicresources such as Web of Science(ISI) and MathSciNet. Over1,300 electronic scientific jour-nal titles in various disciplinesare available at the University.Every Ph.D. student has a work-station on his or her desk. Inaddition, workstations and PCsare available in public locations.The Applied Mathematics Labo-ratory comprises an experimen-tal facility in fluid mechanicsand other applied areas, coupledwith a visualization and simula-tion facility. The Center forAtmosphere Ocean Studies isthe locus for multidisciplinarystudies and research in criticalenvironmental problems, such asglobal warming, ozone deple-tion, monsoon and El Ni\u00f1ocycles, and pollution of air andwater; it organizes a weekly col-loquium and brings togetherinterested faculty and studentsfrom different departments. 251 MERCER STREET NEW YORK, NY 10012-1185 WEB SITE: (mathematics), Buenos Aires.

A student may berequired by his or her dissertationadviser to learn additional languages,in keeping with the student's specificresearch needs. As early as possible in their gradu- ate studies, students should choose amajor field and begin focusing theirstudies on it. Subject to the availabili-ty of faculty, major fields may includeIslamic studies; ancient Egyptian classical literature; Turkishlanguage and literature. Students pri-marily interested in Middle Easternhistory should see below for informa-tion about the joint Ph.D. program inhistory and Middle Eastern studies. By the end of their third year of graduate study, students should havetaken and passed the written qualify-ing examination in their major field.Students prepare for this examinationby course work and by workingthrough a reading list for the fieldunder the supervision of the facultymember who will examine them; eachexamination will have a second readeras well. Students who do not pass theirmajor field examination may petitionthe department for permission to takethe examination one more time. Students must also be certified in a minor field, which should be distinctfrom the major field but complemen-tary to it in subject matter or theoreti-cal concern. Students should develop acoherent minor field in consultationwith their minor field adviser andobtain the approval of the director of graduate studies; certification requiresat least three courses in the minorfield and a substantial piece of writ-ing, either a major research paper or asubstantial bibliographical essay.

On completionof all course work (including all incom-pletes) and the fulfillment of all lan-guage requirements, the student mustpass an oral examination in his or herspecial field, defined in consultationwith the student's adviser and approvedby the director of graduate studies. Thestudent's adviser and two other facultymembers serve as the examiners.Discussion of the dissertation proposaland its relation to the relevant scholarlyliterature is a key component of thespecial field examination. Successfulcompletion of the special field examina-tion constitutes approval of the disser-tation proposal, subject to whateverrevisions are indicated as a result of theexamination itself. The completed dissertation must conform to departmental and GraduateSchool of Arts and Science standards, beread and approved by the student'ssupervisor and two other faculty mem-bers, and be defended in a public oraldefense in which those three readers andtwo additional examiners participate.

Admission: Students primarily inter- ested in the history of the Middle Eastshould seek admission to the jointPh.D. program in history and MiddleEastern studies, in accordance with theprocedures specified by the Depart-ments of Middle Eastern and IslamicStudies and History. Admission to thejoint program is contingent on out-standing academic performance and isprovisional until the completion of allM.A. requirements and until qualify-ing examinations are taken and passed.

Students should begin defining the fields of historical study in which theywish to specialize and concentrate asearly as possible. Joint program stu-dents must also take the \"methods\"course required of all history graduatestudents. Between their second andthird year of full-time study, studentsmust take and pass a qualifying exam-ination in each of two major fields ofhistory. One field must be MiddleEastern; the other may be MiddleEastern or one of the other fieldsdefined by the Department of History.Subject to the availability of faculty,Middle Eastern fields may includemodern Middle Eastern history (1750-present), early modern Middle Easternhistory (1200-1800), and early Islamichistory (600-1200); other MiddleEastern history fields may be approvedlater. Each student's choice of fieldsmust be approved by the directors ofgraduate studies of both departments. Both qualifying examinations are nor- mally taken at the end of the samesemester, but students may petition totake one of their examinations no laterthan the end of the following semester.Students who do not pass a qualifyingexamination may petition for permissionto take it one more time. Studentspreparing for an examination in any ofthe fields for which the Department ofHistory prescribes \"literature of thefield\" courses must take those courses.For Middle Eastern history fields, it islikely that preparation for examinationsin those fields will be done not in formalliterature of the field courses butthrough reading courses or informally, ina manner to be arranged by each facultymember. In either case, students preparefor their qualifying examinations bycourse work in the field and by workingthrough a reading list for the field underthe supervision of the faculty memberwho will examine them; each examina-tion will have a second reader as well. After successfully completing the qualifying examinations, the studentshould begin to formulate a disserta-tion proposal, in consultation with thestudent's primary dissertation adviser.On completion of all course work(including all incompletes) and the232 MIDDLE EASTERN AND ISLAMIC STUDIESfulfillment of all language require- ments, the student must pass an oralexamination in his or her special field,defined in consultation with the stu-dent's adviser (who must be a full,associated, or affiliated member of theDepartment of History) and approvedby the directors of graduate studies ofthe Departments of History andMiddle Eastern and Islamic Studies.The student's adviser and two otherfaculty members serve as examiners.Discussion of the dissertation proposaland its relation to the relevant scholar-ly literature are a key component ofthe special field examination.Successful completion of the specialfield examination constitutes approval of the dissertation proposal, subject towhatever revisions are indicated as aresult of the examination itself.

INTERNSHIPS One of the unique opportunities opento students in the program is the indi-vidualized and project-oriented person-al internship placement for one semes-ter or more (approximately 300 hours).As the artistic, financial, and culturalcenter of the country, New York Cityhas the largest concentration of muse-ums anywhere in the world. Thus, stu-dents may work at one of the morethan 90 museums in the metropolitanarea or elsewhere in the United Statesand abroad. Placements are based onthe student's long-range goals, academ- ic specialization, area of museum careergoals, experience, and skills. Placementsare made at (but are not limited to) thefollowing: American Museum ofNatural History, National Museum ofthe American Indian, Asia Society,Brooklyn Museum of Art, BrooklynHistorical Society, New York StateMuseum, Museum of the City of NewYork, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, New Museumof Contemporary Art, New York Hallof Science, New York Public Library,Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum,Staten Island Historical Society, Statueof Liberty National Monument/EllisIsland (National Park Service),Whitney Museum, SmithsonianInstitution, and Grey Art Gallery atNew York University. In choosing aninternship, the student and the intern-ship coordinator give primacy to match-ing the goals set by the student to theexperience offered at the museum. The program considers the intern- ship a catalyst in the workplace forsynthesizing academic studies andpractical skills and in preparing stu-dents for placement and advancementas museum professionals. SPECIAL PROJECTS Students may participate in specialprojects and exhibitions, colloquia,and symposia organized by the pro-gram and/or by other institutes andacademic units at NYU. Studentsassisted with installation of an exhibitfor the public conference, \"Art andOptics: An Evaluation of DavidHockney's New Theories RegardingOpticality in Western Painting of thePast 600 Years,\" which was organizedby the New York Institute for theHumanities at NYU (December 1-2,2001). Past activities have includedstudent work on program contracts forthe collection, registration, and storageof historical collections at the Statue ofLiberty National Monument/EllisIsland (National Park Service) and onthe educational programming develop-ment for and staffing at the New YorkTransit Museum (Metropolitan Transit Authority).

ELECTIVES Topics in Museum Studies G49.3330 4points. Current issues in the museum profes- sion. Outside museum scholars, spe-cialists, and university faculty offer in-depth examination of topics. Practicums,with \"hands-on\" components, are alsooffered periodically under this coursenumber. Some examples are listedbelow. (Refer to the current courseschedule for particular seminars offeredin each academic year.) Topics in Museum Studies: Exhibiting the \"Latin Boom\" in theU.S.A. G49.3330 Coffey. 4 points. Examines exhibitions around, about, and for the diverse groups captured bythe rubric \"Latin\" in its current usage inthe United States. By focusing on signalexhibitions from the last three decades,examines not only how these culturecategories have been produced in muse-um exhibition, but also how they havechanged as a result of critical pressuresbrought to bear by the groups theyclaim to represent. Contextualizes this\"boom\" with respect to the politicaleconomy of free trade, globalization,and privatization; the cultural politics ofnationalism, diaspora, and citizenship;and the distinct histories of populationsdesignated by these broad labels. Topics in Museum Studies: Museums and Contemporary ArtG49.3330 Altshuler. 4 points. Investigates historical, theoretical, and practical aspects of the collecting andexhibiting of contemporary art inmuseums. Following a survey of thehistory of museums' exhibition of con-temporary works, the course focuses oncurrent issues of display and acquisi-tion. Topics include curatorial strate- gies for exhibition and collectiondevelopment, biennialism, specialproblems relating to new media, con-servation issues, and recent museumarchitecture designed for the display ofcontemporary art. The course alsoinvestigates conflicts of interest thatcan arise for museum staff and trusteesin collecting and exhibiting contem-porary art and art works created as acritique of the museum. Two shortessays, a class presentation, and a finalpaper are required. Topics in Museum Studies: Museums of Science, Nature andIndustry G49.3330 Feldman. 4 points. Examines the history and practice of science museums from Aldrovandi'smuseum in 16th-century Bologna toSea World. Students investigate a fullrange of museum types, includingmuseums of industrial history, medi-cine, aviation, space, natural history,and technology. The syllabus focuseson the key paradigms in the history ofscience museums, starting with thetheatre of nature and then movingthrough the great industrial displays,progress exhibitions, corporate muse-ums, and science centers. Throughreadings, discussion, and independentprojects, students consider the histori-cal and political contexts germane tothe various science museum para-digms, as well as arguments aboutclass, race, gender, and nation thatthey articulate. The goal of the courseis to develop a dynamic, historicallygrounded conception of scienceexhibits that incorporates material cul-ture, education, and critical theory.Readings include cultural history, mis-sion statements, and professional train-ing literature. Topics in Museum Studies: Anthropology Museums, MuseumAnthropology G49.3330 Feldman. 4points. Examines the history, structure, and social life of anthropology museumsand the study of museums by anthro-pologists, focusing on a broad range ofexamples from the mid-19th centuryto the present. The syllabus traces therole played by museums in developingvarious anthropological paradigms,including evolutionary ethnology,physical fieldwork, cul-tural relativism, natural repa-triation, and postmodernism. Thechallenge is to understand the globalprocesses and politics of buildingethnographic collections, displays, and 238 MUSEUM STUDIESMUSEUM STUDIES 239education programs, as well as the shifting role of the anthropologymuseum in the academy and the cul-ture industry. Students examine theemergence of the museum as the cele-brated focus of anthropological teach-ing, its subsequent demise, and thenits reemergence as the subject ofethnography itself. Topics in Museum Studies: Heritage and Memory in HistoryMuseums G49.3330 Feldman. 4points. Examines the controversial subject of museums that represent heritage, his-tory, and memory. Considering cases asdiverse as Colonial Williamsburg,Mexican American heritage museums,slavery museums in Africa, Holocaustmuseums, and museums of NativeAmerican history, seeks out commonthemes and problems that definemuseum representations of the past.Topics covered include authenticity, race, cultural property, cultural bro-kers, nationalism, interpretation, mul-tivocality, photography, contact zones,context, multiculturalism, and com-munity outreach. The objective is toexamine the connections and distinc-tions between the theory and practiceof exhibiting history and to under-stand how material culture, socialprocess, and historical events convergein the social production of collectionsand institutions. The focus is on muse-ums not merely as containers of histo-ry, but as social arenas that influenceand determine the politics, value, andexperience of the past. Accordingly,students are expected to develop a the-oretical toolkit for contextualizing andaddressing controversies in the her-itage industry.Research in Museum Studies G49.3915 1-4 points. Independent research on a topic deter- mined in consultation with the pro-gram director. Development, Fund-Raising, and Grantsmanship G49.2221 Himmelfarb. 4 points.

Indeed, our studentswork on a wide variety of topicsincluding jazz, popular music,film music, world musical tradi-tions, western art music, andmusical theatre. Recent gradu-ates hold academic appointmentsin some of the most prestigiousuniversities in the United Statesand Canada, and they are mak-ing distinguished contributions to scholarship and musical com-position on both the nationaland international levels. Thegraduate program in music isdeliberately small, admitting sixto eight students each year. Thecurriculum is research oriented;most courses are concerned withextending the boundaries of cur-rent knowledge. Located in the largest private university in the world and inthe world's most exciting city forarts and culture, the NYUDepartment of Music has accessto unmatched facilities andresources. The departmenthouses the American Institutefor Verdi Studies, containingperhaps the largest collection ofVerdi source materials in the world, and the Center for EarlyMusic, committed to the per-formance practice of medieval,Renaissance, and early baroquemusic and to combining aca-demic study with research in alaboratory performance setting.The department also sponsorsthe Washington Square Contem-porary Music Society, whichpresents professional concertseach year devoted to the mostrecent music of our time. The University is rich in sup- porting resources, including theElmer Holmes Bobst Library,which houses an important col-lection of music, books, periodi-cals, and microfilms of earlymusical sources. The Avery Fisher Center in the BobstLibrary has a leading collectionof videos and recordings. TheNoah Greenberg Collection ofMusical Instruments (containingthe collection of the New YorkPro Musica Antiqua) forms anucleus for the department'sensemble for the performance ofearly music, the CollegiumMusicum. Likewise, the WorldMusic Ensembles make use ofthe Affelder Collection, whichcontains a growing variety ofinstruments from throughoutthe world. In addition to the resources within the University, the NewYork City area presents limitless cultural facilities, among themthe New York Public Library, thePierpont Morgan Library, theMetropolitan Museum of Art, theSchomburg Center for Researchin Black Culture, the Center forTraditional Music and Dance, CityLore, the World Music Insti-tute, the Archives for Contempo-rary Music, and the manyperforming institutions active inthe city.

MUSIC 241Admission: All applicants to the department are encouraged to visit thedepartment in advance. Students areadmitted to the department's graduateprogram on the basis of a superior aca-demic record as evidenced by tran-scripts and letters of recommendationand, for the program in music compo-sition and theory, by demonstratedcreative ability. Applicants must hold (or be in the process of receiving) the B.A., B.M., oran equivalent degree, and their under-graduate careers should include a strong background in the liberal artsand a special emphasis on music.Applicants in composition should sub-mit three or four musical works withtheir application, with accompanyingtapes or CDs if possible. Applicants tothe other tracks should submit one ortwo writing samples that demonstratetheir analytical and writing abilities.Students applying from NorthAmerica should submit GraduateRecord Examination (GRE) scores.Entering students should possess a solid background in harmony, counter-point, and analysis, and must take adiagnostic examination in these areasin their first semester of study.Students who fail the examination arestrongly encouraged to remedy thedeficiency before taking the generalexamination and before completingthe second year of course work. Ph.D. students who transfer to the department with a master's degreefrom another university are required to Programs and Requirements242 MUSICtake the general examination. They may, however, transfer some of theirprevious course credits with theapproval of the director of graduatestudies. All students registering for courses must have their choices approved bythe director of graduate studies.Students not enrolled in the depart-ment must have written approval ofthe instructor and the director of grad-uate studies to register for a depart-mental course. GRADUATE GUIDELINES The description in this bulletin repre-sents the Department of Music, itspolicies, its faculty, and its programsas of spring 2003. A major curricularoverhaul will be effected after this bul-letin goes to print, and so for up-to-date information on the requirementsfor the program and the coursesoffered, please consult the Web site atwww.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/music. MASTER OF ARTS AND DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY All graduate students in the Department of Music are enrolled forthe Ph.D. degree and take a total of72 points of course work. However,after completing 36 points of creditand passing the general examination,the theory diagnostic, and one lan-guage examination, students are eligi-ble for the M.A. as an interim degree.The M.A. degree is not automaticallyawarded; students must apply for it.However, we strongly recommend thatqualified students take the degree andthat they apply for it as soon as theyare eligible. The application should bemade well in advance of the date ofthe degree; the deadlines and proce-dures are outlined in this bulletin andon the Graduate School of Arts andScience Web site. Graduate Program Requirements Full-time Status: All graduate stu- dents receiving MacCrackenFellowships are required to maintainfull-time status over the duration oftheir fellowship\u2014in most cases forfive years. Full-time status means thefollowing: 1. While enrolled in classes, a student must be registered for 24 points ofcredit each year. Ordinarily, these 24points are distributed evenly over thefall and spring semesters. Foreign stu-dents holding student visas must reg-ister for 12 points each semester; if forsome reason they register for fewerpoints, the department must officially confirm their full-time status to theOffice of International Students andScholars (OISS). Any student who reg-isters for fewer than 8 points in agiven semester, whatever her or hisstatus, whatever the reason (see thefollowing), must fill out a \"Full-time/Half-time Form\" in the department. Itis the student's responsibility to dothis. 2. Although not encouraged to do so, a student may carry a reduced courseload of 8 points of course work duringthe semester preceding the generalexamination. 3. During the final year of course work, a student may, if she or he nolonger has 24 points of work remain-ing, take a reduced load equal to thenumber of points still to be completedfor the Ph.D. 4. A student who has completed all course work for the Ph.D. and who isstill being supported under theMacCracken program must maintainmatriculation for each semester inorder to retain full-time status. Thisrequires formal registration, as thoughfor a course. Maintenance of matricula-tion is free for the remainder of thestudent's MacCracken fellowship andfor six semesters thereafter. After that,a fee will be charged by the University. It is crucial that students maintain their full-time status during theirMacCracken period, and that thereafterthey maintain matriculation until theycomplete their doctorate. Foreign stu-dents in residence on student visas risklosing their visa by not doing so.Students with outstanding studentloans risk having their loans recalled.Beyond that, back fees will quicklyaccumulate, placing a potentially crip-pling burden on these students whenthey come to graduate, since they willnot be permitted to receive theirdegree until all fees have been paid. Toreiterate: It is the student's responsibil-ity to see that she or he is properly reg-istered as a full-time student, and laterthat she or he maintains matriculation. Academic Standing: Students are expected to be in good academicstanding at all times. In theDepartment of Music, \"good academicstanding\" means the following: (1) agrade point average of 3.5 or better;(2) no more than two grades lowerthan B over the course of the student'scareer, and no grades of F or N; (3) nomore than two grades of Incompleteover the course of the student's career;(4) passage of the general examination and satisfaction of other degreerequirements in a timely manner, asdescribed in this bulletin and on thedepartment's Web site. Students whofail to meet the criteria for good aca-demic standing may be placed on aca-demic probation for up to one semes-ter, during which time they can workwith the director of graduate studiesand other faculty to resolve their aca-demic difficulties. Students on proba-tion who do not return to good aca-demic standing by the end of the pro-bationary semester risk termination oftheir fellowship. Arts and science doctoral students in good standing who are beyond theirfirst year of doctoral study are eligibleto take graduate courses at the follow-ing distinguished universities through-out the greater New York area: 1. Columbia University, GSAS (www.columbia.edu/cu/gsas) 2. CUNY Graduate Center (www.gc.cuny.edu) 3. Fordham University, GSAS (www.fordham.edu/gsas) 4. Graduate Faculty, New School University(www.newschool.edu/gf/index.htm) 5. Princeton University (webware.princeton.edu/GSO) 6. Rutgers University, New Brunswick (gsnb.rutgers.edu) 7. Stony Brook University (www.grad.sunysb.edu) 8. Teacher's College, Columbia University (www.tc.columbia.edu) Outside Work: In general, GSAS does not permit graduate students onMacCracken fellowships to engage inoutside work. This is stated in the fel-lowship award letter issued by theGraduate School. Students wishing towork must obtain the permission ofthe director of graduate studies; if thisis obtained, the request must be for-warded to Dean Roberta Popik by thedepartment for her approval. Thedepartment will try to accommodatestudent needs in this regard, but it isrequired to maintain strict oversightof such activity. Language Examinations: Students must demonstrate reading competencyin one modern European language\u2014usually French, German, or Italian\u2014by passing a written examinationadministered by the department beforetaking the general examination.Between the general and comprehen-MUSIC 243sive examinations, students must demonstrate reading knowledge in asecond language (students in composi-tion are exempted from this require-ment). For students in historical musi-cology, the second language is normal-ly another of the principal Europeanlanguages, though a different languagemay be chosen with the approval ofthe director of graduate studies.Students in ethnomusicology areexpected to select a language appropri-ate to their research topic. General Examination: For each of the three departmental tracks, the generalexamination tests the student's knowl-edge of all the major aspects of thefield. Students are expected to displaysophisticated skills in dealing withintellectual problems and should beable to create and support thoughtfullines of argument from a wide range ofevidence. For historical musicology,the examiners require of the students athorough general knowledge of allperiods of Western musical history andof the changing styles employed.Students are expected to cite and dis-cuss recent writings in historical musi-cology and to advance and supporttheories about major issues in responseto the questions posed on the examina-tion. In ethnomusicology, studentsshould demonstrate an understandingof the history of the discipline, its the-ories and principal ethnographies, andmajor musical cultures. Compositionand theory students are expected to befamiliar with the principal composersand compositional models of the lastcentury and to be able to handle prob-lems of practical analysis. Students ineach track are also expected to have abasic knowledge of the other tracksand to incorporate this knowledge intheir examination responses.Preparation for the examination shouldtherefore include independent study ofboth the secondary literature and themusic itself with extensive listeningand analysis. There are three possible outcomes of the examination: 1. A student may pass the examination at a level deemed appropriate for con-tinued studies toward the Ph.D. andin so doing qualify for the M.A. inmusic. 2. A student may pass the examination at the M.A. level (and qualify for theM.A.) but not at a level consideredacceptable for further studies in thedepartment. Students may then retakethe examination only once, one yearafter the original, and may register forfurther study only provisionally until the examination is passed. 3. A student may fail the examination outright. Students who fail the exami-nation may repeat it only once, oneyear after the original, and may regis-ter for further study only provisionallyuntil the examination is passed. After the general examination, stu- dents are expected to begin preparingresearch papers or compositions forpublic presentation and publication.The faculty believes strongly that theskills involved in presenting a scholar-ly or musical argument and in sup-porting it adequately with the neces-sary apparatus form an importantaspect of graduate training. Adviser, Doctoral Committee, and Special Examination: During the third or fourth year of study, the stu-dent selects a principal adviser for thedissertation. The adviser and the stu-dent select two other members fromthe departmental faculty to form a dis-sertation committee. In certain cases, amember of the committee may comefrom outside the department, or, morerarely, from outside the University.This committee prepares the specialexamination and works with the stu-dent on the dissertation. The specialexamination, individual to each stu-dent and a prerequisite for dissertationresearch, is administered after the gen-eral examination, after completion ofcourse work, and at a time deemedappropriate by the student and adviser.It should demonstrate the student'scompetence in the planned field ofresearch, in surrounding fields, and incurrent methodological and theoreticalapproaches to the topic. A studentwho fulfills all requirements for aPh.D. except for the dissertation, andwho declines to complete a disserta-tion, may request that the departmentaward the M.Phil. (Master ofPhilosophy) degree. Dissertation: A dissertation proposal must be submitted to the departmen-tal faculty for approval. The proposalshould succinctly state the researchquestion to be studied, how it relatesto existing scholarship, the methods(approaches to fieldwork, analyticaltechniques, etc.), and how the disserta-tion will expand our understanding ofthe field. A proposed chapter outlineand working bibliography should alsobe included. For composers, the prin-cipal part of their dissertation is acomposition of significant proportionsaccompanied by a thesis on a topic inmusical analysis or theory. In their dis-sertation proposal, composers must include a brief description of theintended composition and discuss scor-ing, the texts to be set, and theplanned structure and size; theyshould also discuss the thesis asdescribed above. The dissertation must be distrib- uted to all committee members amonth before it is submitted to thedepartment, and all committee mem-bers must approve the work beforefinal submission to the departmentand the Graduate School. The deadlinefor submission of the dissertation tothe department is the same as thedeadline for submission to GSAS. After four weeks have elapsed, a pub- lic oral examination is held for the can-didate to defend the research and thesisbefore the department faculty. Thisdefense follows rules established by theGraduate School of Arts and Science.The defense must be held during thefall or spring term. Candidates shouldbe careful to determine submissiondeadlines for any given semester and tocoordinate their progress accordingly.

MASTER OF ARTS The program has three elements: (1) acoherent sequence of courses on theregion, totaling 40 points; (2) a demon-strated ability in one modern languageof the area; and (3) a master's thesis orreport written under the supervision ofan adviser. The program includes anoptional internship course. The degreecan be completed in two years (foursemesters) of full-time study; studentsmay also study part time. Course of Study: The 40 points of course work include two requiredcourses and a distribution require-ment. The required courses are (1) thecore course, Problems and Methods inMiddle Eastern and Islamic Studies(G77.1687), and (2) History of theMiddle East, 1750-Present(G77.1642) or, with the approval ofthe director, an advanced history semi-nar. Students select the remainingeight courses according to their indi-vidual research interests, in consulta-tion with the director of graduatestudies. The distribution requirementconsists of at least one course eachfrom two of the following disciplines:anthropology, economics, politics, andsociology (e.g., two of the followingcourses: Anthropology for MiddleEastern Studies [G14.1322];Economics of the Middle East[G31.1608]; Middle East Governmentand Politics [G53.2590]; andSociology of Islam [G77.1612]). Language Requirement: To complete the degree, students must demonstrateproficiency at the upper-intermediatelevel in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, orTurkish. (Other languages may be considered as meeting this require-ment with the approval of the directorof the program.) Students with no lan-guage background may satisfy therequirement by completing foursemesters (16 points) of languagetraining at NYU; however, only twoof those semesters (8 points of under-graduate language credits) may becounted toward the degree. Studentswho have prior language training orwho take an intensive language coursein the summer of their first year maysatisfy the requirement by testing atan intermediate level of proficiency orby enrolling in an advanced class.Native speakers with fluency in read-ing, writing, listening, and speakingmay waive this requirement with thepermission of the director. The pro- gram encourages all students to pursuelanguage training through theadvanced (graduate) level. Master's Thesis or Report: The mas- ter's thesis should generally have theformat, style, and length of a substan-tial scholarly article in a MiddleEastern studies field. Alternatively, itcan have the format and style of a pro-fessional report, with a length andsubstance similar to a scholarly article.In either case, it must present theauthor's own research and relate this toexisting scholarly understandings ofthe topic or field. Students shouldbegin discussing possible topics forthe thesis or report by the end of theirfirst semester and should select a topicand an adviser, in consultation withthe director of graduate studies, beforethe end of their second semester.Students are encouraged to conductresearch on their topic during thesummer at the end of their first year. Internships: The internship program draws on the resources of New YorkCity as a center of international poli-tics and culture. Internships providepractical training in the kinds ofresearch and report writing requiredfor careers in public and nongovern-mental service, policy research, cultur-al affairs, and political advocacy. Theinternship program enables studentsto make professional contacts in fieldsthey are interested in joining and toshare their skills with organizations asthey explore a particular field or issue.Organizations providing internshipsinclude (but are not limited to) humanrights organizations; Nationsagencies missions; media nongovernmental organizations.The internship involves 10-15 hoursof work per week during one semester.Students receive up to 4 points towardthe degree by registering forInternship (G68.2997). They mustsubmit weekly progress reports ontheir internship project as well as mid-and end-of-semester reports.

MASTER OF ARTS PROGRAM IN NEAR EASTERN STUDIESWITH A CONCENTRATION INMUSEUM STUDIES The Master of Arts program in Near Eastern studies with a concentration inmuseum studies is designed for thosewho intend to pursue careers in muse-ums and cultural organizations and forthose currently employed in the fieldwho wish to acquire formal training.The program combines a comprehen-sive knowledge of the contemporarytheory and practice of museum workwith a substantive curriculum inMiddle Eastern studies. It offers indi-vidualized internships in a wide vari-ety of museums, cultural organiza-tions, and nonprofit institutions in theUnited States and abroad. Students must complete 48 points of course work (32 points of MiddleEastern studies, including up to 8points of language, and 16 points ofmuseum studies), a full summer NEAR EASTERN STUDIES 251internship in a museum or cultural institution, and a master's essay basedon the student's combined study andinternship. Museum studies requirements for all students in this program includeMuseum Studies I (G49.1500) or II(G49.1501); Museum Studies Seminar(G49.3330), selected a broadrange of topics; and InternshipResearch Seminar (G49.3991). Theremaining 8 points are elective courses.(Consult the Program in Museum Studies section of this bulletin for course offer-ings and additional information.) Students in the museum studies concentration may elect to study inany of three tracks: the modernMiddle East, the medieval MiddleEast, or the ancient Near East. Thecourse and language requirements forthe modern track are identical to therequirements for the Master of Arts aslisted above. Requirements for the medieval track include two core courses, Problems andMethods in Middle Eastern and IslamicStudies (G77.1687) and History of theMiddle East, 600-1200 (G77.1640).For the distribution requirement, stu-dents register for one advanced historyseminar or for History of the MiddleEast, 1200-1800 (G77.1641), and oneclass from either law, philosophy, orreligion; for instance, a student mayregister for Topics in Medieval IslamicHistory (G77.1646) and either IslamicLaw Society (G77.1854), Seminarin (G77.3111), orIslamic Institutions (G77.2855).Electives are chosen from coursesoffered in the Departments of FineArts, Hebrew and Judaic Studies,History, and Middle Eastern andIslamic Studies and the Program inReligious Studies. Students mustdemonstrate proficiency in a modernMiddle East language, as above. The ancient track requires students to enroll in two core courses,Introduction to Ancient Studies(G78.1040) and Seminar: History ofthe Ancient Near East (G78.2601).Each student in the ancient track isassigned a faculty adviser who super-vises the student's selection of coursesin consultation with the director ofgraduate studies. Electives are chosenfrom courses offered in theDepartments of Anthropology, FineArts, Hebrew and Judaic Studies,History, and Middle Eastern andIslamic Studies.

SUMMER PROGRAMS: PERSIAN ANDTURKISH, AND CENTRALASIAN LANGUAGES The Hagop Kevorkian Center is a member of the Eastern Consortium inPersian and Turkish, which organizesan annual intensive summer languageprogram that gives students the equiv-alent of one year of Persian or Turkishlanguage study at either the elemen-tary or intermediate level. Classes aretaught by instructors chosen by a com-mittee from the American Associationof Teachers of Persian and theAmerican Association of Teachers ofTurkish. The Eastern Consortium is a cooper- ative arrangement of the Middle EastCenters of Georgetown University, Harvard University, University ofMichigan, New York University, OhioState University, University ofPennsylvania, and PrincetonUniversity, and the InternationalStudies Center at Duke University; itis sponsored by the U.S. Departmentof Education under Title VI. The sum-mer program is held at one of themember schools every summer. Insummer 2001, 2002, and 2003, NYUhosted the consortium program. Admission to the Eastern Consortium program requires submis-sion of an application directly to theschool hosting the program. Tuitionfellowships are available for studentsto attend the Eastern Consortium pro-gram. The Eastern Consortium pro-gram meets the requirements for stu-dents who plan to study under ForeignLanguage and Area StudiesFellowships. The Center participates as a full member in the SWEEL Inner AsianLanguages Program organized andhosted by the Title VI Inner Asian and Uralic National Resource Center atIndiana University. The program offersintensive summer language instruction(equivalent to one year) in Azerbaijani,Kazakh, Pashto, Tajik, Turkmen,Uighur, and Uzbek. Summer study inKhazakstan and Uzibekistan isplanned to begin in summer 2003.Applicants to the Inner AsianLanguages Program apply directly toIndiana University for admission andfinancial aid; the Inner Asia programmeets all requirements for studentswho plan to study under ForeignLanguage and Area StudiesFellowships.

MIDDLE EASTERN HISTORY Gender, Empire, and the Nation inthe Middle East and South AsiaG68.1999 Balaghi. 4 points. Examines the shifting paradigms of gender in the Middle East and SouthAsia throughout the process of build-ing, imposing, resisting, and disman-tling empire. The ruptures of colonial-ism recast gender relations, and thealchemy of race, gender, and ethnicityfigured prominently in the formationof anticolonial nationalisms. The his-torical memory of empire continues toplay important role in the discours-es of postcolonial antifeminist move-ments. Examines the history of womenin Iran, India, and Algeria in the 19thand 20th centuries. History and Memory in the Middle East and South Asia G68.2000 Balaghi. 4 points. Examines the contentious politics of memory at moments of rupture, dislo-cation, and displacement in the con-struction of nationalism in the MiddleEast and South Asia. Nations createand recall memories as a means ofarticulating communalism, coalescingdistinct identities, and justifyingpolitical positions. Popular memorycan serve as an effective means ofresistance to the national canon and itserasures by groups who are marginal-ized in the national narrative.Movements of peoples, advances intransportation, and developments inthe new media in the 19th and 20thcenturies gave rise to particular expres-sions of national memories with com-mensurate modes of political behavior.

DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER: Professor Dan H. Sanes DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Lynne Kiorpes eural science is a collection ofdisciplines uni-fied by a con- cern for the function of thebrain. Experimental approachesin neural science vary fromanalyses of molecular and cellu-lar mechanisms in nerve cellsand groups of nerve cells tobehavioral and psychologicalstudies of whole organisms.Theoretical tools include mathe-matical and computationalmodeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas ofscience. Experimental questionsinclude issues related to bio-physical and neurochemicalmechanisms within single nervecells, functional neural circuitsconsisting of small numbers ofneurons, the behavior of largesystems of neurons, and the rela-tionship between the activity ofelements of the nervous systemand the behavior of organisms. The doctoral program in neu- ral science provides advancedtraining for research careers inneural science. Opportunitiesexist for study in both experi-mental and theoretical aspects ofthe field. Areas of specialization neuro-biology, neuroscience,robotics intelli-gence, and cognitive science.The curriculum of the Ph.D.program is designed to provideresearch training of the highestcaliber to a small group of full-time students with varied back-grounds and interests.

Completion of this require-ment qualifies the student as a candi-date for the doctoral degree. Specific knowledge related to the area of the doctoral thesis is examinedorally at the time of the presentationof the thesis proposal to the disserta-tion committee. The formal presenta-tion of the dissertation proposal mustbe filed at least six months before thedefense of the thesis. The final examination consists of the oral defense of the doctoral thesis.The examination committee usuallyconsists of the three members of thedissertation committee plus two addi- tional members. Passage of the thesisdefense is contingent on all but one ofthe examiners voting to accept thethesis and its defense. If there is a dis-sent, the dissenter shall provide a writ-ten report detailing the grounds forthe dissent. Research and Sponsorship: Many students may have already selected aresearch area and made arrangementsfor research sponsorship at the time ofadmission. Others do not make thisdecision until they have completed thecore courses described below, includ-ing rotations through the research lab-oratories of the staff of the Center,which expose the student to the inter-ests and techniques of neuroscience.The final decision on the doctoralresearch to be undertaken depends on a mutual agreement between the stu-dent and the appropriate sponsor forthe research.

PERFORMANCE STUDIES 259CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Associate Professor Barbara Browning ASSOCIATE CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Associate Professor Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz he performance studies curriculumcovers a full rangeof performance, from theatre and dance to ritualand popular entertainment.Postmodern performance,kathakali, Broadway, festival, ballet, and capoeira are analyzed using fieldwork, interviews, per-formance theory, and archivalresearch. Courses in methodol-ogy and critical theory are com-plemented by offerings in spe- cialized areas. The program isboth intercultural and interdisci-plinary, drawing on the arts,humanities, and social sciences. Areas of inquiry include con- temporary performance, dance,folk and popular performance,postcolonial theory, feminist andqueer theory, and performancetheory. Training leads to careersin teaching, research, theatre andperformance reviewing andscholarship, writing, editing, artsadministration, and managementof performing arts collections. Students may serve on the edi- torial staffs of TDR: The Journalof Performance Studies and Women & Performance: A Journal of Femi-nist Theory, which are produced within the Department of Perfor-mance Studies. New York is a world center for theatre and dance, both tradi-tional and experimental, andhome to a diversity of folk andpopular performance traditions.Students take advantage of thecity's unparalleled resources forresearch and professional devel-opment\u2014museums, libraries,archives, live performances of allkinds, and a network of perform-ance professionals. 721 BROADWAY , 6TH FLOOR NEW YORK, NY 10003-6807 212-998-1620 TPrograms and RequirementsAdmission: Applicants must follow the admissions procedures set forth bythe Tisch School of the Arts.

Women & Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory is a semiannual publi- cation produced independently by stu-dents, faculty, alumnae, and alumni ofthe Department of PerformanceStudies. It is the first ongoing publica-tion of its kind devoted to a feministinvestigation of performance. Thejournal encourages dialogue amongperformers, theorists, and spectatorsby providing a forum for feminist crit-ical theory in theatre, dance, film,video, music, and ritual. It discussesfeminist aesthetics and includes per-formance documentation, articles onwomen in historical performance,reviews, scripts, and resource listings.Students on staff work in various phas-es of production, including writing,copyediting, proofreading, layout, paste-up, advertising, circulation, anddistribution. CURRICULUM To make performance a primary con- cern is to blur radically the boundariesof disciplines, to subvert the hierar-chies and exclusions of the canon, andto examine cultures for the diversity ofperformance modes and concepts. As adiscipline of \"inclusions,\" performancestudies provides an integrating, com-parative perspective on the entire con-tinuum of human action from \"lifeevents,\" sports, public ceremonies, andritual to aesthetic theatre and dance. Courses in theory and methodology, while developing a distinctive body ofconcepts and approaches, explore theo-ries of performance indigenous to Asia,Africa, Europe, Latin America, andother parts of the world and drawfrom various disciplines\u2014anthropolo-gy, sociology, history, literary theory,semiotics, feminist and queer theory,Marxism, psychoanalysis, the study ofcolonial discourse, movement analysis,aesthetics, and theatrical theory. Although well established as a disci- pline, the study of Western theatre hastended to emphasize a historicalapproach to a canon of dramatic litera-ture. In contrast, the performance stud-ies curriculum focuses on extraliteraryor nonliterary aspects of performance. In keeping with the integrated per- spective on performance, courses dealwith dance not only as a performingart in its own right but also as a vitalconstituent of theatre, ritual, andsocial life. Courses train students toidentify the basic components ofmovement; to see, discriminate, and describe movement behavior in all itsforms and contexts; and to applyknowledge of movement style to stud-ies of dance and culture. Dance historyis studied as an aspect of cultural his-tory and in relation to the other arts. Folk performance and popular enter- tainment (including the modernmedia) have constituted a culturallyand artistically vital alternative theatreand important influence on contempo-rary performance. The forms of popularentertainment, their internal logic andaesthetics, are studied in relation totheir historical formation and culturalsetting. The study of folk performancefocuses on how people in their every-day lives shape deeply felt values intomeaningful form\u2014for example, con-versational humor and storytelling,improvised play and traditional games,competitive street dance, domestic rit-uals, and neighborhood and communi-ty celebrations. A major concern is thenature of tradition, which is seen as aprocess rooted in social life as well asin time and space. Courses in performance studies are also developed in order to explore thepolitical and ideological implicationsof performance. Postcolonial, feminist,and queer theory are employed asframes to investigate how artisticforms subvert and uphold particularideological forms. While performance studies is not a studio-based program, students areencouraged to take at least one course(but not more than three) in perform-ance practice. Each semester, coursesin performance composition andmovement 263Experimental Performance: Interculturalism and the Avant-Garde H42.2060* Limited to graduate students with strong acting, directing, andresearch interests in African, Asian, andEuro-American traditions of performance.Schechner. 4 points.

Viewings of film, the-atre, dance, performance art, andinstallation art identify elements ofcomposition, thematic fields, andmedia-specific problems in dramatur-gy. Throughout the semester, studentsare assigned to work as dramaturgs intheatre, dance, and performance artproductions in New York City. Performance Composition H42.2730* Limited enrollment. Invited artists. 4 points. Practical workshop designed to devel- op autobiographical material for per-formance. Acting and writing exercisesare adapted with the aim of makingart out of everyday experiences. Courseincludes field trips to observerehearsals of other performance artists. Radio, Recording, and Sound Art H42.2752 Weiss. 4 points. The practical and theoretical aspects of sound (voice, music, noise, and silence)within modernism. Investigations are methodologically supported by workin the fields of linguistics, psycholin-guistics, philosophical aesthetics,Freudian metapsychology, rhetoric,and structural anthropology. The guid-ing thematic is the neglected historyof radiophonic art in the context of thetransformation of performance byrecording the montage. Food and Performance H42.2850 Kirshenblatt-Gimblett. 4 points. Cross-cultural and interdisciplinary approaches to food, its preparation,presentation, and consumption, viewedas a complex system of performance.Topics include the physiology of taste and smell and the discourse of gastron-omy; analysis of the design, staging,and choreography of food preparation,presentation, and consumption; andhistorical and social issues.PhilosophyDEPARTMENT OF Faculty Gordon Associate Professor.

There are opportu- nities for study and research inboth experimental and theoreti-cal physics. Areas of specializa-tion include astrophysics andcosmology, atomic and molecu-lar physics, condensed matterphysics, earth system sciences,elementary particle physics,quantum field theory and stringtheory, low-temperature physics,many-body and statistical physics, nuclear physics, quan-tum optics, and sports physics.Although the curriculum isdesigned primarily to meet theneeds of full-time students,opportunities also exist for part-time students. ANDRE AND BELLA MEYER HALL 4 WASHINGTON PLACE, ROOM 424 NEW YORK, NY 10003-6621 212-998-7700 TPrograms and RequirementsAdmission: Applicants considered for admission have usually completed theequivalent of an undergraduate major inphysics and maintained an average of atleast B or better in physics and in math-ematics. Calculus and ordinary differen-tial equations are prerequisite to allcourses. Special consideration is given toapplicants with an undergraduate majorin mathematics, engineering, or anotherscience. Such students ordinarily takeremedial work to make up undergradu-ate deficiencies in physics before theyproceed in the regular degree program. Applicants are required to submit scores from the general and subject testsof the Graduate Record Examination(GRE). Applicants whose native lan-guage is not English must also submitscores from the Test of English as aForeign Language (TOEFL). Colloquia and Seminars: Faculty and students attend the weekly departmen-tal colloquia, at which speakers fromother institutions discuss researchfindings. The department holds week-ly seminars in astrophysics, particlephysics, atomic and laser physics, non-linear dynamics, condensed matterphysics, theoretical physics, relativity,and cosmology. Distinguished lecturesendowed by the James Arthur andStanley H. Klosk Funds are held peri-odically. Informal interactions and \"journal clubs\"\u2014where students, post-doctoral researchers, and faculty dis-cuss research in progress\u2014promotecollaboration within and across sub-fields. Interaction is also fostered withprograms at the Courant Institute ofMathematical Science, the Center forNeuroscience (program for theoreticalneuroscience), the School of Medicine,and the Departments of Chemistry andBiology. Special Notes: Although students may be admitted at midyear, manycourses are full-year courses, so it maynot be possible for those students toenroll for a full-time program. Full-time students are expected to carryeither three courses per semester or theequivalent in approved research. MASTER OF SCIENCE All candidates for the M.S. degreemust achieve 32 points of credit (atleast 24 in residence at the GraduateSchool and at least 16 in theDepartment of Physics) and a gradepoint average (GPA) of B (3.0) or bet-ter. They are further required to passat least five of the following sevencourses: 1. Dynamics (G85.2001)2. Statistical Mechanics (G85.2002) 3. Electromagnetism I (G85.2005)4. Electromagnetism II (G85.2006)5. Quantum Mechanics (G85.2011)6. Quantum Mechanics II (G85.2012)7. Experimental Physics (G85.2075) M.S. candidates are permitted to take at most two courses outside thedepartment, with permission of thedirector of graduate studies. In addition to the above course requirements, M.S. candidates com-plete their degree requirements via oneof three options: Option A: Report The report is essentially a comprehen- sive review article based on the litera-ture in a specialized field of physics,prepared under the supervision of afaculty adviser. In addition to submit-ting the report, students choosing thisoption must receive credit for nineregular courses (one-semester, 4-pointcourses, not including reading andresearch). Option B: Thesis The thesis is based on physics research (experimental or theoretical) supervisedby a faculty adviser, at a level of origi-nality and comprehensiveness less thanthat of Ph.D. research.

FACULTY EMERITI Benjamin Bederson, Lawrence Spruch,Leonard Yarmus.PHYSICS 271the standard course requirements, the student is expected to enroll in onesemester (4 points) of a research course(G85.2091 or G85.3301). Option C: Examination In addition to receiving credit for eight regular courses (one-semester, 4-point courses, not including readingand research), a student choosing thisoption must pass the core courses withan average grade of B or better. Foreach course, the student has the optionof 1. enrolling in the course;2. taking the midterm and final exam- ination of the course if the student isnot enrolled; or 3. taking the relevant preliminary examination, given just before thestart of the fall term. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Ph.D. program is aimed atenabling a student to prepare for andcarry out research in physics at thefrontier of knowledge. The departmentencourages entry into dissertationresearch under the supervision of a fac-ulty member as soon as one hasattained sufficient mastery of the fun-damental principles and techniques ofphysics. Depth and breadth within thelarger context of contemporary physicsare promoted by a flexible set of courserequirements. Numerous seminars andthe weekly Physics Colloquium pro-vide an excellent opportunity for stu-dents to keep abreast of recent develop-ments across the full spectrum ofphysics research. Special talks by facul-ty members describing their researchprograms help students learn aboutresearch activities in the department. Entering students who qualify for admission to the Ph.D. program areoffered a five-year departmental finan-cial aid package with a commitment ofat least two semesters of part-timeteaching duties. Departmental supportmay be withdrawn if a student isdeemed to be not making adequateprogress toward fulfilling the degreerequirements. Students who need morethan five years to complete their degreerequirements may apply for researchassistantships and a limited number offellowships without teaching duties. Core Course Requirements The aim of the Ph.D. program is to certify the student's mastery of a tradi-tional body of basic principles andproblem-solving techniques generallyconsidered to be an essential part of aresearch physicist's training. To this end, a student in the program isrequired to get a B or better in eachpart of four core subjects: 1. Dynamics 2. Statistical Mechanics 3. Electromagnetism (Parts I and II)4. Quantum Mechanics (Parts I and II) Other Options for Satisfying Core Course Requirements A student who has taken a course else- where that is equivalent to one of thecore courses need not enroll in thatcourse; instead, he or she may satisfythe relevant requirement by achievingeither 1. an average grade of B or better based on the midterm and final exami-nation of the course or 2. a grade of B or better on the rele- vant preliminary examination givenjust before the start of the fall term.Each examination is designed to becompleted in two hours (three hoursare allowed to avoid time pressure) andcovers the material of the correspon-ding course at the level of midtermand final examinations. Deadline for Core Course Requirements In order to make satisfactory progress toward the Ph.D., a student must com-plete all core course requirements bythe beginning of his or her second year.If a student fails to get a B or better ina core course (or in one of the alterna-tive options) during his or her first aca-demic year, the student is obliged totake the relevant preliminary examina-tion just prior to his or her second year.If one or more of the core courserequirements are not satisfied at thestart of the student's second year, thePh.D. qualification committee willreview the student's entire record anddecide what action to take. Such actionmight include a recommendation tothe faculty that the student be discon-tinued from the Ph.D. program.Termination of a student from the pro- gram requires a vote of the faculty. Experimental Physics Requirement The course Experimental Physics (G85.2075) is required of all students,except for those who have had equiva-lent laboratory experience. Course Requirements Beyond the Core A student is required to take at least six courses beyond the core level (notincluding reading and research coursesor Practicum in the Teaching of Physics [G85.2090]) in the Department ofPhysics. At least two of these coursesmust be outside the student's researcharea. For the purpose of satisfying thisrequirement, Experimental Physics(G85.2075) counts as one of the outside-the-area courses, but ComputationalPhysics (G85.2000) does not. Requirements of the Graduate School A student must also satisfy the follow- ing requirements of the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science: completionof 72 points of graduate credit (at least32 in residence at the GraduateSchool) and a cumulative GPA of B(3.0) or better. Formation of a Thesis Committee By the beginning of May of the stu- dent's second year, the student isexpected to have arranged for thesissupervision with a member of thephysics faculty. A four-person thesis committee, chaired by the thesis adviser, is set upat this time. The membership of thethesis committee is proposed by theadviser in consultation with the stu-dent and must be approved in writingby the director of graduate studies toensure breadth and level of expertise. At the time of its formation, the thesis committee meets with the stu-dent and discusses the student's courseof study, preliminary research plans,and the timing and scope of the oralqualifying examination (see below).The committee conducts an annualreview of the student's progress, nor-mally in January. Oral Qualifying Examination The qualifying examination marks the student's formal entry into dissertationresearch under the supervision of aparticular faculty member. It takesplace after the student has alreadyembarked on some sort of preliminaryresearch with his or her adviser and isadministered by the student's thesiscommittee. The deadline for takingthe oral qualifying examination isJanuary of a student's third year, priorto the annual review. The examination itself consists of a prepared talk by the candidate fol-lowed by a question period. The aim isto examine the student's mastery notonly of the specific area of the stu-dent's intended research, but also ofrelated areas of physics and of (rele-vant) general principles of physics.The committee decides whether theevidence, taken all together, presents aconvincing picture of a person with the preparation and skills needed to dooriginal scientific research in the pro-posed area. Annual Review, Progress Report, Thesis Proposal There is an annual review of each stu- dent's progress toward the Ph.D. Thisincludes a progress report submittedby the student. Prior to the formationof a thesis committee, the review isconducted by the Ph.D. qualificationcommittee. Afterwards, the student'sthesis committee conducts the review.The first annual progress report fol-lowing the qualifying examinationincludes a formal proposal for the stu-dent's thesis research. Subsequent progress reports inform the committeeon progress toward completion of thethesis, as well as on any significantmodifications of the original proposal. Oral Thesis Defense The final approval of the student's the- sis, and the oral thesis defense, is con-ducted by the student's thesis commit-tee, augmented by one additional fac-ulty member. Three members of theexamining committee, including thestudent's adviser, serve as readers ofthe dissertation. DEPARTMENTAL FINANCIAL AID A number of financial aid programs are available for qualified graduatestudents in physics.

POETICS AND THEORY 275DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Professor Anselm Haverkamp, Department of English CODIRECTORS OF THE PROGRAM: Associate Professor Eva Geulen, Department of GermanAssociate Professor Mich\u00e8le Lowrie, Department of Classics he Program in Poetics and The-ory is a transdisci-plinary advanced certificate program that providesan institutional framework fordiverse theoretical initiatives and practices at New York Univer-sity. By offering an integratedapproach to theoretical concernsin the humanities, it responds tofrequently voiced desires for atheory initiative across the disci-plines. Rather than pure theoriz-ing, the program focuses onsharing theoretical approachesand fosters interdisciplinary andinternational collaboration. The program traces a historical progression from the ancientpractices of poetics and rhetoric to their modern theoretical heirs.The intimate but vexed relationsbetween aesthetics andhermeneutics, philosophy andliterature, social institutions andthe work art, form the core ofstudy. The transdisciplinary orienta- tion of WAVERLY NEW YORK, NY 10003-6790 212-998-8597 T Eligibility: All students enrolled in Ph.D. and M.A. programs in theGraduate School of Arts and Scienceare eligible. Students holding theMacCracken Fellowship pay no addi-tional tuition or fees. Admission: Students already enrolled in a Ph.D. or an M.A. program at NewYork University should submit a state- ment of purpose, a letter of recommen-dation, clearance from the departmen-tal director of graduate studies, and thefirst two pages of the regular GSASapplication form to the codirectors. For those not already enrolled at NYU, admission to the advanced cer-tificate program is by application tothe Graduate School of Arts andScience, New York University, P .O.Box 907, New York, NY 10276-0907. ADVANCED CERTIFICATE A total of 20 points of course work isrequired (a maximum of 8 points mayoverlap with the credits required forthe M.A. or Ph.D.): (G40.2001); Poetics andTheory Seminar (G40.2002); and three additional courses, of which one mustcover either philosophy or rhetoric orbe a theory survey, and two must belisted outside the student's homedepartment (cross-listing in the homedepartment is allowed). In addition to the five courses, stu- dents seeking the advanced certificatemust present a paper at least once atone of the yearly workshops or confer-ences offered by the Program inPoetics and Theory. Students planningon participating in a conference orProgram and Requirementsworkshop develop a paper in the con- text of the Poetics and TheorySeminar, which focuses on a topicleading to the conference. This papermay be a chapter of the dissertation. CONFERENCES The Program in Poetics and Theoryruns annual workshops with a largeconference every three years, organizedin cooperation with the KleistInstitute at the European UniversityViadrina in Frankfurt an der Oder (Berlin), Germany. EXCHANGE PROGRAM AND TRAVEL Ph.D. students may take advantage of an exchange between New YorkUniversity and the Kleist Institute atthe European University Viadrina inFrankfurt an der Oder (Berlin).

Students may taketheir MacCracken Fellowships abroadduring a year in which they have noteaching responsibilities. Qualifiedstudents may also apply for stipendsfrom the Deutsche Forschungsgemein-schaft for a sixth year of funding. 276 POETICS AND THEORYProseminar in Poetics and theOrigins of Literary TheoryG40.2001 Introduces students to the most important developments in theWestern history of theorizing litera- ture, its production, and its interpreta-tion. Since many courses at NYU sur-vey 20th-century literary theory, thiscourse offers some historical back-ground: it brings into conjunctionpre- and post-18th-century traditions that rarely come into contact in thecurriculum and are unlikely to betaught in one course. Issues includethe definition of literary genres, differ-ences in registers of style, the relationof pleasure to morality, of the practicalto the aesthetic, and the transforma-tion of these issues in post-Kantiantheories of interpretation.Poetics and Theory Seminar G40.2002 One course every year is identified as the Poetics and Theory Seminar, whichfocuses on the subject matter of theconference so that students have a cur-ricular framework for preparing apaper for the conference. This course ismeant for students who are already atan advanced stage in their research. CoursesPoliticsDEPARTMENT OF FacultyNathaniel Beck, Professor.

It isan intensive and comprehensive one-year study of the tools required to excelat managing a political campaign orrunning for office. Students in the pro-gram are exposed to all the aspects ofpolitical campaigning, from leadingacademics in the Department ofPolitics to top industry professionals atthe forefront of the political consultingcommunity. The program offers stu-dents a unique setting with access tothe political marketing, advertising,media, and communications expertswho practice at the world's media andcommunications epicenter and who areredefining politics. In addition tostrong offerings in the field ofAmerican political campaign manage-ment, New York University is singularin its attention to political campaignsbeyond the American context. We offercourses by experts and practitioners inpolitical campaigns in Latin Americaand Western and Eastern Europe. Weprovide expertise in the electoral poli-tics of proportional-representation sys-tems and emerging democracies. Admission: Admission to the political campaign management program is gen-erally granted for the fall semester only.Admission is limited to students withstrong academic and professional records.The general test of the Graduate RecordExamination (GRE) is required of allstudents, including all international stu-dents applying from countries in whichthe GRE is offered. All internationalstudents are also required to submitscores from the Test of English as aForeign Language (TOEFL). Course of Study: Students must com- plete 32 points of course work in thedepartment, which must include therequired courses listed under M.A. Program in Political Management in the Courses section. Before graduation, stu- dents must complete a major projectapplying their newly mastered skills to a practical problem in political cam-paigning under the guidance of a facul-ty member. Typically, this projectrequires students to apply the skillsthey have learned to an actual politicalcampaign. Students are expected to maintain an average of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) inwork for the master's degree. Each stu-dent should meet each semester withan adviser of his or her choice to dis-cuss and agree on a course of study. MASTER OF ARTS Admission: Admission to the general M.A. program in politics is usuallygranted for the fall semester only.Admission is limited to students whoseacademic records and letters of recom-mendation indicate exceptional promiseof success in the advanced study ofpolitical science. This means an out-standing undergraduate record and usu-ally an undergraduate major in politicalscience, history, or another social sci-ence. Applicants with lower averagesmay be admitted where there is indica-tion of a particular strength in politicalscience and clear aptitude for graduatework. Applicants with undergraduatemajors outside the social sciences or his-tory may be asked to enroll in appropri-ate undergraduate courses to improvetheir political-science background. Thegeneral test of the Graduate RecordExamination (GRE) is required of allstudents, including all international stu-dents applying from countries in whichthe GRE is offered. All internationalstudents are also required to submitscores from the Test of English as aForeign Language (TOEFL). Course of Study: Six departmental fields of study are offered: political phi-losophy and theory, political methodolo-gy, American politics, political econo-my, comparative politics, and interna-tional relations. Students are required tocomplete eight courses (32 points), ofwhich at least six must be in the depart-ment and four must be in one depart-mental field. Courses in the major fieldmust include the field core course. Thiscore course and one additional corecourse are required and are usually the first courses taken in the department. Students must also complete a major project. The M.A. project consists of aseminar paper, which should demon-strate breadth in the conception andmastery of political analysis. Studentsare required to notify the director ofgraduate studies at the initiation of re-search for the master's project. Thedirector of graduate studies must benotified in all cases, whether the paperis to be written in conjunction with, orindependent of, a course. The director ofgraduate studies must approve the proj-ect and designate an adviser to be thefirst reader, with written notice to bothstudent and adviser. If the paper is writ-ten in conjunction with a course, theadviser would also be the course instruc-tor. The director's approval relates onlyto M.A.-project status and would in noway interfere with assignment or evalu-ation of the essay for course credit. Oncean M.A.-project topic and adviser aredesignated, the director of graduatestudies must approve changes to them.Once the adviser has read and approveda draft, an M.A.-project evaluationscommittee, appointed annually by thechair to read all M.A. papers, will evalu-ate it. If the evaluations committeeapproves the essay, it is accepted as themajor project. Students are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 (on a 4.0scale) in work for the master's degree.Each student should meet each semesterwith an adviser of his or her choice todiscuss and agree on a course of study. Foreign Language Requirement: Students must demonstrate proficiencyin one language other than English or,with permission of the director ofgraduate studies, in statistics. Studentsdemonstrate proficiency in a foreignlanguage by passing the GSAS lan-guage proficiency examination or bycompleting an intermediate-level for-eign language course with a grade of Bor better. Students demonstrate profi-ciency in statistics by completingQuantitative Analysis II (G53.2127)with a grade of B or better.

The other courses are takenfrom a designated group in other disci-plines in the Graduate School of Artsand Science, the Leonard N. SternSchool of Business, and the Robert F.Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Each student is also expected towrite an M.A. major project on a topicrelated to his or her program work. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The goal of the Ph.D. program is toprepare students to conduct research,to teach, or to work in applied settingsat the best institutions in the UnitedStates and abroad. To achieve thisgoal, the program specifies the distri-bution of courses, the substance andtiming of requirements, the forms offaculty supervision, and the criteria foradvancement within the program. Admission: The general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) isrequired of all students, including allinternational students applying fromcountries in which the GRE is offered.All international students are alsorequired to submit the Test of Englishas a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores.Letters of recommendation must clearlyindicate that an applicant is capable ofsuccessfully pursuing the doctorate.The applicant is also required to submita writing sample and statement of edu-cational background and objectives. Abachelor's degree is required for admis-sion to the Ph.D. program. A Master ofArts degree is not a requirement foradmission to the Ph.D program. Course Requirements: Students must complete 72 points (18 courses) beyondthe B.A. degree. There are no depart-ment-wide course requirements. Toguard against excessive specialization,students must take at least three cours-es (12 points) in each of at least twofields. Course credits transferred fromanother institution may count towardthe fulfillment of this requirement. Thefields presently recognized by thedepartment include (1) political philos-ophy and theory, (2) political methodol-ogy, (3) American politics, (4) politicaleconomy, (5) comparative politics, and(6) international relations. In consulta-tion with their adviser, students maypetition the director of graduate studies(DGS) to create a field of their ownmaking. Such a field may be interdisci-plinary. Doctoral students are expectedto maintain a 3.5 grade point average. When entering the program, stu- dents should declare their intendedmajor, which can be changed at anytime in consultation with the student'sadviser. A student specializing in anyrecognized field may have to satisfycourse requirements established by fac-ulty in this field. Admission to someadvanced courses may be conditional onstudents having taken some othercourses or having an equivalent back-ground. In all cases, students must con-sult their adviser to plan a comprehen-sive program of courses and informtheir adviser of any changes. There are no limits on courses taken in other departments or other universi-ty members of the Inter-UniversityDoctoral Consortium (other than thosespecified by the GSAS). Students areencouraged to develop knowledge andacquire methodological skills in sisterdisciplines. To train themselves in academic research and writing, students areencouraged to write research papers, typ-ically by applying or developing thework of a particular course in subsequentreading and research courses. The tworequired papers, the M.A. paper and thePh.D. qualifying paper (see below), arenormally prepared in this way. Students who have satisfied all the requirements of a particular course otherthan the final examination or paper andwho present a written proposal for aresearch paper related to this course mayask the instructor for a research inprogress (RIP) grade. Students whoreceive this grade are expected to take areading and research course during thesubsequent semester(s) to research andwrite the paper. This grade is reported tothe registrar as IP (Incomplete Pass) butis distinguished by the department fromIncomplete grades for all other purposes,including financial decisions. On com-pleting the research paper, the studentreceives final grades for the courses. M.A. Paper: Students who enter the program without an M.A. degree mustpresent a written M.A. paper by no laterthan the beginning of their second year.The specific requirements for the paperdepend on the field, but the general ruleis that it should have the format of anarticle in this field. The topic of theM.A. paper should be chosen in consul-tation with faculty members. On com-pletion, the paper is submitted for read-ing by two faculty members chosen bythe director of graduate studies (DGS),no later than within two months aftersubmission. The paper can receive a highpass, a low pass, or a failing grade. If thepaper does not receive a unanimous highpass, the student may revise and resub-mit it by no later than the beginning of the fourth semester of residence. If the paper receives a low pass and the student maintains at least a 3.0grade point average, the student isgranted the M.A. degree but must leavethe program. If the paper receives a fail-ing grade or if the student's grade pointaverage is below 3.0, no degree is grant-ed. If the revised paper receives differentgrades from the two readers, the DGSappoints a third reader and the expand-ed committee will decide the grade. Astudent whose M.A. paper and graderecord are satisfactory is considered tohave advanced toward the Ph.D. M.A. Waiver: Students entering with an M.A. degree from an equivalentinstitution may petition for a waiver ofup to one year of course requirements(equivalent of 24 points). For this pur-pose, a copy of the M.A. thesis (in anylanguage that can be read by at leasttwo faculty members) must be submit-ted to the director of graduate studies(DGS) when the student enters the pro-gram. The DGS appoints two facultymembers as readers to decide whetherthe thesis is equivalent in standards andquality to the department's require-ments. If the M.A. thesis is approved,the student submits the waiver petitionto the DGS at the end of the first yearof residence. In consultation with thereaders, the DGS decides whether ornot to waive residence requirements onthe basis of the M.A. thesis and thegrade record of the student during thefirst year at New York University. Communications Requirement: Doctoral students must demonstrateproficiency in a language other thanEnglish. The Graduate School of Artsand Science determines which lan-guages qualify, but another languagecan be substituted on recommendationof the student's adviser and the directorof graduate studies and with approvalof the language coordinator. A studentwhose native language is not Englishshould consult the director of graduatestudies regarding fulfillment of thecommunications requirement. Ph.D. Qualifying Examination: No later than the end of the fifth semesterin residence (third semester for studentswho receive an M.A. waiver), studentsmust complete the Ph.D. qualifyingexamination, which consists of the sub-mission of a qualifying paper (QP) andthe oral defense of a syllabus. The QP is a research paper of pub- lishable quality, satisfying all formalrequirements for an article in a givenfield. Before writing the paper, studentsshould submit a brief proposal to atPOLITICS 281least two faculty members, who become \"readers\" on approving this proposal.The topic (but not necessarily the field)of the QP must differ from that of theM.A. paper, and the two papers mustbe read by at least four different read-ers. The work on the QP can be andshould be assisted by faculty. Readersevaluate this paper within two monthsof submission. The readers have theoption of accepting the paper, suggest-ing revisions, or rejecting the paper. Ifinvited to do so, the student may revisethe paper and resubmit it within sixmonths. If the revision is not acceptedby both readers, the student is consid-ered to have failed this requirement. Students must also submit an origi- nal syllabus for a graduate introductionto a field. This syllabus should attest tothe understanding of the structure ofthe field, as well as to the knowledge ofthe primary and secondary literature.This syllabus is presented at an oralhearing to two faculty members, whothen pass or fail the syllabus and itsdefense. Students who successfully com-plete both of these requirements qualifyas candidates for the Ph.D. degree.Students who do not satisfy bothrequirements by the end of the thirdyear (second year for students whoreceive an M.A. waiver) are required bythe department to leave the program,save for exceptional circumstances. Dissertation: After completing the qualifying examination, students mustpresent a Ph.D. dissertation proposal.The proposal ordinarily should be pre-sented before the end of the third yearin residence (second year for studentswho receive an M.A. waiver). Studentswho do not present a proposal withinone calendar year of passing their qual-ifying examination must petition theDGS to be allowed to do so. The proposal should specify the prob- lem to be researched, summarize the cur-rent state of knowledge, describe researchprocedures, and identify the bodies of rel-evant information. It should be no morethan 15 single-spaced pages, plus a bibli-ography. A dissertation committee (seebelow) must approve the proposal. Whenall members are satisfied with the pro-posal, the committee meets with the stu-dent in an advisory hearing. Acceptanceof the proposal signals that the studenthas satisfied all the requirements for thePh.D. degree other than the dissertation. The dissertation must constitute a substantial body of original research ofpublishable quality. Except by theexpressed permission of the chair of thedepartment, the dissertation should notexceed 100,000 words. Once membersof the committee approve the disserta- tion, an oral defense is scheduled. After the student's thesis director approves the dissertation and the dis-sertation committee agrees that it isready for defense, a final oral defense isscheduled before a panel of five facultymembers appointed by the chair of thedepartment or the director of graduatestudies. The GSAS regulates the proce-dures for this defense. The department expects students to complete the dissertation and its defensewithin four years after finishing courserequirements. GSAS regulations requirestudents to complete them within tenyears from entering the graduate pro-gram (seven years for those enteringwith an M.A. from another university). Advising: On entering the program, each student is assigned a preliminaryadviser after a consultation with theDGS. Students are free to change theiradviser at any time during their resi-dence. They should inform the DGS ofsuch changes. In the month of April of the first year in the program, students meet withmembers of their advisory committee(comprising their adviser and one facul-ty member with whom they haveworked) to discuss the substance of theirresearch, progress in the program, andfuture plans. Advice for fall registrationmay also be given at this meeting. TheDGS notifies all first-year students ofthe need to schedule this meeting withthe adviser and sends a copy of eachnotice and report form to the adviser.Following the meeting, the adviser sub-mits a brief report for the student's file. Before beginning to work on the qualifying paper, students must form aQP committee consisting of two read-ers (see above). Students should keepthis committee informed about theprogress of their research. Before beginning to work on the Ph.D. dissertation, students must forma thesis committee, comprising at leastthree faculty members (the committeechair and two members), of whom atleast two must be members of thedepartment. Students should consultwith the committee while preparingthe proposal and working on the thesis. The Graduate Office maintains a progress checklist for each student,showing the adviser, major and minorfields, M.A. paper topic and readers, QPtopic and committee, and dissertationtopic and committee. The fellowshipevaluation and progress (FEP) commit-tee uses this checklist to oversee theprogress of all students in the program.Regular Progress: A student is con- sidered to be making satisfactoryprogress as long as she or he does thefollowing: 1. Submits a previously written M.A. thesis on entering the program or con-sults with faculty about writing theM.A. paper during the first semesterin the program. 2. Submits the M.A. paper by the beginning of the third semester or, ifinvited to do so, resubmits it by thebeginning of the fourth semester. 3. Submits the QP and the syllabus and defends the syllabus by the end ofthe fifth semester (third for studentsentering with an equivalent M.A.degree) or, if invited to do so, resub-mits the QP and defends the syllabusby the end of the sixth semester. 4. Defends the Ph.D. proposal within six months of passing the Ph.D. quali-fying examination. Students who are not making satisfac- tory progress are notified by the DGSand must petition the fellowship evalu-ation and progress (FEP) committee tobe allowed to continue in the program.With regard to points 1 through 3 above, this request is granted only ifthe delay is caused by exceptional cir-cumstances. With regard to point 4, itis sufficient that the student demon-strates reasonable progress. All references to time are based on a calendar of effective semesters (normal-ly 12 points). Hence, part-time stu-dents may take a longer period to satis-fy the requirements. Nonmatriculated Students: Under special circumstances, nonmatriculants(students who are not working towarda degree) may enroll for one course persemester with permission of the direc-tor of graduate studies. Nonmatricu-lants can earn cumulatively no morethan 12 points in the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science.

Landy; Community Psychology, Professor Edward Seidman; Social Psychology, Professor Yaacov Trope he Department of Psychology atNew York Uni-versity approaches the study of the human mindand human behavior from manyperspectives. Psychologists inthe cognition and perceptionprogram focus on perception, action, memory, attention, lan-guage, and thinking. Social psy-chologists study persuasion andattitude change, stereotypingand prejudice, judgment anddecision making, and how rela-tionships form and develop.Community psychologists con-sider how social systems andsocial context influence develop-ment and functioning. Graduate students in the department have the opportu-nity to obtain sophisticatedtraining from these perspectivesand to integrate the approachesin novel ways. At the doctorallevel, students select one of thethree specialty areas but candeclare a minor specialty in asecond area or declare a minor inquantitative psychology. Inaddition, students from all pro-grams have the opportunity tofocus on developmental psychol-ogy, which is a cross-cutting concentration rather than a sepa-rate program. Developmentalpsychologists examine both cog-nitive and social functioning asit changes over the life span. At the master's level, students have the opportunity to samplegraduate courses in a wide vari-ety of topics and may participatein tracks in either industrial/organizational psychology or ingeneral psychology. The department takes advan- tage of its location in thenation's premier city by collabo-rating with important scientificinstitutions, community agen-cies, and corporations. NewYork provides access to almost any population or cultural grouppsychologists might choose tostudy. Experiences in this stimu-lating context supplement thedepartment's emphasis on basicpsychological research.

Admission tograduate study in psychology is basedon academic records, Graduate RecordExamination scores, and letters of rec-ommendation. A limited number ofnonmatriculants may be accepted foradmission to the Master of Arts pro-gram (see Nondegree Status, below). Each student is responsible for com- plying with all rules, regulations,requirements, and policies of theUniversity, the Graduate School ofArts and Science, the Department ofPsychology, and the program in whichhe or she is studying. MASTER OF ARTS The Master of Arts degree in psycholo-gy is offered to students wishing toimprove their status in a psychology-related occupation or to strengthentheir background in the field. ManyM.A. students plan for later pursuit ofthe Ph.D. degree. It should be empha-sized, however, that the M.A. programoffers a terminal degree. All studentswho wish to obtain a Ph.D. degreemust apply directly to their programof choice during the Ph.D. applicationperiod (see under Doctor of Philosophy) . Admission: Applicants seeking admission to a Master of Arts programin psychology should have graduatedfrom college with an average of B orbetter. All applicants must have com-pleted courses in introductory psychol-ogy and in introductory statistics withgrades of B or better to be eligible foradmission. All applicants must pro-vide a report from the general test ofthe Graduate Record Examination(GRE) and achieve a score of at least530 in the verbal and quantitative sec-tions as well as a score of 4.5 or abovein the analytical writing section. Inaddition, international applicants mustachieve a score of at least 600 (250 forthe computerized version) on the Testof English as a Foreign Language(TOEFL). Applications are accepted for fall, spring, or summer admission. Fields of Study: Two fields of study are offered to M.A. degree candidates:(1) general psychology, for studentswho wish to shape their course ofstudy to fit special interests and needs,and (2) industrial/organizational (I/O)psychology, for those wishing toexpand their knowledge of the psycho-logical principles and methods usefulin employee relations and humanresources fields. Degree Requirements: Formal requirements for the M.A. degree inpsychology are the satisfactory comple-tion of 36 points (at least 27 in resi-dence at New York University) andeither a written comprehensive exami-nation or a master's thesis. All stu-dents must pass Intermediate Master'sStatistics (G89.2016) or the equiva-lent. Students must pass substantivecore courses with a grade of B or bet-ter and must maintain an overall Baverage. The specific requirementswithin each program are listed below. General Program Requirements: Satisfactory completion of four corecourses chosen from three core groups,as follows: a total of three from core G89.2025) and core B (G89.2014,G89.2015, G89.2020, andG89.2034), such that each core is sam-pled, and one from core C (research:G89.2066, G89.2067, andG89.2126). Note: Students who are admitted without having majored in psychologyas undergraduates are required to com-plete a total of four courses from coreA and core B, such that each core issampled. I/O Psychology Requirements: Satisfactory completion of G89.2032,two courses from core I (G89.2070,G89.2071, and G89.2073), two cours-es from core research course(normally G89.2067). Master's students are required toregister for courses, request an official leave of absence, or maintain matricu-lation each semester from the start oftheir academic career until graduation. The Master of Arts degree is also granted to students matriculated inthe doctoral program when they havemet the requirements for the degree asdefined by their program and by theGraduate School of Arts and Science. Courses at the M.A. level usually commence no earlier than 4:20 p.m.and no later than 6:20 p.m. The pro-gram may be completed on a part-time or full-time basis, providing thatall course work and either a compre-hensive exam or thesis are completedwithin a five-year period. NONDEGREE STATUS An applicant with an undergraduateaverage of B or better may apply foradmission as a nonmatriculated stu-dent, eligible to take 12 points ofM.A.-level courses in general psycholo-gy (circle \"Nondegree\" at the top of theapplication form). Nondegree status isnot available for I/O students. A nonde-gree applicant should submit the appli-cation form and required subsections,copies of all transcripts, and at least oneletter of recommendation. All materialshould be sent to the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science Office of GraduateEnrollment Services. Nondegree students who wish to petition for admission to the M.A. pro-gram must satisfy any conditions setby the department and provide a reportfrom the general test of the GraduateRecord Examination that reflects ascore of at least 530 in each section.Address inquiries to the Department ofPsychology, New York University, 6 Washington Place, New York, NY10003-6634; 212-998-7900. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy is aresearch-oriented degree.

Specialty programs include cog-nition and perception, communitypsychology, and social psychology.Students may also specialize in devel-opmental psychology in conjunctionwith the cognition and perception,community psychology, or social psy-chology program. Admission: Applicants to programs of study leading to the Ph.D. degreeshould have graduated from collegewith an outstanding undergraduaterecord. An undergraduate major inpsychology is recommended for admis-sion but not required; however, allapplicants must have completed cours-es in introductory psychology andintroductory statistics. The GraduateRecord Examination (GRE) generaltest is required of all applicants. TheGRE psychology test is not required.Matriculants are admitted only in thefall term and only on a full-time basis.See also the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin. International appli-cants are also required to take the Testof English as a Foreign Language(TOEFL), including the writing test. Degree Requirements: Formal requirements for the doctorate in psy-chology include the satisfactory com-pletion of 72 points, (at least 32 in res-idence at New York University); twoterms of statistics (either G89.2228and G89.2229, or the equivalents); sat-isfactory completion of an oral or writ-ten comprehensive examination, or theequivalent; and presentation of anacceptable dissertation. After comple-tion of the required number of points,doctoral students maintain matricula-tion by fee each semester until comple-tion of the dissertation. Informationregarding requirements of the doctoralspecialization programs additional tothe preceding department require-ments should be obtained from theDepartment of Psychology, New YorkUniversity, 6 Washington Place, Room550, New York, NY 10003-6634;212-998-7900. Five years of postbaccalaureate study are usually required to completethe Ph.D. degree; however, no morethan seven years may elapse and the completion ofall degree requirements. Continuationas a matriculant is contingent on thedemonstration of satisfactory progresstoward the doctorate. It cannot beoveremphasized that the accumulationof high grades in formal courses, whileimportant, is secondary to the comple-tion of research that contributes sig-nificantly to the field and is effectively presented in the dissertation. The Graduate School's foreign lan- guage requirement has been waivedfor the Department of Psychology. DEPARTMENTAL PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH Cognition and Perception: Research programs in cognition (Matthews,Phelps); and human development(Adolph, Marcus). Research in perception and attention deals with the perception of depth,pattern, form, motion, color, and atten-tional processes to various dimensions.Psychophysical methods and computermodeling of visual processes areemployed. Research in memory andcognition deals with reasoning, catego-rization, verbal and auditory informa-tion processing, short- and long-termmemory, conscious and unconsciousprocesses in memory, and visual cogni-tion. Research in language and psy-cholinguistics deals with reading, syn-tactic and semantic structures, andissues of modularity. Physiologicalprojects in the cognition and percep-tion program benefit from the fact thatmany of its faculty are also members ofNew York University's Center forNeural Science (CNS). visualattention. Learning projects involveboth operant procedures with animalsand behavioral techniques in humanlearning. Current research in humandevelopment includes the developmentof visuomotor skills, conceptual devel-opment, and acquisition of language. Training for research begins when students enter the program and culmi-nates in the doctoral thesis. Studentsbecome active members of one of the productive research laboratories associ-ated with the program, facilitating con-tact with faculty members, advancedstudents, and postdoctoral scientists.Teaching experience is gained through assistantships that supplement researchtraining. Recent graduates have takenpositions in a variety of academic, pureresearch, and applied research settings.The interdisciplinary Center for NeuralScience offers opportunities to studentsin the cognition and perception pro-gram to participate in neural sciencecourses along with students of theCenter and, in some cases, to work withfaculty of the Center as well as affiliatedfaculty from the Departments ofBiology, Chemistry, Computer Science,Mathematics, and Physics. There are weekly area seminars with prominent speakers in cognition andperception, developmental psychology,and neural science. Community Psychology: Community psychology is an action science. In thecommunity psychology program atNYU, rigorous research, theory devel-opment, and preventive interventionsare viewed as fundamental to the searchfor solutions to current and futuresocial problems. Throughout the firstthree years of the program, studentstake a variety of courses covering issuessuch as the conceptualization and meas-urement of transactions between peopleand settings, the design and implemen-tation of preventive interventions, sta-tistics, and methodology. They alsocomplete a one-year supervisedpracticum in which they are engaged incommunity action. Students areinvolved in research throughout theiracademic career and publish articlesand present papers in seminars and atnational conferences. Students are fund-ed with research assistantships, teach-ing assistantships, and fellowships. NYU has been a part of community psychology since its inception as a field.The University's New York City loca-tion provides students with opportuni-ties to focus on important issues in thelives of diverse populations, includingimmigrant families, homeless adultsand children, and racially diverse andgay and lesbian youth. At present, fac-ulty and student research interestsinclude effects of homelessness on chil-dren and families, racial socializationpractices within black families, schooltransitions among urban adolescents,cultural differences in adolescent par-ent-peer relationships, riskand prevention.292 Psychology: The social unifying framework;ensures extensive training in techniques; active collaborationwith cognitive, developmental, andorganizational psychologists. Researchin the program is funded in part bygovernment grants, which contributeto the computerized laboratory envi-ronment as well as provide support formany students for their first four yearsin the program. All faculty are on edi-torial boards of major journals insocial, developmental, and personalitypsychology, and all have served as edi-tors of these journals as well. The program encourages faculty-stu- dent interaction, and students regular-ly present papers at regional andnational psychology association meet-ings. Recent graduates have joined thefaculty of major universities and havetaken positions in both public (e.g.,medical schools) and private sectors.An active colloquium series regularlyfeatures leading figures from aroundthe world. Visiting faculty and post-doctoral students also contribute tostudents' training. Faculty research interests include attitudes and persuasion; automaticprocesses in social perception, motiva-tion, and behavior; affect and cognition;developmental social cognition, sexroles, and social comparison processes;judgment and decision rela-tionships, health psychology, and stress;stereotyping and trait inferences; sexbias in work settings, dynamics ofstereotyping, and consequences procedures; conflictand negotiation, socialjustice, of legal psy-chology, survey research/fieldresearch. The social psychology labora-tories provide computer-based experi-mental facilities to study cognitive,affective, and motivational responses tosocial stimuli in a controlled environ-ment; a place for social interaction(either in person or over the Internet);rooms for small groups and personalityresearch; and extensive computer facili-ties for data analysis and experimentpreparation. There is also a large sub-ject pool of undergraduates each semes-ter, and diverse subject populations areavailable off-site. See also Developmental Training Program, below.Developmental Training Program: The Department of Psychology atNew York University offers a uniqueprogram of study in developmentalpsychology. Students who participatein the training program enroll in thedevelopmental concentration withinone of the department's core areas (cog-nition and perception, community psy-chology, or social psychology). Theyengage in advanced-level seminars andcutting-edge research with facultyaffiliated with both developmental psy-chology and their other chosen field ofinterest. Therefore, students becomeexperts in both developmental psychol-ogy and a specific content area. Thefact that the program cuts across differ-ent areas of psychology assures thatstudents receive broad exposure to the-ories of development and methods ofstudying developmental change acrossa range of content areas. The link witha core psychology program ensuresdepth of knowledge and expertise in aparticular content area. This approachoffers students considerable flexibilityas well as advantages when they enterthe job market. The department's interdisciplinary approach enables students to pursuebasic, applied, or clinical research pro-grams. State-of-the-art lab facilitiesinclude powerful new technologies forobserving, recording, and analyzingbehaviors on a finely detailed or globalbasis. The University's location inlower Manhattan provides a uniqueopportunity to study developmentalchanges in a range of populations andcommunities. Faculty study develop-ment in infants, children, adolescents,and adults. They use a variety ofmethodological approaches, fromexperimental lab studies and computa-tional modeling to intervention stud-ies and epidemiological surveys todiary studies and naturalistic fieldresearch. Areas research include ado-lescent behavior regula-tion, cognition, model-ing, culture gender identi-ty, immigrant children, psychopathol-ogy, discourse and narrative, homeless-ness and family functioning, languageacquisition, moral reasoning andempathy, motor skill acquisition,racial socialization, and social referenc-ing. Students can also receive excellenttraining in advanced methods and sta-tistics relevant to studying develop-mental processes. Students pursue a specific course of study in developmental psychologywithin the required curriculum oftheir core psychology program. They attend and present their research at aweekly seminar in developmental psy-chology. This seminar provides a stim-ulating forum in which both facultyand students discuss their research.Nationally renowned scholars are alsoinvited to present their research at theseminar, and students have the oppor-tunity to discuss their work withthem. The developmental concentra-tion at New York University is certi-fied by New York State and will there-fore be registered on the student'stranscript. Quantitative Psychology: Quantitative psychology involvesmathematical representations of behav-ioral data, using statistical analysis andmeasurement models as well as directmathematical models of psychologicalphenomena. All areas of psychologycan be approached from a quantitativeperspective, so it is possible to pursue aquantitative minor from any of thedoctoral specialty programs. To qualify for the quantitative minor, students take elective coursesin advanced statistical and/or mathe-matical topics and demonstrate anability to communicate mathematicalapproaches clearly. Quantitative facul-ty research interests include multivari-ate statistical methods, exploratorydata analysis, analysis of similaritydata, and mathematical models of per-ceptual systems. A limited number offellowships for quantitative studentswith interest in mental health researchare available through a training grantfunded by the National Institute ofMental Health (NIMH).

The department offers several seminars each term, reflecting the interest ofadvanced students or members of thefaculty in contemporary problems inpsychology theory, research, or practice.Program and RequirementsAdmission: The requirements for admission to the NYU PostdoctoralProgram in Psychotherapy andPsychoanalysis are 1. A doctoral degree from a program in clinical psychology or a related areaof study. 2. Two years of supervised experience in individual adult psychotherapy. 3. Eligibility for state certification/ licensing in a mental health discipline. Program Requirements: Candidates must satisfactorily complete 36 pointsof course work. They are afforded con-siderable flexibility in their selectionand scheduling of courses and in theirrates of progress through the program.Enrollment in a minimum of one courseper semester is required. Candidates are required to complete 300 hours of personal analysis at a mini-mum of three sessions per week. Thisanalysis must begin prior to initiatingwork with a clinic patient, and it mustbe concurrent with at least one year ofthe treatment of a clinic patient. Thecandidate's training analyst must havehad, at the commencement of the candi-date's analysis, five years of experiencefollowing graduation from an analytictraining program. Moderate-cost psy-choanalysis is made available to studentsby many members of the faculty. Forfurther information regarding moderate- cost analysis, candidates may speak withthe program director, Dr. Lewis Aron. Candidates are evaluated by faculty following completion of each course andby supervisors following each superviso-ry experience. Candidates' progress ismonitored by the ProgressionCommittee, which may require addi-tional course work, supervision, clinicalexperience, or personal analysis. Curriculum: The central thrust of the program is to provide the opportunityto study with faculty representing majororientations in contemporary psychoana-lytic theory and practice. Students aretherefore encouraged to take coursesreflecting differing points of view. Forthose who prefer to concentrate on oneorientation, the program offers a sys-tematic course of study in a modernFreudian, an interpersonal, or a relation-al orientation. Alternatively, the studentmay choose to combine courses from thethree orientations, as well as courses notaligned with any particular one (theindependent track). The curriculumthus fosters an intellectual communityin which theoretical diversity maythrive, and a rigorous comparative psy-choanalysis is encouraged. Postdoctoral Clinic: The Postdoctoral Clinic is the clinical facility for thetraining program. It is designed toprovide individual intensive psy- chotherapy and psychoanalysis for alimited number of individuals unableto afford private fees. Clinic fees arearranged according to the patient'sincome. Candidates working withclinic patients are supervised by thefaculty of the postdoctoral program.

Established in1961 for psychologists, who atthat time found it difficult toobtain formal training in psy- choanalysis, the New York Uni-versity Postdoctoral Program inPsychotherapy and Psychoanaly-sis was the first psychoanalytictraining program sponsored by auniversity graduate school ofarts and science. It is now thelargest psychoanalytic trainingprogram in the country. The program offers a diverse curriculum, comprising modernFreudian, interpersonal, rela-tional, and independent orienta- tions, and it is unique in offeringcomprehensive training in thesevarious schools. Each orientationhas an internationally knownteaching faculty and thepostdoctoral of scholars and practitionershas made a significant contribu-tion to the field. 715 BROADWAY , 1ST FLOOR This curriculum encompasses the fun- damental discoveries of SigmundFreud and the diversity of viewpointsin theory and technique that character-izes Freudian psychoanalysis as it ispracticed today. This diversity arisesboth from the proliferation of ideaswithin ego psychology and from theincreasing influence of studies of childdevelopment, of self psychology, andof theories of the self in relationship tothe object world. The program is suchthat one can take Freudian training inany desired proportion in relation tothe overall postdoctoral program. It isalso possible to participate in a struc-tured Freudian program, with guaran-teed access to a planned sequence ofcourses. Candidates are welcome tocontact the chair of the faculty in theFreudian area of study, Dr. Jo Lang(jpjlw@aol. com), to discuss individual questions and planning.

INTERPERSONAL AREA OF STUDY Interpersonal theory rests upon a broad framework of implicit and explicitpremises that departed from the psy-choanalysis of its day and that contin-ues to reflect its unique contributionto the current psychoanalytic move-ment. An individual's experience,acquired in the context of interactionswith others, becomes the focus of ana-lytic inquiry. Central to interpersonalanalysis is the direct engagement ofanalyst and patient in their actual andimmediate experience of each other.Interpersonal theory posits a variety of influences that produce diverse andindividualizing effects upon the per-son. However, no assumptions aremade about any preordained event orconstellation of events as being pri-mary determinants of experience. Inthis way, the uniqueness of eachpatient, each therapist, and each ana-lytic dyad is emphasized. Great impor-tance is placed on an understanding ofcharacter formation through an explo-ration of the interplay of interpersonalinteraction with the social and culturalfactors that provide the context inwhich this interaction is embedded.Candidates are welcome to contact thechair of the faculty in the interpersonalarea of study, Dr. Elizabeth Goren(elizgor@aol.com) , to discuss individual questions and planning.

RELATIONAL AREA OF STUDY Over the past several decades, a basic theoretical and clinical paradigm hasemerged within various psychoanalytictraditions that is fundamentally differ-ent from that which underlies classicalpsychoanalytic thought. The new per-spective includes and cuts across recentdevelopments within the British schoolof object relations, American interper-sonal psychoanalysis, self psychology,and currents within Freudian ego psy-chology. The curriculum is organizedaround three levels of course work; it isbased on courses sponsored by the rela-tional faculty and augmented by othercourses in the program. Candidateswho are interested in pursuing this ori-entation are encouraged to consultwith members of the relational facultywith the goal of setting up an individ-ually tailored curriculum.

AFFILIATED FACULTY IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS James Jacobs, School of Law; David Jacobson, Robert F . W agner Graduate School of Public Service. FACULTY EMERITI Eliot L. Freidson, Wolf V . Sexton, Dennis H.Wrong. 310 SOCIOLOGYSOCIOLOGY 311Admission: All applicants must take the Graduate Record Examination(GRE) general test. Grade and Point Requirements: Graduate School requirements aredescribed in the Degree Requirements sec- tion of this bulletin. The Departmentof Sociology requires all graduate stu-dents to maintain a grade average of Bor better in order to remain in goodstanding. All students must completeat least 12 points per semester in let-ter-graded work in the Department ofSociology (unless the director of gradu-ate studies gives special permission),until they complete the Ph.D. compre-hensive examinations. To obtain detailed information on the current requirements, standards,examinations, and course offerings,visit the department Web site or con-tact the department graduate secretary.As the department is constantly devel-oping its program, some of the infor-mation provided here may be supersed-ed. All students must meet the currentofficial requirements available from thedepartment. MASTER OF ARTS While the graduate program is a Ph.D.program, it does offer continuing stu-dents a Master of Arts degree. The pro-gram does not admit students for a ter-minal M.A. degree. Formal require-ments for the Master of Arts degree insociology are the satisfactory comple-tion of graduate studies totaling atleast 36 points (at least 24 in residenceat New York University with at least aB average) and either a thesis or a com-prehensive examination. At least 24 ofthe points must be in sociology. Thecourses must include three basic sociol-ogy courses, one basic theory course,Methods and Statistics I (G93.2331),and one additional methods course. There is no language requirement for the M.A. degree in sociology. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy is a researchdegree. It signifies that the recipientcan conduct independent research, has abroad basic knowledge of sociology, andhas a comprehensive knowledge of atleast two chosen areas of specialization. General Course Requirements: In addition to the requirements shownabove under Grade and Point Requirements, Ph.D. requirementsinclude 72 points of graduate work (at least 36 in residence at New YorkUniversity). At least 48 of the pointsrequired for the Ph.D. degree must bein regular sociology courses. Up to 12 ofthe remaining 24 points may be readingor dissertation courses that involve indi-vidual work with a member of the fac-ulty. The acceptability of courses outsidesociology depends on the relevance ofthe work to sociology as judged by thedepartment. Credit for work done else-where requires the approval of the direc-tor of graduate studies. In addition, aminimum of 4 points in a regular, listedseminar (any 3000-level course exceptreading and dissertation courses) mustbe included among the 72 points for thePh.D. degree. Methods and Statistics Requirement: Ph.D. students must pass with a B or better two semestersof the Methods and Statistics sequenceand one course satisfying the \"secondmethods course requirement.\" Transferstudents should see the director ofgraduate studies when first registeringin order to determine what coursesmay be required of them. Theory Requirement: The depart- ment requires that all students becomefamiliar with major sociological theo-ries and theoretical reasoning. Thisrequirement is fulfilled with one basicand one advanced theory course, withat least a B in each. Basic Course Requirement: This requirement aims to ensure that stu-dents receive a strong base of knowl-edge in selected subfields of sociology.Students early in their careers benefitfrom learning the basics of an area, asorganized by experts currently workingin it. This training facilitates students'abilities to engage in research in thearea and aids them as they prepare theirareas for the Ph.D. comprehensiveexamination. To meet this requirement,students must achieve a B or better ineach of two departmental 2000-levelcourses, excluding those 2000-levelcourses in theory and methods. Research Paper Requirement: This requirement aims to ensure that allstudents gain research experience earlyin their graduate student careers. Thepaper is written, ordinarily during thesecond year of study, under the guid-ance of a faculty supervisor and mustbe approved as well by a second reader.Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination: The required two written examinationsare organized around areas that the stu-dent has studied in consultation withmembers of the faculty. These twowritten examinations should be takenby the end of the third year of full-time study. The examination processtests the student's knowledge of thesetwo areas of study and his or her abilityto draw on the discipline as a whole inapplying both theory and researchmethodology to social problems. Dissertation: The proposal for the dissertation, and the dissertation itself,are researched and written in consulta-tion with a committee of at least threeadvisers. Upon approval of the advis-ers, the dissertation is defended beforean examining committee of five facul-ty members (including the three dis-sertation advisers). At least four affir-mative votes are required for passing adissertation defense. Time Limits: All requirements must be completed within ten years of theinception of graduate study, or sevenyears from return to graduate study ifthe candidate holds the master's degreeat the time of readmission. Extensionsof this time limit, if granted, are usu-ally conditional. It cannot be overemphasized that the accumulation of high grades in formalcourses, while important, is secondaryto the demonstration of the capacityfor original thinking and to the com-pletion of research that contributessignificantly to the field and is effec-tively presented in publications andthe dissertation. RESEARCH APPRENTICESHIPS The Department of Sociology has a sys-tem of research apprenticeships for grad-uate students. Students taking theseapprenticeships work as professors'research assistants, usually for twosemesters. These apprenticeships offerstudents intensive research experienceand often lead to coauthorship of pub-lished work. Students may receive up to24 points of credit toward Ph.D. courserequirements for apprenticeships. Thefirst 8 points of credit (G93.2321,2322) can count as part of the 48 pointsstudents need in regular sociologycourses. Additional apprenticeship cred-it 2326) mustcount doctoral degree from thePrograms and Requirements312 SOCIOLOGYcombination of apprenticeship, reading, dissertation, and outside courses. Thedepartment encourages students to takeresearch apprenticeships. See the depart-ment's official statement on researchapprenticeships for more details.DEPARTMENTAL FELLOW- SHIPS, PRIZES, AND AWARDS A comprehensive list of University, Graduate School, and departmentalfellowships, prizes, and awards appearsin the Financing Graduate Education section of the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid .

GRADING SYSTEM Departments in the Graduate Schoolassign the following grades: GPA Grade Meaning Equivalent A Excellent 4.0 B Good 3.0 C Passing 2.0 F Failure 0.0 P Pass (reading and research courses) IP Incomplete Pass IF Incomplete Fail N No Credit R Auditor (no credit) W Withdrawal The grade of A may be suffixed with a minus. The grades of B and C may besuffixed with a plus or a minus. INCOMPLETE GRADES (IP , IF , AND W) The assignment of the grade Incomplete Pass (IP) or Incomplete Fail (IF) is atthe discretion of the instructor. If anincomplete grade is not changed to apermanent grade by the instructor with-in one year of the beginning of thecourse, Incomplete Pass (IP) lapses toNo Credit (N), and Incomplete Fail (IF)lapses to Failure (F). Permanent gradesmay not be changed unless the originalgrade resulted from clerical error. A grade of W represents official withdrawal from the course. A studentmay withdraw from a course up to 24hours prior to the scheduled final exam- ination. Any tuition refund will be inaccordance with the refund schedule forthat semester. For complete rulesregarding incomplete grades, refer tothe GSAS Policies and Procedures Manual. ADVANCED STANDING (TRANSFER CREDIT) Consideration for advanced standing must be determined by the departmentwithin the first calendar year of atten-dance. Courses for which a master'sdegree has been awarded may be con-sidered for transfer credit toward thePh.D. but not toward a second master'sdegree. Only courses with a grade of B(3.0) or better will be considered. Agrade of P or S is considered for transfercredit only if received for a research orreading course culminating in the con-ferral of a master's degree or with thesubmission of a written statement fromthe school issuing the grade that thegrade is equivalent to the grade of B orbetter. Courses considered for transfercredit must have been taken at a gradu-ate institution and must be substantial-ly equivalent to those offered by theGraduate School of Arts and Science.Transfer credit will be awarded point for point unless the institution fromwhich credit is being sought requiresthat students take the same number ofcourses for a given degree as GSAS butuses a different credit system, therebyrequiring a different number of pointsfor the degree. Transfer credit may notexceed the difference between the num-ber of points needed for a degree inGSAS and the minimum number ofpoints that must be earned withinGSAS. For the Master of Arts and theMaster of Science degrees, a minimumof 24 points must be earned in GSAS.For the Master of Philosophy and theDoctor of Philosophy degrees, a mini-mum of 32 points must be earned inGSAS. For detailed rules regarding thetransfer of credit, refer to the GSAS Policies and Procedures Manual. FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY Some departments and programs in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciencerequire graduate students to demon-strate proficiency in at least one foreignlanguage integral to their academicresearch. English, as the language ofrecord at New York University, cannotbe used to satisfy this requirement.Individual departments may have morestringent language proficiency require-ments or may waive this requirementfor individual students. Language proficiency may be demon- strated by any of the following: (1) passing the foreign language profi-ciency examination given by theGraduate School of Arts and Science;(2) passing a departmental examination,if one is regularly scheduled by thedepartment in which the student is reg-istered; or (3) completing, or havingcompleted not more than two yearsbefore matriculation, a full or finalintermediate-level college course in thelanguage with a grade of B or better. Students who have met the language requirement in another graduate schoolnot more than two years before matric-ulation in the Graduate School of Artsand Science may request that such cre-dentials be accepted, with the approvalof the associate dean. CONFERRAL OF DEGREES Degrees are conferred in September,January, and May of each academic year.Degree candidates must apply for grad-uation through TorchTone, NYU's tele-phone registration and information sys-tem, at 212-995-4747, approximatelyfour months prior to the date of confer-ral. Please consult the Academic Calendar at www.nyu.edu/gsas/calendar for the appropriate deadlines. Diplomas are sent by certified mail to the recipient's address on file in theOffice of the University Registrar. Onrequest, the registrar will issue a state-ment certifying that a student who hassatisfactorily completed all the require-ments for an advanced degree has beenrecommended by the faculty for awardof the degree at the next conferral. Nodegree is conferred honoris causa or for studies undertaken entirely in absentia.One year must lapse between conferralof the B.A., M.A. (M.S.), M.Phil., andPh.D. degrees. GRADUATION POLICY No candidate may be recommended fora degree until all outstanding bills havebeen paid. The University cannot beresponsible for the inclusion in the cur-rent official graduation list of any can-didate who pays fees after the first dayof May, September, or January fordegrees in May, September, or January,respectively. Following the payment ofall required fees and on approval of thefaculty, the candidate will be recom-mended for the degree as of the date ofthe next regular meeting of theUniversity Board of Trustees at whichthe awarding of degrees is part of theorder of business.328 ADMISSION, REGISTRATION, AND DEGREE REQUIREMENTSGRADUATE SCHOOL CONVOCATION In May of each year, at Convocation, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciencehonors all master's and doctoral degreerecipients whose degrees were grantedin September, January, or May of thatacademic year. In keeping with tradi-tion, each degree recipient is hooded bya member of the faculty, and each Ph.D. recipient keeps her or his doctor-al hood as a gift from the GraduateSchool. Special Graduate School awardsand prizes are also presented during theceremony. COMMENCEMENT Each May, Washington Square Park istransformed into a magnificent settingfor Commencement. All graduate and undergraduate degrees are officiallyconferred by the president of New YorkUniversity during Commencementexercises. The president also confershonorary degrees to outstandingwomen and men who have made distin-guished contributions to society. JOINT AND DUAL DEGREE PROGRAMS Students may pursue joint and dual degrees between GSAS programs andbetween GSAS programs and programsin many of the professional schools ofNew York University. Joint degree pro-grams offer a single degree for the satis-faction of the requirements of a singlecurriculum that is drawn from the cur-ricula of two departments or programs.Dual degree programs allow students topursue two degrees simultaneously bycompleting the curricular requirementsof separate degrees in a coordinatedfashion. Participating Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science programs anddepartments include biology, econom-ics, French studies, Latin American andCaribbean studies, law and society, phi-losophy, history, journalism and masscommunication, politics, and sociology.Participating schools include theLeonard N. Stern School of Business,the School of Law, and the School ofMedicine. Refer to the individual department and program listings for specific jointand dual degree programs and theirrequirements. INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS A key component of the University's global commitment to education is theGraduate School's internationalexchange program. In the New YorkUniversity Institutes for AdvancedStudy, distinguished visiting facultyfrom throughout the world join special- ists from NYU to research topics ofincreasing importance to all nations ofthe world. Together with graduate stu-dents, the visitors form an active core ofintellectuals engaged in studying globalissues. Graduate students may study at New York University's Italian research center, La Pietra, a Tuscan estate of five magnif-icent villas on the outskirts of Florence.Other exchange programs supportresearch at the Charles University ofPrague and the Universities ofAmsterdam, B onn, Cape Town, Copenhagen, Ghana, Singapore,Stockholm, and Vienna, among others.These unique programs give New YorkUniversity students access to interna-tional university laboratories, archives,and libraries and encourage them toparticipate in international city andregional life. GRADUATE FORUM The Graduate Forum is an innovativeprogram for graduate students acrossNew York University. Launched inJanuary 2001, the Graduate Forum wasestablished to encourage interdiscipli-nary inquiry into intellectual and moralproblems, to question the foundationsof the disciplines, and to experiment intranslating basic research into a lan-guage accessible to a variety of audi-ences without oversimplification. The 10 members of the forum are graduate students drawn from master'sand doctoral programs throughout NewYork University. Graduate studentsmay either nominate themselves or be nominated by the chair of their depart-ment. Criteria for selection include apromising academic record, the capaci-ty for innovative thinking, the abilityto contribute to interdisciplinaryinquiry, and an interest in the newtechnologies of education. Studentmembership in the forum is for a termof two academic years (unless a studentgraduates earlier). The Graduate Forum usually meets on the last Wednesday evening of eachmonth during the academic year.Student members are expected to makeformal presentations of their work toeach other in ways that further the aimsof the forum, including the circulationof their papers or other materials priorto discussion at meetings and the post-ing of edited forum proceedings andrelated resources on the Web. Themembers of the forum also contributeto the regular evaluation and redesignof the forum's format. The great public servant John W . Gardner contrasts two forms of institu-tional behavior, the nurturing of\"seedbeds\" versus the intolerance of\"dead wood.\" The Graduate Schoolhopes that the Graduate Forum willestablish, nurture, and cultivate aseedbed that will in turn foster innova-tive and creative thinkers. Academic ExperienceGraduate School Fellowships, Assistantships, Prizes, and Research AwardsFinancing Graduate Education Instructions for Financial Aid ApplicantsThe application for admission is also the application for all GraduateSchool fellowships for new stu-dents. No additional forms are required. An application must be received by the January 4 deadline to be eligiblefor Graduate School and departmentalfellowships and assistantships. In thelist of departmental deadline dates(refer to the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid), some departments list a December 15 recom- mended date along with the January 4 final deadline date. To allow thesedepartments adequate time to review applications for admission and finan-cial aid, applicants should endeavor tohave allmaterials submitted to the Graduate School by December 15. Guidelines for continuing students are available from departmental advisersin advance of the established deadline. The Graduate School encourages all U.S. citizens and permanent residentsto complete the Free Application forFederal Student Aid (FAFSA) to beconsidered for all forms of federal andstate aid, including the Federal Work-Study Program and the various federaland private loan programs. NYU prefers that the FAFSA be submittedon-line by linking to www.fafsa.ed.gov (paper FAFSAs are available in Januaryfrom the University Office of FinancialAid). The FAFSA should be filed afterJanuary 1, 2004, but preferably beforeMarch 1, 2004, for fall 2004 enroll-ment. Students should give permissionfor application data to be sent to NewYork University (enter institution code 002785 in the \"Title IV Code\" space). FINANCING GRADUATE EDUCATION 329he financial aid program of theGraduate Schoolof Arts and Sci- ence seeks to ensure that all aca-demically qualified studentshave enough financial support toenable them to work towardtheir degree. Awards include support for tuition and modestliving expenses in the form offellowships, teaching andresearch assistantships, andloans. Graduate Enrollment Ser-vices at the Graduate School andthe NYU Office of FinancialAid offer additional financial options.

Interestedapplicants should submit the applica-tion form by the financial aid deadlinedate. In addition, master's students areeligible for awards through theGraduate School's Tuition IncentiveProgram (TIP). For more specific infor-mation regarding eligibility and theavailability of fellowships, applicantsshould call the director of graduatestudies in the department or program,or contact Graduate EnrollmentServices. FUNDING FOR INTERNA- TIONAL STUDENTS To secure a visa, international students must demonstrate that they have suffi-cient funding to complete the degree.International students who apply bythe January 4 deadline and are admit-ted to the Graduate School are auto- matically considered for GraduateSchool fellowships and scholarships aswell as for teaching and research assist-antships. Most loan programs arerestricted to U.S. citizens and perma-nent residents. International studentsmay apply for these domestic loan pro-grams, however, with a cosigner who isa U.S. citizen or a permanent residentof the United States. In addition, NewYork University works with a variety of lenders to provide loan programsspecifically tailored to the needs ofinternational students. Visit our Website frequently for the latest news oninternational student financing oppor-tunities; the address is www.nyu.edu/ financial.aid/international.html. Many international students obtain support for their educational expensesfrom their government, a foundation,or a private agency. In many cases,these students are eligible to receivematching tuition funds through theGraduate School's Tuition Incentive Program. Applicants should contactGraduate Enrollment Services for spe-cific details. RESIDENCE LIFE ASSISTANTSHIPS The Office of Residence Life annually offers a limited number of residentassistantships (RAs) and graduate assist-antships (GAs) to students who wish towork with residential undergraduateand graduate students to promote inter-personal connections and communitywithin our residence halls. Students inthese positions serve as peers who assess,organize, and implement social and edu-cational activities within and around theresidence halls. Details about theseopportunities are described in theFinancing Graduate Education section of the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid.Alternative Funding Sources ELIGIBILITY To be considered for financial aid, stu- dents must be officially admitted toNYU or matriculated in a degree pro-gram and making satisfactory academ-ic progress toward degree require-ments. Generally, University-adminis-tered federal and state financial aidprograms are awarded to full-time stu-dents. Half-time students (fewer than12 but at least 6 points of credit persemester) may be eligible for a federalStafford Student Loan, but they mustalso maintain satisfactory academicprogress. A full description of theNYU academic progress requirementsis available at www.nyu.edu/financial. aid/progress_grad.html. University-administered federal and state awards are not automaticallyrenewed each year. Continuing stu-dents must submit a Renewal FAFSAeach year by the NYU deadline.Renewal depends on the annual reeval-uation of a student's need, the avail-ability of funds, the successful comple-tion of the previous year, and satisfac-tory progress toward the completion ofdegree requirements.In order to be eligible for aid from federal and state government sources,students must be classified either asU.S. citizens or as eligible noncitizens(as defined by the U.S. Department ofEducation). It is the student's responsibility to supply true, accurate and completeinformation on the FAFSA and tonotify the Office of Financial Aidimmediately of any changes or correc-tions in his or her housing status orfinancial situation, including tuitionremission benefits or outside grants,once the application has been made.Determination of financial need is alsobased on the number of courses forwhich the student registers. A changein registration therefore may necessi-tate an adjustment in financial aid. NEW YORK STATE TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (TAP) Legal residents of the state of New York who are enrolled in a full-time degree program of at least 12 creditpoints a term, or the equivalent, maybe eligible for awards under this pro-gram. The Graduate School requiresall eligible financial aid applicants to apply for this grant. The TAP awardreplaces a portion of the tuition fel-lowship amount for students whoreceive full tuition grants. Studentsapplying for TAP must do so via aFAFSA application. VETERANS BENEFITS Various Department of Veterans Affairs programs provide educational benefitsfor sons, daughters, and spouses ofdeceased or permanently disabled vet-erans as well as for veterans and in-service personnel who served on activeduty in the U.S. Armed Forces afterJanuary 1, 1955. In these programs,the amount of benefits varies. Undermost programs the student paystuition and fees at the time of registra-tion but receives a monthly allowancefrom Veterans Affairs. Since interpretation of regulations governing veterans benefits is subjectto change, veterans and their depend-ents should keep in touch with theDepartment of Veterans Affairs. Foradditional information and assistancein completing the necessary forms,Other Financial Aid\u2014Federal, State, and Private ProgramsTuition and FeesThe Graduate School of Arts and Science charges tuition on a per-pointbasis. For 2003-2004 the rate is $919per point. A student must complete72 points for the Ph.D. degree and 32-40 points for the master's degree,depending on the program. A full-time course load is 12 points persemester, 24 points per year.

FEDERAL LOANS Subsidized Stafford Student Loan(SSL) Program The subsidized federal Stafford Student Loan Program provides low-interest student loans using the capitalof lending institutions and the admin-istrative facilities of state agencies.These loans are made by independentbanks or lending institutions and aregenerally insured by both the state andfederal governments. A graduate student may borrow up to a maximum of $8,500 per year witha total aggregate borrowing limit(including undergraduate loans) of$65,500. Within these limits, stu-dents may borrow up to the differencebetween the cost of education, thefamily contribution, and the total ofall financial aid awards. For graduatestudents, family contribution is basedon the incomes of the student andspouse (if married). The subsidized Stafford Student Loan interest rate for all students isvariable with a cap of 8.25 percent.Interest does not accrue, however, nordoes repayment begin, until sixmonths after the borrower ceases toenroll at least half time. An origination fee of up to 3 per- cent will generally be deducted fromthe loan funds. Unsubsidized Stafford Student Loan Program The unsubsidized federal Stafford Student Loan Program provides addi-tional loan eligibility beyond any sub-sidized Stafford amounts. Studentsmust first apply for the regular (subsi-dized) Stafford program, and if theymeet eligibility criteria they will beautomatically considered for theunsubsidized program. Terms and con- ditions are essentially the same as forthe regular Stafford loan, except thefederal government does not pay theinterest on the unsubsidized loanwhile the student is in school. Studentsare not required to make payments onthe principal or interest of the loan aslong as they are enrolled at least halftime; however, interest does accrue.Students may request that their lenderbill them for the loan's interest. Graduate students may borrow up to a total of $18,500 in combined sub-sidized and unsubsidized Stafford loanseach academic year, although no morethan $8,500 of the $18,500 can be inthe form of a subsidized loan. Thetotal amount of unsubsidized Staffordloan in any academic year may notexceed the cost of education minus thetotal family contribution and minusall other financial aid (including subsi-dized Stafford loans) received that year. PRIVATE LOANS A variety of private student loan pro-grams are available to both U.S. andinternational students attending NYU.Created to supplement federal andinstitutional aid, they feature attractiveterms and interest rates, and all credit-worthy families facing college expensesare eligible.

WITHDRAWAL AND REFUND OF TUITION A refund of tuition will be made by the Office of the Bursar after presenta-tion of a withdrawal (Change ofProgram) form signed by a depart-mental adviser and approved forrefund by the dean of the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science throughGraduate Enrollment Services, provid-ed such withdrawal is filed within thescheduled refund period for the term,which is stated below. Withdrawaldoes not necessarily entitle the studentto a refund of tuition paid or a cancel-lation of tuition still due. An application for refund may be filed in person or by mail and must bemade in writing on the Change ofProgram form, obtainable in thedepartmental offices of the school. An official withdrawal must be filed if a course has been canceled and, inthis case, the student is entitled to arefund of tuition and fees. Ceasing to attend a class does not constitute official withdrawal, nordoes notification to the instructor. Astop payment of a check presented fortuition does not constitute withdraw-al, and it does not reduce the financialobligation to the University. The non-returnable registration fee and a penal-ty fee of $10.00 for a stopped paymentwill be charged in addition to anytuition not canceled. The date on which the Change of Program form is filed, not the last date of attendance in class, is considered the official date of the student's withdraw-al. It is this date that serves as the 332 FINANCING GRADUATE EDUCATIONFINANCING GRADUATE EDUCATION 333basis for computing any refund grant- ed the student. The refund period (see schedule below) is defined as the first four cal-endar weeks of the term for which theapplication for withdrawal is filed. Noapplication filed after the fourth weekwill be considered. The processing ofrefunds takes approximately two weeks. Refund Schedule for Fall and Spring Terms This schedule is based on the total applicable charge for tuition excludingnonreturnable fees and deposits. Withdrawal before the official opening date of the term 100% (100% of tuition and fees)* Withdrawal within the first calendar week from the opening date of the term 100% (100% of tuition only) The first calendar week consists of the first seven (7) calendar days beginning with the official opening date of the term.(Note: not the first day of the class meeting.) Withdrawal within the second calendar week from the opening date of the term 70% Withdrawal within the third calendar week from the opening date of the term 55% Withdrawal within the fourth calendar week from the opening date of the term 25% Withdrawal after completion of the fourth calendar week of the term NONE *After the official opening date of the term, the registration and services fee is notreturnable.Note: A student may not withdraw from a class the last three weeks of thefall or spring semester or the last threedays of each summer session. It should be noted that the registration and services fee is not returnable. Exceptions to the published refund schedule may be appealed in writingto the dean of the Graduate School ofArts and Science through GraduateEnrollment Services and should besupported by appropriate documenta-tion regarding the circumstances thatwarrant consideration of an exception,including approval by the departmen-tal director of graduate studies. Students who withdraw should review the Refunds page on the Officeof the Bursar Web site at www.nyu.edu/ bursar. Federal regulations require adjust- ments reducing financial aid if a stu-dent withdraws even after the NYU refund period. Financial aid amounts will be adjusted for students whowithdraw through the ninth week ofthe semester and have received anyfederal grants or loans. This adjust-ment may result in the student's billnot being fully paid. NYU will billthe student for this difference. Thestudent will be responsible for pay-ment of this bill before returning toNYU and will remain responsible forpayment even if he or she does notreturn to NYU. Any semester during which a stu- dent is charged even a single dollar intuition will be taken into account whencalculating the student's progresstoward his or her degree. This mayrequire the student to make up creditsbefore receiving any further aid.Students should review the \"satisfactoryacademic progress\" standard for theirprogram so they do not jeopardizefuture semesters of aid (www.nyu.edu/ financial.aid/progress_grad.html).Student Services GRADUATE ENROLLMENT SERVICES for who seek advice about programs of study at theGraduate School of Arts and Science orwho need assistance with admissionrequirements for specific departmentsmay obtain information and guidancefrom Graduate Enrollment Services,One-half Fifth Avenue.

As advocatesfor advanced inquiry and creativity, we greatly prizethe curious and exceptionally competent student. We value this moment to introduce students and others to the intellectual vision of the GraduateSchool and the programs and faculty that embodythat vision. The bulletin's offerings demonstrate thatgraduate schools are the intellectual nerve center ofthe modern university. Graduate schools makegroundbreaking discoveries, investigate ideas old andnew, and prepare the next generation of scholars,researchers, thinkers, and teachers. As a matter offact, New York University was a pioneer in graduate education. In 1866, New York Universitybecame the second university in the United States to offer an earned doctorate. In 1886, it for-mally opened a graduate division. Today, the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS)houses 47 programs that offer doctoral and master's degrees and enrolls 4,100 students annu-ally. The pioneering continues. As we chart the course of our Graduate School for a new century, we must fuse the strengths of today with a vision of tomorrow's possibilities. To achieve this fusion, GSAS calls on the abun-dant creative energies of New York City. Even more important, the Graduate School draws on theextraordinary New York University faculty to work with students to become intellectual leaders\u2014no matter what career they might eventually choose. Graduate education depends first and fore-most on an institution's faculty and students, on the brains that power the school. Buoyed by its city, rooted in its faculty, the Graduate School of Arts and Science shares this bulletin with those who seek a range of graduate degrees, a balance of disciplinary andinterdisciplinary work, and the core values of intellectual communities: rigorous inquiry, life-long discovery of ideas, and a commitment to the ethics of scholarship.
