Low anti-pertussis toxin (PT) antibody levels confirmed the absence of pertussis disease, consistent with ongoing protection. Anti-pertactin (PRN) antibodies, remained at higher levels in Pa-vaccinated subjects. At year 6, CMI responses continued to be present and were higher in Pa-vaccinated than Pw-vaccinated subjects. Long-term protection with Pa vaccines can be expected to be at least as good as that provided by efficacious Pw vaccines.
