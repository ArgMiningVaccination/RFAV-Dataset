From atoms that form the device you're reading this on; to the millions of molecules in your physical body; the world around you; and all the stars in the universe - it is all energy. Subtle aromatherapy uses the vibrational, energetic quality of essential oils to influence our psyche and spiritual wellbeing, which allows us to self-heal. The vibrations of the body can go out of tune when we experience physical or emotional stress, and so energetic healing can be used to restore the body to a healthy, harmonic resonance. Energy Healing & Chakras One of the most powerful ways to harness and direct energy for healing is to understand and work with the energy centres within our bodies - chakras. Chakra is a Sanskrit word which means 'spinning wheel,' and is a concept that originated more than 2,000 years ago in ancient traditional, esoteric Tantric practices of India; though much of our understanding of chakras today is a Western concept. It is believed that throughout our body, we have energy centres that are connected to body, mind and spirit: and these spinning wheels of energy are considered the centre of our life force - known as Prana in Sanskrit, Qi in Chinese medicine, or Ki in Japanese philosophy. There are various interpretations and more than one chakra system, but the most commonly accepted chakra system in the West includes seven chakras. \"In my past life, that is, my life before I discovered natural therapies, I studied electrical engineering. Therefore, the concept of energy, or Qi, was not foreign to me. As an engineer, the idea of using crystals to amplify energy was not some New Age concept; it was based on sound scientific principles. The idea of energy flowing through meridians (energy centres) made so much sense.\" - Salvatore Battaglia, from his book Aromatherapy and Chakras Understanding how energy manifests within the body allows us to focus our energy healing where it needs it most, and we can do so by selecting essential oils and crystals that have a vibrational match to the chakra that is out of balance. Each of the seven chakras resonates on a different vibrational frequency, and this corresponds to the seven colours of the light spectrum. When they are balanced and aligned, everything sings in divine, harmonic resonance and we feel inspired, wise, full of gratitude and love, vibrant, and completely content in the universe. However, when the chakras are out of alignment the body is in a state of discordant dis-ease, and depending on whether the chakra is overactive or underactive, it can bring about an emotional state of anxiousness, lethargy, despair, anger, stress, irritability, panic, despondence, and can even affect our physiological state too. Spiritually we feel discontent, lost, helpless, bitter and are generally unhappy within ourselves and our place in the world. Aromatherapy can help rebalance the chakras and restore our prana - our ki, our life force- to its most radiant and resonant form by chakras, or inspiriting underactive chakras. If you visualise a rainbow, it's at its most beautiful when it's balanced and proportionate - too much or too little of one colour would be uncomfortable with an unsettling power dynamic. Each chakra has an equally important role to play, and so neglecting one in favour of another can lead to an imbalance. However, life is naturally full of ups and downs, which is why we can use subtle (vibrational) aromatherapy to counterbalance the chaos of the world around us. Aromatherapy & Chakra Healing \"Visualise the chakras as sites where we receive, absorb, and distribute life energies. Through external situations and internal habits, such as long-held physical tension and limiting self-concepts, a chakra can become either deficient or excessive and therefore imbalanced.\" - Salvatore Battaglia, from his book Aromatherapy and Chakras Chakra healing focuses on restoring balance and harmony in body, mind and spirit. With introspection and self-awareness, we can begin to translate our life's challenges symbolically and find meaning in them. We become conscious of where we are exerting our physical and emotional power, and where we feel as though we are lacking in it. Look inward and reflect upon what traits and themes throughout your life are present. What feels like it's domineering? For example, are you prone to excessively oversharing? This may signal an overactive throat chakra. Conversely, where do you feel as though you're deficient? Using the same example, an underactive throat chakra may mean you feel as though you can't speak up and express yourself fully. Another point of consideration is where you feel like the free flow of energy is blocked. This could be internal, such as creative blockages or blockages in expression, or it can be external - such as areas in your life that you feel like you're constantly hitting a wall. When it comes to chakra healing, you could translate those areas of struggle into a metaphor that relates to a chakra. For example, if you are always having something fall apart in your home, that could be symbolic of how you're taking care of your body which is home to your soul - and this links to the base chakra. Once you've identified the chakra you need to heal, you can use subtle aromatherapy to balance that energy. [Which chakra do you need to heal?

Intention is vital in subtle energy healing, and so infusing the intention of healing and spirituality into the process is as important as the selection of your oils.

Perhaps you'd prefer to create an aromatic mist, or to visit an aromatherapist for an aromatherapy massage treatment. | | Always observe safe usage of essential oils in all of your rituals.
