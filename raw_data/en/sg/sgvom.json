DHEC will select the final cleanup remedy after reviewing and considering comments. DHEC may modify the Preferred Alternative or select another response action based on new information or public comments. Public encouraged to review and comment on all the Alternatives presented. 910Site Ownership History Prior to 1972 the site was used for agricultural purposes. 1972 -Neptune Carolina constructed the 130,000 sq foot facility to manufacture flow meters and transferred ownership of the property to Greenwood County. 2001- Property transferred to Schlumberger Industries and then Actaris U.S. Liquid Measurements. 2008 -Itron acquired Actaris . Itron currently leases the site to Red Seal 11Key Contaminants of Concern of Assessment and Remediation Phase I Environmental Assessment identified possible areas of concern2011 Phase II Environmental Assessment included installation of soil borings and temporary monitoring wells and identified PCE and degradation products above regulatory screening levels. 2012 Itron entered into Responsible Party Voluntary Cleanup Contract VCC 13 -6078- RP October 2, 2013.2013 Remedial Investigation (RI) included the installation of permanent monitoring wells. Identified potential source areas in the vicinity of the Steel Sump and Cardboard Storage Area.2014 13History of Assessment and Remediation (Continued) A Supplemental RI Report and Addendum along with groundwater monitoring was completed to further define the extent of contamination.2015- 2019 A Feasibility Study was submitted 2018 A Feasibility Study was revised to evaluate cleanup alternatives for the site. 2019 14Areas of Concern Steel Sump Area -located near the southeast corner of the building. Soil contamination is above screening levels to protect groundwater and includes PCE levels from 5mg/kg to 2,600 mg/kg. Additional volatile organics are present. PCE groundwater contamination is as high as 95,000 ug/l which is above the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 5 ug/l. Cardboard Storage Area -located east of the building. Soil contamination exceeds levels for the protection of groundwater. Soil contamination ranges from 5.4 mg/kg to 1,300 mg/kg. Additional contaminants are present. PCE in groundwater is as high as 190 ug/l. Additional contaminants are present above standards. 15Shallow Groundwater Contamination 16The concentration of PCE decreases from shallow to deeper groundwater zones at the site. The extent of groundwater contamination does not extend beyond the property boundary.Intermediate Groundwater Contamination 17Deep Groundwater Contamination 18Cleanup Goals Restore groundwater quality to MCLs (maximum contaminant levels) Prevent exposure to impacted soil and groundwater above applicable standards Reduce the potential for soil contamination leaching to groundwater 1920Clean Up Alternatives Alternative 1 No Action Alternative 2 Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) and Institutional Controls (ICs) Alternative 3 Excavation and Disposal with MNA and ICs Alternative 4 In-Situ Remediation using BOS 100 with MNA and ICs Alternative 5 In-Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) using PersulfOx with MNA and ICs Alternative 6 Excavation and Disposal Combined with In -Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) using PersulfOx with MNA and ICsAlternative 1: No Action Required by the National Contingency Plan (baseline comparison to other alternatives) No active treatment No monitoring Cost $0 21Alternative 2: Monitored Natural Attenuation and Institutional Controls Monitor natural degradation of constituents of concern (COCs) in groundwater with existing monitoring well network Implement restrictions on land and groundwater use Cost $610,000 22Alternative 3: Excavation and Disposal with MNA and ICs Excavate and dispose of impacted soils Monitor natural degradation of COCs in groundwater with existing monitoring well network Implement restrictions on land and groundwater use Costs $2,868,000 23Alternative 4: In-Situ Remediation using BOS 100 with MNA and ICs Inject BOS 100 into the subsurface to degrade chlorinated contaminants in soil and groundwater Monitor natural degradation of COCs in groundwater to address residual contamination following in -situ remediation Implement restrictions on land and groundwater use Costs $1,428,000 24Alternative 5: In -Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) using MNA and ICs Inject PersulfOx into the subsurface Monitor natural degradation of COCs in groundwater to address residual contamination remaining after ISCO Implement restrictions on land and groundwater use Cost $1,378,000 25Alternative 6: Excavation and Disposal Combined with In -Situ Chemical Oxidation using PersulfOx with MNA and ICs Excavate contaminated soils Inject PersulfOx into the subsurface to chemically oxidize contaminated groundwater Monitor natural degradation of COCs in groundwater to address residual contamination following in -situ chemical oxidation Implement restrictions on land and groundwater use Cost $3,693,000 26Evaluation Criteria 1.Overall Protection of Human Health and the Environment; 2.Compliance with State & Federal Regulations; 3.Long -Term Effectiveness and Permanence; 4.Reduction of toxicity, mobility, volume through treatment; Effectiveness; 6.Implementability ; 7.Cost; and 8.Community Acceptance 27Overall Protection of Human Health and the Environment Alternative 1 (No Action) does not provide control of exposure or reduction of risk because no active remediation is employed. Alternative 2 (MNA/ICs) risk could be minimized by implementing ICs and the environmental risk would be evaluated through monitoring. Source area is not addressed. Alternative 3 (Excavation and Disposal with MNA and ICs) removes soil contamination but does not address groundwater contamination. Alternative 4 (In -situ Chemical Remediation BOS 100) and Alternative 5 (ISCO PersulfOx) reduce groundwater contamination but do not address soil contamination. Alternative 6 (Excavation and Disposal with ISCO) provides the greatest amount of risk reduction because soil and groundwater contamination are both addressed. 28Compliance with State and Federal Regulations Alternative 1 does not meet regulatory limits because there is no active remediation. Alternative 2 is not expected to meet regulatory goals within 50 years. Alternatives 3 through 5 meet regulatory limits within various time frames. Alternative 6 combines removal of contaminated soil and treatment of contaminated groundwater meeting regulatory requirements sooner than other alternatives. 29Long Term Effectiveness and Permanence Alternatives 1 and 2 are the least effective long term. No active remediation. Alternative 3 only addresses the source area and does not address groundwater contamination which extends the time contamination remains in the environment. Alternatives 4 and 5 address groundwater contamination but do not address contaminated soil which will continue to source groundwater contamination. Alternative 6 addresses the soil and groundwater contamination to provide long term effectiveness. 30Reduction of Toxicity, Mobility, or Volume Through Treatment Alternatives 1 does not employ active treatment of contaminated soil or groundwater so there is no reduction in toxicity, mobility, or volume of contamination. Alternative 2 may reduce the volume and toxicity of contamination over a time greater than 50 years. Alternative 3 provides a reduction of mass in soil but does not immediately address volume, toxicity or mobility of contamination in groundwater. Alternatives 4 and 5 treat existing groundwater contamination but do not address the source of contamination. Alternative 6 reduces toxicity and mobility of contamination by removing source mass and treating contamination in groundwater using in -situ chemical oxidation. 31Short -Term Effectiveness Alternatives 1 and 2 do not involve any active remedial activities so no short -term risks exist to the community, workers or the environment. Alternatives 3 through 6 do include active remediation such as excavation and injections into the subsurface that would involve temporary disturbances at the site, however, proper use of personal protective equipment and adherence to site specific health and safety protocols will provide worker protection. These alternatives would not impact the community or result in adverse environmental impacts. 32Implementability Alternatives 1 and 2 do not involve active remediation therefore there are no technical or administrative limitations to implement these alternatives. Alternatives 3 through 6 include active remediation such as excavation, transportation, disposal and/or injection into the subsurface which are all commonly implemented at similar sites to treat contaminated soil and groundwater. 33The table below ranks the alternatives from 1- 6 based off their effectiveness for each category.
