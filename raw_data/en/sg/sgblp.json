He has no medical expertise, but he provides medical advice based on claimed communication with the spirit world. What could possibly go wrong?", "sitename": "Science-Based Medicine", "date": "2017-05-04", "cleaned_text": "False Hope as Journalism](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/nyt-promoting-false-hope-as-journalism/) It seems increasingly difficult for consumers to sort out credible medical information from complete bunk. Thyroid conditions have their areas of legitimate medical controversy, but the sheer volume of pseudoscience and dubious advice on offer buries the fact that most thyroid diseases are well understood and highly treatable. Two weeks ago I examined a clinical trial that answers an important question about whether or not treating a [laboratory-diagnosed form of low thyroid](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/overtreating-the-thyroid/) offers patients any meaningful benefits. Since that post I've received several emails and messages from people seeking more information about treating thyroid dysfunction. I was pointed to a [thyroid post on Goop](http://goop.com/the-mysteries-of-the-thyroid/) which I have to admit, left me a bit shocked. Sure, Goop's advice is [dubious](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/activated-charcoal-the-latest-detox-fad-in-an-obsessive-food-culture/), but I didn't realize the website lets totally unqualified individuals give medical advice, especially when that advice is based entirely on claimed communication with the spirit world. This was my introduction to Anthony William, the \"Medical Medium\", whose apparent claim to fame is channeling ghosts that give medical advice. Since William was also on [your list of suggested blog topics](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-floor-is-yours/#comment-3233258146) for me to write about, I couldn't resist diving in. Take a deep breath. Ignorance of science is seemingly no barrier when you have the spirit The website [Psychic Gurus](https://www.psychicgurus.org/whats-the-difference-between-a-psychic-and-a-medium/) (yep) tells me that a medium is someone who can communicate with spirits (spirit guides, angels, etc.). All mediums are also psychics, but not all psychics are mediums. It's worth noting at this point that [no medium has ever been proven to be legitimate](http://skepdic.com/medium.html). Probably the strongest critics of mediums are the \"mentalists\", who know it's all a con, and are [more up-front](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mentalist) about the fact that any apparent \"skill\" of a medium is based on insights derived from the real world, and not based on supernatural abilities. Anthony William has an [extensive and detailed disclaimer](https://www.facebook.com/medicalmedium/app/354142324690488/) on his Facebook page which gives a more concise summary of his qualifications than his own biography. In short, he advises: - His information is not a substitute for medical information or advice - You should never disregard medical advice based on his writing - He is not a medical doctor or healthcare professional - You should speak with a medical doctor or healthcare professional before acting on any of his advice [Quack Miranda](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Quack_Miranda_Warning), etc. With that in mind, here's what William says about his own abilities: Anthony William was born with the unique ability to converse with a high-level spirit who provides him with extraordinarily accurate health information that's often far ahead of its time. Since age four, when he shocked his family by announcing that his symptom-free grandmother had lung cancer (which medical testing soon confirmed), Anthony has been using his gift to \"read\" people's conditions and tell them how to recover their health. His unprecedented accuracy and success rate as the Medical Medium have earned him the trust and love of thousands worldwide, among them movie stars, rock stars, billionaires, professional athletes, best-selling authors, and countless other people from all walks of life who couldn't find a way to heal until he provided them with insights from Spirit. Anthony has also become an invaluable resource to doctors who need help solving their most difficult cases, and has recently released his NY Times Best Seller \"Medical Medium.\" The Spirit's views on hypothyroidism Judging by William's writing, his spirits are channeling straightforward alternative medicine approaches. His advice seems largely similar to the pseudoscience that you see offered by naturopaths, homeopaths, and other alternative-to-medicine practitioners today. Reading his writing, you'll quickly discover you have [adrenal fatigue](http://www.medicalmedium.com/blog/adrenal-fatigue). [Gluten needs to be avoided](http://goop.com/healing-food-from-the-medical-medium/). You need a [detox](http://www.medicalmedium.com/blog/heavy-metal-detox), and so on. But the thyroid seems to be a focus for William, likely because he has a book about thyroid on the way. There's just too much to wade through in [William's 7,000+ word opus](http://goop.com/the-mysteries-of-the-thyroid/) to respond point by point, so I'll touch on some of the highlights. (TL; DR: William blames the Epstein Barr virus for causing thyroid issues, and recommends herbs and supplements to cure it.) William's advice isn't supported by any credible evidence, yet that doesn't stop him from [making very specific statements](http://goop.com/the-mysteries-of-the-thyroid/) about the causes and treatments of thyroid disease: |The Medium||The Science / The Translation | |\"because without true insight into what causes thyroid illness, medical communities aren't yet able to offer remedies that heal the underlying problem\"||There are safe effective medical treatments for thyroid conditions that can enable people to live normal lives without symptoms.| |\"Currently, the autoimmune theory proposes that in certain conditions, a person's immune system becomes confused and starts attacking part of the body. In the case of Hashimoto's, patients are told that the immune system mysteriously produces antibodies that target and damage the thyroid gland as though it were a foreign presence. This hypothesis will not hold up over time. Why? Because it's not the real answer.\"||Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis) is a |[numerous autoimmune diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-diseases)where the relationship to infection is unclear or unproven. [your disease, your fault](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/your-disease-your-fault/). [fake disease](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/fatigued-by-a-fake-disease/). Same whine, new bottle William the \"Medical Medium\" offers alternative medicine, with a supernatural twist. William may genuinely believe he has a gift. But he has no medical knowledge or training. His ignorance of medical science is evident from his dismissal of it. It's worth remembering that William has enough sense (or caution) to write a disclaimer that emphasizes that anything he says should be reviewed with a medical professional. If you're seeking credible, [science-based advice on thyroid issues](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/hypothyroidism-the-facts-the-controversies-and-the-pseudoscience/), this medical professional's advice is to ignore anything suggested by the Medical Medium, and to discuss your questions with your family doctor or an endocrinologist.
