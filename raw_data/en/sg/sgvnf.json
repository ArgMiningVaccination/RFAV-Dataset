For more than 50 years, her First Federal Congress Project has set out to document a little-known nor long-remembered period of American history, when a group of mostly forgotten Founding Fathers gathered to take the framework of a new Constitution and build a government. Ms. Bickford, MA '69, joined the team as a graduate student in 1967, a year after the project left the National Archives to be based at GW, within the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. She's been its director since the 1970s, steering it through the publication of nearly two dozen volumes that document that first Congress using official records, personal diaries, correspondence, historic doodles and the occasional acerbic poem. Each book, published by Johns Hopkins University Press, is as thick as a fist\u2014some more than a thousand pages\u2014bound in blue with gilded lettering. \"It's an enormous scholarly achievement,\" says historian Fergus Bordewich, whose 2016 book, The First Congress, relied on the project's work. \"It's packed with rich detail and has a comprehensiveness that is unmatched by any collection I've worked with.\" When Ms. Bickford and her team\u2014co- editor Ken Bowling and associate editors William diGiacomantonio and Helen Veit, MPhil '77\u2014publish the final two volumes in 2017, a project that officially began in 1950 will end, and the office will close the doors on more than a half-century of research that included gumshoe sleuthing, codebreaking, stolen artifacts and an FBI sting. \"There are big bins full of paper debris going out of here every day at this point,\" Ms. Bickford says. \"It's a little strange.\" When the books are published, she will retire, ending a career entirely dedicated to a momentous but overlooked period of American history. The First Federal Congress convened from 1789 to 1791, before the District of Columbia had been carved out along the banks of the Potomac River. Most of those first 95 senators and representatives left behind families to meet in New York and, later, Philadelphia, to cobble together an experiment in federalism. \"We are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us,\" lamented James Madison, then a congressman from Virginia and one of the few in that first Congress who remains a household name. \"WE ARE IN A WILDERNESS WITHOUT A SINGLE FOOTSTEP TO GUIDE US,\" LAMENTED JAMES MADISON, THEN A CONGRESSMAN FROM VIRGINIA.gwmagazine.com / 7 The Articles of Confederation had failed. The revolutionary government and many of the states were deep in debt. Threats loomed from the British to the north, the Spanish to the south and Native American tribes to the west. States sparred with one another. Regions mistrusted each other. Four-dozen currencies were in exchange. Americans, including many of those first legislators, distrusted a federal government. Amid this backdrop, lawmakers put aside deep divisions to craft a government. In three sessions, the first Congress established the Supreme Court and a federal judiciary. It created the first executive departments\u2014the Treasury, State and War departments. It passed the Bill of Rights. It passed duties and tariffs to fill federal coffers, launched a national bank, embarked on a census, drafted copyright and patent laws and named a capital. \"It was the most important and productive Congress in United States history,\" says Ms. Bickford, sitting at a massive table formed from six wooden desks pushed together in the center of a room that smells of coffee and old paper. Scattered across the desks are fading file folders she made 50 years ago out of stapled construction paper to hold oversized documents. The project's 20 volumes run down the center of the table like a spine. Page proofs for Volume 21 lie stacked in a dozen piles on one side. Another stack destined for Volume 22\u2014which nudges into the period after the first Congress and collects some materials unavailable for earlier volumes\u2014sits on a desk in the entryway. Across the table, Dr. Bowling, the co- editor, dumps a stack of papers into a gray bin filled to overflowing. They're all photocopies, he says; the office has no original manuscripts. The papers he's tossing are old newspaper accounts of the first Congress. Already gone are boxes of copied notes on the proceedings of the first House of Representatives. Those records were jotted in a personal shorthand that looks like cuneiform. Project editors had to decipher them character by character. Dr. Bowling started on the project a few months before Ms. Bickford but didn't become a full-time editor until 1989. Back in the '60s, he set off to comb through than 1,000 collections west of the Mississippi in search of manuscripts. \"It's a detective kind of job in many ways,\" he says. In one case, he tracked manuscripts to a Pennsylvania auction, alongside a run of Hustler magazines. Another turned up precious letters in a Wilkes-Barre, Pa., barn. Dr. Bowling helped find Pennsylvania's missing original of the Bill of Rights (it was hanging in the New York Public Library), and North Carolina's, which had landed mysteriously in the hands of private collectors before FBI agents posed as buyers and seized it. Touching those old documents feels like touching history, Dr. Bowling says. \"You have your hands on something\" that one of the Founding Fathers touched, he says. But they also hold lessons that are still relevant, the researchers say. \"The retroactive idealization of the founding airbrushes out parts that were chaotic, combative and full of cynical politicking,\" Mr. Bordewich. \"It's important for Americans today to understand that the Revolution was fought not to take politics out of government\u2014the way certain people on both sides of the political spectrum think it ought to be. The Revolution was fought so that people could do politics. It was never, ever a group hug.\" GW NEWS 8 / gw magazine / Fall 2016At the VIP opening night of a Mel Chin art exhibition in September, amid a passel of black-clad patrons, a dozen or so students from the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design wander a New York gallery and reconsider what art can be. Mr. Chin\u2014a conceptual artist known for his community-based, socially minded and often real-world applicable work\u2014is putting on a show of art that he and a group of 100 artists known as the GALA Committee made and stashed in the background of three years' worth of Melrose Place episodes.\"It was a product of a trust that was developed between the GALA Committee and the writers and producers of Melrose Place ,\" Mr. Chin says. \"So it's a collaborative kind of exercise. And so that allowed it to be on the air.\" The objects in the exhibition, titled Total Proof: The GALA Committee 1995- 1997 , are everyday items imbued with subtle, occasionally subversive, cultural commentary. The writing on some Chinese takeout boxes translates to \"rebellion.\" There's a blanket with the chemical diagram of an abortion pill. \"It's really interesting,\" says Layla Saad, a Corcoran junior. \"Millions of people were watching the show and they have no idea. ... You can put things in people's lives and they don't even notice.\" Nicole \"Ozzy\" Osborne, a first-year master of fine arts student, calls it \"almost subliminal.\" For Corcoran Director Sanjit Sethi, who was a member of the GALA Committee and a student of Mr. Chin's, that's a nice way of understanding his vision for the future of the 138-year-old school: creativity that transcends the gallery. It's about thinking as much as it is about making. \"I think we're in the business of educating culturally competent, critical problem solvers\u2014I know that's a mouthful,\" says the 45-year-old Mr. Sethi, who came to GW last year after serving as the director of the Santa Fe Art Institute. \"... It's possible that one of those problem solvers is a painter and [corcoran] Art Is Everywhere As Corcoran Director Sanjit Sethi enters his second year, he's positioning students to notice the world outside the gallery. // By Matthew Stoss WILLIAM ATKINS Mel Chin (right center), the inaugural William Wilson Corcoran Visiting Professor, talks to students at opening night of Total Proof: The GALA Committee 1995-97 , an art exhibition showcasing work first seen in the background of Melrose Place episodes.gwmagazine.com / 9 WILLIAM ATKINSexperience,\" Mr. Sethi says. \"But I also think that one thing we need to do is make sure creativity and innovations are intermixed and intertwined.\" The students who saw Total Proof in September say it got them to consider new ways to reach audiences as well as the definition of art. \"It's art that's in the common world, the world that everyone interacts with, not just people who go to the galleries,\" says Miguel Perez, BFA '16, who is auditing a course with Mr. Chin. The course's name? \"Art Outside the Gallery.\" working in the D.C. community, that's also a lesson. We have to earn the trust.\" Other initiatives of Mr. Sethi's that are in the works include founding centers for creative research and community engagement. The former would bring a mid-career professional to GW to work on a Washington-themed project, and the latter would send Corcoran students into the world to use art in a utilitarian way. \"Imagine a ceramics class that would work with an environmental concern, say out in the Delmarva peninsula, and create nesting modules for a particular bird species that needs habitat restoration,\" Mr. Sethi says. Everything he wants to do is centered on a philosophy of community collaboration and interdisciplinary study. Mr. Sethi says that it feels as though, at some point, artists claimed creativity for themselves and engineers vectored off with a monopoly on innovation. But in recent decades, he says, there has been a trend of overlaps, particularly in academia. \"I think we need to have sheer aesthetic they show at Art Basel in Miami\u2014and that's fantastic. \"But it's also just as likely that one person that graduated from the Corcoran with a focus in photography could be working at a design firm or could be going to law school or could be getting a master's degree in policy management or whatever else. I don't put that past them. I'm not limiting the profile of what we can do. I don't assume everyone is going to get an MFA and want to teach like I did.\" Mr. Chin, currently working on a project to raise awareness about childhood lead poisoning, is GW's inaugural William Wilson Corcoran Visiting Professor of Community Engagement\u2014Mr. Sethi's first big initiative as the director of the Corcoran School. \"I think that's why it was important to bring\u2014and Sanjit also agreed\u2014to bring students [to New York] because this is not just about putting things on television,\" says Mr. Chin, a former professor of Mr. Sethi's at the University of Georgia. \"It's about how we could do things that would not be allowed normally, and I think for [the students] top Mel Chin bottom Cocoran Director Sanjit Sethi10 / gw magazine / Fall 2016 GW NEWS WILLIAM ATKINSDozens of times in the past 18 months, Joseph Keith Melancon has taken a seemingly lifeless, graying kidney and threaded it onto pipes where an ailing one used to be. Clamps are released, and in a matter of moments the foreign organ is flush and pulsing with life. That's the eureka moment. With medical students often by his side, he looks for the telltale sign of a functioning kidney: urine. \"That's the champagne of kidney transplantation,\" Dr. Melancon says. \"I always ask them if they want a drink.\" As chief of the GW Transplant Institute, the professor of surgery\u2014who estimates he's done some 800 kidney transplants in his career\u2014spent the past year working alongside a new kidney center at the university to make a dent in the nearly 1,300 Washington, D.C., residents on the kidney transplant waiting list. The wait is long for most patients\u2014as of October, 245 kidney transplants had been done in the District in 2016\u2014and for some, the delay is deadly. Twenty-one people have already died on the waitlist in D.C. this year; 31 died in all of 2015, according to data from the United Network for Organ Sharing. Nationwide, 13 people die each day waiting for a kidney transplant, according to the National Kidney Foundation. Together the two new GW entities have boosted the number of kidney transplants by 75, overwhelmingly at the surgical hands of Dr. Melancon. The Transplant Institute he runs launched in early 2015, followed that November by the Ron & Joy Paul Kidney Center, established with a $2.5 million donation from the Ron & Joy Paul Family Foundation. Many of GW's patients have complications that make other institutions reluctant to perform the operation, Dr. Melancon says, including HIV or hepatitis C infection, a history of IV drug abuse or socioeconomic issues that have kept patients from receiving adequate medical care in the early stages of kidney disease. \"We're taking all those people that studies have shown have worse outcomes, and we're saying, 'This is your Statue of Liberty, this is your place to come get transplanted,'\" Dr. Melancon says. Nationwide, African Americans have a kidney-failure rate three times higher than that of white people. And Washington, D.C., had the highest prevalence of end-stage renal disease in the U.S. in 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In D.C., the disease is mainly concentrated in Southeast and Northeast neighborhoods, areas with a large proportion of the city's African American residents, though most city residents who have received transplants live in Northwest D.C., a primarily white and affluent area, Dr. Melancon says. The disparity in part stems from a lack of access to regular medical care, which creates a delay in diagnosis, he says. There's also a smaller pool of live donor candidates in family, friends, co-workers and community members because of health-related issues like diabetes and obesity and the likelihood that people in the patient's support system are dealing with kidney disease themselves. People in a patient's social circle are also less likely to be able to take off time from work for donation and recovery time. To combat this problem, Kidney Center staff are spending time in minority neighborhoods focusing on awareness of the disease and the importance of seeking treatment. The center partners with churches to set up group screening sessions, and this summer launched Metrobus advertisements on 40 routes plugging the need to get tested.

High blood pressure and foamy urine, for example, are signs of kidney disease that often go ignored, since they don't impinge on daily life. Most people in these highly affected parts of D.C. aren't diagnosed until they show up at the emergency room with stroke-like symptoms, a blackout or with swollen eyes or ankles. \"They come to the emergency room and they feel like they're dying\u2014and they're right. They are dying,\" Dr. Melancon says. At that point they're in kidney failure and are rushed to dialysis, he says. But any window for preventative care to avoid damage to the body has run out. Maurice Lucas was a dialysis patient at another local hospital before hearing Dr. Melancon speak at an information seminar in 2015. Soon after, Mr. Lucas made the switch to GW. After five months on dialysis under Dr. Melancon, Mr. Lucas was told the institute had found a match for him, a kidney donated by a 67-year-old woman looking to do a good deed in the spirit of Thanksgiving. Mr. Lucas received his new kidney on Dec. 1, 2015, and has been healthy since. The experience inspired him to become an advocate for organ donation, reaching out to audiences like his church congregation. \"This lady I got a kidney from, I don't know her. I don't know if she's black, white, Asian or other\u2014I don't care. It opened my eyes,\" he says. \"With kidney disease, we can help the next person.\" Those success stories are everything to Dr. Melancon. But with more than a hundred people yet on the waitlist at GW alone, he says there is a lot of work left to be done for doctors here and everywhere. \"We started to make a dent in the problem, but the problem still persists. We need to continue to increase access to transplants,\" he says. \"To really make a change in this country, we need to go in a little bit of a different direction in how we prevent kidney disease and understand it better, then intervene in what's going on.\" above and opposite page Surgeon Joseph Keith Melancon, chief of the GW Transplant Institute, who is hoping new efforts will chip away at the long and sometimes lethal kidney transplant waiting list in D.C.12 / gw magazine / Fall 2016 GW NEWS THE COLLECTION OF MARK AND ROSALIND SHENKMAN$26M Grant Will Fuel Pursuit of An HIV Cure GW researchers will lead 17 public and private partners in the search for a cure for HIV under a new five-year, $26.4 million grant.

The board is expected to pick Dr. Knapp's successor in the spring. The profile frames the presidential position in the context of GW's history and priorities, and outlines current challenges and opportunities. The qualifications of the next president, according to the document, include having academic distinction and intellectual leadership; a demonstrated commitment to diversity and inclusion; dedication to the student experience; and a commitment to fundraising. At an alumni town hall in September in D.C., alumni who spoke were interested, among other things, in a president who would listen to students, be capable of bringing in research funding, be culturally competent and committed to fostering alumni engagement and a strong sense of community on campus. At a second alumni event, in October in New York City, trustee Madeleine Jacobs, BS '68, HON '03, who chairs the search committee, asked the audience what questions they would want asked of candidates.

It said, 'Take me back to Washington. ... '\" The Post reports: \"The next day, 'fortified by a hamburger and a beer,' Trachtenberg bought the beast.\" After it was refused a place at his own home, Dr. Trachtenberg has said, he donated it to the Class of 2000. His hippo Hail Mary stuck, and the object found its way into the heart of the student body\u2014even if the road, in the early days, was bumpy. (\"The sculpture,\" the Post reported at the time, \"has become a BIG HIPPO: WILLIAM ATKINS / LITTLE HIPPO: JOHN MCGLASSONgo-between, of sorts, for the students who throw coins in its mouth and the homeless people who pluck them out.\") In the two decades since, the hippo has ascended to unofficial mascot status. It's inspired hippo stress toys, hippo sweatshirts, stuffed hippos and a not-so-secret society, the Order of the Hippo. When the university in 2015 released four emojis to represent GW, a hippo was among them. Along the way, the statue has weathered two decades of springtime showers, of kids scrambling up its back in the summer, of selfies in the fall and mouthfuls of snow in the winter. It's fostered as much bewilderment and criticism as it has affection. But it's only the affection that has left a mark of age on the hippo: the burnished gold from countless hands rubbing its tusks, snout and flower-petal ears. \u2014Danny Freedman, BA '01locked in a silent bray toward traffic on 21st Street, the hippopotamus outside Lisner Auditorium crossed its 20th anniversary in August, looking much the way it did on the day it fell out of the blue and landed there.

On Mentoring a Posse and then, ultimately, it's the student's decision where they go. But framing [that] set of options up without making the students feel as if they aren't good enough or that they aren't able to accomplish their hopes and dreams\u2014but also still showing them options\u2014is an important conversation. What has this experience meant to you? At a purely selfish level, it's made me a better teacher and so forth. But emotionally, it's just incredibly inspiring to see any student stretch farther than they think they're even capable of and accomplish their dreams. That is really, in essence, why I became a professor to begin with. It's just incredibly rewarding. It's really the best part of the job. It's the reason I do this job. Just curious: What do the students call you? I'm just \"Liesl\" to them because I'm a mentor. I do not teach them. In fact, those that are business school students have to take my colleague's version of the required courses instead of mine because this is a mentor relationship\u2014because I have a stake in the game. GW 's first group of Posse Scholars arrived this fall as part of a new partnership with a nationwide college access and leadership development program run by the Posse Foundation. The initiative is one piece of a broader focus on expanding access to GW for students from diverse backgrounds and ensuring their success here. The Posse Foundation finds public school students who may be overlooked by the traditional college selection process and sends groups of 10\u2014\"posses\"\u2014to college together. There, they have a faculty mentor and go through school as a team. At GW\u2014one of 57 Posse schools, which have awarded more than $930 million in scholarships to Posse students\u2014that mentor is Liesl Riddle, an associate professor of international business and international affairs. She spoke with GW Magazine about the experience; an edited transcript follows. You said you heard about the program while lunching with a colleague last spring. What happened after that? I said, \"I hope you nominate me!\" [And the colleague said], \"I was thinking maybe it would be someone else, because I know you're busy with this, that and the other thing, and you've done a lot of service.\" And I'm like, \"No! This is why I came into teaching. This is why I became a faculty member: to do stuff like this.\" And so I pretty much jumped [Q&A] across the table. Maybe my enthusiasm had something to do with being selected. The training\u2014three days in New York, two in Atlanta\u2014sounds intensive. What are some things you picked up as both a professor and a mentor? That learning for this generation happens best in Lego pieces\u2014a small Lego of interaction and movement, a small Lego of blogging, a small Lego of old-fashioned lecture, a small Lego of movie clips. And you pack the learning up and then you get an actual goal accomplished. But you stimulate the senses in different ways, and you define ways to both utilize technologies and pull away from technology, and that balance is what Posse taught me. ... [We also talked about] how to have the conversation about switching gears, changing paths to best match [a student's] interests and talents. ... We look at, for example, simulated transcripts of, \"What if your student came to you with this hope and desire?\" And then, \"What would you say to that student?\" It's important to support hopes and dreams but also make sure that the student is aware of all sorts of other options, \"I PRETTY MUCH JUMPED ACROSS THE TABLE.

His process is a more mystical one, mindful of the agency of words. /By Menachem Wecker, MA '09 / Even from the start of his collection of more than 160 poems spanning 22 years, it's clear that Yahia Lababidi misses Egypt. He dedicates the book to \"the real and imaginary Home I carry in my heart.\" One poem has him \"pick at the earth like a scab/ frantic, and faithful, like a dog,\" having lost Cairo. Another tells of Alexandria's \"wild waking dream/ of a shoreless sea.\" In yet another, he writes of Egypt: \"Self-exiled, even after all these years/ I remain your ever-adoring captive.\" Mr. Lababidi, who is based in Florida and Washington, D.C., grew up in Cairo \"surrounded by literature with a capital 'L'\" in the informal salon his parents arranged. \"We would have the top writers, poets and philosophers there,\" he says. \"I was very young, and I had no idea what was going on. Why were these elders gesticulating wildly and reciting things?\" As a boy, he would sometimes serve drinks to the luminaries and then retreat to his room. But then as a teenager, he started to hang around and absorb, or as he puts it, to realize he was implicated in this world. \"It was as a reader. I remain a reader first,\" he says. One of those regular guests, Ahmed Ragab, a renowned and particularly witty writer, became an important mentor for many years. \"Some of it may have been passed intravenously,\" he adds. He never met his paternal grandfather, who died when his father was young, but Mr. Lababidi bears the name of his grandfather, a celebrated Lebanese poet whose verse\u2014often set to music\u2014is still recited today. \"For the longest time, I felt I hadn't earned my name, because it was his name,\" he says. He's published six books in English\u2014one of aphorisms, one of essays, three of poetry and one of conversations\u2014yet still he envies those who produce systematically. \"I don't sit at my desk at a certain hour or wear a certain hat to conjure the spirits,\" he says. \"I've heard of writers who go to the bar at 5 p.m., so that their muse knows where to find them. My muse must be directionally challenged.\" Instead, he tries to pay attention as he goes about his day and, he says, to blink as little as possible. \"There are so many poems that are ripe for plucking if only one were in the right place and paying attention,\" he says. He no longer scribbles half-baked ideas on napkins or the backs of receipts, as he once did, and he's superstitious and fears that poems get shy around notebooks. The ideas that endure, he believes, are mature enough, while those that do not aren't yet ready. It's a mystical approach. \"If I'm struggling too much with the technical aspect of constructing a poem, I mistrust the poem. I think it's not ready, or it's not mine. Somebody else down the line will do better with it,\" he says. In the new book, one particularly beautiful image surfaces in the beginning of two poems, to which Mr. Lababidi added different endings. \"The mind is full/ of elephants and mice/ scuffling in corridors,\" he writes. \"The air is dense/ with stray spirits [one adds \"and ghosts\"]/ swarming for soul.\" Reworking a poem isn't typical for Mr. Lababidi, but he made an exception for the two poems, titled \"Moment\" and \"Circumstances,\" because he realized things could be \"rotated differently\" yielding equally valid results. \"Normally, I don't allow myself to go back and properly rewrite because of course the temptation is to entirely rewrite the poem,\" he says. \"Then you may as well write a new poem.\" Balancing Acts: New & Selected Poems, 1993-2015 (Press 53, 2016) By Yahia Lababidi, BA '96gwmagazine.com / 21 WILLIAM ATKINSStolen, Smuggled, Sold: On the Hunt for Cultural Treasures (Rowman & Littlefield, 2015) By Nancy Moses, BA '70, MA '74 Most museum visitors don't think much about provenance, or even recognize the term, as they gawk at Monet paintings, taxidermied rhinos or historical documents.

And they made him the greatest swimmer in GW history. // By Matthew Stoss There wasn't a pool handy for Andrea Bolognesi to demonstrate how fast he can swim, so he improvised an exhibition of athletic prowess. The men's swimmer and Most Outstanding Performer of the 2016 Atlantic 10 championship meet went outside the Charles E. Smith Center's side door and jumped as high as his action-figure calves\u2014which pair nicely with his action-figure everything else\u2014could take him. It didn't give you any idea about the Italian's ability in the breaststroke or butterfly, but he made it clear that those action-figure calves aren't glamour muscles. They're thrust. \"I'm good at jumping,\" says Mr. Bolognesi, smiling. \"I jump high.\" On the vertical-leap measuring apparatus in the Smith Center, Mr. Bolognesi, a senior who squats 360 pounds, can touch the 10-foot-6-inch mark. A basketball hoop is 10 feet high. Seeing Mr. Bolognesi poke the sky was enough to get the point across. He's got power in his 5-foot-10, 159-pound body\u2014think of him as a living coil\u2014and when swimming, that helps him not only be fast through the water but consistent with his mechanics and technique on swimming's most democratic stroke. \"Compared to most of the country and most of his competitors that he sees at the A-10 level, it could be very even the first 25 percent of the race\u2014and he's still going to be in the lead,\" GW coach James Winchester says. \"It's such a small margin, but his ability to hold his efficiency together, while also having great power, really separate him in the back half of the race.\" At the A-10 championship meet last February in Geneva, Ohio, Mr. Bolognesi separated himself from the conference. Swimming in his first collegiate meet\u2014credit-transfer issues from the International University of Monaco kept the Cuveglio, Italy, native ineligible to swim in his first GW semester\u2014Mr. Bolognesi set a record every time he got in the pool for an individual event. He swam three preliminaries and three finals and each time broke either a standing A-10 record or one he'd set in the prelims. Six times in the pool, six records. At the end of the meet, Mr. Bolognesi owned the A-10 mark for the 200-yard individual medley butterfly (47.18) and the 100-yard breaststroke (52.44), his signature event. It was the best showing in the 100 breaststroke at the A-10s since 2000-01 when GW's Alvaro Fortuny won with a 54.65. \"I knew I was in good shape, but since I never swam in yards in good shape, I had no idea ... where [my times] were at,\" says Mr. Bolognesi, who swam only in meter pools in Europe before arriving at GW in August 2015. \"I just had my conversion time from meters and they were telling that I was around the best times in each event.\" Mr. Bolognesi, also at the A-10 meet, helped set four GW relay records\u2014200 freestyle relay (1:21.31), 400 free medley relay (3:16.36), 200 medley relay (1:29.81)\u2014and after just one meet, he became the greatest swimmer in program history.

A shooting guard on Argentina's men's national basketball team, he was a newbie among greats, including four players\u2014San Antonio Spurs star Manu Ginobili among them\u2014 from the 2004 \"Golden Generation\" squad that won gold in Athens. \"To be honest, I wasn't expecting to get as many minutes as I did,\" says Mr. Garino, who averaged 14.1 points per game for the Colonials in 2015-16, helping them to the NIT title. \"It's my second year with the national team, and we had a team full of superstars.\"In the Olympics, Mr. Garino averaged 24.8 minutes, 6.3 points and 3.2 rebounds in six games as Argentina reached the quarterfinals before losing 105- 78 to the United States. In his debut, Mr. Garino netted an Olympic personal-best 15 points, going 5-for-6 from the floor. He shot 53.6 percent for the tournament. Off the court, Mr. Garino says, everything in Rio went well. The mosquito and crime threats were, in his experience, non-factors; the Olympic Village apartments were nice but spare of luxury, he says\u2014except for extra-long beds for the basketball players; and he had fun getting to know the other athletes. All that on top of the chance to play on the same team as his idols. \"They've been our heroes for, literally, all our lives,\" the 23-year-old says. \"And now, being alongside them, it was literally amazing.\" JENNIFER RIZZOTTI First-year GW women's basketball coach Jennifer Rizzotti served as an assistant coach to Geno Auriemma on the U.S. women's basketball team, which claimed its sixth straight gold medal and averaged 102.1 points per game. Ms. Rizzotti, a member of Mr. Auriemma's national team staff since 2013, used her time around noted women's coaches like DePaul's Doug Bruno and South Carolina's Dawn Staley to pad her acumen, picking up nuance and philosophy\u2014like how to run a better ball screen and spacing on the floor. \"You're in a room full of people who have been doing things a long time, in a really great way, and you just pick their brains,\" says Ms. Rizzotti, who wasn't an on-court coach. She scouted and helped at practice. (GW assistant director of basketball operations Kevin DeMille was on the Olympic staff, too.) \"I asked Doug about their practice plans and their preseason schedule,\" Ms. Rizzotti says. \"I talked to Dawn about what they do for their workouts. There's always an opportunity to see how someone else is doing something and figure out how you can apply that to better yourself.\" YUTA WATANABE Yuta Watanabe, a junior guard on GW's men's basketball team, got close to making the Olympics while playing for Japan's national team. Mr. Watanabe had 10 points, seven rebounds and three blocks in an 87-71 group-play loss to the Czech Republic, which eliminated Japan during the FIBA Olympic qualifiers in Serbia. Japan went 2-2, and Mr. Watanabe averaged seven points and four rebounds in those games.championships, where he finished eighth in the 100 breaststroke, becoming the first GW swimmer to be a first-team All-American. In the NCAA prelims, he set a personal record with a time of 52.06. He swam a 52.51 in the finals. The national champion swam a 51.29. \"If Andrea could have set all the conference records and not gone to NCAAs,\" Mr. Winchester says, \"we still would have been talking a phenomenal performance and one of the greatest A-10 performances ever.\" Mr. Bolognesi came to the U.S. to further his education while still swimming at an elite level. (In Europe, after you age out of club sports, it's either go pro or nothing.) And Mr. Winchester describes him as a \"program changer.\" His showing helped lure a freshman recruiting class that Mr. Winchester considers the best in GW history. It includes Maximilian Forstenh\u00e4usler, ranked 131st in the country by CollegeSwimming.com, and No. 210-ranked Andrew Cho\u2014rare gets for a program outside a Power Five conference. The NCAA record for the 100-yard breaststroke is 50.04, set in 2014 by Arizona's Kevin Cordes. He finished fourth in the 100-meter breaststroke at the 2016 Olympics. It's unlikely that Mr. Bolognesi, who will turn 23 in December, could pare 2 \u00bd seconds from his time, but dropping a tenth of a second or even several tenths? That's doable, and that's what everyone's aiming for after his dramatic 2016 debut. At this point, he's doing more refining than major surgery on his strokes. Lately, in terms of breaststroke, he's focused on making his kick more hydrodynamic. During the summer, he says, he worked with fellow Italian breaststroker Nicolo Martinenghi, who in August at age 17, broke the Italian record for the 50-meter breaststroke. Mr. Bolognesi is aiming to qualify for the Italian national team and compete in December's World Swimming Championships in Windsor, Ontario, but he realizes swimming is defined by interminable training, which may or may not result in a small handful of miracle moments. \"It's hard,\" Mr. Bolognesi says of improving on his 2016, \"... but I'll try to make it better.\" ATHLETICS COMMUNICATIONS gwmagazine.com / 25[Gymnastics] An Added Twist An already vault-adept squad may get a boost from a rule change. // By Matthew Stoss ATHLETICS COMMUNICATIONSJillian Winstanley sat calmly and described what it's like to compete in the vault\u2014to launch your body several feet into the air, do some flips and twirls, and land without crashing/dying despite sometimes not being able to see where you're coming down. It can be scary. But that's the allure of participating in the gymnastic equivalent of the human cannonball. \"It's that 10-second rush when you go,\" says Ms. Winstanley, a junior and an all-conference GW gymnast. \"It's very focused and driven on, 'Here I am starting, and this is my end goal, and this is where I'm gonna be right now,' and it's just instant gratification, that feeling when you stick the landing.\" The Colonials have made a habit of that, claiming two straight East Atlantic Gymnastics League vault titles (the Atlantic 10 does not sponsor gymnastics), with Ms. Winstanley winning in 2016 and junior Cami Drouin-Allaire winning in 2015. This season, GW is in position to continue its dominance, thanks in part to a rule change intended to make gymnasts attempt a wider variety of vaults. \"That has really given us an advantage,\" GW coach Margie Foster- Cunningham says. The point value for the vault maneuver that has become the college standard\u2014a Yurchenko full twist\u2014has been reduced to 9.95 from 10.0, which makes the Yurchenko 1 \u00bd the next easiest 10-point vault, even though it requires a blind landing.A blind landing is one where you can't see the ground, and two of GW's three vaulters, Ms. Winstanley and senior Chelsea Raineri are comfortable with them. Ms. Drouin-Allaire isn't a fan, but she's working on a double twist, also valued at 10 points, to compensate. \"You get one vault,\" Ms. Foster-Cunningham says of college gymnastics. \"That's the difference from the Olympics where you get two chances. So [college] coaches go conservative on that and do the one vault they know the athletes can make. It's much riskier to do the 1 \u00bd.\" Last season, Ms. Drouin-Allaire took third overall in the vault (9.90) at the NCAA regionals. As a freshman, she became only the second GW gymnast to qualify as an individual for the NCAA championships, where she tied for eighth with a 9.875, good for All-American status. \"I was proud of it,\" says Ms. Drouin-Allaire, who last year became the first GW athlete to be named EAGL Gymnast of the Year. \"I hit all my routines, which was really my goal. I had never been there before, and to make it there was just an incredible achievement in itself.\" Ms. Foster-Cunningham says her current vaulters are the best she's had in 33 years at GW because of their speed and \"air sense,\" or knowing where they are when they're upside down and twisting. \"It's like being a cat,\" Ms. Foster-Cunningham says. \"You can throw them and somehow they land on their feet.\" above Junior Cami Drouin- Allaire, who last year took third overall in the vault at the NCAA regionals26 / gw magazine / Fall 2016RUMBLE & SWAY After 30 years in the U.S. Senate\u2014and at least as many tussles as tangos\u2014the chamber's highest- ranking Democrat, Harry Reid, JD '64, prepares to make an exit.

Chuck Schumer, who in January replaces Mr. Reid as Democratic leader in the Senate, hold a press conference Sept. 29 this page Mr. Reid in his office on Capitol Hillgwmagazine.com / 29ne of the happier days in U.S. Sen. Harry Reid's political life was when his security guards said they wanted him to stop appearing in parades. Great, replied Mr. Reid. He never liked them anyway. Perhaps other politicians also see home-state parades as a chore. But few gladly forego the campaign staples that Mr. Reid has ignored throughout his three-decade congressional career, which ends with his retirement in early January. He almost never goes to the dinners and receptions that many lawmakers see as essential, and maybe even enjoyable. He doesn't go on Sunday talk shows. He doesn't kiss babies, slap backs or make even cursory efforts at warmth or conversation. \"It's amazing what I have not done,\" the Nevada Democrat and 1964 GW Law graduate says in a recent interview in his Capitol office. \"I don't go home every week. I never have, even when I was in the House. I don't like banquets, parades.\" House and Senate members typically live two political lives simultaneously. Their public side, ever focused on the next election, makes sure their hair, quips and talking points are always ready for a TV interview or visit from constituents. They go home every weekend, especially if they're junior-level House members. Meanwhile their unseen side digs into Congress' mundane workings. If they've reached a leadership level, they help plan legislative strategies and intramural jockeying. Most, however, labor away at raising money, preparing for committee hearings and overseeing constituent services for voters back home. In his four years in the House and 30 years in the Senate, Mr. Reid\u2014who turns 77 on Dec. 2\u2014eschewed the public side whenever possible. He devoted himself to becoming the consummate inside player: a patient listener and keeper of colleagues' wish lists, and a pragmatic workhorse willing to spend weeks or months hammering out a deal to seat (or block) a judicial nominee, to pass (or kill) a bill. His grind-it-out work ethic and constant attention to colleagues' needs paid off. He became the second-highest-ranking Senate Democrat in 1999, and ascended to the party's top leadership post when Tom Daschle lost his 2004 re-election bid. For the past 17 years, Harry Reid has been at or near the center of almost every major federal issue, playing key roles in the 2009 stimulus, the passage of \"Obamacare\" and the deeply divisive decision to change the Senate's filibuster rules for nominations. As Washington's partisan wars grew hotter, Mr. Reid found himself fighting hard just to keep Democrats united, not pretending that bipartisan accord was possible. After Congress passed the landmark health care bill without a single Republican vote, the two parties' war of words grew ever more bitter, and O30 / gw magazine / Fall 2016Mr. Reid engaged as fiercely as anyone. For good or bad, his acerbic attacks on Republicans (he called Donald Trump \"a racist, incompetent failure\") seem in step with the times. As Mr. Reid leaves, it's unclear when or if his Democratic successors and their Republican counterparts can return to the brand of two-party consensus that we studied in civics class and that Mr. Reid once championed. SILVER STATEMACHIAVELLI Before he could climb the leadership ladder, of course, Mr. Reid had to find a way up that allowed for his strategy of going home sporadically, disdaining TV appearances and not bothering with the usual niceties saddled on someone who has to stand for re-election every six years. Mr. Reid, who looks professorial and barely speaks above a whisper, handled this problem by becoming a modern-day Machiavelli. Never one for subtlety or sheepishness, he brazenly intervened in Nevada's Republican primaries, spending heavily and pulling strings to assure himself a weakened opponent in the general election. His first big test came in 1998, when he ran for a third Senate term against a fast-rising Republican congressman, John Ensign. \"Ensign was everything Reid wasn't\u2014telegenic and smooth,\" Jon Ralston, a top Nevada political reporter and longtime Reid chronicler, wrote in Politico . Mr. Reid needed a way to drive up Democratic excitement and turnout. He eventually persuaded Las Vegas Mayor Jan Jones to launch an uphill gubernatorial Mr. Reid says the only Senate vote he regrets in 30 years was to authorize the Iraq invasion. \"But I am also sorry I was lied to,\" he says.campaign against a popular Republican, Kenny Guinn. Dr. Guinn, as most predicted, handily defeated her. Mr. Reid, meanwhile, squeaked past John Ensign by 428 votes. \"Reid had done everything he could to stack the deck in his favor,\" Mr. Ralston wrote, and \"found a way to win a race he never should have won.\" Mr. Reid's intervention was even more audacious in 2010, when polls and pundits noted his sagging popularity and predicted his ouster. First, he used his influence to move Nevada's 2008 presidential caucus earlier in the calendar. Excited by Barack Obama's insurgent campaign and the state's heightened political prominence, tens of thousands of new Democrats turned out, boosting the voter rolls for 2010. Then Mr. Reid turned his energies to seeing that the Republicans' most promising candidate, Sue Lowden, didn't become his GOP challenger. His team ran attack ads against her and took other steps to help tea party activist Sharron Angle in the Republican primary. Mr. Reid figured Ms. Angle was too extreme for Nevada, and he was right. She came from far back to win the primary, and Mr. Reid\u2014running against his handpicked opponent\u2014won the general election. It was a brilliant, if cynical, strategy, in step with a lifetime of looking for battles if they didn't find him first. SHORT-SHORTSAND FISTICUFFS Like many oft-told stories, the biography of \"The Man from Searchlight\" has taken on some mythic hues. Surviving the car bomb planted by the mob when he opposed corrupt casinos? Well, not exactly. But Mr. Reid did hitchhike 47 miles to high school, fought professional boxers, punched his future father-in-law, worked his way through law school as a Capitol cop and held a four-decade grudge against the George Washington University. Mr. Reid was born in the desert town of Searchlight, where his father mined gold and his mother did laundry for a bordello. Their home, built of old railroad ties, lacked an indoor toilet, hot water and a telephone. Mr. Reid dreamed of being a baseball or football star. But first he had to get to high school, which meant hitchhiking to Henderson, sometimes spending the week with aunts and uncles. In Henderson, a pretty girl \"wearing short-shorts\" and washing her family's car caught his eye, Mr. Reid recalls in his 2008 memoir, The Good Fight. Landra Gould was \"out of my league,\" Mr. Reid wrote, but he tried nonetheless. Owning no car, he borrowed one for their first date. The starter didn't work, so the young couple parked the car on hills and coasted to jump-start it. She was smart, fun and Jewish. Mr. Reid was neither Jewish nor anything else, really. He says he had never entered a house of worship at that point, and \"knew absolutely nothing\" about Jesus. But one of his favorite aunts was a Mormon, and he began attending Mormon instructional sessions because \"all the best-looking girls\" went there. Mr. Reid also began boxing at a local Boys Club, and continued through college. Getting pummeled as a 190-pound heavyweight, he gwmagazine.com / 31lost 30 pounds. \"At 160,\" he wrote, \"I could fight anybody.\" He boxed in about 20 fights, some involving professionals, but he never earned more than modest expense money. Mrs. Reid's parents were kind and welcoming until they realized their daughter might actually marry this non-Jewish boy. When her father tried to bar him from their house, Mr. Reid wrote, \"I threw a punch, and then the whole mess spilled out into the front yard.\" The young couple eloped in 1959 and joined the Mormon church\u2014widely popular in Nevada\u2014for life. The families eventually reconciled, and Mr. Reid wore his father-in-law's ring for years, out of respect. By 1961, with a new baby girl, the couple was ready to leave Nevada so Mr. Reid could attend law school. He considered a scholarship offer from Santa Clara University, but his closest friend and adviser said Washington was the place for him. The young family moved there and Mr. Reid began classes at GW. To pay bills, he also worked full time at the Capitol as a police officer. Still, the family struggled. When their Buick broke down, and Mrs. Reid learned she was pregnant again, Mr. Reid sought counsel from a GW dean. \"I was probably hoping for some assistance from the wealthy university,\" Mr. Reid wrote later. But the dean stunned him by suggesting he quit law school. \"He may have been employing some sophisticated reverse psychology to make me angry and to motivate me,\" Mr. Reid wrote. Nonetheless, after graduating he refused to set foot on GW's campus or answer its letters for 41 years. Mr. Reid ended the boycott in May 2005, addressing GW's graduating law class. \"In retrospect,\" he said of his grudge, \"I should have gotten over it sooner.\" He apologized for his \"pettiness.\" LAW Y ER TO LA WMAKER Mr. Reid returned with his family to Nevada in early 1964 and practiced law for several years. But he hadn't forgotten the thrill of being elected treasurer of his high school junior class. His adult political career started well. He was elected to the Nevada Assembly in 1968, and lieutenant governor in 1970. But after losing elections for U.S. Senate and Las Vegas mayor, Mr. Reid agreed to chair the Nevada Gaming Commission, overseeing casinos still run in part by organized crime. One day Mrs. Reid\u2014by then the mother of five\u2014saw something protruding from the family car's gas tank. When police found an amateurishly wired bomb, Mr. Reid blamed a mobster he'd help send to prison. It was never proven, but the incident burnished Mr. Reid's image as a courageous public official, and his political career revived. He won election to the U.S. House in 1982 and 1984, returning to the building he knew from his police days. Elected to the Senate in 1986, he began a long, steady climb into Democratic leadership. From the start, Mr. Reid focused less on policies and ideals than on keeping the legislative trains running and ingratiating himself to Democratic colleagues. When I ask him how he'd like to be remembered, he says he cares only to be \"remembered as someone who was always very honest with people, very candid ... And that I was good to my family, and was a friend to people.\" When I note he had not mentioned any policies from his three-decade career, he shrugs. \"Some other people,\" he says, want to be remembered for speeches, bills or \"the great policy issues they worked on.\" In hindsight, keeping the spotlight off his beliefs and ideals helped Mr. Reid rise in Democratic ranks as the party became more liberal, due mainly to its loss of Southern conservatives. Many in Washington, for instance, didn't realize that for years the Nevada Mormon opposed Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion\u2014a cornerstone of Democratic doctrine. Mr. Reid rarely called attention to the issue, and he gradually changed his position without fanfare. FIGHTING,NOT DANCING \"I know how to dance, I know how to fight,\" Mr. Reid once said, \"and I'd rather dance.\" For whatever reasons, however, Mr. Reid did more fighting than dancing throughout most of his career. (He told The New Yorker he lost the 1974 Senate race because \"I attacked everybody.\") Not prone to philosophy or long explanations, Mr. Reid said in the interview: \"I have no choice. I can't run from a fight.\" Among his fiercest battles was to keep Republicans from changing the Senate's filibuster rules in 2005. It was a miserable year for Democrats. They'd just seen President George W. Bush win re-election while Republicans added to their House and Senate majorities. Mr. Daschle's re-election loss left Mr. Reid to lead a demoralized Democratic caucus. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans were furious that Democrats were using their 45 votes to block many of Mr. Bush's judicial nominees in the 100-member chamber. Over the years, both parties had used the filibuster\u2014which can halt Senate action unless 60 senators vote to proceed\u2014to thwart the majority party on some issues. But now, Republicans said Democrats had gone too far, especially in blocking several of Mr. Bush's appellate court nominees. If the Democrats didn't back off, GOP leaders said, they'd deploy a \"nuclear option\": using a simple-majority vote to change the filibuster rules. Democrats, led by Mr. Reid, were incensed. The Republican majority, Mr. Reid said in a floor speech, \"has threatened to break the Senate rules, violate over 200 years of Senate tradition and impair the ability of Democrats and Republicans to work together on issues of real concern to the American people.\" For a while, Mr. Reid tried bipartisan, closed-door negotiations. He exchanged offers with top Bush aide Karl Rove in vain. With Mr. Reid and Republican Senate leader Bill Frist on a collision course, a renegade group of seven Democratic senators and seven Republicans snatched the issue from their leaders. The bipartisan \"Gang of 14\" forged an agreement to allow votes on some of Mr. Bush's stalled judicial nominees while preserving the minority's right to filibuster others in \"extraordinary circumstances.\" Mr. Reid and Dr. Frist had no choice but to accept the compromise. But party leadership jobs clearly were becoming more difficult in a time of heightened partisanship. Nothing underscored the challenge more than the ferocious 2009-2010 battle over newly elected President Obama's top domestic priority: an overhaul of the health care system, or the Affordable Care Act. The 2006 and 2008 elections had greatly improved the Democrats' fortunes, and now they held solid House and Senate majorities. Mr. Obama and other Democrats wanted at least a few Republican votes, so they could label the health care legislation \"bipartisan.\" A handful of Republican senators said they'd play ball. But long, contentious negotiations ultimately collapsed, infuriating Democrats who felt duped into wasting precious time. Then, after an election recount in Minnesota, Democrats got the rarest of gifts: a filibuster-proof Senate majority of 60. Now it was up to Mr. Reid to steer every last Democrat (and Democratic-leaning independent) into the \"Obamacare\" corral, and shut the gate. It wasn't pretty. Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut insisted on killing the \"public option\" for buying health insurance, dashing millions of liberals' hopes. Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska conditioned his vote on a special Medicaid reimbursement rate for his state\u2014the much-derided \"Cornhusker Kickback,\" which he'd later regret. On Christmas Eve 2009, the Senate passed the Affordable Care Act with no votes to spare, and no GOP help. They sent it to the House and went home for Christmas. Many liberals were outraged over the \"We make deals in the Senate, we compromise. It is essential to the enterprise,\" he wrote in 2008. Two years later, that seemed sadly na\u00efve. gwmagazine.com / 33loss of the public option and other priorities. Still, Politico called it \"Harry Reid's defining moment as majority leader.\" And Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who replaces Mr. Reid in January as Democratic leader, called the outcome \"a total vindication of Harry Reid's strategy.\" Senate Democrats lost their veto-proof majority a few weeks later, when Republican Scott Brown succeeded the late Ted Kennedy in Massachusetts. This made the health care battle even uglier in the House. Democrats there couldn't alter so much as a comma in the Senate version, which many liberals detested. Any change would send it back to the Senate for certain death by GOP filibuster. So, like Mr. Reid, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had to cajole and browbeat her Democratic troops into passing the bill without any Republican votes. Some pundits praised Mr. Reid and Ms. Pelosi for using every ounce of their persuasion, cunning and goodwill to hand Mr. Obama a huge victory. Lost in the cheering, however, was a remarkable fact. Congressional leaders\u2014think Lyndon Johnson, but others, too\u2014were usually lauded for crafting compromises between the two parties. Now, it was all Mr. Reid and Ms. Pelosi could do to deliver a win solely by keeping their own troops in line. Conservatives, meanwhile, hailed the GOP leaders\u2014Mitch McConnell in the Senate and John Boehner in the House\u2014for not yielding an inch. In The Good Fight, Mr. Reid wrote: \"We make deals in the Senate, we compromise. It is essential to the enterprise.\" Two years later, that seemed sadly na\u00efve. FILIBUSTERFLIPFLOP By 2008, Democrats controlled the Senate again. Majority Leader Reid promised not to repay Republicans by pursuing the \"nuclear option\" change in filibuster rules. \"As long as I am the leader, the answer's no,\" Mr. Reid told C-SPAN. \"I hope we never, ever get to that again because I really do believe it will ruin our country.\" Five years later, Mr. Obama was starting his second term, and now Republicans were the minority party using the filibuster to block judicial and cabinet nominees. When the Republicans kept the president from filling three vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Mr. Reid did a U-turn and called for changing the filibuster rules. \"The Senate is a living thing,\" he said, \"and to survive it must change.\" Republicans, who had threatened the same change in 2005, did their own 34 / gw magazine / Fall 2016 \"In our little home, my mother had a navy- blue embroidered pillowcase ... and she put it up on the wall. On it, in bright yellow stitching it read, 'We can. We will. We must. \u2014 Franklin Delano Roosevelt.' And that was my religion.\" Mr. Reid describing in his 2008 memoir, The Good Fight, his home and hardscrabble life in a once-booming Nevada mining town, which by the 1940s no longer claimed so much as a phone or a TV, let alone a doctor or dentist. He was raised in a house made of railroad ties, chicken wire and plaster, with an outhouse in the back. Though he says he spent years hiding the struggles of his past\u2014his family's, his town's\u2014Mr. Reid eventually embraced its role in shaping him. \"[S]ome of the men and women of greatest character that I will ever meet in my life came from this place of hard rocks and inhospitable soil,\" he wrote. \"Sometimes people need to be slapped across the face to understand 'This is something we need your attention on.'\" HARRY REID, ON HIS SOMETIMES-ACIDIC DISCOURSE ALL: COURTESY OFFICE OF SEN. HARRY REIDclockwise from right Mr. Reid in his boxing days; his family's home in Searchlight, Nev.; being sworn in to Congress by House Speaker Tip O'Neill, surrounded by familygwmagazine.com / 35turnabout and protested bitterly\u2014to no avail. Using a simple-majority vote to rewrite Senate rules, the Democrats eliminated the filibuster for executive branch and judicial nominations, except for the Supreme Court. Nonpartisan PolitiFact rated Mr. Reid's move a \"Full Flop.\" \"I had no choice,\" Mr. Reid says in our interview. In 2005, he says, he had made numerous concessions to appease the Frist-led Republicans, agreeing to confirm Bush nominees \"who should never have been on the D.C. Circuit.\" But in 2013, he says, \"the Republicans weren't willing to do that.\" U N VA R NISHED,AND SOMETIMES ACIDIC There's a reason every Reid profile calls him a \"pugilistic\" ex-boxer. The metaphor is irresistible. And his brawler background explains his approach to politics as well as anything. His insults are famous. He called Alan Greenspan, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, \"one of the biggest political hacks\" in Washington. He called a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2014a Democrat, no less\u2014\"unethical, prevaricating\" and \"a first-class rat.\" loser,\" \"spoiled, rich brat\" and \"racist, incompetent failure who managed to lose a billion dollars in a boom year.\" Some of his most famous and consequential feuds were with the second President Bush, whom he called \"a liar.\" Mr. Reid grew disenchanted soon after Bush's 2001 inauguration, saying the new president misled him into thinking the administration would move cautiously, if at all, on plans to permanently store nuclear waste in Nevada's Yucca Mountain. Blocking the project has been central to Mr. Reid's political survival in Nevada. But nothing made Mr. Reid angrier than Mr. Bush's advocacy for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He says the president concealed his pre-2001 targeting of Saddam Hussein, and then misled the world about Iraq's supposed weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Reid says the only Senate vote he regrets in 30 years was his vote to authorize the invasion. \"But I am also sorry I was lied to,\" he says. Mr. Reid's spats with the president sometimes bordered on farcical. \"Your dog is fat,\" he once told Mr. Bush\u2014in the Oval Office. He called Bush a \"loser\" and \"liar.\" He apologized for the \"loser\" remark (Mr. Bush twice won the presidency, after all), but not \"liar.\" Former Reid aide Jim Manley says the senator's \"intemperate remarks\" are rarely temper tantrums. \"There's a method to his madness,\" Mr. Manley says. \"He likes to throw things against the wall and see what sticks.\" After launching a verbal missile, Mr. Manley says, Mr. Reid watches to \"see how people react, see how the rats scurry from the ship\u2014where they are going, and who they are talking to.\" But Rutgers University political scientist Ross Baker, who has enjoyed unusual access to Mr. Reid's staff and offices, doubts there's calculation behind the senator's barbs. \"We're marked by our origins,\" Dr. Baker says. \"No one in that hovel where he was raised taught him etiquette or politesse.\" When I ask Mr. Reid whether his acidic comments are wholly spontaneous or sometimes designed to rattle people, he hedges. \"I think it's a mixture,\" he says. \"Sometimes people need to be slapped across the face to understand 'This is something we need your attention on.'\" COMPLICATEDLEGACY Mr. Reid shows little interest in helping journalists or historians decide his legacy. During our interview, he is brusque and to the point, as usual. When I ask how he hopes to be remembered\u2014other than as an honest friend and good family member\u2014he replies: \"The rest of the stuff, other people can write about that.\" He got a huge endorsement in 2012 from Robert Caro, the celebrated biographer of Lyndon Johnson, the dominant Senate majority leader of modern times. Mr. Reid \"has done a terrific job\" as majority leader under \"near impossible circumstances,\" Mr. Caro said. Others are less generous. \"I can't help thinking Reid is one who deserves some blame for the deterioration of discourse that numbed the country to Trump's vulgarity,\" Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank wrote in September. Perhaps some historians will agree that Mr. Reid played a significant role in coarsening our political language. But others will likely conclude that Mr. Reid chose to ride\u2014rather than push or resist\u2014the rising waves of angry rhetoric surrounding Bill Clinton's sex scandal and impeachment, government shutdowns, the tea party revolt, court nomination battles, Mr. Trump's campaign and more. By the time Mr. Obama pushed his landmark health bill, it took all the strength Mr. Reid could muster just to keep his Democratic caucus 100 percent on board. Anyone who thinks it's easy to keep a party caucus in line these days should ask former House Speaker Boehner.WISTFULDEPARTUR E As Mr. Reid wraps up his tenure, he worries about Congress' ability to solve big problems. The House, he tells me, is almost hopeless. \"The House is going to be as it is. The majority party controls everything.\" He pauses briefly. \"I would hope the Senate would not become another House of Representatives. But unless the Republicans change, that's where we're all headed.\" Mr. Reid says he and his wife will keep a home in Nevada but spend most of their time in Washington. He plans to announce a new job in December. \"Hopefully I'll be of some benefit,\" Mr. Reid says, but not as a lobbyist. \"I'd rather be taken to Singapore and caned,\" he says. Friends and rivals already are offering testimonials. Mitch McConnell, who tangled with Mr. Reid more often than anyone else, provided a GOP template for limited praise in March when he said of Mr. Reid: \"Underestimated often, his distinctive grit and determined focus nevertheless saw him through many challenges. They continue to make him a formidable opponent today.\" Mr. Manley, the former aide, said the arc of Mr. Reid's career reflects political realities. \"He really wanted to go out having a whole slew of legislative accomplishments,\" Mr. Manley says. But rising partisan warfare made it impossible. \"I honestly believe he would have loved to have danced more, and fought less. But he had no choice.\" If Mr. Reid shares such regrets, he hides them. \"I love this institution,\" he tells me. If a serious workout accident involving elastic bands had not blinded his right eye two years ago, Mr. Reid says, he would have sought a sixth term this year. But the loss of depth perception seriously impairs his stability, especially when descending stairs or inclines. So he felt forced to retire. \"I wish I could be here forever,\" Mr. Reid says as our interview ends. \"Every day has been such a pleasure for me.\" Charles Babington has covered Congress for The Washington Post, the Associated Press and other news organizations.

The U.S. team suspended both Americans and Mr. Norman was effectively blacklisted at home. above Mich\u00e8le Gates Moresi, seen through the crowd at a museum preview in September, ahead of the opening later that monthgwmagazine.com / 39 n the spring of 2006, Mich\u00e8le Gates Moresi flew to Chicago to see about a painting. In an apartment up near the top of a skyscraper, she stood before Charles Alston's Walking . The owner's parents had bought it for her and she'd had it all her life. Now she was downsizing and needed a decision from Dr. Gates Moresi, MPhil '97, PhD '03. The oil painting\u2014by an artist whose bust of Martin Luther King Jr. became the first image of an African American on display in the White House, in 1990\u2014was inspired by the bus boycotts of the 1950s. Dr. Gates Moresi looked over the painting, with its vivid, abstract colors and angular forms; she confirmed that it was not in tatters or otherwise beyond rescue, and she decided to take it\u2014the first acquisition among thousands that she would make over the next decade, and one of the first objects to become part of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. The museum now is an extraordinary assemblage of objects large and small, from a slave cabin and a 44-seat segregated rail car to a pair of M.C. Hammer's signature pants and a punched ringside ticket to see a mouthy upstart, Cassius Clay, topple a giant to claim the world heavyweight championship. But while museums typically are built to house established collections, here the institution was founded before collecting began, and the two grew up together. When Dr. Gates Moresi went to see the Alston painting, it was only a few months after the museum was given a plot of land to call home. She was working to fill a museum that wasn't built, with exhibits that hadn't yet been decided on, and whose staff at the time she could count on her fingers. They were starting from scratch, deciding which objects to go looking for, which donations to accept, which stories to tell. Dr. Gates Moresi, now the museum's supervisory curator of collections, had been hired a few weeks prior. When she started, there was a single object in the collection: a boat stool from Ecuador, part of the shared heritage of people descended from Africans who were brought unwillingly throughout the Americas. During the daytime, it was a canoe seat. At night, you could carry it inside and sit on it to tell stories. She remembers asking the museum's director, Lonnie G. Bunch III, \"So, how many artifacts do we need to get before we open?\" The number he came up with was 30,000. \"He said, 'Then we're a museum.'\" When the National Museum of African American History and Culture opened this September, a century in the making and occupying the last plot on the National Mall, there were more than 3,000 objects on display\u2014including the boat stool and Alston's Walking \u2014and nearly 34,000 more in storage. IN THE BEGINNING, the curators collected largely on gut feeling, based on their \"Eleven years ago we began this trek full of trepidation, and motivated by a desire to complete a journey that began a hundred years ago. So for 11 years we have dreamed, prayed, toiled for this day. But what kept us going was the way people stopped us on the street just to say 'Thank you.'\" \u2014Museum Director Lonnie G. Bunch III, who taught at GW from 1989 to 2000, speaking at the museum's grand openingLOGAN WERLINGERknowledge of history and art. Everyone was working on topics outside of their expertise to cover the bases. Dr. Gates Moresi\u2014who studied history at Boston University and American studies at GW\u2014ended up at her first auction, a Christie's sale of a James Brown collection. She brought a budget, a list of items to try for and a colleague who could help keep track of what was happening in the fast-moving sale. \"It is nerve-wracking,\" she says. She emerged, budget intact, with the Godfather of Soul's keyboard, some clothes and speakers bearing his initials. It wasn't just relics; they also collected history in real time. Right after the 2008 election, her colleague Jacquelyn Serwer got a call that the Obama campaign headquarters in Fairfax County, Va., was being packed up. The offices were a rental\u2014 in an old barbershop, complete with chairs\u2014and staff had only a few days to vacate. \"There was a big dumpster outside,\" Dr. Gates Moresi says. \"We were like, 'Don't throw away too much!'\" At the campaign office, they did informal interviews and decided what to take. \"It was, quite frankly, overwhelming. People were so excited,\" she says. They collected the white boards, with the notes from the final days of the campaign; flyers in a multitude of languages; even a barber's chair and a La- Z-Boy, which they were convinced to put in Dr. Gates Moresi's pickup only after staffers showed them pictures of all the different people sleeping on it. As the dozen opening exhibitions came into focus, collecting could shift toward objects needed to tell those stories. An exhibition Dr. Gates Moresi co- curated, Making a Way Out of No Way, explores how African Americans moved through an often hostile world. \"It's about everyday people,\" she says. Museums tend to offer a one-dimensional view of the African-American experience, but \"black lives were not always about protest,\" she says. Even in the civil rights era, people got up in the morning, went to work or school and were involved in their communities. It's a broad, complete reflection that the museum in general sought to build. \"What we keep saying to folks is that this museum tells the American story with an African American lens,\" she says; the African American story, told in full. \"If it's constantly being told as a marginal story, then you're not fully engaging that story and embracing it.\" TEN DAYS before the museum's opening, Dr. Gates Moresi stood in front of a case in the Making a Way Out of No Way exhibit displaying items related to the Independent Order of St. Luke, an organization that helped African Americans with financial needs\u2014burial expenses, disability and life insurance\u2014during the Jim Crow era. The story of the organization and its impact is told in part through artifacts related to Maggie Walker, a leader of the order who was known for being the first black woman to found a bank.

This history is right in your face. Sometimes people say 'That was then, this is now.' That's not true here.

Just down the way are desks from the Hope School in South Carolina, which educated rural African-American children in the early 20th century. Other objects are closer to home: A display about Prince Hall Freemasonry, the oldest African American Masonic order, was put together by another curator and includes items from Dr. Gates Moresi's family. She was visiting her grandmother and noticed a certificate on the wall, commemorating her grandfather's initiation into Freemasonry. But it was marred by brown marks. \"Oh, Nana, do you want me to maybe take care of that for you?\" she'd said. She took it to a private paper conservator, who concluded that it had probably been damaged by heat. Dr. Gates Moresi had a high-resolution image made so her grandmother could display that instead. Her grandmother told her just to take the original, and she donated it to the museum. Initially, Dr. Gates Moresi says, it didn't seem like a big deal to put a personal object in the collection. \"For me, it kind of felt like work.\" She'd filled a gap in a planned exhibit and solved a problem for herself\u2014she no longer had to worry about taking care of a delicate object. But, when her family came to a museum preview ahead of the opening, it felt different. \"They totally flipped out,\" she says, and only then did she get emotional about it. \"I see that all the time, the meaning that it has for individuals\" to see their belongings in a museum, or to recognize an everyday object that is just like one they grew up with. \"It's a very humbling situation.\" But she hadn't thought about the experience herself. \"It feels good. It is humbling when it's me, too.\" Many artifacts are less uplifting. The museum is often offered so-called \"African Americana\"\u2014collectible items with stereotypical representations, like Aunt Jemima and Uncle Mose salt and pepper shakers. When this first happened, Dr. Gates Moresi was shocked. \"How am I supposed to handle this?\" she asked Mr. Bunch, the director. \"I don't understand how\u2014what do I do?'\" The objects don't represent the African American experience, but they still are part of the story, she says. \"These everyday objects, from tablecloths to little tchotchkes that people put up\u2014that's part of the context that African Americans had to continue their lives in, that they would be seen in this very one-dimensional way.\" Early on, the museum was offered a large collection of African Americana, and she and Mr. Bunch decided to take it and be done. From then on, they could be highly selective of such offers. The museum also made the decision not to pay for those types of objects or for memorabilia related to the Ku Klux Klan, like the white satin hood that now stares from behind glass beside photographs COLLECTION OF THE SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE, GIFT OF THE BLACK FASHION MUSEUM FOUNDED BY LOIS K. ALEXANDER-LANEgwmagazine.com / 43of lynchings. \"It just felt wrong,\" Dr. Gates Moresi says. Just by showing an interest, the museum would seem to be contributing to the market. Most objects in the collection were donated. Some artifacts were very hard to find. One of them was a Green Book, which was published annually during the Jim Crow era to tell black motorists where they could eat, sleep and get their cars fixed. The last edition came out in the 1960s. Dr. Gates Moresi had wanted one for years when a man called claiming to have one. But it didn't pan out. \"He was just toying with me,\" she says. She reached out to dealers and collectors, who said they hadn't seen a Green Book in years. Finally a colleague noticed one in an auction catalog, and the museum struck the winning bid. \"I was so mad,\" she says with a laugh, \"because I knew somebody put that on there when they knew we were looking for it.\" Clothing from the slave era is also extremely difficult to find. Fabric from those days eventually would wind up as rags. But a woman called to say she had something she thought was slave clothing: a skirt and a top. Her grandmother had always told the children to stay away from one trunk, and as she was dying, she explained that the trunk contained the clothes of her ancestors, who had been slaves. That was enough to make it worth shipping the clothes to the Smithsonian. Tests concluded that the top was probably from the early 20th century, but the skirt was from before 1865. \"Once we knew that, we were like, 'OK, we need to have it,'\" Dr. Gates Moresi says. The woman didn 't know much about her ancestors; they were probably on a Georgia plantation, she said. But the museum has a genealogist on staff, and Dr. Gates Moresi hopes eventually they'll learn more about the person behind the clothes. \"So much of what we know and understand about the slave era is numbers, facts and figures. These were people. Their stories are very real,\" she says. \"To evoke that, to give them presence\u2014you can only do that with clothing, with personal belongings.\" This is what sets the Smithsonian apart from other kinds of storytelling, Dr. Gates Moresi says. \"It's the real thing, the authentic thing\u2014the original things that are associated with all those historical events and cultural moments that were so important to us, and that we celebrate.\" WILLIAM ATKINSopposite page The dress that Rosa Parks was sewing shortly before she was arrested in Alabama on Dec. 1, 1955, for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white passenger above A collection of buttons from Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign right A 1973 Cadillac Eldorado belonging to rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berryopposite Presidential Administrative Fellow Max Tingle, BBA '15, who is working in GW's Marketing and Creative Services unit while pursuing a Master of Public Administration, graciously added modeling to his portfolio, posing with a handmade bow tie and an armload of alumni-made goods. gwmagazine.com / 45It's a time-honored tradition: the search for the perfect gift, which quickly buckles under the weight of indecision and procrastination and a little browsing for yourself\u2014hey, you're human\u2014until suddenly, the holidays nigh, you reach for a gift, any gift, and make all sorts of resolutions about next year's effort.

The idea led Ms. Votruba-Matook to launch her own company, The Artful Educator, which now sells the prints, notecards, alphabet flashcards and custom placemats and name art. \"The goal is to help parents and kids build that habit of having quality conversations,\" she says. Each letter is made up of items that begin with that letter, all drawn in a color that starts with the letter, too. The letter \"A,\" for example, comes in aqua and other \"a\" colors, and is made up of things like alpacas, airplanes and avocados. SPICE IT UP WATCHAREE.COM | $9.50 The best way to transport home cooks to Thailand is to offer them a taste of the real thing, which is why Watcharee Limanon, LLM '99, imports the spices and other traditional ingredients that go into her ready-to-eat sauces. \"I have had customers call and say, 'I just wanted to tell you I lived in Thailand for years and your sauces taste like the dishes that I ate while there,'\" Ms. Limanon says. The Bangkok-native rediscovered her love of Thai cooking while working in Thailand as an environmental lawyer. She began her culinary training in 2005, studying at Le Cordon Bleu Dusit Culinary School in Bangkok and other cooking schools. In 2014, back in the U.S., she launched the Watcharee's product line, which includes her peanut sauce, pad Thai sauce, and green and massaman curry sauces.

Ms. Hellmuth, BFA '97, sells the patterns, which are printed and then cut, folded and taped into shape using her simple instructions. Her most popular box is in the shape of a retro oven, which a customer filled with cupcakes and used for a sugar-coated baby-gender reveal. \"One customer ... used them to help her family raise funds to bring their adoptive daughter-to-be home from Ghana,\" Ms. Hellmuth says. \"I was so touched to think that my little printables could have some small role to play in this family's life.\" PUT A BOW ON IT ETSY .COM/SHOP/HOPSALOTSNACKS | $18-$25 They met, classically enough, at a wedding: Emily Landsman's brother was getting hitched last year when she came face to face with a bow tie, which she was helping a groomsman knot. Ms. Landsman, BA '01, MPA '11, a seasoned sewing enthusiast, looked over the piece and decided to try to fashion them herself. The first few were a hit on her Etsy site and, ever since, making bow ties\u2014even designing and printing some of the fabric\u2014has become \"part of my life,\" she says. They come in quirky prints, like bunnies, apples and bikes\u2014even a matzoh bow tie for the dapper Seder-goer. She also does custom jobs, including once swooping in at the last minute with freshly made ties to rescue a panicked bride and groom.48 / gw magazine / Fall 2016Using timber harvested from an Illinois forest that's been in the family for generations, David Stine's custom, hand-crafted furniture celebrates wood's rambling curves, its grains, its knots and fissures. It clings to the \"natural beauty,\" he says, from which it was hewn. \"It might be along the lines of something you've seen before,\" Mr. Stine, JD '99, says of his furniture, \"but because every piece of wood is different it's not going to be Ikea.\" He found woodworking on the family farm growing up, where he learned craftsmanship from watching his father and grandfather and eventually would spend the winter months restoring antiques. While at GW Law School, he built humidors for Georgetown Tobacco on the side, and the business grew from there. Mr. Stine hung up his pinstripes after a year and took up at an old farmhouse in Dow, Ill., where the business now includes everything from handmade benches and tables to bed frames and bar tops.

And gin is the place to start. \"Whiskey has to sit for a really long time in barrels, so nobody is going to want to age whiskey for six months to six years. You can't make vodka in your house because it's like a meth lab; the same thing for rum,\" says Sarah Maiellano, BA '07, who launched The Homemade Gin Kit in 2012 with her husband. \"Gin is the one thing you can make at home, and it turns out really nicely.\" Each kit includes two 375-milliliter glass bottles, a strainer and funnel, and the blend of juniper berries and other botanicals (which lend it a caramel hue) you'll need to transform a bottle of vodka into gin. Steep them for 36 hours, impress, repeat. And what if you could give the warm and fuzzies twice with one gift?

But 10 years before it was dropped, GW football rose to its zenith, the greatest season in program history and a singular moment on the national stage. Here, an appreciation of the beginning of the end. // By Matthew StossONE AFTERNOON IN JANUARYgwmagazine.com / 53 WILLIAM ATKINS54 / gw magazine / Fall 2016majority of its home games at the Redskins' and Senators' 56,000-seat D.C. Stadium (rechristened RFK in 1969) after moving from the by-then-demolished Griffith Stadium, a venue half as big. GW rented D.C. Stadium for $10,000 a year and struggled to fill the extra space. The last football game in GW history\u2014a 16-7 loss to Villanova at D.C. Stadium on Thanksgiving Day 1966\u2014drew just 6,800. And yet, even in '66, there had been hope on G Street. Passed down through rosters and coaching staffs was a history of past, albeit infrequent, glory: the team's 30-6 win over Virginia Military Institute at the official dedication of D.C. Stadium; the near-decade of winning seasons in the '30s, during which Alphonse \"Tuffy\" Leemans (later an NFL Hall of Famer) led the 1936 college all-star team to a draw against the reigning NFL champion Detroit Lions; there was the tidy evisceration\u201477-0\u2014of the University of Maryland in 1908, when GW went 8-1-1 overall. And there was 1956, the year that coach Eugene \"Bo\" Sherman did what must have seemed all but impossible while staring at empty bleachers or watching a muffed punt roll into a puddle. Ten years before the program died for the last time, the George Washington University football team had its greatest season. That's when Mr. Sherman led an outmanned and underfunded, beat-up and broke-down group of 31 men from a program barely good enough to be forgotten to what the newspapermen would call \"one of the biggest upsets in Sun Bowl history.\" NOT LONG AFTER Thanksgiving 1956, Robert Kolliner invited the generally believed overrated GW football team to play in the 22nd Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas. There, the Colonials\u2014who went 7-1-1 overall and 5-1 in the Southern Conference in regular-season play\u2014would face Texas Western, a 39-man squad built on speed and featuring a halfback who would, in a few years, become one of Joe Namath's favorite receivers and an NFL Hall of Famer. It was not a popular choice by Mr. Kolliner, an El Paso alderman and the chairman of the Sun Bowl selection committee. Texas Western, which became the University of Texas at El Paso in 1967, was having one of its best seasons ever. The Miners went 5-0 in the Border Conference that year and finished the regular season 9-1 overall. They ran over their only common opponent with GW, Hardin-Simmons, a team y the 1960s, coaching football at the George Washington University required periodic, if not regular, positive affirmation. The staff recruited to a program that had no permanent home stadium, a small scholarship allotment and little pedigree. The practice field\u2014a grassy spread of soft land that was a 15-minute bus ride across the Arlington Memorial Bridge\u2014not only abutted George Washington Parkway, but it also sloped into a canal. That meant that some poor student manager had to go fish for footballs if a return man couldn't field a punt. The setup doesn't even seem romantic in retrospect. \"We were told that an old coach made a statement,\" says Bobby Collins, a former assistant from 1961-63, who went on to become the head coach at Southern Miss and then Southern Methodist. \"He says, 'Each year, the coach that won the national championship should have to coach at GW the next year to prove himself.'\" Founded in 1890, GW football was never far from a problem. Five times the university killed and resurrected the program between 1891 and 1945. Organizational issues and a lack of administrative/fan interest contributed to three of those discontinuations. World war handled the others. The 1940 media guide even acknowledged the miracle of the program's continued existence. In a section titled \"The History of Football,\" it reads: \"Under the conditions of highly inadequate facilities, a substantial percentage of self-supporting students, and various difficulties of organization, the wonder is that the sport survived at all in those early years.\" Football stabilized after World War II and continued uninterrupted until administration and the Board of Trustees, encouraged by the Faculty Senate, cut the program for good at 4:46 p.m. on Jan. 19, 1967, although news of football's imminent demise broke in late December. It was two days after head coach Jim Camp quit, citing the program's uncertain future. Two years earlier, a Faculty Senate review of athletics found that football alone was responsible for more than half of a $250,000 deficit, and expense became the primary reason for dropping the program. Funding an on-campus basketball arena that would, eight years later, become the Charles E. Smith Center, and a lack of fan and student support also were factors. The team's venues weren't doing it any favors, either.

This summer, they marked the 50th anniversary of their last team and celebrated how they've endured on their own. Brothers by every definition but biology, these guys have met semi-regularly since 1983 and annually since 2002. In June, they convened at a resort outside Gettysburg, Pa., and again picked up right where they left off. It's like nothing's changed since Welling Hall, the notorious jock dorm that stood where Science and Engineering Hall is now. \"That place was a zoo,\" says Mark Gross, BA '67, a kicker. Well, some things have changed. They're not dropping phone booths down stairwells anymore. Or holding the dorm chef's cat hostage. \"It's about getting together with the guys,\" Dick Duenkel, BA '67, an offensive/defensive end who played at GW from 1961 to 1963, says of the reunions. \"We lived with each other from one to five years and we became friends and we know a lot about each other. It's just renewing the friendship. That's important to me.\" GW last fielded a football team in 1966, which means the ex-players don't have the built-in reunion mechanism of a homecoming game. So the players\u2014 organized by Mr. Duenkel and Rich Hornfeck, BA '63, MA '67, with an assist from former GW Athletics Alumni Program Director Ed McKee\u2014do this instead.They remember games and practices and their time on campus: the antics and nickel- beer night at a corner bar; how the dorm food seemed worse when it wasn't football season; the library at Welling Hall (\"I remember they had a library,\" says Ed Hino, BBA '61, a quarterback. \"I don't remember it being used too often.\"). They remember the perks of playing in D.C. \"When we would go play at RFK,\" says Gary Brain, BBA '68, a split end on the '66 team, \"they'd send the bus for us down at GW and they'd give us a police escort through D.C., sirens blaring. We'd run through stoplights. I don't know why; they just did that for us. You really felt kind of special. You're going through D.C. with a police escort.\" The practice field was close to the Pentagon and sometimes, one player remembers, John F. Kennedy would hop out of his helicopter and shake hands with a few of the guys. On the day of Kennedy's assassination, the football team was flying to Nashville, Tenn., for a game at Vanderbilt. The pilot announced twice that the president had been shot. The first time, the players thought it was a bad joke. Five minutes later, they found it wasn't. \"The pilot came on, and you could tell he was crying this time, and he said, 'I need to tell you guys: 'The president was shot in Dallas and he has died,'\" says Fred Yakin, BS '68, a defensive end. \"We were up all night long watching TV. There were a whole lot of guys who were emotionally upset, and we asked to have the game postponed.\" They played the game. GW lost, 31-0. There also are memories of the program's last day. Larry Cignetti, BS '67, a split end, was driving his brother-in-law's car from the Pittsburgh area to Norfolk, Va. It was December 1966; he heard the news on the radio. \"That was a shock to me. I don't think any of us had any inkling that this was in the works.\" Reunion attendance has fluctuated, with more than 100 showing up for reunions in the late '80s and early '90s. In 2015, 45 former players showed up. This June, 27 made the trip. Four of them played on that last team. \"For a lot of years, we didn't see each other,\" Mr. Duenkel says. \"From the mid '60s to the first one in '83, and it was kind of by chance after that until 2002. We've gotten so much closer as people have passed away. It's hitting home that we're losing friends, and every time we get together, we kind of say, 'Hey, there's gonna be a few people not here next time,' and that's what happened.\" \u2014M.S. 58 / gw magazine / Fall 2016coached by former Redskins quarterback/ great Sammy Baugh. Texas Western blew out Hardin-Simmons, 51-13. The Colonials won just 13-7. No one seemed to care that GW had played that game with about a lineup's worth of key players injured\u2014including junior quarterback Ray Looney, BA, '59 (he couldn't even raise his arm)\u2014and still managed to pull off the upset over Slingin' Sammy and the Cowboys. Then there was the fact that Texas Western was the hometown team and played in the same stadium, Kidd Field, that hosted the Sun Bowl. Fans wanted a worthy opponent. \"I'm going to be damned if they do and practically driven out of town if they don't,\" Mr. Kolliner told The Washington Post on Dec. 31, 1956, referring to GW winning the Sun Bowl. Mr. Looney says that even Mr. Baugh, charter member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, weighed in. \"When we were in meetings the night before the game, Bo Sherman read me an article [that had comments] Sammy Baugh made that said we didn't deserve to be on the same field as Texas Western,\" says Mr. Looney, now a 79-year-old retired FBI agent and former private investigator who lives and golfs in Fort Myers, Fla. \"They were going to blow us away. But what an incentive that was. \"I told the coach, I said, 'Hey, coach, I got news for you.' I said\u2014exact words, and I used 'ain't'\u2014'Ain't gonna happen that way.' I says, 'We're gonna be in it and there's a good possibility we're gonna win tomorrow.' He said, 'Are you guaranteeing us a win?' And I said, 'You're damn right I am.'\" By game time\u20142:30 p.m. on a gray, 55-degree New Year's Day 1957\u2014Texas Western was a two-touchdown favorite over GW, a hard-nosed team built of working- class sons and shaped by the chain-smoking Sherman. Considered one of the \"keenest\" defensive minds of the day, he reportedly fielded overtures for the vacant head coaching job at Indiana in the interstice between Thanksgiving and the Sun Bowl. The Associated Press that year had ranked the Colonials as high as 14th, until they became West Virginia's 19th straight Southern Conference win in a game that left GW battered\u2014one guy, tackle Bob Jewett, BS '58, MA '64, broke his jaw\u2014and stymied its march toward an undefeated season. That was Nov. 4. Mr. Looney went 0-for-6 passing, got picked off once and rushed for minus-21 yards. The Colonials managed just three first downs. The game cost them the league championship. The possibility of a completely unblemished 1956 ended three weeks earlier with a 20-20 tie at Boston University in Game 4. GW snapped a punt into the end zone early in the fourth quarter, which set up the Terriers for a seven-play, 29-yard drive to tie the game. \"GW's brief tenure as a bigtime football power probably came to an end shortly after a bad pass from center sailed into the GW end zone early in the fourth quarter,\" The Washington Post said in its game story. A tie with lowly Boston, which finished the season 1-5-2, only lent fuel to the criticism that Mr. Kolliner had picked a dud for the Sun Bowl. But GW again had struggled with injuries in that game. Standout halfback Mike Sommer, BA '59, MA '64, MD '70, RES '75\u2014who led the nation in punt returns in 1955 and would go on to win an NFL championship with the Baltimore Colts\u2014had missed the two previous games with a pulled muscle. It was part of a seasonlong slump for the D.C. native and former Wilson High star that included getting knocked unconscious against Furman in the second game of the year and benched against Richmond in Game 8. The Colonials, though, rallied after Boston and after that critical loss to West Virginia. They won their final two regular- season games over Richmond and the Citadel by a combined score of 52-6, relying as they had all year on a burly, battling line, a brutal defense and Mr. Looney, a tough-guy left-handed quarterback from Glassport, Pa., who was a better leader than a passer. He even suited up and played days after his older brother and best friend, James, was killed in a car wreck. He felt like his team and his late coach, whom he still considers a father figure, needed him. \"We didn't have that big of a squad that they could have just put someone else in there,\" Mr. Looney says. \"[Sherman] trusted me more than anyone else he would put in there.\"James Looney, a former quarterback at Vanderbilt, was driving from basic training at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas to pick up his wife in Nashville. They were married just a few months earlier. \"They were passing a truck going up a hill,\" Mr. Looney says, \"and he got a blowout and there was a truck coming down the hill and his car swerved to the right and hit my brother, hit the passenger side of the car and killed him. Instantly.\" Ray Looney played the rest of the season heartbroken. THE GEORGE WASHINGTON football team arrived in El Paso on Dec. 28, 1956, in an American Airlines DC-7 after more than a month of buildup. The Colonials in the Sun Bowl\u2014in any bowl\u2014was a monster to-do. GW was a small team from a formerly formidable league that was, of late, light on cachet. The Atlantic Coast Conference poached seven Southern Conference schools in 1953 to create itself, and at this point, SoCon teams weren't postseason regulars. Prior to the 1957 Sun Bowl, no Southern team had made the postseason since Georgia Tech hammered SoCon school West Virginia, 42-19, in the 1954 Sugar Bowl. A Southern Conference team wouldn't make another bowl appearance until the Citadel went to the 1960 Tangerine Bowl. The gap between college football's haves and have-nots grew fast in this era, thanks in part to television, and by the early 1950s, college football's seat of power had migrated south and west from the eastern schools. The once-mighty programs of the 1910s, '20s and '30s fell back, particularly those in the Ivy League, where Harvard, UPenn and Princeton had in the past competed for national championships. City schools in the population-dense east didn't have the spare real estate for big stadiums and big enrollments, and many of them, like Georgetown and other similar, often private, schools, folded their football programs due to rising costs. Scholarships hastened these decisions. Football grants were offered, unchecked, until 1971 when the NCAA first set scholarship limits. Today, Division I, Football \"COACH MIKE BRUMBELOW'S TACKLES HAD A MISERABLE DAY OF IT, TRYING TO KEEP OFF THEIR BACKS AS THE BEEFY COLONIALS MOVED THEM AT WILL. IN ADDITION, GW WAS FLATTENING THE LINEBACKERS.\" The Washington Post, Jan. 2, 1957 See more artifacts from GW's football years at magazine.gwu.edugwmagazine.com / 59Bowl Subdivision programs\u2014college football's top tier\u2014can offer a maximum of 85. Back then, schools were limited by only interest and cash. \"Texas and SMU could have fielded 200 scholarship players,\" says John Watterson, a former history professor at James Madison and Virginia Commonwealth universities who authored 2000's College Football: History, Spectacle, Controversy. \"That's a total that would have smothered opponents in other conferences.\" GW football\u2014which offered, roughly, 30 scholarships\u2014survived the '50s purge on the back of consistent winning seasons. Between 1950 and 1956, only twice did the Colonials have losing records, a run punctuated by the Sun Bowl appearance and the program's most wins since 1908. Even before GW played the game, the Sun Bowl became the football program's halcyon moment. It was something Bo Sherman, the fifth- year coach who would resign unexpectedly for \"personal reasons\" after the 1959 season, recognized and he told newspapers at the time that he refused to make the bowl game a \"chore.\" The Colonials didn't practice between Thanksgiving and Dec. 10, and even then, practices involved little hitting and centered on running and \"play timing.\" \"The kids have earned this trip,\" Mr. Sherman told The Washington Post on Dec. 3, 1956. \"And I intend to see that they enjoy it. We'll practice only once a day, even after we get to El Paso. The whole game hinges on condition and attitude. The boys will be in top condition and I'm sure their attitude will be good. We'll take a sightseeing tour of El Paso and the kids will go over to Mexico for a bull fight.\" Yes, a bullfight.On Dec. 30, the team bused from the fancy Del Camino Hotel for the Juarez Bull Ring in Juarez, Mexico. Texas Western halfback Don Maynard says the Miners didn't know much about George Washington\u2014\"Some of us probably had to look it up on the map,\" he says\u2014but that they believed they could play with anybody. Coached by a defensive-minded disciplinarian named Mike Brumbelow, Texas Western won by shutout four times in 1956 and never gave up more than 13 points in a single game. The defense was known for its occasional use of a nine-man front, which left Mr. Maynard, who would have a Hall of Fame career as a New York Jets wide receiver, and future Green Bay Packer defensive back Jesse Whittenton to patrol the entire secondary with their tremendous speed. Mr. Maynard also starred on offense with fellow halfback Jim Bevers. Both of them ran the 100-yard dash in 9.7 seconds. \"There wasn't anybody in the league that could catch us,\" Mr. Maynard says. IF EVER A MOVIE STUDIO decided to make a Rudy Remembers the Hoosiers -style film about the 1957 Sun Bowl, some producer, director, executive\u2014anyone with even the most facile grasp of dramatic storytelling and human emotion\u2014would have the whole thing rewritten to include a romantic subplot and a Hail Mary to a bench player dying of inoperable face cancer. Dominance makes for such poor dramatic tension. On New Year's Day 1957, the George Washington University football team manhandled Texas Western, 13-0, in front of a capacity crowd at 15,000-seat Kidd Field, bookending the game with touchdowns in the first and fourth quarters and allowing a flimsy Miners offense to do little more than trudge in and out of field goal range. The outcome was barely in question. It was a thorough, legend-making drubbing by those 31 men of G Street, who, like Pecos Bill, wrangled twisters and ate dynamite in the American Southwest, if only for one gray afternoon. \"Everybody on that team wanted to win so bad because it was important\u2014the only bowl that GW ever went to,\" says Ray Looney, GW's quarterback who would go on to play six seasons of minor league baseball, mostly in the Pirates organization, before a thrice-dislocated shoulder sabotaged what had been a promising career. \"They were all geared for it. The practices we had over in Virginia before the game were real positive, real gung-ho, always on a high note we'd leave every practice. We couldn't wait to get down and teach them a lesson. \"We were real underdogs. The newspaper articles when we got down there ... were all against us. We didn't have a chance to win, 14- or 17-point underdogs. The club, we couldn't have gone into that game at a higher peak than we were.\" The Colonials, with Bob Jewett by some act of God returning from a broken jaw, held Texas Western\u2014\"the fastest team in the state of Texas\"\u2014to just 168 yards of total offense (most of which came in garbage time) and forced five turnovers. They pummeled the Miners on both lines as Claude \"Bo\" Austin ran up, down, over and right on through the Texas Western defense and that nine-man front. The 6-foot, 190-pound senior fullback rushed, depending on the source, for either 108 yards on 20 carries or 98 yards on 18 carries. Either way, Austin was named the Sun Bowl's Most Valuable Player and the 17th-ranked Colonials collected 318 yards of total offense\u2014257 rushing\u2014while becoming the first team to pitch a Sun Bowl shutout since 1945. \"Coach Mike Brumbelow's tackles had a miserable day of it, trying to keep off their backs as the beefy Colonials moved them at will,\" The Washington Post wrote on Jan. 2, 1957. \"In addition, GW was flattening the linebackers.\" It was the first time Texas Western, which had just 23 yards of offense (seven rushing, 16 passing) in the first half, had been held scoreless since 1952, a span of 44 games. Don Maynard had six carries for 24 yards. \"We only had two guys on the offense or defense that weighed over 200 pounds,\" Mr. Maynard says. \"It seemed like George Washington had a whole roster that was a lot heavier and so forth. We were a fast team, had a great defense and a good passing game but we were just kind of outmanned in the trenches.\" Mr. Looney, with his mother and his brother's widow in the stands, completed four of nine passes for 61 yards and a touchdown\u2014a 30-yard pass to Paul Thompson, who also starred at defensive end in the game, to put GW up 6-0 in the first quarter. The Colonials also scored on a 3-yard run by Pete Spera early in the fourth quarter to go up 13-0 and seal the win. After the game, Brumbelow said GW \"outplayed, outhustled and outran\" his squad. \"I do remember this, that they were overconfident,\" says Mike Sommer, GW's left halfback who played in the NFL and later became an emergency room doctor. \"They were pretty cocky and that's all I really remember.\" Dr. Sommer, a speedy 5-10, 190-pounder who also starred in track, rushed for 43 yards on 13 carries, according to GW's stats. Mr. Looney played all but five plays\u2014 significant in the era of two-platoon football\u2014and performed well on defense. The Post described the 6-foot, 185-pounder as a \"terror in the defensive backfield.\" Mr. Looney also was instrumental in game planning, meeting individually with coach Bo Sherman. Fifty-nine years and eight months later, talking on the phone from Fort Myers, Fla., after finishing his morning golf round with an 84, Mr. Looney's assessment of the 1957 Sun Bowl was simple. \"We should have beat them bigger than we did.\" Alumni newsalumni pro Files ... class notes ... artists' quarter ALUMNI NEWS LOGAN WERLINGERp. 74 // Hoops History Mark Plotkin, BA '69, reflects on six decades of basketball fandomp. 72 // A SCOTUS Specialist A GW Law alum has argued before the U.S. Supreme Court 41 timesp. 64 // Talking It Over Bernie Swain, BS '69, MA '72, interviews a who's who of politics, culturep. 63 // Shoe Inventors Two alumni patent a design for self-tying triathlete footwear 60 / gw magazine / Fall 2016Alumni newsalumni news class notesiSTOCK.COM/ERIC ISSEL\u00c9E// 60s & EARLIER J.

Gen. Nadja West is the highest-ranking black woman in U.S. Army history. Because of rules against women in combat and a proscription against women outranking men that lasted into the 1970s, the first African American women to attain officer ranks in the Army came from the medical arena, although women have served as nurses since the Revolutionary War. Here is a timeline of black female officers in the Army. 1901 The Army Nurse Corps is created. 1918 The first black nurses are allowed to serve in World War I. 1942 Della Raney, a nurse, is the Army's first black female officer. 1948 President Truman signs an executive order to desegregate the military. 1956 Clotilde Bowen is the Army's first black female doctor to become an officer. 1976 Women are admitted to U.S. military academies. 1979 Hazel Johnson-Brown is the Army's first black female brigadier (one- star) general. 2011 Marcia Anderson is the Army's first black female major (two-star) general. 2015 Nadja West is the Army's first black female lieutenant (three-star) general.Dr. West says the battalion commander, Ricardo Sanchez, who would later become a three-star general, same as Dr. West, didn't care. \"He asked me a question,\" Dr. West says. \"He said, 'Can you fix broke soldiers?' And I said, 'Yes, sir, I can.' And he said, 'We're glad to have you as part of the team.' \"There was no question about, 'Where'd you go to school? What were your grades?' It was, 'Can you help my soldiers if they get injured?' And just knowing that that's what they're relying on me to do really did change me. That's one of the reasons I stayed in [the Army] as long as I have.\" Dr. West, a humble Star Trek \"nerd,\" 55 years old and the adopted daughter of a civil rights activist and a career soldier, graduated from West Point in 1982 as a member of just the third class after the military academies started admitting women in 1976. She has gone on to become the highest-ranking woman to graduate from West Point. She's also been to Airborne School and volunteered to practice medicine in combat. Although combat experience is not a prerequisite to be the Army's surgeon general\u2014as such, she is the commanding general of Army Medical Command and advises the chief of staff for the Army and the secretary of the Army on medical issues\u2014it's not unuseful. For Dr. West, her time as a combat doctor informs her role overseeing the Army's 150,000 medical service members and civilians as well as its hospitals and clinics. She says her priorities as Army surgeon general are to maintain medical readiness in the event of a large-scale military operation, improve the capabilities of medical personnel and to provide care to soldiers and their families. The post requires a presidential appointment and a Senate confirmation. In less than a year as Army surgeon general, Dr. West has helped create eight-person medical teams that are capable of going anywhere, each member carrying a component of a mobile operating room in their backpacks. Previously, she says, the smallest medical team was 20 people. Dr. West also has introduced a \"profiling\" program that consolidates the Army medical records into a disabled list-esque database to make it easier for commanding officers to know who's available\u2014who's had a dental exam, a physical, who's got a knee problem, who's fit for deployment. Dr. West, still seated in the office suite conference room, is describing what it's like to save wounded soldiers\u2014\"If he could survive, by God, I was gonna make sure he did,\" she says\u2014and how it feels. \"Just taking care of soldiers and just the bond that you have with them\u2014they'll do anything for you. I mean, you're their doc,\" Dr. West says. \"It doesn't matter if they knew you before or not. You're with their team, you're their doc, and they go out and do things and put themselves at risk because they know that their doc's got their back.\" \"He said, 'Can you fix broke soldiers?'

Cooper, MD '77, coauthored The Theory of Devilution: The History of the Universe According to Man, and The History of the Universe According to God [inventions] A Shoe in Transition Two alums invent a shoe that you don't need to bend over to put on. Or tie. // By Matthew Stoss Rarely, we're assuming, has it been so serendipitous to have a patent attorney as a best friend. When author, lecturer and seven-time world champion triathlete Don Ardell, BA '63, had an idea for a new running shoe, all he had to do was call Ray Lupo, BS '63, JD '68\u2014in addition to inventing the shoe, of course. \"Random good fortune,\" the sunny 78-year-old Dr. Ardell says. At the 2013 World Triathlon Championships in London, it took Dr. Ardell nearly a minute to finish the transition from bicycle shoes to running shoes\u2014between Legs 2 and 3 of the swim, bike, run competition\u2014because of cold, muddy conditions. The switch should take a pro 15 to 20 seconds. \"I thought, 'There's got to be a better way,'\" says Dr. Ardell, who played basketball at GW and got a PhD in health and public policy at Union Institute and University in Cincinnati. \"Why can't the [running] shoe\u2014the back of the heel\u2014be down when you come into the transition?\" Dr. Ardell scribbled a design and called Mr. Lupo, who added his own touch, and three years later, they have two patents\u2014one for the shoe and another for the mechanism that Velcros it shut\u2014and what's believed to be the world's first hands-free \"fast-transition running shoe.\" It's designed to shave about 15 seconds from the bike-to-run phase of triathlons by eliminating the need to bend over to change shoes. \"You just step in these things and you run,\" says Mr. Lupo, 75, a former adjunct law professor at GW and the retired head of McDermott, Will & Emery's intellectual property department in Washington, D.C. Mr. Lupo navigated the shoe's patent process, which spanned a year and a half and two rejections (one for each patent) by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. He also conceived the mechanism that allows the shoe to close without manually shutting it. It works like a mousetrap, with the foot triggering shut a Velcro flap that wraps around the heel to the inside of the shoe. \"Based on the value of the system, how it could be used and the number of people who could use it, I can't imagine why it wouldn't work,\" says Dr. Ardell. \"But the key is that we have a prototype that does what we want it to do.\" Dr. Ardell and Mr. Lupo intend to sell or license their patents to a major company, like Adidas or Nike. That won't be easy. Most patents, Mr. Lupo says, never make it to the marketplace. They also must find an agent to act as an intermediary between them and a company. Established manufacturers, for legal reasons, don't take unsolicited pitches. It's an effort to avoid intellectual property-theft lawsuits. Currently, there are 3-D models of the shoe, and Dr. Ardell and Mr. Lupo are hiring an engineer to build the first official prototype, which, they estimate, will cost $5,000 to $10,000. The two men are primarily aiming their shoe at the triathlon crowd, but they also envision a wider reach: young children, people who struggle to bend over, people too lazy to bend over, hip kids. \"They're going to be so cool,\" Dr. Ardell says. It works like a mousetrap, with the foot triggering shut a flap that wraps around the heel to the inside of the shoe. A strap secures the shoe to the foot. This is an illustration of the shoe concept. gwmagazine.com / 63Alumni news MARGOT SCHULMAN[Motivations] A Series of Happy Accidents In 1980, Bernie Swain, BS '69, MA '72, was the assistant athletics director at GW and, with his boss retiring, had designs on the top job. But then on a lark\u2014less, really: a misread comment\u2014he left to launch the Washington Speakers Bureau with his wife, Paula, and friend Harry Rhoads Jr. The agency foundered at first but pulled out of its nosedive to become a giant of the lecture circuit, representing three of the past four U.S. presidents, five secretaries of state and six British prime ministers among a who's who of thinkers and doers. Mr. Swain, now retired, interviewed dozens of those iconic figures\u2014from Madeleine Albright to Terry Bradshaw, Condoleezza Rice and Bob Woodward\u2014about the turning points in their lives for his new book, What Made Me Who I Am (Post Hill Press and Savio Republic, 2016). GW Magazine talked with Mr. Swain about the book, his own turning point and the handshake deal that accidentally became the agency's calling card. \u2014Danny Freedman, BA '01 On the founding of the Washington Speakers Bureau (and taking things too literally):\"[Harry Rhoads] sent me this article in Fortune magazine about a speakers bureau, the largest agency in the world, it was called the Harry Walker Agency; still in business. ... In the article, Harry Walker says that [Henry] Kissinger is complaining about the 33 percent commission rate that he wanted to charge and says, 'Why don't I move to one of your competitors?' And [Walker] said, 'I have no competitors.' \"Well, back then there's no Internet, there was no way for us to tell.\" On making the leap: \"I wanted to build something on my own. ... I think my wife felt that [at a university I was] always going to be second guessed, people are always going to say 'Let's do this by committee,' and she said, 'You're just never going to be happy doing that.' And I think that's what she recognized in me.\" On getting started:\"We had absolutely no idea what we were doing. And we had no plan. We didn't represent anybody. We didn't know how to represent anybody. ... We didn't feel comfortable working out of our house, because I said that's just not a good business environment. We had a friend who went to GW, his name was Bill Collins ... and his business partner was Chuck Hagel [later a U.S. senator and secretary of defense], and they had a stationery closet, so he let us use the closet and we paid him rent. ... If there was a meeting going on and we wanted to go to lunch, you had to sit there till the meeting was over so we didn't interrupt [Chuck], and then we could leave.\" On the call that changed everything:\"We sat there running out of money. Twelve months to 14 months afterwards, we're just about to close up. I got a call from a guy named Steve Bell, who was on Good Morning America . Years earlier, when I was at GW, I let Steve and ABC use the swimming pool at the Smith Center for a story, so Steve remembered me and somehow knew I had left and started a lecture agency. He had been under contract with the Harry Walker Agency and they hadn't produced well enough for him. And he said, 'I would love to go with you.' We were so excited we shook his hand and didn't sign him to a contract. \"Afterward I said, 'Gee, we didn't sign anything.' We felt embarrassed to go back and say, 'Well, now that we've agreed and shook hands, will you sign a contract?' so we didn't. He went to cocktail parties with other journalists and others he knew in Washington and told them, 'I just went with this agency and they'll let you shake hands with them, and if they don't do a good job you can walk out just like I'll walk out.' So we got calls from four or five different journalists all wanting to be represented on a handshake. They knew they could walk away, but on the other hand we knew we had to work hard for them. \"We grew slowly for seven years, and that's when we got invited in the fall of 1988 to interview for [President Ronald] Reagan.\" On the impetus for the book: \"What I discovered was that most of the people I represented actually came from very humble and modest beginnings, just like I did, and they were no different than my friends or neighbors in how they began and how they became successful. ...

She says while she had attended alumni events for her degree program (master of science in project management), \"it was just last year that I learned about GWAA. I started out volunteering on the Career Services Committee and recorded two webinars for alumni.

In the past, I had always volunteered for area nonprofits and had previously served on a board of directors. I had to put my volunteering on hold when I had three children, but once they all passed the toddler stage, I decided it was time to return to committing time to other organizations. Just as I had made the decision to do that, I learned about GWAA. I really liked the idea of giving my time to an organization that had provided me with such a positive educational experience. And one of the best parts of being involved with the board is that I 'm exposed to the much larger GW community. I now know alumni that span across generations and that studied very different subjects than I did both as undergraduates and as graduates. What are you looking to accomplish during your term on the board? First off, I want to continue to learn more about the board and the role that it plays as a bridge between the alumni and the school. I have attended one meeting so far and was really impressed with the breadth of what is accomplished each year. I am serving on the Nominations and Governance Committee and am particularly excited about spreading the word about the board to other alumni like myself who may not realize it exists and the opportunities that exist for them to serve, too. What do you think our alumni should know about their alumni association? I think it's important that our alumni know that the board exists and that it provides them with opportunities for giving back to GW while expanding their alumni network.

He argued in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin that a \"holistic admissions plan\" was necessary to have a \"meaningful impact on diversity at the university.\" By a 4-3 vote, the court held that the policy is legal. Sixteen years after his first appearance at the high court\u2014an inauspicious 9-0 loss in a case involving an arbitration agreement\u2014Mr. Garre still basks in the sublimity of the oral argument. \"It absolutely is an awe-inducing experience every time you stand up before the Supreme Court,\" he says, reflecting on that first case. \"I learned that I loved arguing before the court as much as I thought I would. I was eager to get back to it.\" But, he adds with a laugh, \"my wife will tell you that she's tired of seeing the justices beat up on me.\" He counts as one of his most significant outcomes the 2012 decision in Maples v. Thomas , in which Mr. Garre helped Alabama death-row inmate Cory Maples receive a new hearing after his lawyer abruptly abandoned the case. The court ruled 7-2 to spare Mr. Maples from execution, maintaining his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

He'd end up clerking for Chief Justice William Rehnquist (for whom Mr. Garre would serve as a pallbearer at his funeral in 2005) and for Judge Anthony J. Scirica of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third District. Mr. Garre also spent nearly seven years working for John Roberts, when the current chief justice was in private practice in Washington. Each of the men helped instill in Mr. Garre the key to his legal success: preparation. \"If you haven't put in the 100-plus hours necessary to get ready for the oral argument, then you're not going to be in a position to successfully advocate for your client in that challenging environment,\" he says. \"You also have to stay in the moment and be focused on answering the questions as they come in, because they're coming from all different directions.\" Mr. Garre, who as solicitor general represented the government at the Supreme Court from 2008 to 2009 (capping nearly a decade in that office), acknowledges that most lawyers feel \"a certain sense of dread\" before the buzzer sounds summoning them to the courtroom. In those final moments, the court clerk offers antacids and sewing kits to tend to last-minute wardrobe malfunctions. \"For me, it's kind of a nervous excitement,\" Mr. Garre says, who keeps on his desk a jar of white goose-quill pens, which the court has made a tradition of setting out for counsel. \"At that point you've put in the work that's necessary, and it's your opportunity to stand up and make your case. I get excited on argument days.\" He isn't above superstition. Mr. Garre at times has worn an old Timex that once belonged to his grandfather and then his father.

Watching the men's basketball team celebrate on the floor that March night at the National Invitational Tournament brought back so many great memories collected over so many years. Growing up in cold, blustery Chicago, I used to brave the elements and, at an early age, go to my elementary school playground on the South Side to shoot hoops. A good deal of the time was spent perfecting my jumper and fantasizing about sinking the game-winning shot.

There was no such thing. Far from it. The team played in Arlington, Va. They borrowed the gym at Fort Myer, a military installation. The venue was awful; it was old, dismal, dark and dank.

He played only one season for GW (1968-69), but what a season. He had transferred from Kentucky, and Adolph Rupp's loss was our gain. He had the prettiest shot I've ever seen. Effortlessly he would set up and, with perfect form, loft the ball ... and swish. Honestly I don't recall him ever missing. At the free-throw line he was the ultimate master. He shot 90 percent. That year, Mr. Tallent was fifth in the nation in scoring with 28.9 points per game\u201428.9 points a game, I remind you, without the benefit of the three-point rule. He was followed by terrific younger brothers Mike and Pat, and of course served as head coach from 1974-81. Then there was Babe McCarthy, who coached only one year, 1966-67. He came from Mississippi State, where in 1962 the team had been picked to go to the NCAA tournament, but was told by the governor they were not to compete if an opposing team had a black player. He went anyway, under the cover of night. It is to GW's credit that we can count him as one of our own. In later years came Shawnta Rogers, so small but so big. What a competitor. In the last seconds, he's the one you want to have the ball to make the buzzer-beater. And he did, again and again. Chris Monroe, GW's leading Belarus; and Pops Mensah-Bonsu, the mayor of Foggy Bottom. No one played with such sheer joy. He was a delight and a wonder to watch. I remember the season that genuine basketball glory came to Foggy Bottom: 1992-93, pushed on by the 7-foot-1 Yinka Dare\u2014to say he dominated the boards is a vast understatement\u2014and Dirkk Surles. Every time he got the ball, excitement followed. And so did I, taking to the road behind the team as it battled its way through the NCAA tournament. Then all of a sudden, this basketball nobody was in the Sweet 16, against Michigan's vaunted Fab Five. We were, unbelievably, down by two points at the half and then took the lead with eight minutes left. Sitting in the stands in Seattle, I had visions of the Final Four. It was not to be, but the thrill was beyond compare. GW had finally broken into basketball royalty. From there on, GW was to be taken seriously on the court. Just two years later, in 1995, GW was playing top-ranked UMass and, as I made my way into the Smith Center, I saw an unusual sight\u2014a scalper. Then inside, metal detectors. I knew instantly what was going on. The president of the United States, Bill Clinton, was coming to the game. Our game! And what a game. GW won. We had beat the No. 1 team in the nation. The students stormed the floor. But the sight that sticks in my mind is the sharp-shooting Kwame Evans sitting on top of the basket, his face radiating sheer ecstasy. That night GW led the ESPN highlights. For the first time, GW basketball was the talk of the town. I've also been there for postseason A-10 tournaments: through the thunderous clamor in the Palestra in Philadelphia, through blinding snow in Atlantic City. I've road tripped to see the team in seemingly all-but-forgotten Olean, N.Y.; in Pennsylvania, where I had to be rescued on the turnpike as I made my way home in a snowstorm; all the way to Honolulu, where we knocked off 11th-ranked Wichita State on the way to winning the Diamond Head Classic. I was in Durham, where Duke plays in that country-club gym and clobbered us. But at least I was there. At various points, sometimes even when the going is at its hardest, I've paused and thought: Why does this make me so happy? After all these years, I still wake up in the mornings during basketball season and say, \"It's game day. What a great day.\" GW will be playing and, in one way or another, I'm there and always will be.

Seated at an easel, Clarice Smith, BA '76, MA '79, paints ladies and gentlemen in long coats and top hats. Her brushes and paint tubes are arranged neatly; books surround her. Two pages later, Albert Paley, a Rochester, N.Y., sculptor plays Vulcan to Ms. Smith's Venus. A red bandana over his head, he wears stained work clothes as he dramatically heaves a large piece of steel into a forge. His surroundings are industrial, the furnace lights blinding and the craft of making his art physically taxing. \"It's like David and Goliath, right?\" Ms. Smith says with a laugh. \"He's a terrific man. He's very gentle, intelligent and easy to work with.\" The pair met at a 2014 Corcoran Gallery of Art retrospective of Mr. Paley's work\u2014which is held by nearly a dozen major U.S. and European museums\u2014and agreed to work together on a framed painting. The result, \"Triptych,\" is a centerpiece of the exhibition at The Kreeger Museum in D.C. (through Dec. 30), which includes 13 works by Ms. Smith and 10 by Mr. Paley. The two-sided \"Triptych\" has a painted landscape on one side and flowers on the other, all set in an elaborate frame that Mr. Paley constructed. It was the first time either artist had been part of this sort of duo, which created a collaborative \"back-and-forth between the paintings and the sculptural surround,\" says the exhibit's guest curator, Lenore Miller, MFA '72, GW's director and chief curator of university art galleries. Ms. Smith, who has exhibited her work in recent solo shows at the National Museum of Women in the Arts and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, came up with the pictorial idea on her first trip to Santa Fe, N.M., where she was taken with the sky. \"It's almost as if you could touch it,\" she says. Typically a painter of realistic portraits, flowers and horses, she found herself pursuing abstraction to capture the skyscapes. \"You don't really draw clouds,\" she says. Displeased with one painting, Ms. Smith bought a window squeegee and started scraping off the paint. But as she unmade the piece, she saw images emerge. \"I went along with it,\" she says. \"It's almost as if it painted itself.\" She pursued the same technique with \"Triptych,\" for which she also used a brush. The idea of a triptych\u2014comprising three panels and typically associated with medieval, Catholic devotional art\u2014came to her when she passed two of her paintings propped up in her studio. She thought a third work would make a good grouping. She'd had triptychs on the brain, she says. She often looks out the large windows in her apartment, which make the world appear in triptych form. The work charts new territory for Ms. Smith. \"She was very much a traditional, figurative painter,\" says Ms. Miller, the curator. And Ms. Smith recently expanded into stained glass, as well, collaborating with glass artist Thomas Venturella to create a window for the New-York Historical Society. Ms. Smith did everything but cut the glass, having never worked with the medium. \"I went out and bought the book Stained Glass for Dummies, \" she says. \"I like learning things. It's a feeling of accomplishment. I don't want to stay in the same rut. I'm not a [Giorgio] Morandi, painting the same vase of flowers over and over again.\" She did, however, ask the museum to bring in an expert on installing glass. \"I want it to be striking,\" she says, \"but not to strike anybody over.\" \u2014Menachem Wecker, MA '09 For more on Clarice Smith, visit claricesmith.com, and for Albert Paley, albertpaley.com.

We watch them because they stir our better selves, because we know there will be reconciliation before the lights come up. Real life is messier. \"We have ideals,\" Mr. Stern says, \"and we always fall short.\" But the image, every year around this time, of what it would be like if we didn't fall short\u2014if others didn't\u2014seems to be reason enough to keep trying. iSTOCK.COM/EMISTAfamily, and that's why I think our Christmas films resonate,\" Mr. Stern says. But in exile and disappointment there is the hope of something better, and Christmas\u2014thanks to its chestnut-roasted optimism and expectation of unconditional togetherness\u2014offers a perfect measure by which to compare despair and happiness. \"Alienation is a means to get what they're really about, which is reuniting and finding the sense of either family or community,\" says film critic Alan Zilberman, MPP '09, the film editor at BrightYoungThings.com and a contributor at RogerEbert.com. \"Christmas [FILM] Ever Rosy, but Born of the Blues Two experts weigh in on the complicated genre of the Christmas movie It's likely that in the next month, many of you, on purpose or by accident, will watch a Christmas movie. But what is it that will make you stick to that channel? And what could possibly hold together a genre that swings from Miracle on 34th Street to Die Hard? \"It's about alienation from family,\" says Noah Stern, a screenwriting professor in the Film Studies Program. \"Someone's always coming home. Why are they coming home? Because they wanted to get away from their family.\" The Bishop's Wife? It's a Wonderful Alone? Elf? Love, Actually? Christmas Vacation? Outcast characters drive the conflict in each. \"It's about the uneasiness we have with Meta-Alienation It's not just the characters: the Christmas movie genre itself is something of a pariah, rarely serving up hits in the theater. Only two have ever grossed more than $200 million, according to Box Office Mojo: Home Alone ($286 million) and How the Grinch Stole Christmas ($260 million). Not unlike some family members, they grow on us over time. \"They find an audience later,\" says Mr. Zilberman. \"They don't become classics until they're embraced by a group of people who make it a part of their tradition.\" WE MAKE FUTURES Your gift funds scholarships, internships, and world-class experiences.
