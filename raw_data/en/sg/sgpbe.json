The ancient practice of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is rooted in the understanding that a problem with the eyes, bones, teeth, ears, stomach\u2014or any other body part\u2014stems from a much deeper energetic issue. If a person were experiencing broken bones, low bone density, or even tooth decay, the practitioner may begin by treating the person's Kidney. You may say the bones/teeth and the Kidney are two completely different systems with entirely different functions, and from a physical perspective, you'd be right. But when viewed from an energetic perspective, the body takes on a totally different form\u2014it becomes a treasure map of sorts to understand the body's invisible energetic imbalances. Everything in the body is connected. Physical symptoms are simply messages from the body that something is energetically off balance. A problem with the bones or teeth cues us in to see that the energetic function of the Kidney is off-balance. Likewise, dry, cracked skin and constipation are the body's way of notifying us that the Lung and Large Intestine need an energetic boost. So, once we decipher these messages, how do we help? The first step is a true understanding that the body is an energy being and that everything in the body is connected. Next, we look to see where the body's energy is lacking. Check the table below to understand some physical symptoms and their energetic counterparts. Then read more about each of the organ systems here.
