We have a separate hall for our sick patients with symptoms of COVID-19. We ask that if you call 919-233-6000 option 1 when you arrive in the parking lot and we will come out to escort you directly to a patient room. Please note that these visits are sick visits only and not chronic or preventative care visits to ensure safe and efficient care. We offer rapid antigen testing as well as PCR \"send out\" testing. Due to testing supplies and unknown turn around times with LabCorp, we are not able to offer testing to patients for preoperative clearance or prior to travel. We do offer follow up appointments after you have tested positive for COVID-19 to ensure you recover and have access to healthcare throughout your illness. Please contact our office to schedule an appointment. COVID-19 Vaccine Updates: Due to unforeseen circumstances, we have closed our COVID-19 vaccine clinic at this time. We still recommend COVID-19 vaccines and boosters for our eligible patients. Other sites in Wake County are offering appointments for vaccines. Please call NC Department of Health and Human Services at [1-877-490-6642](tel:+118774906642) or visit [this link](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/vaccines) to find a vaccine distribution center near you.
