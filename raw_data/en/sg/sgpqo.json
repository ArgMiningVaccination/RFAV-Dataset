While we all know that [ sex is a huge stress-buster](https://www.yourtango.com/2016296269/bdsm-sex-kinky-way-treat-stress-and-anxiety), it's not the only form of physical contact that's good for your mental well-being. [Hugging, cuddling, and touching](https://www.yourtango.com/2019322577/why-cuddling-is-important-for-intimacy-and-healthy-relationships) can put you in better spirits and help you relax.
