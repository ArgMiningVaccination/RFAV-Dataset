MMR ( Measles, Mumps, Rubella ): (2) vaccines or positive antibody titers (blood tests) of all three diseases. (2) doses of each of the single component vaccines are acceptable. The first MMR must be given after the first birthday to be valid, and the MMR vaccines must be at least 28 days apart. For healt h science students, there is no age exemption for MMR. Hepatitis B: A minimum of (3) vaccine s, completed at the appropriate intervals, followed by an initial antibody titer 1 month or more after third vaccine. The titer is REQUIRED, even if series was completed as a child. If you have no hep B vaccination records but believe you got them, you can just get the titer to check for immunity. If antibody titer is ne gative, follow the algorithm outlined in the \" Hepatitis B Titer Protocol \" link listed in this Health Science students section. You may need more than (1) additional hep B vaccine in order to achieve a positive titer - so start this process early. Varicel la (chicken pox ): (2) vaccines or positive antibody titer. We do not accept report of disease history. If you had varicella disease as a child and no history of (2) vaccines, you must have a titer to document immunity. Tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis: (1) Td (tetanus/diphtheria) at least every 10 years. Must have documentation of ( 1) Tdap (Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) vaccine. TB (Tuberculosis) screening : A two-step TB skin test (TST) or the blood test- IGRA (Interferon Gamma Release Assay - QuantiFERON Gold or T -Spot) is required at the start of your program. If you have never had any TB skin testing, the two -step TST is done as follows: The first test is placed, and results are read in 48 -72 hrs. The second test is placed at least 7 days after the placeme nt of the first test and read at 48 -72 hrs. Send documentation of both tests, and include placement date, reading date, result and mm induration. Having (2) negative TSTs within the same calendar year will meet the two -step requirement. If you have documen tation of (1) negative TST in the past 12 months, or documentation of (2) negative TSTs in your past, you only need one more TST to meet the two -step requirement. If you have ever had the Bacille Calmette -Guerin (BCG) vaccine, given to children in some countries to prevent TB, you should get the IGRA blood test instead of skin tests. If you have a negative TB blood test (IGRA) performed in the US within the past calendar year, that meets the initial TB screening requirement and a two -step TST is not needed. Indeterminate IGRA results will not be accepted. If you have a negative IGRA that was done longer than one year ago , you will need to repeat the IGRA (must be done in the US) or complete the two -step TST (if you have never gotten BCG vaccine). Those with a history of a positive TST or IGRA must provide a copy of the CXR (Chest x -ray) report. If treated for LTBI (Latent TB Infection), provide medication information and treatment dates. Students with a history of a positive TST are also required to c omplete a symptom assessment at the start of their program. The \"History of Positive TB Screening Results\" form is in the link listed in this Health Sciences student section. Health Screening: Complete the Health Screening form once upon entry to the Health Science program. Can be signed by RN, MD, DO, PA, ARNP. The form link is in this Health Sciences student "}
