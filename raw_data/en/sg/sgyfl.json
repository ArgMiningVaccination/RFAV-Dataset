I have dabbled with homeopathy over the years but became more interested in it after having my first child, Taj. Homeopathy is a safe and effective way to treat all sorts of illnesses for all the family - including babies and children. I contacted a well-known local Homeopath, Alice Kleinsman from Be Well Naturally, and took Taj to see her so she became familiar with him as a person. Homeopathy isn't just about the symptoms a person has, it has a much more holistic view and looks at the personality traits and what is happening emotionally and environmentally for that person. There are some great general remedies which are easy to select yourself and the good thing about homeopathy is that it doesn't matter if it isn't the right remedy, you can try another one until you find the right one. AMAZING EXPERIENCES I had a couple of amazing experiences with homeopathy which have really solidified my belief in this form of treatment. When we were travelling overseas as a family, my Dad became really ill with a stomach bug, this was in the days prior to us travelling home. On the day we were driving to the airport I started to get the same symptoms as him, we were travelling back from Italy so a long haul flight with a stomach bug was not a prospect I wanted! Luckily I had my trusty homeopathy kit with me and I took a remedy I thought sounded right. By the time we got to the airport I felt fine! To say I was relieved is an understatement! Another time my son, Taj, was unwell with a heavy cold and cough and was not improving. He was very lethargic and didn't want to eat - he couldn't even be tempted by ice blocks! I was very worried and decided to take him to the doctor who wasn't sure what was wrong with him and suggested anti-biotics. I managed to get an appointment with Alice after the doctors so I went straight there. After listening to what was going on with him and seeing him, she gave him a remedy. 2 minutes later he had perked up considerably and was eating an ice block, from there he quickly recovered. I am still amazed by this. Sarah with her children Taj and Sia For those of you who aren't familiar with homeopathy, below is some general information from [Alice Kleinsman](http://bewellnaturally.co.nz/). HOMEOPATHY Homeopathy is a natural drug free way that millions around the world use to help with many conditions. It is simple and easy to use, and can easily be used by all the family from women who are pregnant and giving birth, through to the elderly. Homeopathy doesn't interfere with any other forms of medication, and has no known side effects. The most common conditions that people usually seek homeopathic treatment for include: - Allergies - Arthritis - Asthma - Chronic pain such as headaches - Depression, stress, anxiety, and insomnia - Digestive issues such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) - Hay fever - High blood pressure - Hormonal issues - Skin conditions such as acne or eczema Homeopathy is individually tailored for each person and the use of small (minimum) doses is aimed to ensure minimal side effects, and to stimulate the body's immune system. Once the remedy has been chosen, based on the whole picture as much as possible, the potency of the remedy is chosen according to the degree of seriousness as well as what you have on hand. Mostly people only have one strength, and I suggest when building up your kit, that you get the 30C potencies, which will work for acute and more serious situations.
