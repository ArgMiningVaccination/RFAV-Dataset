These Medium Energy High Dose (MEHD) implants have traditionally been supported by stationary spot beam spinning disk batch tools on 200mm (and smaller) substrates. Power Device Manufacturers are increasingly migrating to Single Wafer tools and 300mm substrates for increased performance, more accurate angle control, productivity and lower cost of ownership. Currently, the MEHD dose/energy space is not well supported by Single Wafer 300mm tools. The Varian Business Unit of Applied Materials has developed a Medium Energy High Dose Ion Implanter based on the VIISta Medium Current Architecture to address this need. Modifications to the Medium Current VIISta Architecture will be discussed. Overall system productivity and process results will be presented.", "sitename": "ieeexplore.ieee.org", "date": "2023-09-09", "cleaned_text": "A not-for-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.\u00a9 Copyright 2023 IEEE - All rights reserved.
