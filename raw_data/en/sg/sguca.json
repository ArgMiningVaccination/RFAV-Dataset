Cancer Specialists Multiple Redington Fairview Hospital Skowhegan York Hospital York For more information, go to Maine CDC: COVID19 PreExposure Prophylaxis: Evusheld EVUSHELD is a new combination monoclonal antibody administered as two concomitant IM injections in the gluteal muscle. Maine is experiencing extreme scarcity of blood products to support patients should they have a bleed or hematoma from a deep muscle injection. Thus, strong considerations and judicious clinical discretion is advised for those patients who may be at risk for bleeding from a deep muscle injection. Contraindications for administration in patients who otherwise meet the eligibility per EUA criteria include: Clinically significant heritable bleeding disorder or bleeding diathesis despite a normal platelet count. Platelet count <20,000/uL. On anticoagulation (DOACs) drug(s), or heparin agents,unless they can be safely held in advance. Dual antiplatelet therapy for stent or other considerations.

These anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics are of greatest benefit for non-hospitalized patients who have risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19. The risks for progression are substantially higher for those who are not vaccinated or who are vaccinated but not expected to mount an adequate immune response to the vaccine.
