In this week's eSkeptic, Ralph Lewis, M.D. discusses the challenges to understanding and defining complex mental disorders.

Episodes can endure for weeks or months and affect thousands. Psychiatrists are divided as to the cause of these imaginary scares. Some believe that it is a form of group psychosis triggered by stress, while others view it as mass hysteria. How can groups of people come to believe that their sex organs are shrinking? In this article from [Skeptic magazine issue 7.4](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/7.4/)(1999), Robert E. Bartholomew discusses the anatomy of mass hysteria, their similarities, and the factors involved in triggering them. - [May 21st: Eye Movement Magic](../14-05-21/) - In this article from [Skeptic magazine issue 7.4](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/7.4/)(1999), three psychologists examine in detail the most recent scientific evidence (at the time) regarding the efficacy of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. The authors consider strategies employed by EMDR's proponents to deal with negative findings, and note historical parallels between EMDR and other controversial treatments. This scientific and historical analysis of EMDR may help shed light on a variety of other potentially pseudoscientific practices in the field of clinical psychology. In this respect, EMDR serves as a useful object lesson in the study of pseudoscience. - [May 14th: The Great Dilution Delusion](../14-05-14/) - You might ask why, as skeptics, we must continue to fight the same battles against quackery over and over again, long after the nonsense has been debunked.

It is, for the most part, a \"rational choice\" made by athletes in general and cyclists in particular when it comes to the decision to dope or leave the sport altogether because it is almost impossible to compete if everyone else is doping. And if you only think everyone else is doping the temptation to choose the cheating option becomes psychologically overwhelming.

He treats both as rather disconcerting indicators of the level of public discourse in general, and of the conflict between science and pseudoscience in particular. It is an area that is both usually neglected within the context of discussing science in the public arena and yet crucial to our understanding of how science is perceived or misperceived by the public.

In their study, two classic (but extremely common) blunders were committed: (1) misinterpreting statistical results, and (2) ignoring a basic tenet of scientific testing\u2014repeatability. - [July 27th: What's in the Number 19?](../11-07-27/) - On June 28, Michael Shermer published [a post on Skepticblog.org](http://skepticblog.org/2011/06/28/number-19/)on the number 19 and the attempted ambush interview that he turned into a lesson in patternicity (the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise) and numerology, calling for our readers to chime in with their own examples of such patternicity. In this week's eSkeptic, we present 19 of the more intriguing, delightful, instructive, and funny responses from that blog. - [July 20th: Jesus Potter Harry Christ](../11-07-20/) - In this week's eSkeptic, Tim Callahan reviews Derek Murphy's book [Jesus Christ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615430937/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=0615430937)(Portland, OR: Holy Blasphemy Press). - [July 13th: Religion in Harry Potter](../11-07-13/) - In light of the final installment of the \u00fcbersuccessful Harry Potter series having hit theaters, we present Ari Armstrong's examination of religion in J.

Naturally no one considers their beliefs to be pseudoscience or faith-based nonsense, so saying something along those lines to a believer's face is likely to close off conversation. In this remarkable article, our own Daniel Loxton tackles the matter head on. Daniel shows that a controversy that erupted at last year's The Amazing Meeting conference was just the latest in a very long history of skeptical debates about the \"tone\" of our criticism and educational outreach.

Dick in his classic novel [Minority Report](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375421874?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0375421874).
