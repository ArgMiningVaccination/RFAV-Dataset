I was skeptical of Acupuncture first but now i am a true believer. Oleg is very patient, knowledgeable and professional. I have tried many different therapies, excercices, without success. After several sessions I felt much better, my pain went down to a minimum and i felt energetic and healthy again. What i also liked is that Oleg has a background in massage therapy, so I was able to get best of both worlds during our therapy sessions. I have recommended Nature Med Acupuncture to all my family and friends. Zhanna Kushniarova \"Oleg is amazing. I have had three sessions with him and the pain in my leg has subsided greatly. At my first visit Oleg was very thorough in his explanation of the acupuncture process and what I could expect. After the first session I had immediate improvement with the pain. The treatments have also helped tremendously with my anxiety. I am continuing acupuncture treatments not only for pain but also for the overall benefits. I highly recommend Oleg.
