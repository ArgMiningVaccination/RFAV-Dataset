Approximately 77% of Americans take at least one dietary supplement \u2014 a record high, according to the Council for Responsible Nutrition. The number is even higher \u2014 81% \u2014 in adults aged 35-54 years. According to these numbers, we can assume the majority are taking a supplement daily, but what exactly are they taking and how did they determine it was the right supplement for them? In a survey of nearly 9,800 people who regularly use dietary supplements (with the majority taking at least four different supplements daily), the most popular supplements in 2020 were vitamin D, magnesium, and fish oil, according to ConsumerLab.com, a company that independently tests health and nutrition products for quality approval. While I am sure you are familiar with these supplements, just as you are with other popular options such as Vitamin C or B12, that does not mean that these specific supplements are the most beneficial choice for your specific needs or concerns. Just because a multivitamin is labeled to be \"for men,\" a man that is 24 years old is going to have different bodily needs than a man that is 55. A supplement advertised as a \"sleep support\" sounds great, but what if Woman A considering the product is struggling with insomnia because she is entering menopause while Woman B can't get sleep due to a gastrointestinal disorder. It is so easy to get distracted in today's health and wellness environment yet hard to remember that creating an optimal routine is not a one-size-fits-all concept. Dietary supplements as well as recommendations have been popping up everywhere \u2014 on commercials, online advertisements, through social media influencers, and from friends or family members. Amidst the commotion, and a plethora of choices like gummy bears, teas, and elixirs promising to enhance your health, it can be difficult to figure out which supplement is necessary when the last vitamin you took was in the shape of Fred Flintstone. Maybe you've actually taken an entire cocktail of multivitamins for a fair amount of time but didn't seem to notice a difference so ultimately abandoned the concept altogether. Let's address a few simple but essential things to consider about supplementation. Identify what you would like to achieve. You may be addressing a vitamin deficiency, looking to lower the risk of certain diseases or trying to proactively improve your overall health. Supplementation can also be used to address or combat a variety of concerns that you have probably never even considered them capable of! Just to name a few, these could be things you have struggled with like weight gain, hair loss, anxiety and skin concerns. Using an on site inventory of over a hundred pharmaceutical grade supplements, our medical team can curate a personalized regimen targeting a singular or multipurpose enhancement for each patient around their individual needs and concerns. Pharmaceutical Grade Supplements vs. Store Grade Supplements Have you ever actually read the ingredient label on the supplements you are buying at the drugstore? In the United States, dietary supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, otherwise known as the FDA. The responsibility is left to the manufacturers and distributors of the products themselves to evaluate that their own products are not just safe but actually effective before they enter the market and hit the shelves of your local store. Due to this loophole, countless products have been mislabeled and falsely advertised. Is it just me or does this begin to explain why I actually enjoy taking those gummy vitamins a little too much and may or may not eat an extra one as a little treat from time to time... In opposition, pharmaceutical-grade products are produced to ensure maximum absorption, obtain the purest nutrients available and have 99% accuracy in the ingredients list . Plus, they will contain the highest amount of active ingredients with the least amount of fillers, or in other words, additives, that provide no nutritional value. Pharmaceutical grade supplements follow the same regulations as medications, the raw ingredients are tested before production and the final product is required to be absorbed by the body within 45 minutes. Store grade supplements do not have to meet any accuracy in the ingredient list, can contain any amount of filler, simply have to be safe for consumption and the nutrients may not even be absorbable if there are even nutrients in the product to begin with. Buying pharma-grade supplements directly from a physician vs. an online retailer Hormonify is a board-certified medical group committed to sell only pharmaceutical grade products at the most competitive rates.
