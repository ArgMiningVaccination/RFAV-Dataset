Southern provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Songkhla and Yala - Avoid all travel [Avoid all travel](#levels) to and through the following southern provinces, due to the unpredictable security situation. Separatist insurgents periodically perpetrate violent attacks. - Narathiwat - Pattani - Songkhla - Yala Safety and security Southern provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Songkhla and Yala Separatist insurgents periodically perpetrate criminally and politically motivated attacks in the southernmost provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Songkhla and Yala. These deadly attacks include shootings, bombings and arson, and are usually directed at military, government and security buildings and personnel. They have also occurred in a variety of public places. Martial law and heavily enhanced security measures are in place in Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala, and Sadao District in Songkhla. Increased enforcement powers allow authorities to: - detain suspects without charge - conduct searches - seize objects or documents - impose curfews You risk becoming a collateral victim of an attack if you travel in these provinces. Myanmar border areas in the provinces of Mae Hong Son and Tak Exercise a high degree of caution when travelling to the Thailand-Myanmar border areas in the provinces of Mae Hong Son and Tak. Occasional violence, banditry and clashes between government forces and drug traffickers occur. Border crossing points may be closed without notice. Cross at designated border crossing points only, with the required travel documentation. Preah Vihear Temple area and surrounding border region Thailand and Cambodia have an ongoing border dispute in the region. There are reports of landmines in the Preah Vihear temple area. Exercise a high degree of caution if you are travelling to any other Thai-Cambodian border areas. Political tensions Political instability in Thailand has created a volatile and unpredictable security environment throughout the country, particularly in Bangkok. Legal provisions may allow the military to retain and exercise sweeping powers that could include the right to: - prevent public gatherings - censor media - impose curfews - set up checkpoints - restrict movement - search for weapons - exercise force in response to violence Such measures could be enforced at any time. Some television, radio stations and web sites may be unavailable, and access to social media services may be intermittently suspended. Crime Petty crime, such as purse snatching, pickpocketing and theft, is common. Thieves sometimes use razors to cut purses and bags open to remove their contents. - Don't leave bags unattended - Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and travel documents, are secure at all times, especially in tourist areas, crowded markets and bus or train stations - Avoid walking in dark alleys or isolated areas Thefts occur on cross-country buses and vans. Personal belongings, including passports, have been stolen from luggage compartments under buses, especially on long-distance journeys. Use only reputable transportation companies. Break-ins occur at budget guesthouses, sometimes while guests are asleep in their rooms. Be careful at night in entertainment areas throughout the country, including in Koh Pha Ngan and Koh Tao, particularly during full moon parties, Songkran, and other events in popular tourist locations. Robberies and assaults (including sexual assaults) can occur during these events. Passport thefts and losses are common. Violent crime against foreigners occurs occasionally. You should report all criminal incidents to the Thai police in the jurisdiction where the incident occurred before leaving Thailand. Fraud Many Canadians fall victim to a variety of scams while visiting Thailand. You should report all incidents to the tourist police. Credit card and ATM fraud Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards: - pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others - use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business - avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature - cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN - check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements Rental scams Rental companies have at times accused renters of causing damage upon return of the equipment. In some cases, renters who refused to pay were harassed and threatened, and their passports (left as collateral) were withheld. Some companies have also stolen the motorcycle and then claimed compensation from the renter. Before renting a motorcycle or personal watercraft, read all rental contracts thoroughly to ensure that the vehicle is insured to cover damage and theft. Take photos of existing damage on rented vehicles as proof of pre-existing damage. You must never use your Canadian passport as collateral for rental. If your passport is inaccessible or stolen because of such a situation, you may be subject to investigation by Passport Canada and may receive limited passport services. Only rent from reputable companies. Entertainment venues Some bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues may try to charge exorbitant prices. Discussions about overcharging may lead to threats of violence. - Confirm the prices before consumption - Avoid running a tab - Avoid leaving your credit card with bar or restaurant staff Travel agencies When dealing with travel agencies, ensure that the company is a reputable tour organization before providing payment. Investment fraud If you plan on buying property or making other investments in Thailand seek legal advice in Canada and Thailand. Do so before making commitments. Related disputes could take time and be costly to resolve. Gems and jewellery purchases In scams involving gems and jewellery, merchants sell lower-quality items at inflated prices with promises that the items can be resold at a profit. The guarantees that merchants offer are not always honoured. Carefully consider all purchases if you are not knowledgeable about gems and jewellery. The Government of Canada cannot assist in obtaining refunds for purchases made. Spiked food and drinks Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect that you have been drugged. Women's safety Sexual assaults against foreign women have occurred. Be particularly vigilant during full moon parties, Songkran, and other events in popular tourist locations. If you are victim of a sexual assault, you should seek medical attention and report the situation immediately to local authorities and the nearest Canadian office. Terrorism There is a threat of terrorism in Thailand. Although infrequent outside of the southern provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Songkhla and Yala, small-scale bomb attacks have occurred in public places. Further attacks are possible. Targets could include: - government buildings, including schools - places of worship - airports and other transportation hubs and networks - public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Demonstrations Large demonstrations are taking place regularly in Bangkok and across the country. There are social tensions, and demonstrations are likely to continue. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also disrupt traffic and public transportation when they block major roads and intersections and may cause the closure of mass transit stations. Maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times. Demonstration sites in Bangkok include: - the areas around the Victory Monument - Thammasat University - the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre - the Democracy Monument - Ratchaprasong intersection Other areas of the city may also be affected by protests and associated movements. Demonstrations have also taken place in other cities. - Avoid military installations and concentrations of security personnel - Expect a heightened security presence in several areas - Carry identification documents at all time - Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place - Follow the instructions of local authorities - Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations [Mass gatherings (large-scale events)](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings) Water activities Deaths have occurred due to contact with poisonous jellyfish off Koh Lanta, Koh Pha Ngan, Koh Phi Phi, Krabi and Phuket. Riptides in coastal areas can be strong, including in the popular destinations of Cha-am/Hua Hin, Koh Samui, Pattaya, Phuket and Rayong. There have been several deaths due to drowning. Diving schools and rescue services may not adhere to international standards. - Rent water sports equipment only from operators affiliated with major international training organizations - Exercise extreme caution when swimming or practising water activities - Heed flag warnings and don't swim when a red flag is displayed - If stung by a jellyfish, seek immediate medical assistance Adventure tourism If you undertake adventure sports, such as zip-lining, rock climbing, speleology, elephant trekking or parasailing, choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance. Tour operators may not adhere to international standards. If you have any doubt concerning the safety of the installation or equipment, don't use them. Ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose. If engaging in adventure tourism: - never do so alone - always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company - buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation - ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity - don't venture off marked trails - ensure that you're properly equipped - ensure that you're well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard - inform a family member or friend of your itinerary - obtain detailed information on each activity before setting out Chemical pesticide poisoning There have been cases of poisoning linked to the use of chemical pesticides, including phosphine. Seek immediate medical assistance if you believe that you have been exposed to a chemical pesticide and are experiencing unusual symptoms. Seek information on whether or not chemical pesticides are used in your accommodations. Road safety Accidents involving vehicles and pedestrians are extremely frequent in Thailand. Hazardous road conditions, adverse weather conditions, local disregard for traffic laws and drunk driving result in frequent accidents. Some vehicles may drive against the flow of traffic and on the sidewalks, particularly motorcycles. Drunk driving and accidents are much more frequent around the western New Year (January 1) and Thai New Year (Songkran, mid-April). Be particularly vigilant when driving during these holiday periods. Slow-moving trucks limit speed and visibility. Avoid driving on mountain roads at night, especially during the rainy season (June to October). Paved roads connect major cities, but most have only two lanes. Some roads can become impassable, particularly during the rainy season. Pedestrians and cyclists should be particularly careful. You should always use elevated walkways/pedestrian bridges whenever possible, especially in Bangkok. Motorcycles Motorcycle accidents are common and are responsible for the majority of road deaths. Rental scooters and motorcycles are often poorly maintained, making them unsafe to their riders and others on the road. Helmets are mandatory for motorcycle riders (including passengers), but many helmets don't meet international safety standards. Insurance claims could be denied if you were driving without a motorcycle licence. Avoid driving or riding motorcycles in Thailand, even if you are an experienced motorcyclist Public transportation Taxis Use licensed taxis from official taxi stands, limousine services or a trusted ride-sharing app. If arriving by air, arrange to be picked up by hotel shuttle services, use a trusted ride-sharing app, the airport rail-link service or official airport buses. Unlicensed vehicles (bearing black and white licence plates) are not correctly insured to carry passengers and may not use meters. Many taxis may not be equipped with backseat seatbelts. Don't share a taxi with strangers. Disputes with taxis operators, tuk-tuks (motorized rickshaws), etc., occur and have occasionally resulted in violence or intimidation. Should a dispute occur and you feel threatened, seek local police's assistance to settle the matter. Marine transportation Passenger boats accidents have occurred due to overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels. Vessels often lack adequate safety equipment. Don't board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy. Trains In the past, rail lines in the far south have been the targets of sabotage and armed attacks. Train accidents in recent years have caused injuries and deaths. Piracy Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters. Mariners should take appropriate precautions. [Live piracy report](https://icc-ccs.org/index.php/piracy-reporting-centre) - International Maritime Bureau Air travel We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards. Entry and exit requirements Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination's entry or exit requirements. We have obtained the information on this page from the Thai authorities. It can, however, change at any time. Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng). Passport Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel. Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country's entry rules. Regular Canadian passport Your passport must be valid at least 6 months upon entry into Thailand. Passport for official travel Different entry rules may apply. Passport with \"X\" gender identifier While the Government of Canada issues passports with an \"X\" gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the \"X\" gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination. Other travel documents Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination. Useful links Visas Tourist visa: not required for stays of up to 30 days Business visa: required Student visa: required Working visa: required If you're travelling to Thailand for tourism with a regular Canadian passport, you can obtain a 30-day visa upon arrival. If you obtain a multiple-entry tourist visa, you can stay for up to 60 days. The visa is valid for 6 months and must be obtained before travelling. If you wish to stay longer than 60 days or work or study in Thailand, you must obtain the appropriate visa from a Thai embassy or consulate. Local authorities are actively monitoring and enforcing compliance with visa regulations. Those applying for non-immigrant visas of category \"O-A\" need to show proof of a valid health insurance meeting specific criteria. [Guidelines Non-Immigrant Visa (O-A)](http://longstay.tgia.org/guidelineoa) - Thai General Insurance Association Other entry requirements Thai Border officials may ask you to show them a return or onward ticket and proof that you have sufficient funds to support yourself for the duration of your stay. If you are unable to do so, you may be denied entry. Entry stamp You must get an entry stamp from an immigration officer at the point of entry into Thailand. Don't get your visa, visa extension or entry stamp from visa shops or travel agents in Thailand. A passport that has been altered or that contains counterfeit visas, and entry/exit stamps is deemed invalid. Offenders can expect jail sentences, fines and deportation, and may also be prohibited from entering Thailand in the future. Length of stay The date indicated on your Thai entry stamp determines how long you may stay in the country, even if your visa shows a different date. All foreigners staying in Thailand longer than 3 months must notify Thailand's immigration bureau of their residence every 90 days. The Royal Thai Police perform random visa checks and strict penalties are enforced for overstaying. Canadians overstaying their visa have been arrested and detained until deportation. Deportation procedures are at the foreigner's own expense and can be lengthy. Detention conditions in immigration detention centres are poor. If you overstay, regardless of whether you leave Thailand voluntarily or are deported, you may be banned from re-entering Thailand for 1 to 10 years. [Notification of stay longer than 90 days](https://www.immigration.go.th/en/?page_id=1666)- Thailand's immigration bureau Dual citizenship If you are a dual citizen, you must enter and exit Thailand with the same nationality passport.

Tuberculosis [Tuberculosis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/tuberculosis.html) is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs. For most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low. Travellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional. High-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives. HIV [HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hiv-aids.html) is a virus that attacks and impairs the immune system, resulting in a chronic, progressive illness known as AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). High risk activities include anything which puts you in contact with blood or body fluids, such as unprotected sex and exposure to unsterilized needles for medications or other substances (for example, steroids and drugs), tattooing, body-piercing or acupuncture. Medical services and facilities Excellent healthcare is available in major cities, particularly in private hospitals and clinics. Quality of care varies significantly in rural areas. Establishments may require confirmation of health insurance coverage, a guarantee of payment or an upfront deposit before admitting patients. Psychiatric or psychological facilities and services in Thailand may not meet international standards. Canadians with mental illness have been committed to state facilities, detained and deported. Medical evacuation can be very expensive and you may need it in case of serious illness or injury. Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.

Carry a photocopy of your passport bio-data page and Thai visa or entry stamp. Police may still require that you produce the original document. If you fail to do so, you could be detained. Drugs Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs, including cannabis, are very severe. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines, jail sentences or even the death penalty. Police regularly perform spot checks to search for illegal drugs, particularly in and around entertainment venues. Uniformed or undercover police may conduct physical searches and may screen your belongings. You may be asked to provide a urine sample. If you carry prescription drugs or other medicines, keep them in clearly marked, original packaging. Certain prescription drugs are frequently sold without prescription in entertainment areas and coastal resorts, including on the street. You should never buy controlled drugs without prescription or on the street. These may be counterfeit or could contain illegal substances. If you purchase these drugs, you could be subject to scrutiny or detained. Alcohol The legal drinking age in Thailand is 20. It is illegal to promote the consumption of alcohol. You could be fined or taken to court for posting on social media any pictures that include alcoholic beverages or people consuming alcohol. Useful links Smoking It is prohibited to import, possess or use e-cigarettes, vaporisers, e-baraku (e-hashish) and their refills. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines or jail sentences of up to 10 years. A smoking ban is in effect on several beaches across the country and is punishable by a 100,000-baht fine and up to 1 year in prison. Check with local authorities and look for no-smoking signs before smoking on a beach. Gambling Gambling, with some exceptions, is illegal. L\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 Actions or words that are considered offensive or insulting to the king or the royal family are illegal and may result in criminal prosecution and lengthy prison sentences.

You must carry an international driving permit or a Thai driver's licence to drive in Thailand. It is illegal to operate a motorcycle without a valid Thai motorcycle licence or an international driving permit with a motorcycle endorsement. Helmets are mandatory for motorcycle riders (including passengers), but many helmets do not meet international safety standards. Carry your identification card, driver's licence and vehicle registration book at all times. Housing foreign citizens All hosts, including hotel staff and homeowners, must notify local authorities that they are housing foreign citizens within 24 hours of the arrival of these foreigners. Commercial surrogacy Commercial surrogacy is illegal in Thailand. If you're planning to visit Thailand for the purpose of commissioning surrogacy arrangements, you should consider the potential challenges involved in pursuing international surrogacy and seek specialist legal advice on Thai and Canadian laws prior to making any arrangements. It is also recommended that you consult with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) on current policies regarding citizenship through descent and the issuance of Canadian travel documents. Dual citizenship Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Thailand. If local authorities consider you a citizen of Thailand, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services. [Travellers with dual citizenship](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/dual-citizenship) Compulsory military service Male Thai citizens are subject to compulsory military service when they reach the age of 21. If you're a dual Canadian-Thai citizen, you may be subject to this requirement. International Child Abduction The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Thailand. If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Thailand by an abducting parent: - act as quickly as you can - consult a lawyer in Canada and in Thailand to explore all the legal options for the return of your child - report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre. If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies. Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
