It is also used to treat redness/swelling/itching (inflammation) of the eye/ear from other causes (such as allergy, rosacea, seborrhea, eczema). This product contains framycetin (also known as neomycin B) and gramicidin, antibiotics that work by stopping the growth of bacteria. It also contains dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that works by reducing redness, swelling, and itching. This medication treats/prevents only bacterial infections. It will not work for other types of ear/eye infections and may worsen them (such as infections caused by viruses, fungi, mycobacteria). Using any antibiotic when it is not needed can cause it to not work for future infections. How To Use This medicine comes with a Patient Information Leaflet. Read it carefully. Ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist any questions that you may have about this medicine. This medication is for use in the eye or ear only. Do not take by mouth. Wash your hands first before using this product. To avoid contamination, do not touch the dropper tip or let it touch your ear/eye or any other surface. Do not use the same bottle/dropper in both the eye and the ear. EYE: Apply the medication to the affected eye(s), usually 3 to 4 times a day or as directed by your doctor. Your doctor may instruct you to use it more often for the first 2 to 3 days (every 1 to 2 hours). Your dosage is based on your medical condition and response to treatment. Do not use this medication more often than prescribed or for longer than 10 days unless directed by your doctor. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully. Tilt your head back, look upward, and pull down the lower eyelid to make a pouch. Hold the dropper directly over your eye and place 1 drop into the pouch. Look downward and gently close your eyes for 1 to 2 minutes. Place one finger at the corner of your eye (near the nose) and apply gentle pressure. This will prevent the medication from draining out. Try not to blink and do not rub your eye. Repeat these steps if your dose is for more than 1 drop and for your other eye if so directed. Repeat as often as directed by your doctor. If you are using another kind of eye medication (such as drops or ointments), wait at least 5 minutes before applying other medications. Use eye drops before eye ointments to allow the eye drops to enter the eye. Do not rinse the dropper. Replace the dropper cap after each use. Do not wear contact lenses while you are using this medicine. Sterilize contact lenses according to manufacturer's directions, and check with your doctor before you begin using them again. EAR: Use this medication usually 3 to 4 times daily or as directed by your doctor. First, clean and dry the outer ear. To make sure that the right amount of medication is given, and to avoid touching the ear with the dropper, have another person insert the drops if possible. To make it more comfortable to use, you may hold the container in your hand for a few minutes to warm the solution. To apply ear drops, wash your hands first. To avoid contamination, do not touch the dropper tip or let it touch your ear or any other surface. Lie on your side or tilt the affected ear upward. Hold the dropper directly over the ear, and place the prescribed number of drops into the ear canal. To help the drops roll into the ear of an adult, hold the earlobe up and back. In children, hold the earlobe down and back. Keep the head tilted for about 5 minutes or insert a soft cotton plug if so directed. Repeat for the other ear if so directed. Your doctor may direct you to give this medication in another way by placing a cotton wick in the ear canal and moistening it with the prescribed number of drops. The wick should be replaced at least once a day. Do not rinse the dropper. Replace the cap after each use. Your dosage is based on your medical condition and response to treatment. Do not use this medication more often than prescribed or for longer than 5 to 7 days unless directed by your doctor. Use this medication at evenly spaced intervals throughout the day and night to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, use it at the same times each day. Continue to use this medication until the full prescribed amount is finished, even if symptoms disappear after a few days. Stopping the medication too early may allow bacteria to continue to grow, resulting in a return of the infection. If treatment is for allergies/swelling, then stopping too soon may result in a return of symptoms. Tell your doctor if your condition lasts or gets worse. Side Effects Stinging/burning (more common when used in the eyes) for 1 to 2 minutes may occur when this medication is applied. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.
