In California as in many other states this is an untrue statement. Many parents would ask why wouldn't I want my children immunized? Information regarding both sides of the vaccination issue must be considered carefully. Get the facts about vaccines' safety, effectiveness and long-term effects on the immune system before you rush your children in for their shots. California law clearly states that our children do NOT have to be vaccinated to attend school (public or private) if an exemption certificate is filed. The choice to vaccinate or not is our right. To hear both sides is our responsibility as parents. J. GIAMPOLO Health Alternatives Vaccine Awareness Committee "}
