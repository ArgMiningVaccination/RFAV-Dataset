There are currently no approved vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, which causes severe respiratory illness or death. Defining the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 will be essential for understanding disease progression, long-term immunity, and vaccine efficacy. Here we describe two methods for evaluating the neutralization capacity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The basic protocol is a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), which involves immunostaining infected cells with a chromogen deposit readout. The alternate protocol is a modification of the FRNT that uses an infectious clonederived SARS-CoV-2 virus expressing a fluorescent reporter. These protocols are adapted for use in a high-throughput setting, and are compatible with large-scale vaccine studies or clinical testing.\", keywords = \"SARS-Cov-2, antibody neutralization, high-throughput Grace Mantus and Evan Anderson \"Funding Information: Thanks to Kathy Stephens and Laila Hussaini for their assistance in recruiting the patients.
