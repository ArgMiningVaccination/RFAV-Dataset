During the past four years, President Trump and his Administration have worked to promote strong intellectual property rights protection and enforcement, both domestically and abroad. As part of an integrated approach, the Trump Administration views our intellectual property strategy, policy and enforcement efforts, together, as key to helping secure the future of our innovative economy and to maintaining our competitive advantage. The Trump Administration's Annual Intellectual Property Report to Congress, developed by the Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, brings together the combined and coordinated efforts of the White House, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security, State, Treasury, Defense, Health and Human Services, and Agri culture, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the U.S. Copyright Office. This report was originally mandated to be submitted by the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator over a decade ago by the Prioritizing Resources and Organiza tion for Intellectual Property Act of 2008, and builds upon that framework to provide an overview of the Trump Administration's intellectual property enforcement strategy and policy efforts. For the United States' approach to intellectual property and innovation policy to be successful, it must continue to be a combined effort that includes all branches of government, the private sector, and our international partners. The Trump Administration continues to build on past strategic efforts in all areas of intellectual property policy, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, both domestically and abroad. But the Administration also recognizes that for the United States to maintain its future economic competitiveness, we need to think st rategically and shift the paradigm to one where we not only place America First, but regard America's inventive and creative capacity as something that we must protect, promote and prioritize. 2 UNITED STATES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY STRATEGY \"In order to maintain our competitive edge in an increasingly global and technology -driven economy, we must protect the advancements and breakthroughs in industry that are vital to sustaining recent successes and accelerating growth. That is why we will c ontinue working to put an end to intellectual property theft and other abusive practices through strong enforcement of our trade laws and efforts to strengthen our cyber infrastructure.\" - President Donald J. Trump1 Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the Constitution recognizes the fundamental importance of intellectual property and its protection to the United States. Intellectual Property (IP) underpins nearly every aspect of our economy - it supports good paying jobs, it supports the arts, sciences and technology, and it creates a framework that allows new industries and innovations to flourish. President Trump is the first President to formally recognize World IP Day and in his third proclamation on April 24, 2020 stated that \" [W]e pay tribute to our Nation's long history of ingenuity and advancement, and we recommit to protecting, promoting, and prioritizing a business and economic environment that supports those who carry on this legacy. The pioneering spirit of these artists, authors , inventors, and other creators has improved our lives and the lives of millions of people around the world, and will continue to propel us toward a better future .\"2 Under the Trump Administration, the Office of the U.S. Intellec tual Property Enforcement Coordinator3 (IPEC) along with other White House offices, in coordination with executive branch departments and agencies, works to advance pro- growth policies, to promote and protect our great competitive advantage - our nation's innovative economy. And, under the leadership of President Trump and with the support of Congress, the White House Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC) was established as a new component agency of the Executive Office of the President and part of the National Economic Council, ensuring that in the decades to come the IPEC will be there to advise the President, coordinate policy, and advocate for American interests abroad. 1 President Trump Proclaims October 4, 2019, as National Manufacturing Day (October 3, 2019 ) - https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential -actions/presidential -proclamation -national -manufacturing -day-2019/ 2 President Trump Proclaims April 26, 2020, as World Intellectual Property Day (April 24, 2020) - https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential -actions/proclamation -world -intellectual- property -day-2020/ 3 U.S. Code: Title 15 (Commerce and Trade), Chapter 107 (Protection of Intellectual Property Rights) - 15 U.S.C \u00a78111. In the White House Office the IPEC Office has been established as the newest component agency of the Executi ve Office of the President and part of the National Economic Council (NEC). 3 Our efforts have focused on coordinating and dev eloping the United States' overall intellectual property enforcement policy and strategy, to promote innovation and creativity, and to ensure effective intellectual property protection and enforcement, domestically and abroad. The United States' intellectual property strategy involves a broad range of executive branch agencies and departments to ensure that the government's efforts are focused and well - coordinated. During the past four years, the Trump Administration has taken significant actions to promote and protect intellectual property. The Administration's four -part strategic approach includes: engagement with our trading partners; effective use of all our legal authorities, including our trade tools; expanded law enforcement action and cooperation; and engagement and partnership with the private sector and other stakeholders. The United States G overnment is taking a targeted, practical, and comprehensive approach toward addre ssing intellectual property policy and strategy. The goal is to ensure a level playing field for American innovators and creators, where their innovations and creations are respected and protected, and for systems to be in place that allow American busines ses to operate in a free, fair and open marketplace. To that end, IPEC established the White House Intellectual Property Strategy Group that regularly brings together the National Economic Council (NEC), National Security Council (NSC), Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), Council of Economic Advisors (CEA), Office of the Vice President (OVP), Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), other relevant White House Offices, and Departments and Agencies. Because intellectual property policy in the international and domestic contexts affects multiple departments and agencies, the White House manages the collaborative policy development process to determine courses of action and make Presidential recommendations to ensure that all views are prope rly presented and considered. The Administration's overall efforts involve a multitude of executive branch departments and agencies, that each handle both different and overlapping aspects of the federal government's intellectual property strategy and po licy. These efforts include senior officials from the Departments of Commerce, Justice, Treasury, Homeland Security, State, Defense, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Copyright Office. Additionally , by statute, the executive branch has three Presidentially -appointed and Senate -confirmed positions focused on IP, which are the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator in the Executive Office of the President; the Undersecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) at the Department of Commerce; and the Chief Innovation and Intellectual Property Negotiator at USTR. 4 Across the Administration, federal departments have vital roles over intellectual property policy and str ategy. The Secretary of Commerce leads several agencies that have important intellectual property responsibilities and serves as a leading voice shaping intellectual property policy both in the United States and abroad. Chief among the Commerce Departmen t agencies is the USPTO, with statutory authority to advise \"the President, through the Secretary of Commerce, on national and certain international intellectual property issues\" and advise \"Federal departments and agencies on matters of intellectual prope rty in the United States and intellectual property protection in other countries.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a72(b) (8) -(13). Other Commerce Department agencies that work on intellectual property issues include the International Trade Administration (ITA), the National Te lecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). The Administration is working to ensure that the federal government's intellectual property efforts are focused and well -coordinated and that resources are being used effectively and efficiently. As the Administration works to achieve meaningful progress, there are three important questions that should always be considered - What are we doing well? What isn't working? And what should we be doing? The Administration has made clear that our intellectual property enforcement policy includes all areas of intellectual property and innovation policy - copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets - and involves nearly every sector of our economy. Our strategic approach makes clear that our economic prosperity relies upon our leadership in technology and creativity, and we must protect our innovative economy from those who steal intellectual property and unfairly exploit the innovations of free societie s. As the United States G overnment works to advance American economic interests overseas, a significant component of our enforcement and protection efforts includes addressing trade enforcement, market access, competition, digital trade, cybersecurity, and rule of law concerns in the intellectual property space, around the world. On digital trade, President Trump has stated that \" American success in the digital economy is based on free flow of data, strong privacy and intellectual property protection, a ccess to capital, and innovation. The United States is committed to sustaining this approach to digital trade long into the future.\"4 Additionally, American innovators and creators must be able to operate in foreign markets that provide them with clear p aths to secure and use their IP. Countries and foreign companies should not be allowed to profit off of the theft or misappropriation of American intellectual property, including, for example, by trade secret theft, IP infringement, piracy, forced technol ogy transfers or localization requirements. Additionally, American brand holders must have full and fair ability to market and sell their products and use their properly registered trademarks across the globe, without undue restrictions. On the domes tic front, the Administration work s to ensure that our intellectual property laws are kept up to date, and that they promote American innovation and creativity. The departments and 4 Remarks by President Trump at G20 Leaders' Special Event on t he Digital Economy, Osaka, Japan (June 28, 2019) - https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings 5 agencies responsible for enforcement of intellectual property rights will co ntinue to use every tool availab le to protect the health and safety of our people. This year, we saw o pportunistic criminals taking advantage of the coronavirus health crisis , which led to an influx of counterfeit personal protection equipment and medi cines, as well as the proliferation of online scams . The United States Government will remain vigilant in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting wrongdoing related to the crisis. Intellectual property is integral to our nation's economic competitive ness and the growth of our innovative economy. For instance, copyrights are not only economically important, but a key part of our culture and society. A well -functioning copyright system is essential. The U.S. copyright system is grounded in our Consti tution, and built on centuries of extensive jurisprudence, statutes and regulations. In 2018, Congress considered and passed the Orrin G. Hatch -Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act, which the President signed into law on October 11, 2018. As President T rump explained, this \"landmark legislation\" - which had bipartisan sponsorship and was unanimously passed by both the Senate and the House - \"provides critical updates to copyright law to reflect the realities of music licensing in the digital age and to b etter reward artists and producers for the online use of their music.\"5 In 2020, the Copyright Office continued implementation of the Music Modernization Act (MMA), which makes significant updates to the way musicians are paid when their work is played on digital streaming serv ices. A highlight of the work on this important law was the Unclaimed Royalties Study Kickoff Symposium, held on December 6, 2019, which brought together songwriters, a broad cross -section of industry participants, and other inter ested members of the public for a day -long discussion on best practices for matching unclaimed royalty payments with their rightful owners. Despite disruptions associated with COVID -19, the Copyright Office continued substantial outreach efforts to ensure musicians and publishers are aware of how this legislation will affect them throughout the year. Activities included participation in 31 in -person and virtual outreach events with the music community, including presentations to international audiences on how to claim U.S. royalties and t he launch of an MMA educational resources page. Additionally, the Copyright Office started publishing a newsletter to keep the public informed on important MMA -related developments and new educational materials. The Copyright Office is continuing to participate in virtual panels and education activities, and will continue its outreach efforts up to and beyond the January 2021 license availability date to ensure the music community is well informed about how to recei ve payment under this important law. Additionally, a well -functioning patent system is important for our economy. The Administration is working to promote innovation and to ensure that we have strong and reliable patents, that the process for granting them is thorough, yet expeditious, and that any subsequent reviews by the courts or administrative agency is done fairly. The Supreme Court has ruled on a number of significant intellectual property cases in recent years. The Administration is 5 Statement by the President on signing H.R. 155 1, the Orrin G. Hatch -Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act (October 11, 2018) - https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings -statements/statement -by-the-president -7/ 6 monitoring how those decisions are being implemented by lower courts and executive branch agencies. The Administration also continues to explore opportunities to engage with stakeholders on existing industry -led voluntary initiatives to protect American intellectu al property, and to look at new areas for cooperation. We are at a defining moment in this new century, and th at is why this Administration continues to advanc e pro -growth policies to protect our continued economic and innovative competitiveness, promote s new engines of growth, and prioritize s America's innovative and creative capacity. 7 ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR TRADING PARTNERS \"America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation's wealth. The era of economic surrender is over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal. We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules.\" - President Donald J. Trump6 During the past four years President Trump has met with world leaders across the globe, consistently raising intellectual property issues with our trading partners. The President and his Administration have advocated strongly for free, fair and reciprocal trade. The Trump Administration continues to counter unfair trade practices, utilizing all appropriate means from dialogue to e nforcement tools, and \"work with like -minded partners to preserve and modernize the rules of a fair and reciprocal economic order\" and \"emphasize fair trade enforcement actions when necessary, as well as multinational efforts to ensure transparency and adherence to international standards within trade and investment projects.\"7 In China, President Trump \"...discussed with President Xi the chronic imbalance in our relationship as it pertains to trade, and the concrete steps that [the U.S. and China] will jointly take to solve the problem of the massive trade distortion. This includes addressing China's market access restrictions and technology transfer requirements, which prevent American companies from being able to fairly compete within China. The United S tates is committed to protecting the intellectual property of our companies and providing a level playing field for our workers.\"8 As part of the United States' continuing response to China's theft of American intellectual property and forced transfer of American technology, and at the direction of President Trump, the U.S. has imposed several rounds of tariffs on Chinese goods. On January 15, 2020, the United States and China signed an historic and enforceable agreement on a Phase One trade deal that requires structur al reforms and other changes to China's economic and trade regime in the areas of intellectual property, technology t ransfer, agriculture, financial services, and currency and foreign exchange. In explaining this deal, USTR stated that, \" President Trump has focused on concluding a Phase One agreement that achieves meaningful, fully -enforceable 6 President Donald J.

This unprecedented agreement accomplishes those very significant goals and would not have been possible without the President's strong leadership.\"9 In September 2018, under the leadership of President T rump, the United States, Mexico and Canada reached an agreement to modernize the 24 -year-old NAFTA into a 21st century, high- standard agreement. The United States -Mexico- Canada Agreement (USMCA) s upport s mutually beneficial trade leading to freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth in North America. And the President has stated that \"[t]he USMCA includes the strongest and most comprehensive intellectual property standards of any prior free trade agreement. Congress approved the agreement on January 16, 2020 and then on January 29, 2020, the President signed the USMCA Implementation Act. T he USMCA will deliver comprehensive protections against misappropriation of trade secrets, robust border enforcement, and enhanced trademark, copyright, and patent provisions that are critical to driving innovation, creating economic growth, and supporting American jobs.\"10 And, in October 2018, USTR announced that, \"[u]nder President Trump's leadership, we will continue to expand U.S. trade and investment by negotiating trade agreements with Japan, the EU and the United Kingdom. Today's announcement is an important milestone in that process. We are committed to concluding these negotiations with timely and substantive results for American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses.\"11 As an initial outcome from the negotiations with Japan, United States Trade Representative Lighthizer and Ambassador Sugiyama on October 7, 2019, signed a new U.S.- Japan Trade Agreement and the U.S. -Japan Digital Trade Agreement.12 The agreement on digital trade \"will benefit trade in innovative products and services where the United States is a worldwide leader, and will ensure that American businesses have a level playing field in areas like video, music, e -books, and software.\"13 More recently, on May 5, 2020, USTR announced the opening of negotiations with the United Kingdom on a Free Trade Agreement. In explaining the relationship, USTR stated that \"[t] here is almost $270 billion in two -way trade [between our countries] , we are each other's largest source of foreign investment , and we each employ about a million citizens of the other country.\" USTR further stated that \"[o] ur objective in these talks is to grow this economi c relationship even closer.

On July 8, 2020, USTR formally launched trade agreement negotiations between the United States and the Republic of Kenya , seeking a comprehensive, hig h-standard agreement that can serve as a model for additional agreements across Africa.15 The Administration is also advancing intellectual property issues in multiple international organizations and fora , including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Health Org anization (WHO) , as well as the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Group of Twenty (G20) , among others. During development of the 2020 G20 and APEC summits, the IPEC and other Cabinet -level Departments promoted the protection of I P in preparatory negotiations across multiple work streams. T his ensured that m ultilateral efforts to spur the global economy respect the important role of I P in driving economic growth, especially within the digital economy. The OECD is a 36 -member internat ional organization that provides a forum for governments to cooperate on a wide range of economic and social issues, and also provides analysis and data on global economic and trade developments, including intellectual property systems, among other issues. In March 2019, the OECD issued a study examining the value, scope and trends in trade in counterfeit and pirated goods. The study concluded that the trend in fake goods is now 3.3% of world trade and rising.16 More recently, they released a study on \"Trade in Counterfeit Pharmaceutical Products.\" The study found that the total value of counterfeit pharmaceuticals traded worldwide is estimated to be up to 4.4 billion dollars and that China, Singapore and India are the main sources for counterfeit medi cines.17 In April 15, 2020, President Trump demanded accountability from the World Health Organization by putting a hold on U.S. funding citing \"mismanagement, cover -ups, and failures\" and calling for reform to address longstanding structural issues. The Administration is also \"calling for reforms to promote transparency and data sharing, hold member states accountable 14 Statement of USTR Robert Lighthizer on the Launch of U.S. -UK Trade Negotiations (May 5, 2020) 15 Joint Statement Between the United States and Kenya on the Launch of Negotiations Towards a Free Trade Agreement (July 8, 2020) available at https://ustr.gov/about OECD -EUIPO report - \"Trends in Trade in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods\" (2019) - is available at http://www.oecd.org/gov/risk/trends -in-trade - \"Trade in Counterfeit Pharmaceutical Products\" (2020) - is available a t https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/web/observatory/trade -in-counterfeit -pharmaceutical -products 10 for abiding by the International Health Regulations, increase access to medicines, and counter China's outsized influence on the organizati on.\" 18 Further, on July 6, 2020, the United States notified the WHO Secretary -General of its intent to withdrawal from the organization as of July 6, 2021. The U.S. G overnment continues to engage our partners in other countries on a range of intellectual property and related trade and law enforcement issues. In support of these efforts, over the past few years, the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator has led mult iple U.S. inter -agency delegations to South America, Asia, the Middle East and Europe to address such issues. These delegations have included representatives from the National Economic Council, the National Security Council, the Department of Homeland Sec urity, the Department of Justice, the Department of State, and the Commerce Department, among ot hers. The U.S. continue s to address these and other issues with those countries through bilateral engagements, including, for example, through the Trade and Investment Framework Agreements. Furthe r, other bilateral engagements -- such as Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) and Work Plans, which the U.S. negotiates with our partners in other counties -- are useful tools for collaborating on various aspects of inte llectual property and related trade and law enforcement issues. Various agencies within the U.S. G overnment , including the Department of State, Department of Commerce's U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, the Department of Homeland Security's IPR Center , and others, have recently signed new MOUs, or are actively considering options for future MOUs to continue to achieve mutually beneficial results with foreign counterparts. The USG also continue s to engage on intellectual property and related trade and law enforcement issues in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Europe. In Southeast Asia, the USG has raised various IP enforcement concerns with Malaysia , Indonesia, and Vietnam, including those related to counterfeits and transshipment of such goods, online piracy, and enhancing cooperation with the U.S. to address these issues. In the Middle East and Europe, the USG has continued to engage with respective senior government officials to discuss ways to improve IPR enforcement, and enhance cooperation with the U.S. Particular ongoing concerns in many countries relate to pharmaceutical issues and increasing enf orcement efforts against IPR violations related to online piracy and counterfeits. On October 17, 2018, the Administration announced that it was submitting a notice of withdrawal from the Universal Postal Union (UPU).19 As the Chairman of the Postal Regulatory Commission explained, \"[t]he UPU continues to promulgate agreements that require posts to undercharge for delivery of inbound mail, to insulate postal shipments from full application of national customs laws, and to promote a different legal regime for postal operators and 18 Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Is Demanding Accountability From the World Health Organization (April 15, 2020) - https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefi ngs-statements/president -donald- j-trump -demanding -accountability - world -health -organization/ 19 Statement from the White House Press Secretary (October 17, 2018) - https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings - statements/statement -press -secretary -38/ 11 competing private carriers.\"20 As the President explained in his memorandum of August 23, 2018, the current UPU system \"distorts the flow of small packages around the world by incentivizing the s hipping of goods from foreign countries that benefit from artificially low reimbursement rates\"; as a result, \"in many cases\" - including when packages are shipped by air from China to the U .S. - the postal charges \"are less than comparable domestic postag e rates\" for packages that are shipped entirely within the United States.21 For example, a small package is charged less to be shipped by air from China to the United States than when it is shipped entirely within the US. In addition to other negative impacts, this artificially low postage has significantly contributed to the rapid growth in recent years of counterfeits being shipped from China to the United States. The Administration's notice of withdrawal was intended to address this and other problems. As the Postal Regulatory Commission's Chairman explained, the Administration's decision \"is a tremendous step towards finally addressing these distortions on behalf of our fellow Americans - particularly U.S. merchants, U.S. mailers, and U.S. private - sector carriers who are trying to compete fairly in these global markets.\" Negotiations between the U.S. and other countries occurred throughout FY 2019. As a result of these negotiations, the member countries of the UPU agreed on September 25, 2019, to a significant change in the terminal dues system, allowing the United States to start setting its own postal fees in July 2020. This successful outcome \"is aimed at eliminating economic distortions for the distribution of goods, by establishing parity with comparable domestic services for inbound packet volumes,\" and \"will also enable the Postal Service to support infrastructure development abroad that builds capacity for advance electronic customs data transmission and improvements in postal security\" incl uding through \"concrete steps to ensure that the world's posts will be better positioned to provide data from their customers that will help to reduce the use of the international mail system to transport dangerous contraband and counterfeit goods into the United States.\"22 In March 2020, after months of extensive outreach, the USG participated in the WIPO meeting in which Members agreed, after multiple rounds of voting, to nominate Daren Tang of Singapore to the position of Director General. Mr. Tang took office on October 1, 2020. In September 2020, United States Government participated virtually in the 60th assemblies of the member states of the WIPO. There, and throughout the year, the Administration engaged with their international counterparts and WIPO officials on various intellectual property matters. The United States conducts a number of international capacity building and training programs that leverage the resources of executive branch agencies and our embassies overseas. As the United States conducts these programs, it will be important for them to be designed toward 20 Statement of Chairman Robert G.

For example, in response to the surge of China -origin counterfeit and substandard PPE, test kits, medicines, and ot her COVID -19 related products, the USPTO IP Attach\u00e9 in Brussels launched several public awareness and capacity -building programs and campaigns. One program, co -sponsored with the Bucharest -based DOJ ICHIP, the IPR Center , Europol and Interpol, focused on R omania as an entry point into the EU. Two other programs, held in partnership with the OECD Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade, focused on emerging trends in illicit trade. USPTO IP Attach \u00e9s to the Middle East/North African and Central Asia also joined, to ensure broader regional coordination on illicit trade routes. The USPTO also added a COVID -19 Response Resource Center on its website, including, for example, USPTO resources to assist patent and trademark applicants, and links to pages where fraud an d counterfeiting can be reported. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security has convened an interagency working group dedicated to countering trade in c ounterfeit and s ub-standard COVID -19 supplies , and ensure registration and recordation of relat ed certification markings. The State Department supports deployment of a U.S. Transnational and High Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement Network (GLEN), which features International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property advisors - ( ICHIPs ), experienced Department of Justice prosecutors with responsibilities to strengthen U.S. law enforcement coordination and deliver capacity building assistance to key foreign law enforcement partners. The GLEN particularly focus es on combatting the growing role of transnational crime organizations in IP theft and cybercrime of all kinds, such as Dark Web markets where criminals use cryptocurrencies to hide their illicit gains. In 2020, the USPTO's Global Intellectual Property Academy (GIPA) developed and provided capacity building programs that addressed a full range of IP protection and enforcement matters, including trademark, counterfeiting, copyright piracy (with an emphasis on online piracy) enforcement of IP rights at national borders, express mail s hipments, trade secrets, copyright policy, and patent and trademark policy and examination. During the last year, the programs cumulatively included over 4,820 government officials, judges and prosecutors, from 117 countries.24 23 2020 Special 301 Report - Annual Review o f the state of IP protection and enforcement in U.S. trading partners around the world, which the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative conducts pursuant to Section 182 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, and the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (19 USC \u00a72242). The 301 Report identifies foreign countries and exposes their laws, policies, and practices that fail to provide adequate and effective IP protection and enforcement. ( https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2020_Special_301_Report.pdf ) 24 For a comprehensive list of the types of programs conducted by Executive B ranch agencies in 2020, please see the appendices. 13 In 2020, U.S. Embassies around the world continued to make IPR an integral part of their bilateral policy dialogues with host governments. For example, U.S. diplomatic posts around the world celebrated World Intellectual Property Day on April 26, 2020, highlighting IP's importan ce in fostering innovation and economic growth. To celebrate the occasion, U.S. Embassies and consulates virtually hosted IP -focused panel discussions, contests, and workshops. The United States' inter -agency IP training and capacity building efforts in volve a multitude of Federal agencies. For example, a July 2020 virtual workshop moderated by USPTO brought together representatives from CBP, USTR, DOJ, CLDP and the Department of State with senior officials from Pakistan's Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR ) Customs Directorate for Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement (IPRE). During the program, Pakistan i officials reaffirmed the country's commitment to improving IPR enforcement at the border for both imports and exports, and stressed the threats to public health and safety and the negative economic impact of unchecked counterfeits, pirated, and illicit goods. At the conclusion of the conference, CLDP , USPTO and Pakistan FBR -IPRE agreed to jointly initiate a technical assistance program focused on stopping counterfeit pharmaceuticals transiting through air freight and air mail facilities in Pakistan . 14 EFFECTIVE USE OF ALL OUR LEGAL AUTHORITIES , INCLUDING OUR TRADE TOOLS \"We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others. We support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal. Because, in the end, unfair trade undermines us all. The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices, including massive intellectual property theft...These and other predatory behaviors are distorting the global markets and harming businesses and workers, not just in the U.S., but around the globe.\" - President Donald J. Trump25 President Trump and his Administration are standing strong against the theft of American IP and are committed to protecting our innovative economy. President Trump has expressed that we need to address the unfair trade practices that drive, not only our trade deficit, but the barriers to market access. \"We really have to look at access, forced technology transfer, and the theft of intellectual property, which just, by and of itself, is costing the United States and its companies at least $300 billion a year.\"26 IP theft not only damages American companies, but it also threatens our national security. Promoting American prosperity is a pillar of the Administration's National Security Strategy (NSS). The NSS states that \"America will no longer tolerate chronic trade abuses and will pursue free, fair, and reciprocal economic relationships. To succeed in this 21st century geopolitical competition, America must lead in research, technology, and innovation. We will protect our national security innovation base from those who steal our intellectual property and unfairly exploit the innovation of free societies.\"27 The NSS highlights that \"[e]very year, competitors such as China steal U.S. intellectual property valued at hundreds of bi llions of dollars. Stealing proprietary technology and early -stage ideas allows competitors to unfairly tap into the innovation of free societies.\"28 The NSS lists the protection of intellectual property as a priority action. \"The United States will reduce the illicit appropriation of U.S. public and private sector technology and technical knowledge by hostile 25 Remarks by President Trump to the World Economic Forum (January 26, 2018) - https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings -statements/remarks -president -trump -world -economic- forum/ 26 Remarks by President Trump at Business Event with President Xi of China (November 27 President Donald J.

The Administration's critical and emerging technologies strategy establishes priority actions to protect our national security innovation base and se cure our technology advantage by strengthening rules where gaps exist, insisting that agreements be enforced, and working with like-minded allies and partners to promote, advance, and ensure the success of our common principles. This Administration contin ues to defend our industry, address unfair practices, and level the playing field for American workers. In releasing the strategy, the Administration stated \"[a]s our competitors and adversaries mobilize vast resources in these fields, American dominance in science and technology is more important now than ever, and is vital to our long - term economic and national security. The United States will not turn a blind eye to the tactics of countries like China and Russia, which steal technology, coerce companie s into handing over intellectual property, undercut free and fair markets, and surreptitiously divert emerging civilian technologies to build up their militaries. \"30 In August 2017, President Trump directed the United States Trade Representative to investi gate China's laws, policies, practices, and actions that may be unreasonable or discriminatory and that may be harming American intellectual property rights, innovation, or technology development. On August 18, 2017, the Trade Representative initiated an investigation under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411).31 In March 2018, USTR released the findings of its exhaustive investigation; USTR found that China's acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation are unreasonable and discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.32 Based on these findings, the President issued a memorandum that directed the U.S. Trade Representative to take all appropriate action under Section 301, inc luding considering increased 29 National Security Strategy, December 18, 2017 (pages 21 -22) - https:// www.whitehouse.gov/wp - content/uploads/2017/12/NSS -Final -12-18-2017- 0905.pdf 30 Statement from the Press Secretary Regarding the National Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technolo gies (October 15, 2020) - Nat ional Strategy is available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp -content/uploads/2020/10/National -Strategy -for- CET.pdf . 31 Presidential Memorandum The Investigation Into China's Acts, Policies, And Practices Related To Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation Under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (March 22, 2018) - https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Section%20301%20FINAL.PDF 16 tariffs on goods from China and pursuing dispute settlement proceedings in the WTO.33 Initially the U.S. imposed a 25 percent duty that affected $34 billion in Chinese imports. That was followed by a second round of tariffs on $16 billion in Chinese goods. Starting September 24, 2018, and in response to China's refusal to eliminate its acts, policies, and practices, tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports went into effect initially set at a rate of 10 percent.34 The rate was initially scheduled to increase to 25 percent effective January 1, 2019. At the direction of the President, the Trade Representative postponed the increase in the rate of additional duty for this third tranche of products in light of progress i n discussions with China, but, on May 10, 2019, increased the level to 25 percent after China retreated from specific commitments agreed to in earlier rounds of negotiations. In May 2019, USTR requested comment and, in June 2019, held a public hearing on a proposed tariff modification to add an ad valorem duty of up to 25 percent on additional products of China with an annual trade value of approximately $300 billion. In August 2019, the Trade Representative, at the direction of the President, determined to modify the action being taken in the investigation by imposing an additional 10 percent ad valorem duty, which was subsequently increased to 15 percent, on products of China with an annual aggregate trade value of approximately $300 billion. The Trade Representative also received public comments regarding a proposed modification to increase the rate of additional duty from 25 percent ad valorem to 30 percent ad valorem on goods of China covered by the three prior tariff actions, with an approximate annual trade value of $250 billion.35 USTR explained the need to take these tariff actions, in response to China's unfair trade practices: \"We must take strong defensive actions to protect America's leadership in technology and innovation against the unpreced ented threat posed by China's theft of our intellectual property, the forced transfer of American technology, and its cyber -attacks on our computer networks. China's government is aggressively working to undermine America's high- tech industries and our ec onomic leadership through unfair trade practices and industrial policies like 'Made in China 2025.'

In light of progress in the negotiations with China, and at the direction of the President, the Trade Representative determined to suspend indefinitely the imposition of the additional duties of 15 percent on $160 billion of Chinese goods that had been scheduled for December 15, 2019. In addition, the United States will be reducing from 15 percent to 7.5 percent the tariffs that it imposed on $120 billion of Chi nese goods on September 1, 2019.37 The Trump Administration is committed to promoting free, fair, and reci procal economic relationships. \"The United States will pursue bilateral trade and investment agreements with countries that commit to fair and reciprocal trade and will modernize existing agreements to ensure they are consistent with those principles. Agreements must adhere to high standards in intellectual property, digital trade, agriculture, labor, and the environment.\"38 USTR engages closely with the Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator and other U.S. G overnment agencies on intellectual property matters. USTR continues to lead trade agreement negotiations; reviews under U.S. trade preference programs such as the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA); on trade policy reviews undertaken at the World Trade Organization; and in highlighting intellectual property enforcement deficiencies in foreign markets, and notorious e -commerce and physical markets trafficking in counterfeit and pirated goods. USTR also works closely with ex ecutive branch departments and agencies to prepare the Annual Special 301 report that identifies U.S. trading partners that do not adequately protect intellectual property rights, and to compile the annual Notorious Markets list, that highlights prominent online and physical marketplaces, outside the United States, that engage in and facilitate substantial piracy and counterfeiting. The Annual Special 301 report provides a review of the state of IP protection and enforcement in U.S. trading partners around the world. The report calls out foreign countries and exposes the laws, policies, and practices that fail to provide adequate and effective IP protection and enforcement for U.S. inventors, creators, brands, manufacturers, and service providers.39 The Ou t of Cycle Review of Notorious Markets highlights prominent examples of foreign \"online and physical marketplaces that reportedly 36 Press Release: USTR Issues Tariffs on Chinese Products in Response to Unfair Trade Practices (June 15, 2018) - https://ustr.gov/about- United States and China Reach Phase One Trade Agreement (December 13, 2019) - https://ustr.gov/about of Section 301 Action: China's Acts, Policies, And Practices Related To Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, 84 FR 69447 (December 18, 2019 ) - https://www.govinfo.gov/cont ent/pkg/FR 27306.pdf 38 National Security 20) - https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp - content/uploads/2017/12/N SS-Final -12-18-2017- 0905.pdf 39 2020 Special 301 Report (April 29, 2020) - https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2020_Special_301_Report.pdf 18 engage in, facilitate, turn a blind eye to, or benefit from substantial piracy and counterfeiting.\"40 The list includes a number of foreign e -commerce sites and physical markets where pirated or counterfeit goods are available. The International Trade Commission (ITC) is an independent quasi -judicial federal agency with broad investigative responsibilities on matters of trade. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 provides for relief against unfair acts and unfair methods of competition in the importation of articles, including articles that infringe a U.S. patent or a U.S. trademark. A complainant in a Section 337 action may seek an order to exclude from entry into the United States infringing imported articles found to violate section 337. The ITC is authorized to issue remedial orders in the form of exclusion orders and cease -and- desist orders. The USTR, under authority delegated by the President, may disapprove such exclusion orders for policy reasons. The ITC handles a significant number of patent disputes pursuant to Section 337 and the Commission's procedural rules.41 The World Trade Organization provides a forum for enforcing U.S. rights under various WTO agreements to ensure that the United States receives the full benefits of WTO membership. These WTO agreements also provide a foundation for high -standard U.S. bilat eral and regional agreements that make a positive contribution to a free, fair and open global trading system based on the rule of law. In regards to intellectual property rights, the WTO provides a venue for the United States to engage with trading partn ers on key IP issues, including through accession negotiations for prospective Members, the Council for Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Council), and by bringing IPR -related cases before the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body. On M arch 23, 2018, the United States initiated dispute settlement proceedings against China concerning its discriminatory technology licensing requirements.42 In its request for consultations, the United States identified breaches by China of WTO rules, harming the intellectual property rights of U.S. companies and innovators. On October 18, 2018, the United States requested that the WTO establish a panel to examine the U.S. complaint after consultations did not resolve the matter.43 The WTO composed the disput e settlement panel on January 16, 2019. In March 2019, China revised the measures that the United States had challenged. On June 18, 2020, the WTO panel informed the Dispute Settlement Body that it had accepted a request from the parties to suspend the dispute, in light of ongoing consultations between the parties.44 40 2019 Out of Cycle Review of Noto rious Markets (April 29, 2020) - https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2019_Review_of_Notorious_Markets_for_Counterfeiting_and_Piracy.pdf 41 19 CFR Part 210 42 Press Release: Following President Trump's Section 301 Decisions, USTR Launches New WTO Challenge Against China (March 23, 2018) https://ustr.gov/about- us/policy -offices/press -office/press - releases/2018/march/following -president -trump%E2%80%99s -section 43 Request for the Establishment of a Panel by the United States, China - Certain Measures Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights (WT/DS542/8) - https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds542_e.htm 44 Communication from the Panel, China - Certain Measures Concerning the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights (WT/DS542/14) - https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds542_e.htm 19 As noted, above, the NSS - issued in December 2017 - stated that \"this Administration will work with the Congress to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to ensure it addresses current and future national security risks.\"45 CFIUS is an interagency committee authorized to review certain transactions in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States. Congress passed the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), which the President signed into law on August 13, 2018. As the President explained, \"[t]his new authority will enhance our ability to protect cutting -edge American technology and intellectual property vital to our national security. . . . I'm pleased this new legislation provides the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States greater authority when it comes to reviewing foreign ownership of American firms with critical technology and intellectual property.\"46 In February 2020, final regulations implem enting FIRRMA went into effect. In October 2020, additional updates linked CFIUS mandatory declaration requirements to export controls, further enhancing protections of American technology. A CFIUS assessment or review can be initiated either voluntarily , as when parties to a transaction that might raise national security concerns file a short -form declaration or a voluntary notice with CFIUS, or mandatorily, as when the parties to a transaction deal in technology that is subject to export controls . Addit ionally, CFIUS can unilaterally initiate review of a transaction . If CFIUS determines that the transaction presents national security risks that cannot be adequately resolved by other laws or through mitigation measures , which may be implemented by agreement or imposed by CFIUS through an appropriate order , then CFIUS may refer the transaction to the President. The President may suspend or prohibit the transaction. 45 National Security Strategy, December 18, 2017 (page 22) - https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp - content/uploads/2017/12/NSS -Final -12-18-2017- 0905.pdf 46 Remarks by President Trump at a Roundtable on the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) (August 23, 2018) - EXPANDED LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION AND COOPERATION \"The theft of intellectual property by foreign countries costs our Nation millions of jobs and billions and billions of dollars each and every year. For too long, this wealth has been drained from our country...Washington will turn a blind eye no longer.\" - President Donald J. Trump47 United States law enforcement agencies are taking strong action against criminal enterprises that engage in IP theft, and improving both international and domestic enforcement efforts. The Trump Administration's intellectual property enforcement efforts b ring together the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services' Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and other executive branch law enforcement agencies, to protect American innovation and intellectual property. The Department of Justice (DOJ) investigates and prosecutes a wide range of IP crimes, including those involving copyright piracy, trademark counterfeiting, and trade secret theft. Primary investigative and prosecutorial responsibility within the Department rests with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States Attorneys' Offices, the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) in the Criminal Division, the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section (CES) in the National Security Division, and, with regard to offenses arising under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Consumer Protection Branch of the Civil Division. DOJ also has a network of 270 specially trained federal prosecutors who make up the Department' s Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (CHIP) program. DOJ's Civil Division brings affirmative cases when United States' IP is infringed. The Civil Division initiates civil actions to recover various penalties or customs duties arising from negli gent or fraudulent import transactions, which include counterfeit goods; defends U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) enforcement of the International Trade Commission's (ITC) Section 337 exclusion orders at the Court of International Trade (these orde rs are a key patent enforcement tool); conducts civil and criminal litigation under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including prosecuting counterfeit drug and medical device offenses; and assists Assistant United States Attorneys (AUSAs) throughout the c ountry with their counterfeit pharmaceutical and device cases. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through CBP and U.S . Immigration a orcem ent-Homeland Security Investigations (ICE -HSI) , stands a t the forefront of enforcing U.S. intellectual property rights at our borders to de fend A merican innova tion from 47 Remarks by the President on Signing a Memorandum on Addressing China's Laws, Policies, Practices, and Actions Related to Intellectual Property, Innovation, and Technology (August 14, 2017) - https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD -201700571/pdf/DCPD -201700571.pdf 21 infringement a nd es. The enforcement of IPR suppor ts U. S. public health and safety, promot es econom ic prosper ity, and pr eserves dom estic and int ernational security. CBP's strategy to enforce IPR is built on the pillar s of facilitation, e nforcement, and de terrence. CBP's strategic approach focuses on c ollaborative efforts to e ducate and engage stakeholde rs to de ter the impo rtation of illicit goods a nd employs innova tive approaches to enforce IPR law at all po rts of entry. In implementing this st rategy, CBP has deployed new tools th at have enabled offi cers to expeditious ly determine whether suspected counterfeit or pirated mercha ndise is authentic . One such tool is CBP's e -Recordation program, which allows U.S. trademark and copyright owners to obtain border enforcement of the ir intellectual property rights. ICE-HSI investigates IPR violations involving the illegal produc tion, smugg ling, and distribution of counterfeit merchandise and pi rated wo rks. A si gnificant m ajority of infringing and da ngerous p roduc ts are produc ed ove rseas a nd are either shippe d directly to the United States or arrive at the Unit ed States via a third country. ICE-HSI Special Agents' critical r ole in inve stigating IPR violations utili zes their tradition al customs a uthor ities and the ir expertise regarding the illicit importation a nd exportation of merchandise. The National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Cente r48 (IPR Center), led by ICE - HSI, the largest investigative agency within the Department of Homeland Security , brings government agencies together to share information, leverage resources, and train investigators, prosecutors, and the public on IP. To ensur e that U.S. G overnment prosecutorial and law enforcement resources are used efficiently and effectively, and are not duplicative, the IPR Center also serves as an investigation clearinghouse for the FBI, ICE -HSI, CBP, FDA, and other agencies. The IPR C enter also conducts an aggressive international program to promote cooperative enforcement efforts with our trading partners and to improve substantive laws and enforcement regimes in other countries. Additionally, the IPR Center continues to engage indus try in an open and on- going dialogue. Through this approach, the IPR Center utilizes both law enforcement efforts and private industry collaboration to effectively combat intellectual property crimes. The IPR Center has developed numerous initiatives and interdiction efforts to combat the infiltration of counterfeits. These efforts are focused on counterfeits that pose a risk to the health and safety 48 The federal member agencies of the IPR Center include: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Federal B ureau of Investigation, INTERPOL Washington- the U.S. National Central Bureau (USNCB), the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal Investigations, the Department of Commerce's International Trade Admini stration, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the Defense Logistics Agency's Office of Inspector General, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations, the United States Nucle ar Regulatory Commission, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the General Service Administration's Office of Inspector General, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Office of Inspector Gener al, the Department of State's Office of International Intellectual Property Enforcement, the Army Criminal Investigation Command's Major Procurement Fraud Unit, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector Gen eral, the Federal Maritime Commission, and the Department of Veterans Affairs' Office of Inspector General. The four international members of the IPR Center are Europol, the Mexican Revenue Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the City of Londo n Police. 22 of the consumer, counterfeits entering the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and U.S. Government supply chains, and the protection of the U.S. economy. The United States G overnment has engaged in a number of training programs for federal, state, and local prosecutors and agents investigating IP crimes. These training courses cover a range of IP enforcement issues and are designed to increase coordination between prosecutors and investigators as well as coordination among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. In FY 2020, the IPR Center reached out to 3,438 people at 78 outreach and training events. In addition to these efforts, DHS law enforcement agencies that support IP enforcement had numerous other engagements with stakeholders in 2020. For example, based on a recommendation in the DHS Report on \"Combating Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods,\" the \" Anti-Counterfeiting Consortium to Identify Online Nefarious actors \" (ACTION) group was formed. During its inaugural meeting in June 2020, representatives from 14 private secto r companies including online sales platforms, social media platforms, payment processors and express delivery companies met to discuss ways to enhance information sharing amongst themselves . The IPR Center also collaborates with industry and other government agencies for training and engagement. For example, in support of Operation Engine Newity, ICE -HSI and the Automotive Anti -Counterfeiting Council (A2C2) worked together to train personnel at ICE - HSI and CBP field offices on how to identify counterfeits. The growth of e -commerce has led to an exponential in crease in the volume of cargo being sent as small packages, a significant percentage of which is counterfeit or illicit. In the face of this immense challenge, our customs officers are on the frontlines monitoring, targeting, and seizing illicit and counterfeit goods at our international mail facilities and other ports of entry. In FY 2020, CBP and ICE made 26,503 IPR seizures. The total estimated manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of the seized goods, had they been genuine, was about $1.3 billion. At the end of FY 2020, the FBI had 136 pending IPR investigations. The largest number of investigations deal with the theft of trade secrets (52), copyright infringement (47), and trademark infringement (16). During FY 2020, the FBI initiated 38 new investigations, made 14 arrests, obtained 7 convictions, forfeitures totaling $11,341,164, and restitutions totaling $0. In FY 2020, ICE -HSI initiated 449 intellectual property investigations and had 203 arrests, 1 25 indictments, and 98 c onvictions . In FY 2020, the IPR Center vetted 33,184 i nvestigative leads -- o f these, 18,449 were referred to law enforcement partners. Additionally, the IPR Center de -conflicted 8,785 investigative targets for partner agencies and industry. While performing these de -conflictions, the IPR Center identified 28 \"blue on blue\" situations where two or more entities were investigating the same target. Finally, the IPR Center referred 371 leads to private industry for follow -up. 23 DOJ and DHS continue to prioritize IP investigations and prosecutions that involve (1) health and safety, (2) trade secret theft or economic espionage, and (3) large -scale commercial counterfeiting and online piracy. They have also increased focus on IP crimes that are committe d or facilitated by use of the Internet or perpetrated by organized criminal networks. The health and safety initiative , under the auspices of ICE -HSI Operations Apothecary, Engine Newity, and Chain Reaction, brings together private, state, and federal enforcement resources to address the proliferation of counterfeit goods posing a danger to consumers, including counterfeit and illegally prescribed pharmaceuticals, automotive parts, and military goods.49 In response to the increasing and evolving threat posed by COVID -19-related fraud and criminal activity, HSI launched Operation Stolen Promise in April 2020. Operation Stolen Promise combines HSI's expertise in global trade, financial fraud, international operations, cyber -crime, and criminal analysis t o investigate financial fraud schemes, the importation of prohibited pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, websites defrauding consumers, and any other illicit criminal activities associated with the virus that compromises legitimate trade or financial systems or endangers the public. As efforts to combat COVID -19 progress, HSI will initiate Operation Stolen Promise 2.0 to focus on counterfeit vaccines, while continuing to investigate the trafficking of counterfeit personal protective equipment. This effort will coincide with INTERPOL's Operation Vigilant Interdiction, which will also primarily focus on combatting counterfeit COVID -19 vaccines. DOJ prosecutors and the FBI have continued to emphasize the investigation and prosecution of commercial and st ate-sponsored trade secret theft. This has led to the investigation and prosecution of numerous trade secret thefts and economic espionage cases.50 DOJ and DHS continue to pursue significant, large -scale piracy and counterfeiting operations.51 Global IP crime, from the manufacture and worldwide distribution of counterfeit goods, to the sprawling online businesses designed to reap profits from the illegal distribution of copyrighted works, continues to grow and change in an effort to stay ahead of law enf orcement. The United States is working actively to develop training and technical assistance programs to assist other countries in effectively enforcing IP laws and reducing the trafficking of counterfeit and pirated goods. Executive Branch agencies, i ncluding DOJ, Commerce, State and Homeland Security have provided training to foreign officials on effective enforcement of IP laws. IP trainings are designed to increase cooperation between various law enforcement agencies with responsibility for IP offe nses; to utilize various types of charges, including economic and organized crime statutes to combat IP crime; and to increase awareness amongst enforcement officials and the judiciary of the importance of reducing counterfeiting and piracy.52 49 See Appendix (Department of Justice) for FY 2020 significant prosecutions . 50 See Appendix (Department of Justice) for FY 2020 significant prosecutions . 51 See Appendix (Department of Justice) for FY 2020 significant prosecutions. 52 See Appendices for detailed examples on U.S. Government training and capacity building programs 24 ICE-HSI At tach\u00e9s establish strong working relationships with host country counterparts. These relationships strengthen ICE's capacity to conduct successful domestic, international, and multilateral operations. ICE -HSI Attach\u00e9s are located in over 50 countries. DOJ, in coordination with other federal investigatory agencies, is working with the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center to provide data to the Center to address intelligence gaps as they relate to IP. The Center has provided operational, intelligence, and financial support to investigations where international organized crime groups are involved in IP offenses. The U.S. Transnational and High Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement Network , which features International Computer Ha cking and Intellectual Property (ICHIP) advisors , Global Cyber Forensics Advisors and long term agent mentors, funded by the Department of State and jointly managed with the Department of Justice, is improving the effectiveness of U.S. personnel serving ab road by training foreign prosecutors, judges , customs and border officials, and police.53 Such training has resulted in multiple overseas prosecutions of trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy. The program first created under the Bush Administration in 2006 with a single office in Thailand, has now been expanded under the Trump Administration with the United States now deploying twelve ICHIPs (one funded by DOJ) working collaboratively within and across their regions to mitigate threats to IP protec tions, including those involving transnational organized crime. In addition to two ICHIPs who are deployed in Washington DC, ICHIPs are stationed in (1) Hong Kong, China SAR; (2) S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; (3) Bucharest, Romania; (4) Bangkok, Thailand; (5) Abuja, Nigeria; (6) Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ; (7) The Hague, Netherlands; (8) Zagreb, Croatia; (9) Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; and (10) Panama City, Panama. As one example of the impact of the ICHIP program, long- term assistance provided by the S\u00e3o Paulo -based ICHIP led to the creation of a multi- stakeholder group of S\u00e3o Paulo officials, U.S. rights -holders, and Brazilian police . Under the ICHIP's mentorship, since the inception of the program, the group has had significant operational successes, including seizing approximately 3,842 tons worth of counterfeit goods worth over $300 million USD, and a recent seizure of 1,100 pirate internet protocol television ( IPTV) boxes from 27 stores at Santa Efig\u00eania mall in S\u00e3o Paulo. The IPTV boxes contained pirated films and series as well as applications that facilitate illicit streaming of premium channels. The Sao Paulo operations have served as a model for ways to partner in targeting transnational criminal organizations. The IPR Center's Operation Team Player targets the sale and trafficking of counterfeit sports merchandise, apparel and tickets. On January 25 - February 3, 2020, Operation Team Player enforcemen t operations targeted the importation and trafficking of counterfeit sports merchandise and media activities related to Super Bowl LIIV. The operations were conducted by teams comprised of HSI Miami, HSI Tampa, IPR Center representatives, Miami Dade Polic e Department, and representatives from the National Football League. As a result of these efforts, 53 Global Cyber and Intellectual Property Crimes, U.S. Department of Justice - https://www.justice.gov/criminal - opdat/global -cyber -and-intellectual -property -crimes 25 task force officers arrested 6 individuals and seized approximately 2,884 items with an estimated MSRP value of $6,354,589. Also, in 2018 Congress considered and passed the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention (STOP) Act, which the President signed into law on October 24, 2018. While the STOP Act is focused on stopping the importation of dangerous synthetic drugs thr ough the mail, the Act's provisions - which require the collection of advance electronic information from postal international shippers, and provide for the reimbursement of costs that the U.S. Postal Service and CBP incur in their processing of inbound ex press mail service - will also assist CBP in identifying counterfeit shipments and preventing them from entering US commerce. The protection of intellectual property is especially critical for maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this digital age. As the Administration explained in the National Cyber Strategy that the White House issued on September 20, 2018, \"[f]ostering and protecting American invention and innovation is critical to maintaining the United States' strategic advantage in cyberspace\": \"Strong intellectual property protections ensure continued economic growth and innovation in the digital age. The United States Government has fostered and will continue to help foster a global intellectual property rights system that provides incentives f or innovation through the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights.\"54 Cyber -enabled theft of intellectual property, particularly trade secrets, inflicts a significant cost to the U.S. economy, in addition to the immeasurable harm the theft of IP may cause individual companies. The Administration is committed to combatting the cyber -enabled theft of trade secrets and other confidential business information. As the National Cyber Strategy states : \"The United States Government will also promote protection of sensitive emerging technologies and trade secrets, and we will work to prevent adversarial nation states from gaining unfair advantage at the expense of American research and development. . . . For more than a decade, malicious actors have conducted cyber intrusions into United States commercial networks, targeting confidential business information held by American firms. Malicious cyber actors from other nations have stolen troves of trade secrets, technical data, and sensitive proprietary internal communications. The United States Government will work against the illicit appropriation of public and private sector technology and technical knowledge by foreign competitors, while maintaining an investor -friendly climate.\"55 The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security are committed to aggressively investigating and prosecuting individuals and corporations who undermine American competitiveness by stealing what they did not themselves create and continues to focus its investigative and prosecutorial efforts on combatting the theft of the trade secrets of U.S. businesses. 54 White House, National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America (September 2018) (page 16) - https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp -content/uploads/2018/09/National -Cyber -Strategy.pdf 55 Id. (pages 16- 17) 26 On November 1, 2018, the Attorney General announced the creation of a China Initiative led by the National Security Division's Assistant Attorney General, and composed of a senior FBI executive, five United States Attorneys, and several other Department of Justice leaders and officials, including the Criminal Division's Assistant Attorney General. As th e Attorney General explained, \"[t]his Initiative will identify priority Chinese trade theft cases, ensure that we have enough resources dedicated to them, and make sure that we bring them to an appropriate conclusion quickly and effectively.\"56 During the past year, the Department of Justice brought several prosecutions for trade secret theft, including the following cases. (In addition, the Justice Department has recently issued an overview of the China Initiative.57) On October 4, 2019, the Justice Depa rtment announced that an Italian national was arrested in Marino, Italy pursuant to a provisional arrest request from the United States in a case invol ving two defendants who were charged in the U.S. with conspiring to steal trade secrets from an American aviation company. A federal grand jury indicted the pair on Sept. 11 with conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets and a ttempted theft of trade secrets. Accord ing to the indictment, one of the defendants was an employee of a Russian state- owned company and had previously been a Russian public official whose service included the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , while the other was a former director an Italian aerospace company.58 On November 12, 2019, the Justice Department announced that a C hinese national and U.S. legal permanent resident, pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court to committing theft of trade secrets from his employer, a U.S. petroleum company. The defendant stole the information from a U.S. - based petroleum company regarding the manufacture of a \"research and development downstream energy market product\" that is worth more than $1 billion.59 On November 21, 2019, the Justice Department announced that a Chinese national was indicted by a federal grand jury on one count of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, three counts 56 Press Release: Attorney General Jeff Sessions Announce s New Initiative to Combat Chinese Economic Espionage \" (November 1, 2018) - https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/atto rney- general -jeff-sessions- announces See also \"Attorney General Jeff Session's China Initiative Fact Sheet \" (November 1, 2018) - https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/file/1107256/download; \" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C.

The indictment alleges another example o f the Chinese government using Talent Plans to encourage employees to steal intellectual property from their U.S. employers . The defendant promoted himself to the Chinese government based on his experience at Monsanto. Within a year of being selected as a Talent Plan recruit, he quit his job, bought a one-way ticket to China, and was caught at the airport with a copy of the company's proprietary algorithm.60 On February 10, 2020, the Justice Department announced the indictment of four members of the Chine se Peo ple's Liberation Army (PLA) for allegedly hacking into the computer systems of the credit reporting agency Equifax and stealing Americans' personal data and Equifax's valuable trade secrets. According to the indictment, the defendants exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts Web Framework software used by Eq uifax's online dispute portal. The indictment also charges the defendants with stealing trade secret information, namely Equifax's data compilations and database designs.61 On February 11, 2020, the Justice Department announced that t he head of a Houston- based company that was the subsidiary of a Chinese company that developed stolen trade secrets was sentenced to 16 months in prison and ordered to forfeit more than $330,000. The Court made clear that the defendant knew or intended that the offense would benefit the People's Republic of China.62 On February 13, 2020 the Justice Department announced charges , via a superseding indictment, against Chinese telecommunications conglomerate Hua wei and subsidiaries for racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets. According to the government's independent investigation in the case and review of court filings, the new charges in this case relate to the alleged decades -long effort s by Huawei, and several of its subsidiaries, both in the U.S. and in the People's Republic of China, to misappropriate intellectual property, including from six U.S. technology companies, in an effort to grow and operate Huawei's business. The misappropr iated intellectual property included trade secret information and copyrighted works, such as source code and user manuals for internet routers, antenna technology and robot testing technology.63 On February 27, 2020, the Justice Department announced that a former associate scientist was sentenced to 24 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to theft of proprietary information worth more than $1 billion from his employer, a U.S. petroleum company.

He subsequently turned in his resignation and was escorted from the premises . Later that day, he returned the thumb drive, claiming that he had forgotten to do so before leaving his employer's property. Upon examination, it was discovered that there was unallocated space on the thumb drive, indicating five documents had previously been deleted. Investigators with the FBI searched the defendant's premises and found an ex ternal hard drive. They discovered that the same five missing files from the thumb drive had been downloaded to the hard drive.64 On June 26, 2020, the Justice Department announced that a Chinese citizen was found guilty of economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and conspiring to commit both offenses . Evidence submitted during the course of the trial demonstrated that the individual conspired to and did steal trade secrets from two semiconductor companies . The judge in the case found that the defendant had intended to steal the trade secrets for the benefit of the People's Republic of China65 On July 21, 2020, the Justice Department announced that a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging two hackers, both nationals and residents of China with hacking into the computer systems of hundreds of victim companies, governments, non- governmental organizations, and individual dissidents, clergy, and democratic and human rights activists in the United States and abroad, including Hong Kong and Chi na. The defendants in some instances acted for their own personal financial gain, and in others for the benefit of the Ministry of State Security (MSS ) or other Chinese government agencies. The hackers stole terabytes of data which comprised a sophistica ted and pr olific threat to U.S. networks. The 11- count indictment alleges that the defendants who were trained in computer applications technologies at the same Chinese university, conducted a hacking campaign lasting more than ten years to the present, targeting companies in countries with high technology industries, including the United States, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, high tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; defense. Mo st recently, the defendants probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks of companies devel oping COVID -19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments.66 On July 30, 2020, the Justice Department announced that a f ormer Ohio woman pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to conspiring to steal scientific trade secrets and conspiring to commit wire fraud concerning the research, identification and treatment of a range of pediatric medical 64 Press Release: Chinese National Sentenced for Stealing Trade Secrets Worth $1 Billion (February 27, Chinese Citizen Convicted of Economic Espionage, Theft of Trade Secrets, and Conspiracy (June 26, 2020) - https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese -citizen -convicted Press Release: Two Chinese Hackers Working with the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaign Targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information, Including COVID -19 Research (July 21, 2020) A ccording to her plea agreement, the defendant conspired to steal and then monetize one of the trade secrets by creating and selling exosome \"isolation kits \" and admitted to starting a company in China to sell the kits.

We will combat the counterfeiting and piracy that destroys American jobs, we will enforce the rules of fair and reciprocal trade that form the foundation of responsible commerce...\" - President Donald J. Trump68 The Trump Administration is working closely with a broad range of U.S. industry stakeholders, covering small, medium and large sized enterprises, to address the full scope of intellectual property policy, enforcement and protection issues. Working together to find new solutions and creative ways to address intellectual property issues is key. That engagement has included training and capacity building programs conducted by Executive Branch agencies with the public. It has also included engagement by the Administration on hot button issues and policy priorities, to develop strategies for action on important areas of intellectual property policy. Throughout 2020, the Administration engaged with a variety of stakeholders in support of enhancing the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. These efforts involved departments and agencies across the Executive Branch, engaging with representatives of the private sector, trade associations, think tanks, academia, and other entities. These discussions also extended to foreign government officials, international governmental instit utions (such as INTERPOL, Europol, and WIPO), and private -sector associations and groups in other countries. In these engagements, the Administration has underscored the importance of domestic and foreign actors undertaking initiatives to promote and reinforce a robust IP environment that reduces counterfeiting, copyright piracy, trade secret theft, and patent infringement, and that provides government agencies, rights holders, and other stakeholders with effective legal tools for addressing these illicit activities. In this regard, the Administration emphasizes, inter alia , the importance of strengthening the \"rule of law\"; of enhancing collaboration (within and between governments, between the public and private sectors, and within the private sector) in combatting illicit activities that undermine the integrity of global supply chains, and thereby in supporting legitimate commerce and trade; and of governments considering the adoption of the \"Whole of Government\" approaches for strengthening the governm ent's effectiveness in IPR protection and enforcement. 68 Remarks by the President on Signing a Memorandum on Addressing China's Laws, Policies, Practices, and Actions Related to Intellectual Property, Innovation, and Technology (August 14, 2017) - https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD -201700571/pdf/DCPD -201700571.pdf 31 Coordinating efforts across the government is critical to successfully tackling IP enforcement. Over the past four years, t he White House has convened a number of roundtables bringing together indust ry representatives, interested stakeholders, Members of Congress, Cabinet and other government officials to examine pressing IP issues impacting our economy to develop new initiatives, examine legislative priorities, and find real world solutions. For exa mple, i n 2018, the White House hosted an IP Roundtable focused on illicit streaming devices (ISDs). During the event, a broad range of stakeholders and government officials came together to examine piracy -enabled set -top boxes or illicit streaming devices that deliver pirated television, movies, and sports, with ease. Global sales and use of ISDs is growing and poses a direct threat to content creators, sports leagues, and live performances, as well as legitimate streaming, on -demand, and over -the-top media service providers. Because of the global nature of the problem, the Administration continues to advocate for increased IPR enforcement efforts with important trading partners across the world. To advance this goal, in fall 2020, ICE, through the HSI -led National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, and the M otion Picture A ssociation (MPA) jointly signed a Memorandum of Understanding aimed at developing comprehensive strategies to coordinate public - and private -sector efforts that disrupt and combat all forms of digital piracy. Through Operation Intangibles, HSI is committed to leading the United States' efforts to stop digital piracy and eliminate a vital source of illicit revenue from transnational criminal organizations.69 In April 2019, President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum (PM) on combating trafficking in counterfeit and pirated goods, specifically in third party online marketplaces.70 The President stated that it is the policy of his Administration to protect American businesses, intellectual property rights holders, consumers, national and economic security, and the American public from the dangers and negative effects of counterfeit and pirated goods, including those that are imported through online third- party marketplaces and other third -party intermediaries. Following the release of the PM, a Cabinet -level White House IP Roundtable took place to discuss challenges rights holders face in addressing the proliferation of counterfeits and pirated goods on e -commerce platforms and the potential harm to consumers who unknowingly purchase illicit goods. Government officials expressed the need for greater information sharing, accountability, and enhanced scrutiny regarding commercial goods being sent to retailers o r distributers from online marketplace sellers. The PM, for the first time, placed a spotlight on counterfeit and pirated hard goods being sold on e-commerce online marketplaces, and looks to address this growing problem. At the direction of the President , the Department of H omeland Security, with input from across the USG, released a report on January 24, 2020 analyzing online third -party marketplaces, examining the illicit goods being trafficked on them, and most important ly, identifying practical soluti ons, best practices, 69 For more information on the Memorandum of Understanding and Operation Intangibles, please see https://www.ice.gov/features/OperationIntangibles . 70 Memorandum on Combating Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods (Apr il 3, 2019) available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential -actions/memorandum -combating -trafficking -counterfeit -pirated -goods/ . 32 and potential legislative and administrative changes that will address this important problem. In conjunction with the release of the report, on January 31, 2020, the President issued Executive Order 13904 on \"Ensuring Safe and Lawful E-Commerce for the United States Consumers, Businesses, Government Supply Chains , and Intellectual Property Rights Holders.\" In furtherance of the aims of the report, on October 13, 2020, President Trump issued a Memorandum on \" Stopping Counterfeit Trafficking on E -Commerce Platforms Through Fines and Civil Penalties .\" The Memorandum reinforces the importance that the Administration places on countering trafficking in counterfeit goods. It says \"trafficking in counterfeit goods infringes on the int ellectual property rights of American companies, undermines their competitiveness, and harms American workers. Counterfeit trafficking also poses significant health and safety threats to online consumers. E -commerce platforms serve as key contributors to counterfeit trafficking by acting as intermediaries and providing marketplaces t hat match up buyers and sellers.\" The Memorandum instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and in consultati on with the Attorney General to consider taking all appropriate actions to seize counterfeit goods imported into the United States in connection with a transaction on an e -commerce platform and impose the maximum fines and civil penalties permitted by law on any e -commerce platform that directs, assists with, or is in any way concerned in the importation into the Unit ed States of counterfeit goods and to develop a legislative proposal to promote the policy objectives of the memorandum.71 The intellectual property issues surrounding the online sale of goods and services are well - documented. Many stakeholders, including online sales platforms, payment processing companies and advertising networks, have formed collaborative partnerships to address these conc erns, while encouraging innovation in the digital environment. Still, certain issues remain outstanding, and rapid advances in internet -enabled commerce - including entirely new business models - have brought new problems that need to be addressed. The A dministration continues to seek the input of key stakeholders to help develop new partnerships and creative solutions for addressing outstanding IPR -related issues in the e -commerce and social media space, and will continue expanding its efforts in the fut ure. The Commerce Department's IP Attach\u00e9 program, established during the Bush Administration and operated by the USPTO, continues to promote U.S. economic interests and further U.S. Government IP policy abroad. The IP Attach\u00e9 program helps secure high s tandards in international agreements and host country laws and encourages effective IP protection by U.S.- trading partners for the benefit of U.S. stakeholders. IP Attach\u00e9s engage regularly with the private sector and other stakeholders to understand thei r concerns and develop strategies to address them. Their work includes: raising issues with foreign government officials; providing training on IP law, enforcement, and administration; conducting public awareness programs; and 71 Memorandum on Stopping Counterfeit Trafficking on E -Commerce Platforms Through Fines and Civil Penalties (October 13, 2020) available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential -actions/memorandum -stopping- counterfeit -trafficking -e-commerce- platforms and explaining U.S. G overnment positions. The Attach\u00e9s also help U.S. stakeholders enter foreign markets and conduct business abroad. They inform U.S. stakeholders about foreign laws, policies and regulations and provide assistance in protecting and enforcing their IP ri ghts. Attach\u00e9s serve at U.S. missions throughout the world, including in China, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Belgium, India, Thailand, Kuwait, Ukraine and Switzerland. In 2020, the Global IP Academy (GIPA) at the USPTO continued to provide IP education programming, a distance learning program for U.S. small- and-medium businesses ( SMEs), including a continuing quarterly webinar initiative to provide comprehensive IP education to awardees of the Small Business Administration's SBIR -STTR programs, as well as IP education programming for domestic attorneys general, and webinars. Additionally, GIPA produces and hosts free IPR e- Learning modules that are available to the public. This content covers six different areas of intellectual pro perty, and is available in five languages: Arabic, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. These on -demand , the e -learning products have drawn more than 148,600 unique views since content was made available in 2010. During FY 20, the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration (ITA) - with the support of many USG agencies - completed 3 in -person STOPfakes.gov Roadshows in Newark, Sacramento, and San Jose . STOPfakes also began offering virtual content in August 2020 with ten webinars taking place between August 25 and October 13, 2020. These events , which have given increased attention to SMEs, deliver critically important information about intellectual property to audiences that need it most - start -ups, entrepreneurs, small and medium- sized businesses, independent creators, and inventors. To increase enforcement cooperation and raise awareness about IP theft, the Department of Homeland Security's IPR Center continued to conduct international outreach and training events. During 2020, the IPR Center conducted 78 such events. The State Department and the USPTO have also conducted in -person training programs and updated distance -learning IP training to prepare Foreign Service Officers embarking on overseas assign ments on the fundamentals of intellectual property, U.S. G overnment positions on current debates such as access -to-medicines, and U.S. industry priorities. As a result, these U.S. officials are better equipped to advocate for U.S. rights -holders overseas; provide useful field reporting to inform interagency discussions and deliberations regarding the Special 301 Annual Report to Congress, Notorious Markets, and other IP -related reports and policy discussions; and articulate U.S. G overnment policy positions in bilateral discussions and in international fora. The Administration also continues to examine opportunities to engage with stakeholders on important areas of IP policy, that includes existing industry -led voluntary initiatives to protect American in tellectual property, and new areas for greater cooperation. IPEC and other Cabinet - level Departments continue to engage with stakeholders, develop new initiatives, examine legislative priorities, and find creative solutions. As we look forward, we will build on past roundtables and look to examine new areas of importance to the U.S. economy, stakeholders , and policymakers. 34 The Trump Administration has developed a new 3 -year Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement , which was issued on November 9, 2020.72 The Joint Strategic Plan, developed by the Office of the U.S. Intellectual Propert y Enforcement Coordinator, brings together the combined and coordinated efforts of the White House, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security, State, Treasury, Defense, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the U.S. Copyright Office with valuable input from the public and interested stakeholders . 73 The Administration continue s to engage with stakeholders on these and other important intellectual property issues to ensure that we are promoting and protecting American creativity and innovation. 72 Press Release: Administration Issues Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Pr operty (November 9, https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp -content/uploads/2020/11/IPEC -Joint - Strategic -Plan.pdf . 73 On Sept ember 13, 2018, the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator issued a Federal Register notice requesting public comments for the developmen t of Joint Strategic Plan.

So come to Ameri ca, where you can innovate, create, and build. I believe in America. As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like the leaders of other countries should put their country first also. But America first does not mean Americ a alone. When the United States grows, so does the world. American prosperity has created countless jobs all around the globe, and the drive for excellence, creativity, and innovation in the U.S. has led to important discoveries that help people everywhe re live more prosperous and far healthier lives.\" - President Donald J. Trump74 Promoting strong intellectual property and innovation in the United States will be key to our nation's continued economic competitiveness in the decades to come. To grow our economy, drive innovation, protect American IP, and put America first will require not only effective coordination efforts within the United States G overnment , but working together with Congress, the private sector, and the public. We must all work cooperatively to ensure that the United States' overall intellectual property strategy takes into account both domestic and international policy and its effect. We should no longer view an action taken in one arena as separate from others. The work that the United States does to keep our intellectual property laws modernized and up to date domestically, and the way these laws are enforced, has an effect on international discussions and negotiations. And the actions that trading partners and competi tors take overseas has a direct effect on the value of American IP, job creation and growth in the United States. The Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC) works to promote innovation and creativity by ensuring effective intellectual property protection and enforcement, domestically and abroad. We must work to address intellectual property issues, including protection and enforcement, at their source. We must also work with like -minded nations to ensure that foreign entities that engage in intellectual property theft are no longer able to profit from their ill- gotten gains. President Trump and his Administration are making clear that America's intellectual property policies must be coordinated effectively, and include an even broader range of Executive Branch agencies, and stakeholders. 74 Remarks by President Trump at the World Economic Forum (January 26, 2018) - https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings -statements/remarks -president -trump -world -economic- forum/ 36 As part of the Trump Administration's approach we recognize that we must change the paradigm. Of course, the United States will continue to build upon past work to continue programs and polic ies that are working well. And we are ensur ing that the United States' efforts are focused and well -coordinated and that resources are being used effectively and efficiently. But there are clearly approaches that have failed to bear fruit. And , in those areas that are not working, or achieving meaningful results, we must regularly ask ourselves \"what can we do differently?\" The road that we take will define the course of freedom, innovation, and prosperity - for decades to come. And that is why we must be committed to advancing pro- growth policies to protect our continued economic and innovative competitiveness, promote new engines of growth, and prioritize America's innovative and creative capacity. 37 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY : FACTS AND STATS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THE ECONOMY : In 2014, DOC (2016) designated 81 industries (out of 313 total, more than 25 percent) as IP-intensive in 2014, collectively accounting for $6.6 trillion value added in 2014, or 38.2 percent of U.S. GDP. IP -intensive industries directly accounted for 27.9 million jobs and indirectly supported an additional 17.6 million jobs, representing almost one in three jobs in the United States. IP -intensive industries also pay well; compared to non- IP intensive industries, workers in IP -intensive industries earn 46 percent highe r weekly wages .75 The Department of Commerce reported that technological innovation is linked to roughly three- quarters of U.S. growth since the mid- 1940s.76 Trademark -intensive industries accounted for 23.7 million jobs in 2014; copyright - intensive industri es accounted for 5.6 million jobs in 2014; and patent -intensive industries accounted for 3.9 million jobs.77 In 2014, workers in IP industries received an average weekly wage of $1,312, compared to a weekly average of $896 in non- IP-intensive industries; a 46 percent difference.78 Share of workers in IP industries with a bachelor's degree or higher fell from 42.4 percent in 2010 to 39.8 percent in 2015, while the share of workers with a bachelor's degree or higher in non- IP industries increased from 34.2 percent in 2010 to 38.9 percent in 2015.79 Merchandise exports of IP industries grew to $842 billion in 2014, up from $775 billion in 2010; an 8.6 percent increase.80 Exports of service -providing IP industries totaled nearly $81 billion in 2012, which accoun ted for about 12.3 percent of total U.S. private services exported that year.81 Investment in intellectual property products now accounts for about one -third of U.S. private nonresidential fixed investment, and as such, trade agreements that enhance interna tional protection of intellectual property \u2014such as the United States -Mexico - Canada Agreement and Phase I of U.S. -China negotiations \u2014could also elevate the level of innovation and productivity growth.82 75 U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and Economics and Statistics Administration (2016).

The high -end estimate is $540 billion, amounting to 3% of GDP. 86 In fiscal year 2019, CBP reported processing $2.7 trillion in imports, including approximately 1.8 million small packages per day sent via international mail and express carriers. CBP also reported seizing counterfeit goods with a total manufacturer's suggested retail pr ice of up to $1.5 billion if the goods had been authentic.87 In 2019, CBP reports that $1.03 billion (66 percent) of seized goods originated in China and $397.3 million (26 percent) originated in Hong Kong.88 According to CBP, criminal organizations are shi pping illicit goods, including counterfeits, into the United States via small packages due to a perceived lower risk of detection and less severe consequences if a package is stopped. CBP also reported in FY 2019 that e -commerce sales had contributed to a n increased volume of small packages imported in the United States, including approximately 600 million international mail and express carrier shipments. Further, CBP reported that from FY 2013 - FY 2019, it completed a total of about 203,000 IPR seizures, almost 90 percent of which occurred in the international mail.89 83 OECD -EUIPO. 2019. \"Trends in Trade Commission. 2017. \"Update to the Report of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.\" 86 IP Commission. 2017. \"Update to the Report of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.\" http://www.ipcommission.org/report/IP_Commission_Report_Update_2017.pdf 87 GAO, Report to the Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate: CBP Has Taken Steps to Combat Counter feit Goods in Small Packages but Could Streamline Enforcement (2020), p.6, available at: https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/709639.pdf 88 U.S Customs and Border Protection Office of Trade (2019).

USDA's main goal is to ensure GI protections do not disadvantage U.S. producers by unfairly granting protection to products with common names, which could ultimately result in a loss of market access. During FY 2020, US DA engaged at the most senior levels with key foreign country counterparts to emphasize concerns and counter harmful GI policies, such as those of the European Union (EU), emphasizing transparency, adherence to internationally recognized standards, seeking an opportunity to comment on any proposed GIs through comment period and requesting the countries be fair in the evaluations. USDA engaged with a number of countries that were negotiating Free Trade Agreements ( FTAs ) with the EU - including M orocco , and the MERCOSUR countries - to raise the importance of preserving common terms for food products. Consortium for Common Food Names Activities S upported by USDA The information below represents notable actions taken by the Consortium for Common Food Names (CCFN) , thanks to support provided by the USDA Global Based Initiative on Common Food Names throughout Fiscal Year 2020 to date. Each item listed supports work to preserve U.S. exporters' rights to use common food names. The U.S. Dairy Export Council (US DEC), on behalf of a number U.S. agricultural associations including the U.S. Meat Export Federation and California Wine Institute, led a USDA Market Access Program -funded project to monitor and combat Geographical Indications (GI) -related trade restrictio ns. USDEC has received $200,000 annually since 2013 that help support this effort through CCFN. During FY 2020, CCFN monitored activities and alerted trade officials in the United States and key nations about EU free -trade negotiation concerns. CCFN f iled oppositions to 12 problematic cheese and meat geographical indications (GI) registrations published Page 4 of 177 during the EU -Australia FTA negotiations. At the end of 2019, CCFN secured favorable rulings to the oppositions filed during the China -EU FTA negotiat ions and publications of the 100 for 100 list so \"mozzarella ,\" \"pecorino ,\" \"parmesan,\" \"prosciutto,\" and \"pecorino\" will be free to use. In June 2020, CCFN worked with existing producers and exporters of GI cheeses to Mercosur to submit affidavits to Arg entine, Brazilian, Paraguayan and Uruguayan authorities, attesting prior use of targeted terms scheduled to be restricted by the EU - Mercosur FTA. Prior to that, CCFN successfully led oppositions that resulted in generic usage assurances for \"brie,\" \"camem ,\" \"salami\" the text of the EU - Mercosur FTA. CCFN builds relationships with officials of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), succes sfully becoming an official Observer to WIPO committees, events and policies, and raised awareness in foreign markets about the potential trade barriers that GIs may pose to local industries and trading partners. In November 2019, project partners present ed to officials from six CAFTA -DR countries, the importance of safeguarding common food names and use of regulatory and policy tools to provide concrete guidelines to determine a term's genericism. In FY 2020 CCFN filed comments on the Vietnamese Tradema rk and GI law; the European Commission's roadmap on the evaluation of EU Quality schemes -specifically on lack of clarity on generic terms, scope of protection, and lack of transparency for the GI application and opposition processes ; China's proposed Guide on determining generic names ; New Zealand -EU FTA IP Chapter; and Brazil's GI law public consultation. CCFN also secured favorable rulings : a trademark previously registered in Brazil for \"asiago\" was cancelled ; China's IP office clarified that two trademark applications that contained words similar to \"bologna\" would not prohibit use of the term \"bologna\" ; the highest Guatemalan court ruled that the term \"parmesano\" is and will remain generic; and the Australian IP cour t refused the registration of \"gorgonzola\" and \"asiago trademarks. Plant Variety Protection USDA plant variety protection certificates are recognized worldwide and expedite foreign plant variety protection application filing. The Plant Variety Protection Office (PVPO) of USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) works actively with members of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants to promote cooperation on the standards for variety examination. Once plant variety protecti on is granted, the certificate owners have exclusive legal rights to market and to exclude others from selling their varieties. This legal protection for breeders and inventors promotes the development of new varieties that can increase yield and crop productivity, increase farmer income, and expand trade opportunities. Other benefits of plant variety protection include provisional protection upon application receipt, priority when filing in another country, user -friendly filing without the need for an at torney, no annual maintenance fees, and applicant -conducted field trials. Page 5 of 177 USDA Plant Variety Protection Activities in FY 2020 The final rule was published on January 6, 2020, to add asexually reproduced varieties to the program, and to simplify the fee schedule. With the addition of asexually reproduced varieties, the program will provide plant variety protection certificates for sexually propagated, tuber propagated, and asexually reproduced varieties. This provides the seed and horticulture industry with additional options to protect their new varieties of plants. The PVPO staff provided four webinars on the program, electronic Plant Variety Protection system, and examination procedures to participants from the European Union, China, AmericanHort, Americ an Seed Trade Association, and other plant protection stakeholders. The webinars highlighted the benefits of the electronic system, an overview of PVPO examination procedures, and how the addition of asexually reproduced varieties will be managed by the program. The PVPO has received ten asexually reproduced variety applications including hemp, raspberry, blackberry, apple, calibrachoa, magnolia, grapevine, and orange. The PVPO is continuing to work with ASTA and other seed and vegetative industry stakeholders on International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants explanatory notes and molecular methods of analysis for select crops that can be used as supporting data in plant variety examinations. New members were appointed to the PVP Board on September 30, 2020. The Board consists of 14 members representing farmers, the seed industry, trade and professional associations, and public and private institutions involved with developing new plant varieties. Members of the Plant Variety Protection Board provide oversight and guidance to the program on plant variety protection issues. AMS provides intellectual property rights protection through the PVPO, which protects breeders of varieties of seed and tuber (potatoes) propagated plants, and asexua lly reproduced plants; that are new, distinct, uniform, and stable. Authorized by the Plant Variety Protection Act, the PVPO examines new variety characteristics to grant certificates that protect varieties for 20 years (25 years for vines and trees). The Agricultural Research Service's Protection of USDA's own I ntellectual P roperty USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has a comprehensive program to protect U .S. Government -owned intellectual property ( IP). In addition to IP protection, ARS delivers a comprehensive training program on IP. The program has four components: (1) training scientists on DURC (Dual Use Research of Concern), TT (Technology Transfer) and insiders' threat s; (2) training TT Staff on U.S. Department of Commerce regulations ; (3) Export Control Reviews ; and (4) entrance and exit procedures for agency employees to minimize insider threats . Page 6 of 177 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Page 7 of 177 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Department of Commerce Appendix for FY 20 20 Annual Report This appendix discusses the FY 2020 activities of the Commerce Department, through the Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP), the International Trade Administration (ITA), the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and the U.S. Pate nt and Trademark Office (USPTO) . The Commerce Department continues to engage in training and capacity building programs to strengthen intellectual property awareness and enforcement internationally. Additionally, the USPTO provides many different patent and trademark capacity building programs as fully described in our TRIPS Article 67 report each year, and the following highlights some enforcement activities during FY 2020. COMMERCIAL LAW DEVEL OPMENT PROGRAM The Commerce Department's Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) creates a level playing field for U.S. firms overseas, in particular by building the capacity of foreign countries to improve the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR). As the Office of General Counsel's technical assistance arm, CLDP upholds the Department of Commerce's mission, as stated in its 2018 -2022 strategic plan to \"Accelerate American Leadership.\" Strategic Objective 1.3 is: \" Strengthen Intellectual Property Protection\" and one of the strategies listed in the plan to do so is to \"strengthen the protection of intellectual property\" abroad. CLDP helps enforce IPR overseas through two types of technical assistance programs: programs that help countries develop an effective IPR enforcem ent environment, and programs that help countries create their own intellectual property, which gives them a vested interest in enforcing IPR. Conducted in close cooperation with the USPTO, other Commerce bureaus, USTR, and other Federal agencies, CLDP' s activities usually include consultations, seminars, workshops, and meetings. Starting in March 2020, in light of the public health situation ( COVID -19) and of the resulting impossibility to travel overseas, CLDP suspended its traditional activities, mo st of which took place overseas and conducted, instead , online video- conferences and webinars. At the suggestion of USPTO/GIPA's Director, GIPA and CLDP created an \"IP eLearning Community of Practice\" that has been effective in sharing lessons learned by both institutions as they conducted virtual programs. In FY 2020, CLDP IP activities were conducted for the following countries: Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kosovo, Mali, Morocco, Pakistan, and Tunisia. Page 8 of 177 As outlined below, CLDP's FY 2020 activities mainly fell into three categories: Judicial Capacity Building in IPR Enforcement; Capacity Building for Institutions that Enforce IPR; and Development of Innovation Ecosystems, in particular through Technology Transfer. I. OVERVIEW OF CLDP' s FY 2020 IP PROGRAMS The following are notable CLDP programs during FY 2020 (more detailed descriptions are presented in section II below). Judicial Capacity Building in IPR Enforcement Pakistan: -Meetings with select judges to discuss IP rights enforcement matters, November 2019 Capacity Building for Institutions that Enforce IPR Afghanistan: Webinar on Trademark Registration On August 11, CLDP, in close cooperation with USPTO and Afghanistan's Central Business Registry for Intellectual Property (ACBR -IP), hosted a webinar to discuss the operations and challenges facing ACBR -IP with a focus on trademark registration. Afghan senior management provided an overview of the Trademark Directory (TMD) and its operating environment, rules and reg ulations, authorities and operations, organizational chart, and the trademark registration process. The presentation included a self -assessment of the TMD's strengths and weaknesses, which prompted a full discussion of challenges and opportunities as it se eks to improve its operations and enhance the transparency and effectiveness of trademark examination and registration in Afghanistan. This was the first in a series of planned webinars to address key aspects of trademark examination and registration, incl uding distinctiveness, likelihood of confusion, well -known marks, bad faith applications, non- traditional marks, trade dress, geographic descriptiveness, certification, and appeal, opposition, and cancellation proceedings. This activity is the result of a concerted effort between CLDP and USPTO to focus on trademark as the area of IP law and enforcement having the most direct and tangible impact of the general consumer public (e.g., brand equating to quality, health, and safety), as well as creating value within the private business sector. Webinar on Trademark Distinctiveness On August 25- 26, CLDP, in cooperation with USPTO, conducted a webinar for Afghanistan's Central Business Registry Trademark Directorate on the concept of \"distinctiveness\" in the examination of a trademark (TM) application. The first day of the program explored the legal underpinnings of TM law, including the Paris Convention, the Afghanistan TM Registration Law, the U.S. Lanham Act, what constitutes a good TM, and the seven -factor U. S. test for determining distinctiveness. The second day focused on additional considerations for Page 9 of 177 distinctiveness, generic terms, deceptive mis -description, acquired distinctiveness, and disclaimers. Case studies and hands -on exercises honed the analytical skills of the Afghan examiners. Future webinars will explore additional topics in TM application, including likelihood of confusion, well -known marks, bad faith applications, non- traditional marks, trade dress, geographic descriptiveness, certification, an d appeal, opposition and cancellation proceedings. Enhancing the knowledge and analytical skills of the Afghan TM examiners will have a direct and tangible impact for the general consumer public (e.g., brand equating quality, health, and safety), as well as create value in the private business sector. Trademark Webinar on Likelihood of Confusion On September 15th, CLDP, in cooperation with USPTO, conducted the first of two webinars for Afghanistan's Central Business Registry Trademark Directorate (TMD) on the concept of \"likelihood of confusion\" in the examination of a trademark application. This first session examined the concept as defined in the U.S. Lanham Act, discussed the initial search actions to be taken by an examiner, and the multi -point U.S. test (known as the DuPont factors) for determining the likelihood of confusion between two marks. Case examples highlighted and examined the application of the DuPont factors. Afghan officials actively participated in the discussion and raised questions re lated to past and current issues before the TMD. Increasing the analytical skills of the Afghan examiners will have a direct and tangible impact on the general consumer public (e.g., brand equating to quality, health, and safety), as well as create value within the private business sector. Georgia : Webinar Series on Intellectual Property Essentials In Georgia, CLDP leads a multi- year project that aims to build the capacity of public sector institutions and private sector stakeholders to protect and enfor ce IPR. The Georgian National Intellectual Property Center 'Sakpatenti' has been the main beneficiary of CLDP technical assistance on IPR, but CLDP has also provided support to the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development, the Georgian Copyright Association, the Georgian Innovation and Technology Agency, the European Law Students Association, Georgian judges, IP specialists, and IP right holders. Over the course of the project, CLDP has organized and led IPR awareness workshops for Georgian journali sts, trained Georgian law students through an IP summer school, and trained Georgian IP specialists to properly analyze complex copyright, trademark, and patent issues. CLDP has also helped to coordinate interagency responses to issues of IPR and helped to raise public and business awareness of the importance of IPR. Due to travel restrictions related to COVID -19, CLDP partnered with USPTO and the USPTO Global Intellectual Property Academy (GIPA) on a series of virtual trainings on intellectual property to be delivered to the staff of the National Intellectual Property Center of Georgia in fall 2020. Topics for the training series include trade secret protection, telework practices and procedures, and overviews of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The training series includes virtual discussion sessions on each topic as well as related digitally recorded training videos for asynchronous learning. Digitally recorded training Page 10 of 177 sessions were delivered to the Nation al Intellectual Property Center in September 2020 and live discussion sessions are scheduled to be held on October 5, October 14, and November 3.

DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF PROGRAMS The following are more detailed descriptions of these FY 2020 CLDP programs Judicial Capacity Building in IPR Enforcement Pakistan: Meetings with Judges to Discuss IPR Enforcement On November 19, 2019, CLDP met with four members of the judiciary who adjudicate cases involving IP issues, and have participated in a series of IP workshops specifically conducted for judges identified as likely to be appointed to IP Tribunals in the near future. The judges discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the CLDP programs, as well as their views and opinions on the current state of the judiciary regarding adjudication of cases involving IP matters. Ambiguities in the existing law (IPO Act of 2 012) regarding the IP Tribunals were discussed, including actions under consideration to clarify and strengthen the role of the Tribunals. The judges were highly supportive of IP awareness programs and urged that such programs continue and be targeted to multiple audiences , including government officials (e.g., Ministry of Commerce) . They advocated for 8 -10 judges to be trained specifically on IP and form the pool of judges to hear such cases (e.g., various Tribunals, Appellate Court, High Court); they al so suggested that a letter be sent to the High Court requesting/recommending training on IP matters. As a result of this meeting, CLDP will conduct a series of IP Judicial Workshops for judges newly appointed to IP Tribunals and for other select judges adjudicating cases involving IP matters at the D&S, appellate, and High Court levels. Capacity Building for Institutions that Enforce IPR Kosovo: Webinar for Kosovo Customs Page 12 of 177 On May 14, 2020, CLDP, in coordination with experts from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, held a webinar for Kosovo customs officials on international best practices for combating counterfeit products. Technical assistance on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) enforcement is instrumental in developing Kosovo's economy and protecting U.S. business interests abroad. Mali: Fighting the Counterfeiting of Products A ffecting Public Health In late 2019, CLDP partnered with Malian stakeholders to raise awareness of the danger of counterfeits and to showcase how to best combat counterfeiting. Working with CLDP were: Mali's Customs, Mali's Intellectual Property Office (CEMAPI), Mali's Copyright Office (BUMDA) as well as representatives from ministries of Agriculture and Health. The Mali stakeholders and CLDP created and launched a national campaign, including culturally appropriate marketing material including Public Service Announcements, brochures, billboards, radio and television interviews. CLDP also helped develop and implement a national database administered jointly by Mali's Customs, Mali's Intellectual Property Office (CEMAPI) and Mali's Copyright Office (BUMDA). Producers and importers can register authenticated products in this database to facilitate the seizure of counterfeited products. This effort is part of a multi- year, Mali -wide, joint effort with the USAID mission in Mali to implement innovative solutions for combatting the counterfeiting of p roducts affecting public health, with a particular focus on agro- inputs. The goal of the project was to successfully address the counterfeiting problem , which is becoming endemic in Mali (as in other parts of West Africa) as under -resourced regulatory bodies struggle to adequately thwart the flood of fakes into the market. This effort built upon past CLDP programs to fight counterfeited products, including extensive training of enforcement authorities including Mali's Customs, the judiciary, and law enfor cement agencies, as well as consumer education programs. Pakistan : Discussion of Technical Assistance for IPR Enforcement On November 12, 14, and 18, 2019, CLDP held meetings in Islamabad and Karachi to assess technical assistance needs in various areas relating to commerce, including intellectual property rights enforcement. Representatives of the following organizations took part in these meetings: Pakistan Customs' National Targeting Center (NTC): NTC noted its working relationship with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enforcement arm Customs and Border Protection (CBP), as well as with DHS' investigative arm Homeland Security Investigations ( HSI). NTC's Director Asad noted that DHS National Targeting Center is currently providing s oftware to Pakistan's NTC to support data analysis, and asked CLDP to consider providing technical assistance to NTC on IP rights enforcement, noting Page 13 of 177 that such training could be merged with CLDP programing for Pakistan Customs' IPR Enforcement D ivision (IPRE). Pakistan's Intellectual Property Organization (IPO) : IPO provided an update regarding proposed revisions to the existing IP laws of Pakistan. IPO discussed that with the reconstitution of the IP Policy Board (IPPB), the Ministry of Commerce (MoC, the sponsoring ministry for the proposed legislative updates) sent the proposed changes to IPPB for its review/approval and forwarding for Cabinet -level review prior to entering the legislative process. No expected timing of this process was offered. CLDP reminded IPO that CLDP/USPTO \"stand ready\" to provide support, if requested by IPO, to assist IPO in explaining the proposed updates/amendments and answering questions arising during the legislative process. IPO discussed training needs for its patent and trademark examiners. IPO mentioned its problems retaining trained staff and is considering changes to its employment terms to include increased service obligations possibly attaching after education and training provided by or through IPO. CLDP noted that the movement of trained and experienced employees from the public to private sector, while inconvenient for the government, is beneficial to the overall environment of securing intellectual property rights and enforcement. IPO expressed its support for the creation of a practitioner's guidebook to IP, as well as of an IP judicial bench book. IPO and CLDP observed that development of these proposed resources would help mitigate some of the issues arising from turn -over of personnel (e.g., IPO staff, IP Tribunal staff, ORIC staff, and private law firm staff). CLDP and IPO discussed whether the Intellectual Property Organization Act of 2012 could be amended to enhance the qualifications for IP Tribunal Presiding Officers/judges, as well as to lengthen the term of appointment. IPO expressed support for this proposal , and noted that issues need to be addressed regarding the standing of the IP Tribunals as courts of first instance and appeals. Federal Board of Revenue - IP Rights Enforcement (FBR -IPRE) : CLDP's discussion with FBR -IPRE focused on customs enforcement of IP rights (e.g., anti -counterfeiting). FBR's DG noted that interdictions have increased steadily and \u00be into 2019, ha d reached 100 instances, with seizures topping $15 million in value. The majority of counterfeit product seizures consist of electronics, watches, book piracy, and fashion items. FBR - IPRE utilizes risk management assessments to determine its priorities. During March - April 2019, FBR -IPRE participated in JCO Hygiea, a joint ex ercise including 38 countries and focused on fast -moving consumer goods. Pakistan was deemed the No.1 participant in terms of effectiveness in interdicting counterfeit goods. FBR -IPRE has a good working relationship with many international and domestic c ompanies and has partnered with private industry to teach its officers \"how to spot\" counterfeit goods. To assist in Pakistan's efforts to improve its Special 301 Watch List ranking, FBR -IPRE is taking action to tighten border controls, work more effectively with national and international customs -related organizations, and improve IPRE staff training. FBR -IPRE would welcome technical assistance from CLDP and USPTO. As a result of these meetings, CLDP is developing programs in the following areas: Consul tations with IPO in support of the pending IP Legislative Update Training for new trademark and patent examiners Page 14 of 177 FBR -IPRE Anti -Counterfeiting Air Freight/Mail Pharma Exercise Virtual USG/Pakistan Interagency Exchange on IPR Border Enforcement On July 22, CLDP, in partnership with USPTO, moderated a virtual interagency exchange between representatives from USG agencies (Customs Border Protection (CBP), the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the U.S. Embassy Islamabad) and senior officials of Pakistan's Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) Customs Directorate for Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement (IPRE). The focus of the discussion was on intellectual property rights (IPR) border enforcement. The discussion involved 19 Pakistan officials, including the Director General of FBR -IPRE, the Additional Director of FBR - IPRE (South), as well as other senior Pakistan officials. Pakistan officials reaffirmed the country's commitment to improving IPR enforcem ent at the border for both imports and exports, and stressed the threats to public health and safety and the negative economic impact of unchecked counterfeits, pirated, and illicit goods. USTR discussed key areas for improvement and shortfalls by Pakistan on the 2020 Special 301 Report. Overviews of IPR enforcement procedures and activities at the border were presented and discussed by FBR and CBP, including examples of successful interdictions and identification of areas for possible U.S. government techn ical assistance to Pakistan. At the conclusion of the video conference, CLDP and Pakistan FBR -IPRE agreed to jointly initiate a technical assistance program focused on stopping counterfeit pharmaceuticals transiting through air freight and air mail facilities in Pakistan. The proposed program will highlight Pakistan's transnational efforts with the international community, including the Permanent Forum of International Pharmaceutical Crime (http://www.pfipc.org/). Pakistan and U.S. government representative s agreed to form a working group and conduct a series of scheduled virtual meetings to further develop the details of the multi- phased program. This program will be a capstone IPR enforcement exchange and training program and is a follow -on to earlier CLDP and USPTO programs for Pakistan. Development of Innovation Ecosystems Through Technology Transfer Algeria : Workshop on IP and the Negotiation of Technology Licenses Transfer of technology from academia to industry increases productivity in industry and fosters the development of technology start -ups. Technology transfer from academia to industry is therefore a priority for the Algerian government as it tries to decrease the country's econom ic dependence on oil and gas. At the behest of the U.S. embassy in Algeria, since 2016 CLDP has been providing technical assistance to Algeria to build capacity to manage effectively technology transfer from academia to industry. A key component of CLDP's technical assistance has been a program to form a partnership between a U.S. center of excellence in technology transfer and an Algerian institution that has all the attributes required to become a center of excellence in technology transfer. The former is the International Technology Transfer Institute (ITT I) of the Franklin Pierce law school of the University of New Hampshire; the latter is \u00c9cole Nationale Page 15 of 177 Polytechnique d'Alger (ENP), Algeria's best institute of technology. As a third phase of this program, on October 21-24, in Algiers, Algeria, CLDP condu cted a workshop on the negotiation of technology licenses. At ENP's request, the core of this workshop was the simulated negotiation of a technology license, based on a case study created by CLDP. In addition to the managers of ENP's incubator, about 15 Algerian participants attended the workshop. They represented key agencies that promote and support technological innovation, entrepreneurship, and IP in Algeria; a few Algerian private sector firms also took part in the workshop. The Algerian participan ts praised the very practical nature of the workshop and asked whether a similar workshop could be conducted in the future for a larger audience. Contribution to workshop on \"Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Property \" In June 2020, ANVREDET ( Algeria's National Agency for the Commercialization of the Results of Research and Developmen t) organized a video -conference on \"Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Property .\" CLDP was supposed to be one of the presenters but was unable to do for technical reasons. As a result, CLDP wrote a short note on \"Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Property: An Opportunity for Algeria .\" This note was shared with the organizers. Webinar on \"Identifying and Remedying Vulnerabilities of Technology Start -ups\" In July 2020, ANVREDET organized a series of webinars on the topic of \"The Financing of Technological Innovations .\" CLDP has developed a methodology that makes it possible to quickly assess whether a science -based start -up can be successful and, if not, what it should try to change to increase the likelihood of success. On July 23 and on July 27, at ANVREDET's request, CLDP gave webinar s on this methodology. ANVREDET and the participants found the CLDP methodology to be of immediate applicability. Azerbaijan: Webinar on Negotiating International Software Agreements On May 7, 2020, CLDP, in coordination with the U.S. Embassy in Baku, led a three -hour webinar for Azerbaijan local IT companies, law firms, and law students focused on negotiating international software agreements. CLDP developed the webinar as the result of an assessment held with private sector companies in Azerbaijan who were interested in expanding internationally through joint development agreements and who also needed to understand how to best address key intellectual property (IP) issues. The webinar's two main experts, a corporate counsel from Google and the general counsel of Silicon Valley based start -up, focused on key IP issues that arise in the negotiation of licensing agreements and how software IP can be protected. The live webinar included time for questions from local counterparts. Strengthening IP rights will help Azerbaijan develop a knowledge -based economy, improve employment opportunities and economic stability, and protect the IP of both Azerbaijan and U.S. companies. Page 16 of 177 Bahrain: Background The Kingdom of Bahrain lacks oil and gas resources but has nine universities that conduct a significant amount of research and development. In light of this context, Bahrain's Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT) has designed an economic development strategy based upon technology transfer from academia to industry, both for the improvement of processes used by Bahrain's industry and for the creation of technology start -ups. To implement this strategy, Bahrain has created a virtual Bahrain Innovation and Technology Center (BITC). A key mandate of BITC is to support intellectual property development and commercialization at Bahrain universities. BITC is led by MOICT's SME Development Directorate. BITC members are: Bahrain's Economic Development Bahrain's -ups organizat ions, and Bahrain's Development Bank. CLDP has been providing technical assistance to Bahrain for over ten years. Starting in December 2019, CLDP has been providing technical assistance to BITC, at the behest of the U.S. embassy in Bahrain. In FY 2020, this assistance took two main forms: -A one -day workshop on the negotiation of technology licenses, conducted in December. - Support to the University of Bahrain (UoB), the country's main university. This support took place, from March 2020 until the e nd of July 2020, in three main domains: a) The development of a cooperation agreement with a U.S. university . b) The revision of UoB's IP policy. c) The creation of methodologies to assess which technologies developed at Bahrain universities are worth patentin g. Bahrain's Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT) was pleased with the results achieved and published a press release to state so. A key factor in the results achieved was the role of the USPTO's IP Attach\u00e9 for the region. He took part in all the video -conferences between CLDP, BITC and UoB. In addition, he created significant synergy between CLDP and the USPTO by developing and leading 11 remarkable webinars on: intellectual property (IP) and universities, IP identification, and IP capture. Workshop on Intellectual Property/Negotiation of Technology Licenses On December 12, in Manama, Bahrain, at MOICT's invitation, CLDP held a workshop focused on technology transfer and technology licensing. The participants were key members of BITC: representatives from government, from academia, and from the startup community. The workshop included an intellectual property exercise as well as a negotiation exercise of a Page 17 of 177 technology license based on a case study. The exercise and the case study had b een created by CLDP specifically for Bahrain. After the workshop, the Director of SME Development at MOICT sent a message to CLDP stating: \" it was a remarkable workshop and most of the attendees thanked me for it and for the valuable information you've shared .\" Framework agreement for cooperation between the University of Bahrain and George Mason University Given the importance for Bahrain of technology transfer, MOICT has asked CLDP to help foster cooperation between UoB and a U.S . university that has s ignificant experience in academia- to- industry technology transfer, as well as a unique focus on the development and protection of intellectual property (IP). CLDP approached George Mason University ( GMU) . With a size comparable to UoB's, GMU is the largest public university in the state of Virginia and, like UoB , it has an economic development mission. Also, GMU has the Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) , and its law school has the Center for the Protection of Intellectual Property (CPIP) and the Innovation Law Clinic. The leadership at CPIP and OTT expressed a readiness to explore potential cooperation with UoB. Through video- conferences conducted over several weeks, the following framework for cooperation was agreed upon, in principle. - Cooperation between UoB's Technology Transfer Office (TTO) and GMU's Office of Technology Transfer (OTT), with a focus on IP protection strategy, joint research projects, and internships at OTT for TTO members. - Cooperation between UoB's Incubator and GM U Law School (CPIP and Innovation Law Clinic) to share relevant experience. MOICT values the cooperation envisioned between UoB and GMU. MOICT considers that, for this cooperation to be durable, it is important that a two- way relationship be established. Therefore, MOICT and Bahrain's SMEs Development Board members stand ready to help technologies and start -ups originating from GMU to gain access, through Bahrain, to the markets of the Arabian Peninsula. Revision of UoB's IP Policy. The University of Bahrain is the Kingdom's largest university. Its IP policy will be a model for all the other universities in the Kingdom. The Dean of Graduate Studies and Scientific Research at UoB is in charge of the IP policy. The Dean wanted to mak e sure that UoB's IP policy was consistent with best international practices. MOICT asked for CLDP's technical assistance to do so. To this end, CLDP formed a panel that included a key volunteer expert, Dr. Richard Cahoon, who had been for 20 years the d irector of Cornell U niversity 's Technology Transfer Office and Page 18 of 177 who, after leaving Cornell, had been one of the drafters of WIPO's IP Toolkit for universities. The panel also included the USPTO ( both the IP Attach\u00e9 and members from the Office of Policy and International Affairs) as well as the director of George Mason University's Office of Technology Transfer. For about six weeks, CLDP organized weekly video- conferences during which UoB and the panel discussed revisions to the IP policy that were suggeste d in writing by members of the panel during the previous week, and successive versions of the IP policy revised by UoB based upon these suggestions. As a result of this process, UoB now has a solid IP policy for Technology Transfer purposes that can serve as a model for other Bahrain universities. Methodologies to Assess Which Technologies Developed at Bahrain Universities are Worth Patenting. Over the years, CLDP has developed a \"toolkit\" of Technology Transfer methodologies. CLDP adapted some of the se methodologies to Bahrain's specific priorities. Morocco: Workshop on IP and Technology Transfer On December 11 -13, 2019, CLDP, in collaboration with Morocco's Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, held a workshop on technology transfer and intellectual property in Casablanca, Morocco. The U.S. Consul General in Casablanca gave opening remarks. The workshop was attended by 40 participants representing different techno- parks across Morocco and Spain, research institutions and government agencies. The workshop included a lively discussion on how to best strengthen the capacity of techn ology transfer stakeholders to manage intellectual property rights. This workshop was a continuation of a follow -on to a session held by CLDP in April 2019 in Fes, Morocco. Pakistan: Meetings with Education Institutions On November 13 -14 and 19, 2019, CLDP held meetings in Islamabad and Karachi to assess technical assistance needs in various areas relating to commerce, including the recognition, protection, and exploitation of intellectual property. Meetings were held in particular with the following organizations: Continuing Legal Education Institute of Pakistan (CLEIP) CLEIP reviewed the effectiveness of previous CLDP continuing legal education (CLE) programs focused on IP and discussed possible future programming. C LEIP's cooperation with Pakistan's Higher Education Commission (HEC) and CLDP regarding technology transfer (e.g., Technology/IP Licensing Workshop) efforts with Pakistani universities was discussed in detail, including plans for the upcoming Licensing Wor kshop II in Karachi. Possibly working with a Page 19 of 177 Provincial High Court judicial academy, including efforts for course development and/or an IP judicial bench book was discussed, as well as CLEIP's taking- on the development of an IP Guidebook for Legal Practit ioners. There was detailed discussion on possibly organizing a National E -Commerce Conference to focus on the newly adopted E -Commerce policy for Pakistan. This conference would facilitate a discussion of the content and implementation challenges facing the business and legal communities, even though the GoP has not given any indication it is seeking public input. Higher Education Commission of Pakistan (HEC) CLDP's current efforts with HEC and universities' Offices of Research, Innovation and Commerc ialization (ORICs) and Business Innovation Centers (BIC s) have been focused on improving the skills of the university technology transfer offices by providing technical assistance in licensing IP as an avenue to generate benefit for the general public incl uding, hopefully, creating an ecosystem of innovation, coupled with societal and economic contribution. HEC and CLDP reviewed the plans and preparations for the upcoming IP/Technology Licensing Workshop in Karachi, to be hosted at the City Campus of the I nstitute of Business Administration (IBA), in cooperation with CLEIP. HEC discussed its ongoing open challenge programs to encourage interdisciplinary research and international cooperation; provincial government identification of local problems and proposed solutions of significant importance; IP commercialization; and start- up seed funding to foster innovation. HEC is partnering with the Ministry of Youth to develop and fund an additional 30 BICs to create jobs and opportunity for economic growth. HEC is working with engineering universities, as well as other universities, to offer courses on entrepreneurship, in recognition of the importance of business creation and economic opportunity across study disciplines. CLDP reminded HEC of earlier suggestion s to develop and offer survey courses of \"the legal environment of business,\" including the importance of IP, for non- lawyers. Many law schools have yet to include IP courses as part of their curriculum. HEC will give this further consideration. CLDP of fered to connect HEC with U.S. universities offering such courses of study. Lastly, the importance of IP public awareness programming was discussed, and CLDP introduced the idea of programming for children (Camp Invention in the U.S.). This program introduces young students to the basic concepts of IP and connects these legal concepts to real life every day examples. In this way, the general public is introduced to the practical importance and value of IP and its benefits, while removing the mystery from the primary subject. HEC found the concept interesting, especially the aspect of industry providing (minimal) resources to sustain the ongoing public awareness program. As a result of these discussions, CLDP is developing programs in the following areas : Private Sector Conference/CLE on Digital Economy and the Government of Pakistan's E-Commerce Strategy Private Sector Conference/CLE on the CMR Convention Support for World IP Day 2021 University IP Licensing Workshop III (for universities in the Greate r Lahore area) Page 20 of 177 Workshop on the Licensing of University -Developed IP On March 3 -4, 2020, CLDP, in partnership with HEC and CLEIP (Continuing Legal Education Institute of Pakistan ), conducted a multi- day workshop on identifying, protecting, and exploiting university -developed IP, focusing on licensing as an efficient way to benefit the public good and, possibly, generate revenue for the university. IPO representatives attended the workshop, a s well as having the Director of Copyrights speak at the event. HEC worked closely with the universities in the Greater Metropolitan Area of Karachi for nominations to attend the workshop and provide a venue (the workshop was held on the City Campus of the Institute of Business Administration (IBA)). Workshop participants (i.e., university personnel involved in IP management) learned key concepts and provisions of licensing agreements and how technology transfer benefits the creator, licensor and licensee, as well as the general public and the overall economy. Forty -five participants representing sixteen universities attended the workshop. CLDP anticipates that by focusing on the creation of economic opportunity arising from the recognition, protection, and exploitation of Pakistani -generated IP, for the benefit of Pakistanis, the culture regarding enforcement of IP rights in Pakistan will improve significantly. The workshop was digitally recorded for future use by HEC. Continuing Legal Education Master Class On March 5, 2020, CLDP, in partnership with CLEIP, conducted a continuing legal education (CLE) Master Class on Practicing Law in the Digital Age, to enhance the knowledge and skills of the attendees in the subject areas of intellectual property ( IP) licensing, recent competition law matters, role of in -house counsel in supporting business growth, developments in laws relating to new technologies, and legal concerns and requirements in the Digital Age. CLE participants (i.e., Pakistani lawyers) learned key concepts and provisions of IP licensing agreements and how technology transfer benefits the creator, licensor and licensee, as well as the general public and the overall economy. Participants discussed recent actions by the Competition Commissio n of Pakistan (CCP), the role of in- house counsel in supporting business growth, legal issues relating to new technologies, and the evolving legal environment (e.g., concerns and requirements) of practicing law in the Digital Age. As demonstrated by the l ively discussion and rigorous questioning during the masterclass, CLDP anticipates that the participants will share the knowledge gained from the workshop with their parent organizations (e.g., companies and law firms), and better serve their clients by ap plying these evolving legal concepts (e.g., IP, competition, consumer protection, E -discovery), which, in turn, contributes to the economy of Pakistan. Forty -seven lawyers from the Karachi area attended the CLE Master Class. This program was digitally re corded and will reside in the CLE library of CLEIP, allowing CLEIP to offer this program virtually without having to duplicate the efforts expended to create the initial program. In addition, offering the program virtually facilitates the spread of knowle dge without requiring face -to-face travel, time, and expense. Virtual Program on Law and Technology On August 22, CLDP, in partnership with the Continuing Legal Education Institute of Pakistan (CLEIP) and the Institute of Business Management (IoBM), conducted a webinar titled, \"The Future of Lawyers and Law Firms in Pakistan: Technology, Big Data, and Online Courts.\" The Page 21 of 177 Continuing Legal Education (CLE) webinar focused on how new technologies affect the practice of law, including the need for CLE to keep lawyers abreast of new laws, in particular, cyberlaw, e-commerce, and intellectual property, and effectively advise clients. It was also noted that law schools need to adopt new technologies to prepare students for a rapidly changing environment in legal r esearch, online filing, and document generation, as well as add substantive technology - focused courses (e.g., intellectual property) to the curriculum. The pandemic has accelerated the development and use of distance learning, virtual counseling, and online courts \u2014all of which are quickly becoming normalized. By integrating technology into the practice of law, CLEIP and IoBM members can serve more clients and make legal services more accessible to a larger population. This virtual program reinforces and bui lds upon earlier CLDP -CLEIP programs by focusing on the intersection of technology and law, demonstrating the value of CLE to enhance the knowledge of legal practitioners in Pakistan, supporting a developing ecosystem of innovation, and contributing to the economy. Tunisia: Presentation on \" How to ensure the viability of technology start -ups\" Agence Nationale pour la Promotion de la Recherche (ANPR), the national agency for the promotion of research, is part of Tunisia's Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research. On June 30, ANPR launched a competition for Tunisian science Ph.Ds. and Ph.D. candidates seeking to launch science -based startups. CLDP was one of the guest speakers who gave presentations as part of the virtual conference organized to launch the program. CLDP presented on \"How to ensure the viability of technology start-ups.\" CLDP also spoke about its programs to support startups and technology transfer in Tunisia and the Maghreb. As part of its presentation, CLDP gave an overview of a methodology that it developed specially for the ANPR program. This methodology makes it possible to quickly assess whether a science -based start -up can be successful and, if not, what it should try to change to increase the likelihood of success. This methodology is called VISTTA (a French language acronym for \"Initial Viability of an Ad vanced Technology Tunisian Start found VISTTA useful and shared it with all candidates. The June 30 event took place on Google Meet for a total of 42 participants with a dis tinguished panel of representatives from government, academia, and the startup community. CLDP was invited to lead a series of webinars in July, please see below. Webinar on Strategies for Research Commercialization CLDP organized the first webinar on July 8, with a focus on research commercialization strategies. A consultant from WIPO presented on the different strategies available for research commercialization, including market research, value proposition, and mar keting plan. She also presented on TRL (Technology Readiness Levels), a method for determining the maturity of new technologies. Participants who are primarily academic researchers had an opportunity to learn Page 22 of 177 more about tools to help them develop a more viable, value -driven project as they work to bring their inventions to market. Webinar on the VISTTA Methodology On July 21, 2020, as part of the program described in the section above, CLDP led a webinar on the methodology it has created to make it possible to quickly assess whether a science- based start-up can be successful and, if not, what it should try to change to increase the likelihood of success. There was so much interaction between CLDP and the participants that it was decided to devote a second session to the topic. This session will take place in a few months. INTERNATIONAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION (ITA) Office of Standards & Intellectual Property (OSIP) STOPfakes.gov The International Trade Administration's Office of Standards a nd Intellectual Property (OSIP) manages the STOPfakes.gov website. STOPfakes.gov hosts several resources to educate and assist businesses, consumers, government officials, and the general public. Industry Specific IP Toolkits These toolkits focus on IP as it relates to a particular industry and provide guidance to U.S. companies seeking to acquire and protect copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets in overseas markets. Current industries covered include: Sporting Goods, Marine Technology , Pleasure Boats, Medical Devices, Auto Parts, and Building Products. IP Snapshots IP Snapshots are one -page documents that provide IP information about a foreign country. The following information is included on each IP Snapshot: Contact information for local IP Offices, country membership in important IP treaties, Special 301 rankings for the prior 3 years, and contact information for the IP attach\u00e9 in the region. Seventy -three IP Snapshots are currently available on STOPfakes.gov. Country IP Tool kits Country Toolkits are more in- depth documents to assist U.S. entrepreneurs in understanding the ins and outs of IP protections in foreign markets. Available toolkits include China (new), Singapore, Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Brunei, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, European Union, Italy, and Peru. IP Highlights These pamphlet -sized handouts raise awareness o n a range of IP related issues. The inaugural IP Highlight , entitled \"Suspicious Solicitations,\" noted how bad actors negatively impact rights Page 23 of 177 holders by impersonating government agencies. Additionally, the IP Highlights provides information on an array of U.S. Government IP Resources, including the IP Attach\u00e9 Program, Indian Arts and Crafts Board, Enforcement on Counterfeit Car Seats, a nd the Patent Pro Bono Program. STOPfakes Roadshows The STOPfakes Roadshows deliver critically important information about intellectual property to the audiences that need it most - start -ups, entrepr eneurs, small and medium -sized businesses, independent creators, and inventors. The information is presented by experts from multiple government agencies focused on advancing stakeholders' intellectual property interests : The U.S. Patent and Trademark Off ice provides information about how to protect patents and trademarks; The U.S. Copyright Office discusses the importance of copyright protection to businesses; U.S. Customs and Border Protection representatives explain how a registered trademark or copyr ight can be recorded with Customs to facilitate the seizure of infringing goods at our borders; Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or U.S. Attorney's Office representatives discuss how to protect trade secrets and identify internal and external threats ; The U.S. Department of State highlights the role diplomacy and our diplomatic missions play in advocating for U.S. businesses overseas; International Trade Administration representatives identify mechanisms for obtaining intellectual property rights pr otections in export markets; and Small Business Administration representatives advise on the potential use of grants and loans to help with the costs of obtaining IP protection before exporting. Participating agencies also identify additional resources th ey make available to assist U.S. businesses with acquiring and protecting their intellectual property rights. In 2018, the STOPfakes team expanded the opportunities available to businesses at the \"in- person\" roadshows through what are now its three signat ure offerings: First, participants were able to sign up to talk one -on-one with any of the government agency speakers during 10- minute session s. Second, participants could apply for online copyright registration . Copyright Office staff offered on-site assistance with the copyright application process. Third, participants were able to apply for copyright and trademark recordation. On- site assistance was made available by Customs and Border Protection staff to navigate the recordation application portal a nd process. Three (3) roadshows were completed in FY 2020: Newark, Sacramento, and San Jose. The roadshows will resume when it is practical to do so, and the content is offered virtually as of August 2020. Page 24 of 177 STOPfakes Webinars STOPfakes began offering virtual content in August 2020 with t en webinars taking place between August 25 and October 13, 2020. These webinars are hosted by STOPfakes and feature some of the same topics and speakers from the roadshow agendas as well as some new content from new par tners (e.g., NHTSA covering product safety issues with counterfeit airbags, car seats, replacement parts, etc.). The webinars are being recorded and will be posted on the STOPfakes website and announced via the STOPfakes Twitter feed. Combatting Trafficki ng in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods OSIP undertook a critical role in the interagency process to appropriately implement the response to the Presidential Memorandum of April 3, 2019, on C ombating T rafficking in Counterfeit and P irated Goods. In addition, OSIP led the interagency effort to collect and disseminate 93 substantive submissions received in response to a Federal Register Notice seeking stakeholder views on the issue of counterfeit and pirated goods. OSIP continues to coordinate several meetings with stakeholders, including the International Anti -Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC), National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), and Amazon. OSIP briefed participants on stakeholder outreach efforts, and arranged for briefings to Industry Trade Advisory Committees (ITACs) interested in the issue. In FY 2020, OSIP continued to meet regularly with industry leaders and provide industry's unique perspective as part of OSIP's support for the ongoing USG activities to implement the DHS Report of January 2020 on \"Combating Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods.\" NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION (NTIA) Protect Intellectual Property at ICANN The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the USPTO, and other Federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, continue to engage within the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), highlighting the importance of timely access to domain name registration information (known as WHOIS) for IP right holders, to combat infringement online. In response to the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect during FY 2018, crucial domain name r egistration information details are no longer publicly provided. The U.S. Government is playing an active role in the ongoing ICANN policy development process discussions to establish a sustainable access and accreditation model as soon as possible, so that law enforcement, IP right holders and other legitimate interests can access non -public WHOIS information for enforcement and security purposes. The U.S. Government will continue to work through the GAC to ensure that intellectual property rights are respected in the ICANN policy processes. In addition, USG agencies are closely monitoring the nearly -completed review at ICANN of the new rights protection mechanisms (RPMs), such as the Trademark Clearinghouse, Trademark Claims Service, and the Uniform R apid Suspension System, that were created to address Page 25 of 177 intellectual property concerns in response to the introduction of new top- level domains. NTIA, USPTO, IPEC, and other interagency colleagues will continue to focus on the effectiveness of these new RPMs . USG also will be closely following the review of the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP), which should begin in CY2020. Since its introduction in 1999, the UDRP has been a successful tool in assisting trademark right holders to combat cybersquatting, and consequently, the review of the UDRP is not without controversy. The Copyright Office's Section 1201 Rulemaking Throughout FY 2020, NTIA followed developments in the Section 1201 rulemaking process, and was prepared to fulfill its statutory role to engage in consultation with the Copyright Office on exemptions proposed during the latest triennial rulemaking, which is expected to conclude by late 2021 (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1)(C)). In particular, NTIA reviewed petitions for both new and renewed exemptions, as well as comments on petitions received by the Copyright Office. NTIA looks forward to actively participating in the rulemaking and sharing its views with the Copyright Office during FY 2021. UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFI CE (USPTO) The Director of the USPTO has the responsibility of, among other things, advising \"the President, through the Secretary of Commerce, on national and certain international intellectual property policy issues\" and advising \"Federal departments and agencies on matters of intellectual property policy in the United States and intellectual property protection in other countries.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(b) (8) -(13). Consistent with this responsibility, the USPTO provides expert legal and policy advice to the Administration on issues related to the protection and enforcement of patents, industrial designs, trademarks and geographical indications, copyright s, plant varieties, and trade secrets, including regulatory test data. This year, in addition to reporting on USPTO's enforcement related activities, we have included non -enforcement activities that we consider particularly noteworthy for purposes of this report. The USPTO represents the United States at W orld Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and in other international intergovernmental organizations discussing IP -related matters. In addition, the Department of Commerce (DOC) , including the USPTO, provides advice to the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) through extensive input i nto the annual Special 301 review of global IP regimes, the Economic and Trade Agreement between the government of the United States of America and the government of the People's Republic of China , and the Notorious Markets Review, as well as the Section 301 investigations when intellectual property issues are involved . Additionally, the USPTO participates in the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) Intellectual Property Experts Group (IPEG) meetings and advise s USTR on IP enforcement -related issues in the context of APEC initiatives. The USPTO provide s advice on initiatives, reports, proposed programs, and developments related to IP enforcement made or produced by other APEC economies. The USPTO also organizes and conducts IP enforcement -related programs/seminars for APEC economies. The USPTO continues to work with DOC to respond to Hill inquiries regarding the USPTO's fee revenue predictions as a result of the COVID -19 outbreak. USPTO sta ff met with appropriations Page 26 of 177 staff and authorizers through the month of July. On July 2, the USPTO announced a Fast -Track Appeals Pilot Program, an extension to the already existing Track One prioritized examination program. The Fast -Track Appeals Pilot Pr ogram allows applicants to obtain expedited resolution of ex parte appeals to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). On July 21, the USPTO released an updated study on participation of women in the U.S. innovation economy. The study found that the num ber of women entering and staying active in the patent system is at an all- time high. Additionally, on August 20- 22, the USPTO conduct ed the 2020 Invention- Con online. Strengthen Intellectual Property Enforcement through International Organizations The USPTO continues to lead the U.S. delegation to the WIPO Advisory Committee on Enforcement (ACE). ACE provides a multilateral forum for exchanging information and best practices on combatting trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy . The USPTO has also continued to provide leadership and obtained stakeholder views to shape negotiating positions for a who WH/CEQ , NOAA, NSF, USN, USCG, MARAD, USTR) effort to advocate for the exclusion of IP from the UN Intergovernmental Conference on an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. In October 2019, the USPTO led the U.S . delegation to the 39th Session of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Re lated Rights (SCCR), discussing , among other topics, a draft treaty that would protect broadcasting organizations against signal piracy. The USPTO has also entered into a number of arrangements with intergovernmental organizations. For example, the USPTO 's Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with INTERPOL's Illicit Goods and Global Health Programme was renewed in 2018. Under the arrangement, the USPTO an d INTERPOL intend to cooperate on training and capacity building programs to promote effective intellectual property enforcement internationally. And in FY 2019, the USPTO entered into an MOU with the Oceania Customs Organization (OCO), which is composed of 23 national and territorial customs administrations in the Pacific region. The MOU provides that the OCO and the USPTO intend to cooperate on training and capacity - building programs to promote effective intellectual property enforcement in the region. From November 25- 26, 2019, USPTO's OPIA participated in the WIPO Trade Secret Symposium, speaking on the panel \"National and Regional Frameworks: Recent Developments.\" From July 7 -9, 2020, the USPTO participated in the virtual second session of the WIP O Conversation on Intellectual Property and Artificial Intelligence . Director Iancu was one of the principal speakers. On July 21, 2020, Director Iancu participated in a virtual annual meeting of the heads of the IP5 Offices. The meeting included a review of responses by the offices to the COVID -19 outbreak and the progress and next steps of ongoing IP5 projects . Promote Enforcement of U.S. Intellectual Property Rights through Trade Policy Tools Throughout FY 2020, the USPTO provided policy advice and technical expertise on domestic Page 27 of 177 and international IP matters to multiple other federal agencies. These included USTR, IPEC, and other bureaus of the Commerce Department. The USPTO advised USTR on: the negotiation of trade agreements such as the Economic and Trade Agreement between the government of the United States of America and the government of the People's Republic of China ; reviews under U.S. trade preference programs such as the Generalized System of Preferences and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) ; Trade Policy Reviews undertaken at the World Trade Organization (WTO) ; and accessions underway at the WTO. In addition, the USPTO assisted USTR in the preparation of its annual review of global developments on trade and IP, the Special 301 Report, and the Section 301 Report. The Special 301 Report identifies U.S. trading partners in which IP protection and enforcement has deteriorated or remained at inadequate levels and where U.S. persons who rely on IP protection have difficulty with fair and equitable market access. The USPTO assisted in its preparation by providing extensive information on the state of IP protection and enforcement in many countries. The USPTO likewise provided USTR with information in connection with its compilation of the annual Notorious Markets List , which highlights prominent online and physical marketplaces that reportedly engage in and facilitate substantial copyright piracy and trademark counterfeiting. The USPTO participated in briefing the Industry Trade Advisory Committee (ITAC) and other stakeholders , including small and medium size businesses, on progress on promoting enforcement of U.S. intellectual property rights through trade policy tools. Support U.S. Small and Medi um-Size Enterprises (SMEs) In Foreign Markets The USPTO offers basic- and advanced -topic programming for U.S. Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) doing business abroad through its Global Intellectual Property Academy (GIPA), a component of the Offi ce of Policy and International Affairs (OPIA). These in -depth programs , organized and instructed by OPIA attorneys, cover best practices in domestic and international IP protection and enforcemen t and are delivered through face- to-face and distance learni ng modes, both from the USPTO's headquarters in Alexandria, VA, and around the country in cooperation with the USPTO's regional offices. OPIA collaborates with the USPTO's IP Attach\u00e9s, Regional Offices, other USG agencies, and the Federal Judiciary. In F Y 2020, GIPA provided IP awareness and education programming to over 5,875 U.S. SMEs, U.S. government officials, and other U.S. stakeholders. About 40% of GIPA's 13 0 programs in FY 2020 targeted this domestic audience of IP rights owners, users and policy makers. During FY 2020, GIPA successfully pivoted mid- year to all -remote outreach and education delivery, thanks to prior investments in technology platforms and e -learning strategies. In FY 2020, the USPTO supported the interagency STOPFakes.gov Initiative, which includes organizing and staffing IP Roadshows throughout the country and developing a China IPR Toolkit that was posted to the USPTO.gov and stopFAKES.gov websites in October 2019. In- person programming through OPIA/GIPA included IP education programming for U.S. attorneys general, joint programs with universities and China IP Roadshows for U.S. SMEs, as well as a series of two virtual copyright programs with the USPTO regional offices . FY 2020 GIPA Distance Learning programming for U.S. SMEs included a continuing webinar initiative to provide comprehensive IP education to grantees of the Small Business Administration's SBIR - STTR programs; copyright webinars for U.S. SMEs in cooperation with U SPTO regional offices; and broadcasts of programs from USPTO headquarters. Page 28 of 177 Assessing the Economic Impact of Counterfeiting and Piracy In response to the FY 2017- 2019 IPEC Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement, the USPTO Office of the Ch ief Economist developed a new website, \"Economic resources on intellectual property rights (IPR) infringement\" (https://www.uspto.gov/ip- policy/economic - research/economic- resources -ipr-infringement ). The site provides resources for understanding the nature and impact of counterfeit goods and piracy in the United States. In particular, it provides a customized resource tool that accesses 238 of the latest directives, reports, and policy documents on counterfeit and piracy from 13 U.S. government agencies . In addition, the site provides two recent landscape studies on counterfeit trade and commercial -scale piracy that summarize the current state of understa nding and evidence on counterfeiting and piracy. The piracy study provides an overview of the actors involved in the generation and distribution of pirated content, how these actors are organized, and their financial motivations. The counterfeit study pr ovides an overview of the international market for counterfeit goods and highlights the role of the private sector, of the rising trend of small -parcel counterfeit trade, and of consumer attitudes towards counterfeit goods and the role of social media. To exhibit the flow of international counterfeit trade, the site also spotlights in a figure the top three producers and importers of counterfeits goods between 2010 and 2014.

Page 40 of 177 In March 2020, the USPTO IP Attach\u00e9 in the U.S. Embassy Beijing was one of three presenters during a free 90 -minute webinar for U.S. businesses, inventors, and intellectual property (IP) rights holders doing business in China, entitled, \"Highlights from the field: Current IP developments in China .\" The webinar was attended by over 500 participants, and c overed a wide -range of IP enforcement issues in China, including, in particular, recent trends in administrative, civil, and criminal enforcement, developments in trade secret enforcement, and significant court and administrative decisions, among other important developments for U.S. rights holders in China. In response to the coronavirus, from February to May 2020, at the direction of Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China, all Mission China personnel including the US PTO Guangzhou IPR Officer focused on sourcing and shipping Chinese -made personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical devices for use in the U.S. As part of the Mission China PPE Task Force, the Attach\u00e9 remained vigilant against counterfeit or substandard medical products being imported into the U.S. As the only US PTO China IPR Officer in -country, the Attach\u00e9 responded to Ambassador Branstad and FCS China with any IP requests. In May 2020, along with current and former USPTO IP Attach\u00e9s and Officers, the Attach\u00e9 presented at the first of the China Team's webinars, focusing on current IP issues in China garnered in excess of 500 attendees. In June, the Attach\u00e9 participated in the first virtual meeting between US PTO and the China National IP Administration (CNIPA) to discuss the 2020 to 2021 Work Plan, and cooperative exchange programs in trademark examination and patent linkage. In May 2020, the Attach\u00e9 met with representatives of a major electronics manufacturer in Shenzhen to discuss ongoing counterfeiting issues, fake stores, and incre asingly difficult patent- enforcement issues. In late July 2020, the Attach\u00e9 travel ed to Shanghai to meet with representatives of U.S. rights holders, East China provincial - and municipal -level IP officials, and officers of Consulate Shanghai. In early J uly 2020, representatives of a China -based rights -holders' group consisting of both U.S. and Chinese enterprises utilized the Attach\u00e9's experience with automotive manufacturers, requesting an analysis of the IP aspects of selling refurbished but suspect ve hicular wheels. They wanted to know how the U.S. treated this type of product, particularly if the refurbished wheels were marketed as new product, and the penalties that might be involved. The Attach\u00e9 offered observations on substandard automotive parts, and possible enforcement venues including the joint OEM/USG Automotive Anti- Counterfeiting Council (A2C2) , which is under the aegis of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement/Homeland Security Investigations at the IPR Center. On September 15, 2020, the USPTO's OPIA China Team hosted a webinar on \" Safeguarding Trade Secrets in China's Changing IP Landscape,\" providing U.S. businesses, inventors, and intellectual property (IP) rights holders doing business in China the opportunity to hear from senio r USPTO attorneys and guest practitioners and companies about protection and enforcement of trade secrets in China . The webinar had over 400 attendees. Page 41 of 177 European Union The Brussels -based USPTO Attach\u00e9 for Europe (USPTO Brussels) spearheaded the organiz ation of two on- demand International Visitor Leadership Programs (IVLPs) for officials of the EU institutions (i.e., European Commission, EU Anti -Fraud Office, European Parliament) and from EU Member States' national administrations, including specialized IP and enforcement agencies. These two on- demand IVLPs entitled \"Intellectual Property and Customs Enforcement - A Regional Project for Europe\" occurred in Washington, D.C. and Miami, Florida from November 13 to 23, 2019, and in Washington, D.C. and New Y ork, New York from January 26 to February 5, 2020. In line with the key Presidential priorities, the specific objectives for the programs were to: (1) facilitate sharing of U.S. best practices on IP enforcement; (2) examine the scope of China's continued and growing malign influence in Intellectual IP matters relevant to both U.S. stakeholders and EU country economies; (3) emphasize the importance of establishing a high- threshold, risk- based, national security -focused customs screening system that can iden tify and remove counterfeit goods from the stream of commerce; and (4) explore areas of transatlantic cooperation, such as sharing of customs data to identify discrepancies and lost revenue and enhance enforcement efforts. In response to the surge of Chi na-origin counterfeit and substandard PPE, test kits, medicines and other COVID -19 related products, USPTO Brussels launched several public awareness and capacity -building programs and campaigns. One program, co- sponsored with the Bucharest - based DOJ ICHI P, NIPRCC, Europol and Interpol, focused on Romania as an entry point into the EU, and brought together 75 representatives of Romania, the U.S., and international law enforcement agencies. Two other programs, held in partnership with the OECD Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade, focused on emerging trends in illicit trade and the need for a more coordinated transatlantic response, and on illicit trade in pharmaceuticals targeting the U.S. and EU. USPTO IP Attach\u00e9s to the Middle East and North Africa and Central Asia also joined, to ensure broader regional coordination based on illicit trade routes. USPTO Brussels and the USEU Public Affairs Section also developed significant social media campaigns to raise public awareness during the COVID -19 crisis. The Brussels team amplified the launch of the OECD Report on Illicit Trade in Pharmaceuticals and published messages and a video on World IP Day, emphasizing the disastrous environmental impact of counterfeiting. On World Anti -Counterfeiting Day, the Acti ng U.S. Ambassador to the EU urged transatlantic cooperation against counterfeiting, in a video produced by USEU. Each of these campaigns were translated into French, and reached audiences outside the EU. Partners in the campaigns included Europol, Inter pol, the World Customs Organization, the OECD, the EUIPO, the UKIPO and numerous private sector associations and NGOs. USPTO Brussels also supported the White House IP Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC) and his team on each of the IPEC's Europe visits and on post -travel engagement. During the period between October 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020, the Attach\u00e9 and staff supported the development of itineraries and joined IPEC delegations to Bulgaria, Spain, The Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Croatia, Slovenia and Denmark. In these senior -level meetings, the IPEC and Page 42 of 177 delegation agencies conveyed U.S. Presidential priorities and the urgent need for transatlantic action against counterfeiting and piracy. Oceania From February 11- 13, 2020, the USPTO's OPIA enforcement team p articipated in and co- organized with the Oceania Customs Organization (OCO), with the support of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Interpol, Internationa l Trademark Association (INTA), Pharmaceutical Security Institute (PSI ), and REACT , a customs and anti -counterfeiting border enforcement training workshop i n Nadi, Fiji, attended by OCO staff and customs officers from 16 OCO members, including Commonwealth of the Norther n Marianas Islands, Fiji, Guam, Australia, Kiribati, Nauru, New Ze aland, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Page 43 of 177 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Page 44 of 177 Department of Defense This appendix discusses the FY 2020 activities of the Department of Defense (DoD). I. Policy Implementation DoD I nstruction (DoDI) 5010.44: On October 16, 2019, the Department published new DoDI 5010.44, IP Acquisition and Licensing. DoDI 5010.44 created a DoD -wide policy to govern and unify the acquisit ion, licensing, and management of IP, including by implementing the statutory requirements of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2322(a) . DoDI 5010.44 enables coordination and consistency throughout the Department by establishing the first -ever DoD -wide policy for the acquisition, licensing, and management of all IP forms, regardless of whether the IP is treated as a product or service. The policy applies to all contract types and other legal instruments used to govern such activities, in addition to cover ing all DoD components without exception. Section 1.2.b. of the policy establishes the following six core principles to govern these activities across the Department: 1) Integrate IP planning fully into acquisition strategies and product support strategies to prote ct core DoD interests over the entire life cycle. 2) Ensure acquisition professionals have relevant knowledge of how IP matters relate to their official duties. 3) Negotiate specialized provisions for IP deliverables and associated license rights whenever doing so will more effectively balance DoD and industry interests than the standard or customary license rights. 4) Communicate clearly and effectively with industry regarding planning, expectations and objectives for system upgrade and sustainment. 5) Respect and pro tect IP resulting from technology development investments by both the private sector and the United States Government. 6) Clearly identify and match data deliverables with the license rights in those deliverables. DoDI 5200.48: On March 6, 2020, the Office o f the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Securit y published a new Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Instruction, DoDI 5200.48. Intellectual property, in many forms, is a form of CUI which requires certain protections and procedures. DoDI 5200.48 speaks to the control and management of CUI such as the appropriate handling, marking and protection measures. CUI with the potential to impact national security (e.g., information related to critical programs and technology information) may require enhanced protection. Specifically emphasized in the new DoDI is the critical shared responsibility between the DoD and industry, when established by contract, grants, or other legal agreements or arrangements, in the identification, creation, shar ing, marking, safeguarding, storage, dissemination, decontrol, disposition, destruction, and records management of CUI documents and materials. Page 45 of 177 II. Programs and Engagements The Protecting Critical Technology Task Force: The Protecting Critical Technology Task Force (PCTTF) is not solely focused on the protection of IP; however, IP protection is part of the overall larger technology protection effort. The Task Force has identified weaknesses in the system and has champio ned initiatives to better protect information, especially unclassified and CUI associated with the Department's critical programs and technologies. The PCTTF has effectively utilized an Executive Committee, chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense and t he Vice Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, to highlight technology protection issues, associated threats, and obtain Senior level support of recommendations in order to effect changes in policies and procedures within the Department to include the Defense Ind ustrial Base ( DIB) and DoD's research enterprise. The PCTTF's Top 10 Priorities to protect DoD's Critical Programs and Technologies include: 1) Operationalize the Critical Programs and Technologies list to drive protection efforts . 2) Increase cybersecurity in the DIB. 3) Integrate security into the requirements and acquisition process . 4) Prevent individuals with a nefarious foreign nexus from working on DoD funded research . 5) Counter adversary talent recruitment programs . 6) Prevent adversaries from acquiring our critical technologies through acquisition and investment . 7) Expand protection of DoD critical technologies via export controls . 8) Undermine adversary confidence in exfiltrated data. 9) Operationally respond to cyber threat actors targeting the D IB. 10) Expose Chinese theft of critical technologies . The PCTTF has taken ownership of the development of a Defense -wide process to establish a DoD Critical Programs and Technologies List (CP&TL). The D oD CP&TL will be the single, authoritative list of th e Department's critical programs and technologies. DoD Components will tier their programs and technology based on the impact of their loss or compromise to the DoD Components' strategy, mission, or assigned tasks. Measures to protect CP&T controlled unclassified information will accompany the list so that program executives, intelligence professionals, counterintelligence professionals, security professionals and the export control community will understand their requirements to protect CP&T. Additionall y, the Task Force originally highlighted the poor network cyber security practices of most Defense Industrial Base companies. Most of the companies were not compliant with even the most basic National Institute of Standards and Technology standards and con trols, yet self - attested the opposite. Raising this issue and the critical requirement to comply with cyber security standards led to the development of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC). Page 46 of 177 The PCTTF also works with Departmental organ izations to better utilize export controls and the authorities of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the U nited S tates (CFIUS ), including pursuant to the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) , to ensure protection of DoD's critical programs and technologies. One of the bigger endeavors of the Task Force has been to highlight the vast infiltration of the DoD- funded research enterprise by Chinese and other espionage threats. The Department is currently considering what security con trols it can put in place to prevent and thwart threats in DoD's research. Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) : In accordance with FY2020 NDAA Section 1648, the Department developed a risk- based cybersecurity framework to enhance the protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and IP in the DIB sector. In order to implement this framework, the Departmen t published an interim rule in the Federal Register on September 29, 2020 ( 85 FR 61505) , that amends the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. The public comment period ends, and the interim rule will become effective , on November 30, 2020. In addition, the Department worked with the DoD stakeholders and the DIB sector on risk reduction activities. These activities included acquisition tabletop exercises and mock assessments of the unclassified networks of a prime contractor and a subset of subcontractors on an existing DoD contract. Page 47 of 177 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Page 48 of 177 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Appendix for FY 20 20 Annual Report Drug counterfeiting and adulteration are serious threats to public health. Counterfeit drugs raise significant public health concerns because their safety and effectiveness are unknown. In the United States, a relatively comprehensive system of laws, regulations, and enforcement by Federal and state authorities has kept drug counterfeiting incidents relatively rare, and FDA works to ensure that Americans can have a high degree of confidence in the drugs that they obtain through legal channels. FDA has made it a priority to investigate reports of counterfeit products and works with U.S. drug supply chain stakeholders to improve our ability to prevent, detect, and respond to threats of counterfeit and substandard drugs. FDA also educates consumers and the health care community about the risk s of, and minimizing exposure to, counterfeit and substandard drug products through recalls, public awareness campaigns, and other steps. Additionally, FDA reaches beyond U.S. borders and works with our foreign counterparts to identify global supply chain vulnerabilities as well as identify and implement realistic solutions, nationally and internationally. Protecting the Integrity of the Public Health Supply Chain Drug Track and Trace FDA continues to implement provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of the Drug Quality and Security Act) that was enacted on November 27, 2013. The DSCSA helps to improve the security of the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain by building an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs that are distributed in the United States by 2023, in addition to developing national standards for licensure of wholesale distributors and third- party log istics providers. The DSCSA aims to facilitate the exchange of information to verify product legitimacy, enhance detection and notification of an illegitimate product, and facilitate product recalls. In FY 2020, t o support response efforts to the COVID -19 pandemic, FDA provided clarity on an exemption and exclusion from certain supply chain security requirement during the COVID -19 public health emergency (PHE) in April 2020. This regulatory flexibility during the COVID -19 PHE strike s a balance between the need to facilitate the effective distribution of products under emergency conditions while helping protect consumers from exposure to products that may be counterfeit . DSCSA implementation efforts continued with the 20 pilot projects selected for FDA's DSCSA P ilot Project P rogram , which were completed in June 2020. FDA is working to compile results from the pilot projects to publish a final program report later in 2020. FDA is also planning for additional stakeholder engagement and discussions on system s and processes needed for enhanced supply chain security requirements that go into effect in 2023. For updates about DSCSA implementation and copies of the guidance documents see http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugIntegrityandSupplyChainSecurity/DrugSupplyChain SecurityAct/default.htm . Page 49 of 177 Engagement with Other Countries Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Global Medical Product Quality and Supply Chain Security Efforts FDA is the global lead for the APEC Supply Chain Security Toolkit (Toolkit), which is a comprehensive resource that addresses prevention, detection, and response with regards to vulnerabilities in the medic al product supply chain. It covers the entire supply chain and life cycle of medical products. As part of this effort, FDA helped organize the APEC Harmonization Center (AHC) for its Global Supply Chain Integrity Training Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia , in September 2019. FDA also presented on topics including Good Distribution Practices , Track and Trace, and Internet Sales, and highlighted the utility of the Toolkit in preventing, detecting, and responding to breaches in the medical product supply chain. Addi tionally, in November, FDA participated in GS1's global meeting and met with India's regulators to discuss traceability and serialization. FDA participated in the World Health Organization (WHO) Planning Meeting on Risk- Based Post Market Surveillance on M edicines Quality from 1/20/2020 - 1/23/2020. The purpose of the visit/attendance was to participate in key discussions related to medicine quality survey tools. At the meeting of the Member State Mechanism, the United Republic of Tanzania agreed to pilot the tools to be used during the medicine quality survey to be conducted in 2020. The use of the tools under development seeks to simplify and reduce the amount of sampling and testing, and to allow the regulatory authority to design and conduct ongoing post -market surveillance of select medicines and sites based on risk. FDA provided input for the development of the World Health Organization (WHO) Member State Mechanism Internet Questionnaire. The purpose of this survey is to identify the experiences, best practices and/or regulations of Member States that enable them to identify, prevent and/or reduce the risk of substandard and falsified ( SF) medical products sold or supplied on the internet. This questionnaire is designed to be completed by the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) department responsible for SF medical products. The WHO Member State Mechanism has prioritized an activity within its work plan to \"identify and develop appropriate strategies to understand and address the distribution or supply of SF medical products via the internet.\" Global Surveillance and Monitoring System FDA has supported the W orld H ealth O rganization (WHO) to establish the Global Surveillance and Monitoring System (GSMS) for Substandard and Falsified Medical Products which was launched in 2013. The GSMS provides national medicines regulatory authorities (MRAs) with an information portal to report counterfeit medical products, and the ability to check if similar products have been found around the globe. If simi lar products have been found, the WHO works with MRAs to investigate suspect ed counterfeit cases and issue alerts as necessary. The GSMS portal is available in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. The online portal, search facility, and access to th e photo library have also enhanced participation by Member States . The Page 50 of 177 WHO has reported that the quality and number of reports to GSMS has been steadily increasing in the last few years. Illegal Opioids and Other Consumer Education Illegal Opioid s Online and Warning Letters Issued Opioid addiction is an immense public health crisis and addressing it is one of FDA's highest priorities. The illegal online marketing of unapproved opioids is contributing to the nation's opioid crisis. In addition, opi oids bought online may be counterfeit and could contain other dangerous substances. As part of its continued efforts to address this public health concern, i n a first of its kind collaboration, in September 2019, FDA and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration issued joint warning letters to four online networks, operating a total of ten websites , illegally marketing unapproved and misbranded opioids, including tramadol , that are potentially dangerous. This joint action demonstrates the federal government 's commitment to enhance interagency coordination to respond to the opioid crisis . In August and September 2020, FDA issued seventeen warning letters to the owner(s)/operator(s) of websites illegally marketing unapproved and misbranded opioids . FDA sent abuse complaints to registrars responsible for the domain name registrations associated with websites that offer any unapproved drugs or uncleared devices, or potentially counterfeit, controlled, adulterated or misbranded products to U.S. consumers in violation of U.S. law. These registrars have received an abuse complaint submitted under Section 3.18.2 of the 2013 ICANN Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA) regarding the use of domain names for illegal purposes. These complaints are posted on the FD A website: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health- fraud -scams/registrar Criminal Investigation's Cybercrime Investigation Unit is targeting darknet marketplaces and vendors manufacturing and selling counterfeit opioids through arrest and the seizure of assets. Thus far, Operation CyberPharma has led to the arrest of 11 darknet vendors and aided in the takedown of a major darknet marketplace as well as the seizure of drug counterfeiting tools and tens of thousands of dollars in virtual currencies and other assets. Additional arrests and seizures are anticipated with this on -going operation. As part of its response to the public health emergency, FDA has also addressed the increase in unproven products sold with fraudulent COVID -19 claims and has issued more than 110 warning letters to companies . See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health- fraud -scams/fraudulent information . Please see FDA's website for more information regarding Operation Quack Hack. Operation Quack Hack leverages agenc y expertise and advanced analytics to protect consumers from fraudulent medical products during the COVID -19 pandemic. Building upon our previous experience with illegal online pharmacies, a team of consumer safety officers, special agents and intelligence analysts triage incoming complaints about fraudulent and unproven medical products. Where appropriate, complaints are sent to other agencies or to FDA centers for Page 51 of 177 additional review and possible follow -up action. In some cases, following a preliminary investigation, the Operation Quack Hack team sends an abuse complaint to the domain name registrars or a report to online marketplaces. These abuse complaints and reports are intended to notify companies that may not have been aware that their platforms were b eing used to sell an unapproved, unauthorized, or uncleared medical product during the COVID -19 pandemic. Pilot Process to Reduce the Availability of Opioids Online Launched In June 2020, FDA and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) partnered to announce the launch of a 120 -day pilot to help reduce the availability of unapproved opioids illegally offered for sale online. Under the pilot, the FDA will notify internet registries that are participating in the pilot - Neustar, Verisign and Public Interest Registry - when the agency sends a warning letter to a website operator and the website operator does not respond adequately within the required timeframe. The in ternet registries will review the FDA's notifications and assess whether to take further voluntary action, including possible domain name suspensions or blocks. Consumer Education The FDA/CDER's ongoing BeSafeRx: Know Your Online Pharmacy campaign raises awareness about the dangers of buying prescription medicine from unsafe online pharmacies. The campaign helps consumers understand the r isks, identify the signs of an unsafe online pharmacy and identify the signs of a safe online pharmacy. Between October 1, 2019 and September 28, 2020, the BeSafeRx campaign received 225,377 airings/placements, yielding an estimated 18.2 million impressio ns across TV, radio and print. This includes the BeSafeRx TV public service announcement (PSA) which aired 2.759 times on 44 television stations across the country , yielding approximately 6.1 million impressions . The BeSafeRx radio PSA aired 2, 618 times on 3 7 radio stations across the country , yielding approximately 10.6 million impressions . The print advertisement for the campaign appeared in a publication distributed in physicians' offices. The BeSafeRx print ad was placed in the November 2019 and December 2019 issues of Health Monitor's Guide to Birth Control. These placements resulted in a circulation of over 220,000 total copies, yielding an estimated 1 .5 million impressions. In addition, FDA posted updated BeSafeRx resources and tools on Sept ember 21, 2020. FDA continues to issue warnings to consumers not to purchase or use Rhino male enhancement products or other products containing hidden drug ingredients, many of which are marketed for sexual enhancement. Since 2019, FDA has issued more tha n 40 public notifications about tainted sexual enhancement products that contain hidden drug ingredient(s), such as sildenafil and tadalafil, which are th e ingredients in the FDA -approved prescription drugs, Viagra and Cialis, respectively, to treat erectile dysfunction. These tainted products , which are frequently labeled as dietary supplements, continue to be sold at gas stations and convenience stores, as well as online. Page 52 of 177 In some cases , these unapproved products have been discovered in international mail shipments to the U.S. Outreach to Health Care Providers FDA provides various online courses to inform healthcare professionals and provide them continuing education opportunities. One of these courses, Tainted Products Marketed as Dietary Supplements, is available for access through the FDA website. The course focuses the prevalence of adulterated and misbranded products masquerading as dietary supplements sold in convenience stores, retail establishments and online. These products continue to be the source of adverse event reports submitted to the agency. The webinar outlines how healthcare profe ssionals can help protect consumers and patients from these products, how adverse events can be reported to FDA, and what measures FDA is taking to protect consumers and patients. Using Advanced Technology to Identify Suspect Products : CDx (handheld Count erfeit Detection devices) In September 2012, FDA unveiled a handheld Counterfeit Detection (CDx) device, developed by FDA scientists, which can be used to rapidly screen suspect products and packaging, by visualizing differences between suspect and authent ic products and providing preliminary findings in the field. The current CDx technology is used at the International Mail Facilities (IMFs) to screen incoming packages. With the assistance of the FDA CDx review team, the device enabled the team to assess finished dosage form pharmaceuticals that were offered for entry. In FY 2017, FDA awarded the contract to a small engineering company to refine the design and manufacture devices with additional capabilities and improved ruggedness. The goal was to provi de affordable tools for identifying counterfeit FDA -regulated products , including pharmaceuticals, in the hands of global regulatory, law enforcement, and public health officials. In FY 2018, the vendor provided a CDx prototype device ( CD5, pre -production devices) that was evaluated by FDA scientists. Through their feedback, the vendor made further modifications and refinements to the device. In FY2019, FDA received additional CD5 prototypes. A training program was developed and presented to i mport inves tigators in 4Q19 in preparation for a six - month pilot program at the Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and New York IMFs. This pilot, which began in 4Q19, was designed to evaluate the CD5 prototype's effectiveness and usefulness for field screening suspected counterfeit pharmaceuticals, and intelligent sampling of products to be sent to the laboratory for further examination. Information gathered during this pilot study will be used to finalize the device production units and to refine the training program and materials to support its use. In FY 2020, 17 examinations were conducted by import investigators using the CD5 and submitted to the Forensic Chemistry Center ( FCC ) for review . The 17 products examined with the CD5 represented 1300+ individual finished dosage form pharmaceuticals from four IMFs. Ten of the 17 different products were sent to the laboratory for confirmation. OEIO and ORS Page 53 of 177 have agreed to extend the pilot to the end of 2020 to allow for additional sample collection s and data analysis . Scientific presence and field deployable tools for rapid field detection of illegal, unapproved, and counterfeit pharmaceuticals and tainted supplements In 2019, FDA formalized a partnership with CBP at the International Mail Facilities (IMF) in a Letter of Intent. The Commissioners of FDA and CBP signed this Letter to increase collaboration to maximize inspection and detection capabilities in order to prevent illegal and harmful products entering the U.S. through the nation's IMFs a nd Ports of Entry that pose a threat to public health. This partnership include s an increase in scientific resources at selected IMFs and sharing of space, technologies and information, which will facilitate mission responsibilities by improving efficienc y and reducing duplication of efforts. Based on benchmarking with Federal partners , ORA identified specially trained field -based scientists using an established a set of tools to be the most scientifically reliable and efficient approach to rapid identification of illicit FDA -regulated products, such as counterfeit pharmaceuticals , inclu ding opioids , and adulterated \" supplements.\" Ten ORA/ORS chemists were trained at the FCC on the use of these instruments, a satellite laboratory unit was procured and pilot operations were initiated at the Chicago O'Hare IMF. Ten trained ORS chemists participated in 30- day details and working with OEIO investigator s, processed over 900 samples in 68 working days. Twenty percent of the samples were found to contain DEA scheduled substances or were otherwise in violation of FDA law and regulations . The pilot was halted in March 2020 due to COVID -19 related complications. A summary report was issued in July 2020. Plans to train additional scientists and establish full operations in an additional IMF during FY21 are in progress. Collaboration with CB P at international mail facilities (IMFs) As part of FDA's Import Operation Strategy, FDA import operations personnel work daily with U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) personnel at IMFs and ports of entry. FDA regulatory investigators determine admissibility of FDA -regulated products. All parcels reviewed which contain pharmaceuticals, regardless of detention status, are documented and processed by FDA . On a daily basis, FDA generates data at 8 of the 9 IMFs (excluding the St. Thomas IMF at this time) regarding the detention of unapproved drugs, suspected counterfeit pharmaceuticals , products marketed as foods and/or dietary supplements containing undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients , and other non -compliant FDA -regulated products . This da ta is routinely shared within FDA and CBP. FDA also shares technology with CBP. For example, FDA and CBP personnel collaborate to utilize FDA's handheld CDx (discussed above) to identify counterfeit pharmaceuticals and FDA's IONSCAN 500DT (benchtop) Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) device to identify purported dietary supplements tainted with undeclared APIs at IMFs. FDA/Office of Enforcement and Import Operations is looking at potential expansion of the CDx and other handheld technologies to identify a dditional potential counterfeit pharmaceuticals . Page 54 of 177 International Capacity Building and Training: FDA Capacity Building and Training Below are examples of FDA 's Office of Criminal Investigations ( OCI) capacity building and training activities with foreign countries. In September 2019, a representative from FDA/OCI was part of a panel who provided a briefing on FDA and FDA/OCI to Ecuadorian Law Enforcements officials (Ecuadorian Police, Prosecutors and Judges) as part of the first ever training program to combat illegal trade in Ecuador. The event was sponsored by the Hemispheres University in Quito, Ecuador. In October 2019, FDA/OCI stationed a special agent within the U.S. Embassy in London, United Kingdom (U.K.). In October 2019, a representative from FDA/OCI conducted liaison and outreach meetings in Bangkok, Thailand, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, International Law Enforcement Academy, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administra tion (DEA), U.K. Border Force, U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, and the Thai Department of Special Investigations Bureau of Intellectual Property Crime. In November 2019, the FDA/OCI Miami Field Office hosted Intellectual Property and Customs Enforcement partners from Europe and Eurasia under the U.S. Department of State's International Visitor Leadership Program. In November 2019, a representative from FDA/OCI conducted a liaison and outreach meeting with the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare p roducts Regulatory Agency E -Cigarette Unit of Vigilance and Risk Management of Medicines on counterfeit products. In November 2019, a representative from FDA/OCI conducted a liaison and outreach meeting with the U.K. International Crime Coordination Ce nter with discussions on the distribution of counterfeit drugs. In November 2019, FDA/OCI executed Operation Lascar IV at the international mail facility at John F. Kennedy International Airport, Jamaica, New York. Operation Lascar IV focused on inbound shipments of violative FDA -regulated products from the U.K. FDA/OCI partnered with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, U.K. Border Force, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and investigators from FDA's Division of Northeast Imports. In December 2019, representatives from FDA/OCI participated in a workshop for regulators, police, prosecutors and customs officials from Mexico, Brazil and Peru. The title of the conference was \"Combating Proliferation of Substa ndard, Unregistered, Unlicensed, and Counterfeit Health and Safety Regulated Products,\" and took place at the headquarters of the USPTO in Alexandria, Virginia. Page 55 of 177 In January 2020, FDA/OCI executed a bilateral enforcement operation, Operation Broadsword, at the international mail facility at the O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois. Operation Broadsword targeted packages of violative FDA -regulated products transshipped through third- party countries to conceal their point of origin to avoid d etection. The operation was a collaboration with India's Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, the Forensic Chemistry Center, FDA's Division of Northern Border Imports, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In February 2020, a representative from FDA/OCI conducted a liaison and outreach meeting with U.K. MHRA Investigators with a focus on combatting counterfeit drug and medical devices. In February 2020, FDA/OCI met with representatives of Sanofi and Fran ce's Office Central de Lutte \u00e0 la Sant\u00e9 (OCLAESP) on transshipment issues and the newly created Europol operation, Operation Shield, which targets the distribution of counterfeit and unlicensed high value drugs. In March 2020, a representative with FDA/OCI attended the U.S. Department of State's Mission London China Working Group on strategies for tracing and combatting public safety threats from China. In March 2020, a representative from FDA/OCI participated, via teleconference, in a brief workshop hosted by the Organisation for Economic Co- Operation and Development's Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade. This scaled -down workshop focused on the trade in counterfeit pharmaceuticals and review of a recently released brochure of the same name. In March 2020, a representative from FDA/OCI hosted a teleconference with the U.K. Home Office's drug legislation team, Police Scotland, U.K. MHRA policy team, and DEA on the implementation of regulations related to the distribution of drug manufacturing equipment, including pill presses. In April 2020, a representative from FDA/OCI participated in a workshop, via teleconference, for Romanian law enforcemen t. The title of the workshop was \"Intellectual Property Crime and Cybercrime during the COVID19 Pandemic\" and was coordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) with participation from various law enforcement entities. In June 2020, a representat ive from FDA/OCI participated in a workshop, via teleconference, for the ten member countries of the Association of Southeast Nations. The title of the workshop was \"Turning Regulatory Enforcement into Criminal Enforcement - Enforcement Against COVID19 Crime Series\" and was hosted by DOJ and USPTO. In August 2020, a representative from FDA/OCI presented to Anglophone Pharmacrime Working Group to discuss counterfeit pharmaceuticals sold over the Internet. Along with the DOJ International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Attorney -Advisors, FDA/OCI demonstrated investigative and prosecutorial techniques involving the distribution of counterfeit drugs. Page 56 of 177 Laboratory/Analytical Capacity Building through Domestic Partnerships In 2020, FDA/ORA continued t o build upon a collaboration with CBP at the International Mail Facilities (IMFs) and evaluate the impact of the participation of on -site laboratory personnel in package screening to improve the quality and speed of detection of illegal, unapproved, and counterfeit pharmaceuticals and tainted supplements. ORS/FCC expanded collaborative efforts with Federal partners in the fight against illegal/unapproved pharmaceuticals including opioids by establishing laboratory presence at the Chicago O'Hare IMF in partn ership with CBP's Laboratories and Scientific Services (LSS) and by continuing method development work on detection of pharmaceutical based agents. ORA's FCC participated in joint operations with OCI, OEIO and CBP. Operation Broadsword was conducted at the Chicago IMF in January 2020, and Operation Dirty Hands at points of entry in Laredo, TX in June and McAllen, TX in July 2020. Laboratory/Analytical Capacity Building through International Collaboration The International Laboratory Forum on Counterfeit Medicines (ILFCM) is comprised of scientific experts from National Regulatory Control Laboratories. It began in 1999 with a bilateral arrangement between FDA and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom and developed into a partnership with global regulatory counterparts from Europe, North America, Asia and Australia to maximize the benefits of a scientific n etwork and exchange information on emerging issues related to counterfeit and illegal medicines. The ILFCM also focuses on issues related to falsified/substandard medicines, adulterated dietary supplements and other important public health topics. The ILF CM is closely aligned with the Permanent Forum on International Pharmaceutical Crime (PFIPC) and provides scientific guidance and laboratory support. In 2020, the PFIPC/ILFCM annual meeting was cancelled due to the COVID -19 global pandemic. Enforcement Activities FDA /OCI's Cybercrime Investigation Unit (CcIU) FDA/OCI's Internet -related criminal investigations are led by its Cybercrime Investigations Unit (CcIU), which strategically targets online transnational criminal networks that threaten the public health of Americans. CcIU currently has 1 0 special a gents dedicated as cybercrime specialists and is supported by 1 intelligence r esearch s pecialist, whose activities are overseen by a s enior operations manager . In FY20, CcIU has dedicated focused resources to counter public health threats, such as Operation Cyber Pharma and Operation Quack Hack described above . In response to a dramatic increase in hospitalizations associated with the sale of vaping cartridges containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) , CcIU in partnership with DEA, seized 44 websites advertising the sale of illicit vaping cartridges online. The action, which was part of Operation Vapor Lock, reflected the ongoing work by federal, state and local authorities to investigate the supply ch ain of vaping products associated with lung injuries that occurred in late 2019. CcIU also participates in the Permanent Forum on International Pharmaceutical Crime, the Public Safety Working Group of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Number s Page 57 of 177 Governmental Advisory Committee, and a number of cybercrime -related international law enforcement working groups. In July 2020, CcIU developed a working relationship with Amazon Counterfeit Crimes Unit to identify vendors selling counterfeit FDA -regulat ed products. FDA /OCI's Port of Entry Program FDA/OCI's Import Operations Program (IOP), intended to assist in detect ing violative shipments of FDA -regulated products entering our domestic ports and facilities, is led by 2 Senior Operations Managers and c onsists of 1 5 fulltime and 2 part time IOP s pecial a gents. IOP's priorities include responding to U.S. Postal Service sorting facilities known as international mail facilities, express consignment carrier facilities (to include integrators such as DHL, UP S, and FedEx), air cargo facilities, and sea and land ports. IOP special a gents routinely conduct joint enforcement activities, including internationally, and serve as a critical component within the FDA's support of the overall U.S. government wide effort to combat cross -border crime. IOP also frequently provides training to its foreign law enforcement counterparts, U.S. government partner agencies, local and state level law enforcement personnel and regulated industry. FDA /OCI Enforcement Actions FDA/OCI has a leadership role in combating counterfeit pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Below are notable examples of FDA/OCI's enforcement activities. Additional FDA enforcement cases are discussed further below. Operation PANGEA Operation PANGEA is an international collaboration with the objective to disrupt and dismantle criminal activity relating to the trafficking in illicit pharmaceuticals and medical devices where the crime is facilitated by the Internet. Coordinated by INTERPOL, the annual operation brings together customs, health regulators, national police, and private companies from various countries. The primary objectives of Operation Pangea are to shut down illicit websites, disrupt payment services, intercept illicit medicines in the postal system, investigate criminals involved in pharmaceutical crime, and raise awareness on the dangers of buying medicines online. This year's Operation Pangea also took place at three of the nine international mail facilities (IMFs) in the U.S., as we ll as at other facilities around the world. Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) 708 FDA has implemented the enforcement tool provided by section 708 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) to com bat illegal drug importation. Section 708 gives FDA the authority to administratively destroy refused drugs that are valued at $2500 or less. This authority was implemented nationwide in FY 2017. Congress passed the SUPPORT (Substance Use -Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment [SUPPORT] for Patients and Communities) Act, which became law on October 24, 2018. The SUPPORT Act grants FDA additional imports authorities to help the Agency advance efforts to stop illegal and unsaf e drugs from being imported into the United States. For instance, section Page 58 of 177 3022(d) of the SUPPORT Act added section 801(u) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act or Act). Section 801(u) of the FD&C Act authorizes FDA to treat certain imported articles as \"drugs\" for purposes of determining admissibility, including if the article is an ingredient \"that presents significant public health concern\" and it is, or contains, the same active pharmaceutical ingredient of an FDA approved drug. This provision enhances FDA's ability under its importation authorities in section 801 of the Act to detain, refuse and/or destroy illicit articles imported in the IMFs. FDA developed procedures for the section 801(u) authority and began using this new authority on March 4, 2019. FDA has destroyed over 29,000 violative drug products that are not in compliance with U.S. requirements in FY2020. Operation Opson Through the assignment of an Attach\u00e9 at Europol, FDA/OCI continues to participate in the annual Operation Opson, which is a joint operation lead by Europol and INTERPOL that targets counterfeit and substandard food and beverages. Other FDA Enforcement Actions In addition to the operations discussed above, FDA led enforcement cases during FY 20 20 include the following prosecutions. Opioid Manufacturer Indivior's Chief Executive Officer Pleads Guilty in Connection with Drug Safety Claims.

Nienadov illegally sold counterfeit Page 60 of 177 DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Page 61 of 177 Department of Homeland Security Department of DHS Appendix for FY 20 Annual Report This appendix discusses the FY 2020 activities of the Department of Homeland Security. As outlined below, DHS's activities including protecting public and private acquisition supply chains from counterfeits; conducting la w enforcement operations; engaging with stakeholders; educating the public; cooperating with foreign law enforcement; enhancing IP enforcement through international organizations; and providing capacity building and training to support IP enforcement in ot her countries. Protecting Public and Private Acquisition Supply Chains from Counterfeits Counterfeiting is a significant challenge that can impair supply chains for both the public and private sectors. In the context of the U.S. Government, acquiring pr oducts or services from sellers with inadequate integrity, security, resilience, and quality assurance controls create significant risks, from a national security and mission assurance perspective as well as from an economic standpoint (due to the increase d costs to American taxpayers). Counterfeiting can have particularly significant consequences for the Department of Defense (DoD) supply chain, by negatively affecting missions, the reliability of weapon systems, the safety of the warfighter, and the inte grity of sensitive data and secure networks. The goal is to reduce the risk of counterfeits entering the supply chain; quickly and collectively address those that do enter the supply chain; and strengthen remedies against those who provide counterfeit items. DHS Training for Acquisition Professionals Buyers in the public and private sectors need better visibility into and understanding of (1) how the products, services, and solutions they buy are developed, integrated, and deployed, and (2) the processes, procedures, and practices used to ensure the int egrity, security, resilience, and quality of those products and services. This requires understanding the threat that counterfeits pose, mitigating their purchase and distribution, and identifying counterfeits and reporting them. To address the systemic threat from counterfeits, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement -led National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (IPR Center) provides educational opportunities for public and private acquisition professionals. The IPR Center has poste d on its website free training that is designed to provide acquisition professionals with the knowledge and skills they need to combat the counterfeit threat . The training - \"Acquisition Professional Training: Counterfeit Awareness, Page 62 of 177 China Working Group DHS has formed the DHS China Working Group, made up of senior representatives of all DHS Components, with the goal of developing an action plan to protect and defend the nation against threats from the government of China sponsored online activities. The Working Group is overseen by the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary for Policy and has compiled a preliminary round of actions. These actions are currently undergoing DHS review. The Working Group is sub- divided into five workst reams, which are operated at the staff level and managed by Component representatives. Of these, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) manages the Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure workstream. Participation includes staff fro m multiple CISA Divisions, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U .S. Secret Service, Science and Technology, and Intelligence and Analysis. The Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure workstream is tasked with leading the development of action items in these relevant areas, including the prevention of intellectual property theft. The workstream has generated actions related to increasing public and private sector engagement through awareness, training, and exercises; support for the granting of the administrative subpoena authority to CISA (currently under congressional consideration); facilitation of the protection of cloud service providers, which have been used as a vector for Chinese government - sponsored offensive attacks; augmenting suppor t for the US academic sector, which holds significant intellectual property data and is therefore a key target; studying the effect of emerging technologies, including Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) manufactured in China, on the vulnerability of intellectua l property and developing deterrence strategies; and developing a strategy to protect and defend US intellectual property from Chinese government -sponsored cyber espionage and data theft. The workstream also developed milestones for each of these areas. Law Enforcement Efforts to Secure the USG Supply Chain (Operation Chain Reaction) In addition to the steps taken to secure the front end of the U.S. Government's supply chain (through Federal procurement regulations, supplier requirements, and acquisition training), the U.S. Government is also committed to protecting its vital interests by taking robust enforcement measures against those who sell counterfeit goods to the U.S. Government. Operation Chain Reaction (OCR) targets counterfeit items entering the military and U.S. Government supply chains, and is an IPR Center -coordinated effort led by ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and consists of 17 Federal law enforcement agencies (including HSI, U.S. Cust oms and Border Protection (CBP), and DoD's criminal investigative offices). In FY 2020, under Operation Chain Reaction , HSI initiated 18 criminal investigations, conducted 11 criminal arrests, and helped secure 9 indictments and 1 conviction, as well as 29 seizure incidents of counterfeit goods . Page 63 of 177 Other notable OCR activities during FY 20 20 included the following. On October 10, 2019, HSI representatives from the IPR Center, along with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), met with members of Nucle ar Utility Procurement Issues Corporation ( NUPIC ), who focus on significant nuclear utilities industry challenge's or issues that may influence procurement, planning and management activities. NUPIC evaluates suppliers to improve supplier assurance proces ses through cooperative efforts to ensure high standards of quality, including the prevention of counterfeits from entering the supply chain. In addition to the HSI and NRC, both Operation Chain Reaction and DHS CISA provided program overviews to promote industry to government interaction, information sharing and partnership. On November 21, 2019, HSI and the IPR Center hosted the Export Enforcement Coordination Center (E2C2) Public Private Partnership Meeting, including participants from BAE Syste ms, BioMarin, Booz Allen Hamilton, Honeywell, IBM, L3 Harris Technologies, Leonardo DRS, Mason International Trade, Raytheon, Rolls Royce and Tyco Electronics. The Operation Chain Reaction (OCR) Program Manager provided a presentation on OCR focused IP ca ses and the capabilities of the task force, to include how OCR acquires lead referrals through internal analysis and industry partners and red flag indicators for products that may be counterfeited to include their failure rates and acquisition details. On February 19, 2020, HSI provided a keynote invocation during the Armed Forces Communications & Electronics Association, Northern Virginia Chapter (AFCEA NOVA) Intelligence Community Information Technology Event. In addition, the OCR Program Manager provided a presentation on OCR focused IP cases and the capabilities of the task force and red flag indicators for products that may be counterfeited to include their failure rates and acquisition details. Law Enforcement Operations Protection and enforcemen t of IPR is a national priority, and U.S. law enforcement stands at the forefront of these efforts. In Fiscal Year (FY) 20 20, CBP and ICE made 26,503 IPR seizures. The total estimated manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of the seized goods, had they been genuine, was about $1.3 billion. In addition to Operation Chain Reaction (discussed above), the DHS law enforcement efforts during FY 2020 included the f ollowing operations. Operation Apothecary is the IPR Center's public health and safety initiative that addresses, analyzes, and attacks potential vulnerabilities in the entry process that might allow for the smuggling of commercial quantities of counter feit, unapproved, and/or adulterated drugs through international mail facilities, express courier hubs, and land borders. During FY 2020, Operation Page 64 of 177 Apothecary , HSI initiated 61 criminal investigations, 31 arrests, 11 indictments, and 32 convictions, as well as 223 seizure incidents of counterfeit items. E-Commerce/Operation in Our Sites i. The E -Commerce Program is an on -going HSI initiative targeting entities that sell counterfeit products through the Internet. This program consists of the well -known operation, Operation in Our Sites (IOS), which was initiated in 2010 as a method to disrupt this activity online. The E -Commerce initiative focuses on developing long term investigations that identify targets, assets, and financial scheme s used in operating infringing websites devoted to trafficking in infringing materials . It also emphasizes working in partnership with third- party entities, such as online marketplaces, payment processors and the express consignment industry. Additionall y, the IPR Center coordinates with rights holders, who utilize civil and administrative remedies to shutdown infringing sites. ii. In recognition of the wide -reach of e- commerce into many of its programmatic areas, HSI promulgated a single agency strategy on February 14, 2018. The HSI E -Commerce Strategy emphasizes an agency approach that leverages collaboration between private industry and law enforcement partners in an effort to act as a force -multiplier in a cooperative enforcement approach to identify and dismantle those organizations and prosecute those persons or entities that traffic in all manners of dangerous and illicit goods utilizing various e -commerce outlets including open -net websites, the dark web, point -to-point sales platforms, social media and a variety of payment processors and shipping methods. iii. In FY 2020, in furtherance of the E -Commerce Strategy, IPR Center personnel conducted several meetings with representatives from online platforms, payment processors, and the shipping industry for the purpose of furthering dialogue about how it might be possible to share information for the purpose of stopping the sale of counterfeit goods online. In December 2019, the IPR Center hosted the inaugural event for Operation Intangibles at the first e ver HSI digital piracy symposium. This symposium brought law enforcement and CCI experts together to address stakeholders concerns in copyright protection and enforcement efforts. This symposium further addressed collaborative efforts in countering digit al piracy to further protect a vital sector of the U.S. economy . iv. In FY 2020 under E -Commerce/IOS , HSI initiated 12 criminal investigations, conducted 2 arrests, and helped secure 2 indictments and 4 convictions. These investigations are initiated and developed by HSI field offices through IPR Center leads, seizures, informants, complaints, industry leads, and/or other investigative techniques. Page 65 of 177 Under IOS Cyber Monday/Project Transatlantic , the IPR Center - th rough HSI - partners with Europol, leveraged its member countries to launch multilateral enforcement actions against targeted websites and their operators illegally selling counterfeit merchandise. The operation involves the execution of coordinated seizures of domestic and foreign -based Internet domain name registrations in the United States and Europe. In November 2019, the IPR Center and Europol concluded Operation IOS Cyber Monday/Project TransAtlantic IX in collaboration with INTERPOL. Over 30,500 i nfringing domain name registrations were -down-for - (OEN) is an HSI -led, IPR Center initiative that focuses on securing the supply chains of automotive and other heavy industry from counterfeit components. The proliferation of counterfeit parts - including critical components such as airbags, bearings, brake pads, accelerator arms, and windshields - has grown exponentially over the last several years and now poses a significant health and safety threat to end users and an economic cost to businesses and consumers through lost revenue, downtime, and replacement costs. i. OEN personnel work closely with automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), aftermarket parts manufacturers and suppliers and other automotive parts and equipment companies, including members of the Automotive Anti -Counterfeiting Council (A2C2) and the Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association (AASA) Intellectual Property Council to support criminal investigations by providing case support and product authentication. ii. Between November 3 -8, 2019 IPR Center and A2C2 representatives traveled to Las Vegas, NV and participated in events associated with the Automotive Aftermarket Product Expo/Specialty Equipment Market Association (AAPEX/SEMA) shows. Working closely with industry partners, HSI was able to identify and gather intelligence on counterfeiters, initiate potential investigations of suspected counterfeiters, conduct outreach to the automotive aftermarket community about HSI capabilities in counterfeiting, and raise public awareness of the health and safety issues presented by counterfei t automotive parts. iii. In FY 2020, under OEN, HSI initiated 33 criminal investigations, conducted 7 criminal arrests, and helped secure 6 indictments and 14 convictions, as well as 122 counterfeit goods seizures incidents with a MSRP of approximately $19,195,213. Operation Surge Protector Operation Surge Protector (OSP) was initiated by the IPR Center in December 2016 to target the sale and trafficking of counterfeit consumer electronics and technology products, such as batteries, chargers, smartphones and charging cords. OSP combines the expertise of HSI, CBP and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). i. On November 11- 15, 2019, representatives of OSP worked in conjunction with CBP on an enforcement operation in New York, New York that focused on interdicting counterfeit consumer technology. ii. In FY 2020, under OSP, HSI initiated 14 criminal cases, conducted 18 arrests, helped Page 66 of 177 secure 10 indictments and 6 convictions, and seized approximately $5,771,592 in counterfeit products. Operation Body Armor was initiated by the IPR Center in January 2015, to combat the sale of counterfeit personal healthcare and beauty products. Through Operation Body Armor (which combines the expertise of HSI, CBP, and FDA -OCI), the IPR Center partners with industry and other entities associated with the healthcare and beauty product community. In FY 2020, under Operation Body Armor , HSI initiated 93 criminal cases, conduct ed 8 arrest s, helped secure 4 indictments and 2 convictions , and seized $2,118,405 MSRP in counterfeit products. Operation Team Player Operation Team Player (OTP) targets the sale and trafficking of counterfeit sports merchandise, apparel and tickets, a m ulti-millio n-dollar criminal industry. The culmination of the sports season\u2014playoffs and finals games \u2014are events that stimulate the sale of counterfeit items. HSI Special Agents and CBP Officers worked with sports leagues and law enforcement agencies throughout the nation to identify shipments of counterfeit sports merchandise being imported to the United States or being sold by vendors. In FY 2020, the IPR Center continued coordinating enforcement actions at multiple high -profile sporting events, including the Nat ional Football League (NFL) Pro Bowl and Super Bowl, Major League Baseball (MLB) World Series, National Hockey League (NHL) Winter Classic, and the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA) All -Star games. The traditional spor ts seasons of 2020 have been significantly impact by COVID -19, as such IPR enforcement operations in conjunction with such events have been unwarranted. i. On January 25 - February 3, 2020, OTP representatives traveled to Miami, FL to coordinate Operation Te am Player enforcement operations targeting the importation and trafficking of counterfeit sports merchandise and media activities related to Super Bowl LIIV. The operations were conducted by teams comprised of HSI Miami, HSI Tampa, IPR Center representati ves, Miami Dade Police Department, and representatives from the National Football League. As a result of these efforts, task force officers arrested 6 individuals and seiz ed approximately 2,884 items with an estimated MSRP value of $6,354,589. ii. On December 1 - 2, 2019, an IPR Center representative traveled to Miami, FL to meet with HSI Miami, law enforcement partners, and the NFL, to coordinate planning of IPR enforcement efforts for Super Bowl LIV. iii. On October 22 -25, 2019, a representative of OTP and re presentatives from HSI New York, traveled to Portland, OR to meet with representatives from Nike and discuss ongoing collaboration and lead development . iv. In FY 2020, under OTP, HSI seized more than 270 items of counterfeit sports merchandise worth $15,803,836 and arrested 23 individuals. Operation Pangea is a coordinated global effort led by INTERPOL as a means of further reducing the advertisement, sale, and supply of counterfeit, unapproved, and substandard medicines and medical devices. Websites providing counterfeit pharmaceuticals are a significant and growing global problem both from a public health and safety standpoint, as well as from an Page 67 of 177 intellectual property protection standpoint. In FY 2019, HSI, working in conjunction with CBP and FDA/OCI, conducted Pangea related enforcement operations. INT ERPOL conduct ed Pangea enforcement operation s from March 3 - 10, 2020. During FY 2020 Operation Pangea enforcement efforts, over 90 INTERPOL member countries inspected over 326,000 packages. The inspections resulted in the seizure of over 48,000 packages, which included potentially dangerous pharmaceuticals worth over $14 million. The operation also resulted in 121 arrests worldwide. Operation Stolen Promise was launched by HSI in April 2020 to protect the Homeland from the increasing and evolving threat posed by COVID -19-related fraud and criminal activity. Operation Stolen Promise combines HSI's expertise in global trade, financial fraud, international oper ations, cyber -crime, and criminal analysis to investigate financial fraud schemes, the importation of prohibited pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, websites defrauding consumers, and any other illicit criminal activities associated with the virus that compromises legitimate trade or financial systems or endangers the public. Under Operation Stolen Promise, HSI has reported more than 1,600 seizures of prohibited test kits, treatments and personal protective equipment; over 180 arrests; and over $28 milli on in seized proceeds. As efforts to combat COVID -19 progress, HSI initiated Operation Stolen Promise 2.0 in November 2020 to focus on counterfeit vaccines, while continuing to investigate the trafficking of counterfeit personal protective equipment. Thi s effort will coincide with INTERPOL's Operation Vigilant Interdiction, which will also primarily focus on combatting counterfeit COVID -19 vaccines. DHS's law enforcement activities during FY 20 20 also included the following activities: In FY 2019, CBP conducted 20 national level and 116 local IPR Trade Special Operations. These trade special operations targeted high -risk shipments at seaports, airports, international mail facilities and express carrier hubs across the United States. HSI investigates IP violations involving the illegal production, smuggling, and distribution of counterfeit merchandise and pirated works. Since the majority of infringing and dangerous products are produced overseas and either shipped directly to the Uni ted States or via a third country, HSI's long -term goals are to increase overseas IP investigations through collaboration with its foreign law enforcement and customs counterparts, and to work with host nations in interdicting such exports before they reac h the United States. HSI Special Agents play a significant role in the enforcement of IP violations through their traditional customs authorities and expertise regarding the illicit importation and exportation of merchandise. HSI Attach\u00e9s establish stron g working relationships with host country counterparts. These relationships strengthen HSI 's capacity to conduct successful domestic, international, and multilateral operations. HSI Attach\u00e9s are located in 52 countries, and they work closely with host government counterparts and participate in IP working groups at post. In FY 2020, HSI initiated 449 intellectual property investigations and was involved in 203 arrests, 125 indictments, and 98 convictions. In FY 2020, the IPR Center vetted 33,184 investigative leads; of these, 18,449 were referred to law enforcement partners. Additionally, the IPR Center de -conflicted 8,785 Page 68 of 177 investigative targets for partner agencies and industry. While performing these de - conflictions, the IPR Center identified 28 \"blue on blue\" situations where two or more entities were investigating the same target. Finally, the IPR Center referred 371 leads to private industry for follow -up. Due to the Corona virus pandemic, the IPR Center was unable to conduct any Intellectual Prope rty and Trade Enforcement Investigations (IPTEI) training courses in FY20 . Previous courses were held in October, of 2018 as well as in March, June and August of 2019. The IPTEI course offers two weeks of advanced training with a specific focus on commer cial fraud and IP theft. Trainers for the course came from both the private sector and the government. Students were from HSI, CBP, Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA -OCI) and Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). Engaging with Stakeholders The IPR Center forms the communications hub around which much of the interaction between private sector stakeholders and the law enforcement and regulatory communities takes place. The DHS report \"Combating Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods\" issued to the White House in January 2020 recommended numerous \"Immediate Actions by DHS and Recommendations for the U.S. Government.\" Recommendation six acknowledged the work of the IPR Center E -Commerce Working Group (ECWG ) and recommended the formation of the Anti-Counterfeiting Consortium to Identify Online Nefarious actors (ACTION). On June 30, 2020, the IPR Center hosted the inaugural meeting of the ACTION group. IPR Center Director Steve Francis and DHS Deputy Assist ant Secretary Christa Brzozowski provided opening comments and provided participants with an overview of the DHS Report. The IPR Center provided an overview of the ECWG efforts to date and results from its pilot data sharing project. This inaugural meeting included representatives from 14 private sector companies from various sectors , including online sales platforms, social media platforms, payment processors , and express delivery companies. Government representative included HSI, CBP, FBI and DOJ/Compu ter Crimes and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS). This meeting focused on outlining the primary goal of ACTION, which is to enhance information sharing between private sector companies. Operation Joint Venture and P roject Trade Watch Through the IPR Center's Outreach and Training Section HSI engages in partnerships with the public and private sectors to combat IP infringement through its Operation Joint Venture (OJV) initiative. This IPR Center -led outreach initiative is designed to increase information sharing with public and private sectors to combat the illegal importation and distribution of counterfeit, substandard and tainted goods, as well as the evasion of duties. The initiative is aimed at fostering commercial fraud, public health and safety, and IP investigations. Through OJV, the IPR Center engages with rights holders, manufacturers, importers, customs brokers, freight forwarders, bonded facilities, carriers, and others to discuss the IPR Center's priorities of Page 69 of 177 protecting public health and safety, the economy, and securing the Government's supply chain. Through outreach and public engagement, the IPR Center raises the public's awareness of the dangers of commercial fraud violations, such as IP, while serving as a public poi nt of contact for investigative leads. The IPR Center's audience includes a broad spectrum of industries and government agencies, including but not limited to the pharmaceutical, entertainment, wearing apparel, sports, electronic, and automobile industrie s, as well as customs bonded entities, importers, and law enforcement officials. Project Trade Watch is HSI and CB P's outreach campaign to the importing comm unity to facilitate informed compliance by private industry and to enhance public awareness of law enforcemen t efforts within the trade comm unity. This campaign exists under the IPR Center's broader OJV initiative . Through Project Trade Watch , HSI and CB P field per sonnel provide information and red flag indicators of potential import fraud and impor ter identity theft. Other Engagements DHS law enforcement agencies which support IP enforcement had numerous other engagements with stakeholders during FY 2020. Some of these public education and outreach efforts are described below. The IPR Center has a unique role within HSI by serving as a one -stop shop for IP enforcement efforts. In this role, the IPR Center has regular contact with the international community, the media, Members of Congress, trade organizations, industry leaders, and the general public. In FY 20 20, the IPR Center conducted 78 outreach and training events with 3,438 attendees. In FY 2020, the IPR Center continued the monthly publication of the IPRC Connection s newsletter to keep stakeholders up to date on the mos t significant IPR Center enforcement efforts and outreach activities. Additionally, the IPR Center collects, tabulates, and catalogs victim impact accounts of brand holders and consumers with the aim to show more clearly the full effect of IP infringement and trade fraud on the U.S. and global economies, public health and safety, and any related threat to government supply chains. Throughout FY 20 20, HSI - through its leadership at the IPR Center - collaborated with industry and other government agencie s to present training and foster communication. Examples of this include: On December 12, 2019, the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (IPR Center) - in coordination with the National Association of Attorneys General, and a coalition of law enforcement agencies and community organizations - hosted a roundtable discussion on E -cigarettes and the health and safety concerns associated with their use. The day-long gathering for law enforcement, health care professionals, legislators and educators presented a wide variety of information on E -cigarettes and the health effects that are jeopardizing public health, particularly among young people. The National Association of Attorneys General, an organization of 56 state and territorial attorneys general in the United States, joined the discussion on the heels of its annual Capital Forum in Washington D.C. Highlights of the roundtable discussion included Page 70 of 177 challenges facing law enforcement and the need to work with health care professionals to identify enforcement strategies that place a greater emphasis on prevention efforts designed to inform and educate the public about the dangers and risks associated with E - cigarette use. From a law enforcement perspective, the IPR Center remains at the forefront of efforts to increase information sharing with public and private sectors to combat the illegal importation and distribution of counterfeit E -cigarette products that can be used to deliver other drugs, including marijuana. During FY 2020, the IPR Center's Outreach and Training Section assisted with the coordination of approximately 8 meetings with industries and coalitions including BG Products, JUUL, Specialized B icycles, Target, Adobe, Gemological Institute of America, TruTag Technologies, and National Governors Association. IPR Center HSI personnel assigned to the National Cyber -Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) leverage the resources and analytical tools o f the NCFTA to identify domain names and networks affiliated with infringing activity in support of criminal investigations or potential civil enforcement action. (The NCFTA is a non -profit corporation that conducts real -time information sharing and analy sis with subject matter experts in the public and private sectors and academia.) CBP's multi- faceted communication with IP stakeholders includes daily interaction with industry regarding enforcement activities, formal meetings involving both trade facilitation and enforcement efforts, and participation in numerous national trade events . CBP's stakeholder engagement includes: Regular conference calls with the IPR working group of the Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee (COAC) and quarterly public meetings with COAC members; Daily interaction with stakeholders affected by CBP's IP enforcement efforts at the ports of entry, and nationally through CBP's ten industry -aligned Centers of Excellence and Expertise (Centers), the IP -focused staff at headquarters, the IPR Center in the Washington D.C. metro area ; Participation in na tional and local trade events, industry meetings, speaking engagements, and rights holder and industry -specific right holder roundtables. Throughout FY 2020, CBP collaborated with industry in the form of an e -commerce task force to identify and address t he complexities and challenges associated with the increases in small packages due to the worldwide proliferation of online and mobile technologies. The DHS Private Sector Office (PSO) continues to coordinate U.S. government -wide efforts to catalyze and su pport private sector and non- governmental -based counter -illicit trade activities. On the international stage, PSO seeks to coordinate conferences and workshops in key global locations, e.g. Asia, Eastern Europe, Western Hemisphere, to collaborate on U.S. and international government efforts to detect and disrupt illicit trade activities through the sharing of best practices, approaches, and to bolster enforcement efforts. The U.S. Department of State is Page 71 of 177 key to this effort as their respective Missions work with host governments to strengthen their enforcement regimes. Educating the Public Changing public attitudes toward infringing activities remains essential to an effective intellectual property enforcement strategy. DHS activities during FY 20 20 included: CBP's Centers of Excellence and Expertise have been heavily involved in the development and implementation of the trade intelligence concept, a CBP effort to establish formal linkages with the private sector to develop actionable intelligence. As part of these efforts, the Centers engage in continual dialogue, information sharing, and trend analysis (e.g., with the pharmaceutical industry) in order to safeguard the American public from substandard, counterfeit, or otherwise illegal products. CB P proactively and frequently issues national and local press releases, and social media notifications to educate the public on counterfeiting. In FY 2020, CBP issued approximately 110 IPR- related press releases. In FY 2020, CBP continued the Truth Behind Counterfeits IPR Public Awareness Campaign to educate the public of the many harms associated with the purchase of counterfeit goods. The goal of the campaign is to increase consumer conscientiousness by making people aware that buying counterfeits is not a victimless crime and to encourage them to shop from reputable sources. The sixth phase of the campaign ran at major U.S. airports (Miami, New York, Charlotte, Denver, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore) during the busy 2019 holiday travel period. The campaign ads were placed on large scale electronic bulletin boards at these seven airports. Additionally, the campaign included a digital component with the ads appearing on websites for people in these same locations. During this phase the campaign and its messages about responsible consumer behavior were viewed over 100 million times. To supplement the messages of the IPR awareness campaign CBP organized and facilitated five Truth Behind Counterfeits road shows. These events took place during the winter of 2019 at the Miami, New York, Dallas, Denver and Minneapolis airports and consisted of relevant personnel having conversations with the traveling public about the many hazardous impacts that often come from the purchase of counterfeit goods. CISA and the FBI jointly released a Public Service Announcement on the People's Republic of China's targeting of COVID -19 research organizations on May 13, 2020. CISA and FBI encourage d COVID -19 research organizations to review and apply the announcement's recommended mitigations to prevent surreptitious review or theft of COVID -19-related material. Cooperating with Foreign Law Enforcement As discussed above, DHS law enforcement agencies regularly cooperate with other Federal law enforcement agencies and with law enforcement offices in other countries. Below are especially notable examples of DHS cooperation with foreign law enforcement. Page 72 of 177 In FY 2020, as discussed above, U.S. law enforcement and Federal agencies - including the IPR Center through HSI, CBP, and FDA - participated in Operation Pangea, a global enforcement effort led by INTERPOL that is aimed at disrupting organized crime networks behind the illicit online sale of fake drugs. The majority of Pangea participant countries conducted a week of coordinated enforcement efforts from March 3 -10, 2020. At this time, planning of Operation Pangea for 2021 has been delayed to allow authorities throughout the world to pivot towards managing COVID -19 related outbreaks and criminal activity in their respective countries. As also discussed above, in November 2019, the IPR Center and Europol concluded Operation IOS Cyber Monday/Project TransAtlantic X in collaboration with INTERPOL. Over 30,506 infringing domains were seized. Through the U.S.- China IP Criminal Enforcement Working Group, DOJ and U.S. law enforcement (including HSI and FBI) maintain a steady exchange of information and case leads with Chinese law enforcement, resulting in successful operations to disrupt the manufacture of counterfeit items, such as airbags, pharmaceuticals, batteries, electronic components, and luxury items. In FY 2020, collaboration continued, but there was limited investigative success due to realignment of resources within the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) of the People's Republic of China . During FY20 20, the IPR Center continued to host numerous foreign government officials with an interest in IP enforcement. Among the many international delegations were representatives from Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Romania, Spain, Poland, Bulgaria, and the EU (including EUIPO) . On November 8, 2018, CBP and Japan Customs signed a Letter of Intent regarding strengthening Bilateral Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement on a Pilot Basis (LOI). The two customs agencies have exchanged IPR seizure data of shipments from China for August and September 2018. Enhancing IP Enforcement through International Organi zations The U.S. Government continues its efforts to improve enforcement of IPR through a number of international organizations. During FY 2019, CBP and the State Department continued to support the further development and deployment of the WCO Cargo Tar geting System (CTS), which was successfully piloted in 2013. The CTS has the potential to enhance cooperation between the United States and foreign partners through targeting efforts to identify and interdict counterfeit products. It allows foreign customs administrations to receive electronic cargo manifest data to identify high -risk shipments at import, export, and transshipment across the full range of customs threats, including trade in counterfeit products. Attach\u00e9s at the WCO continue to train and support customs administrations in CTS operation. Capacity Building and Training DHS engages in training and capacity building programs to strengthen intellectual property awareness and enforcement internationally. Page 73 of 177 CBP provided trainers for Departme nt of Justice and HSI -led regional international forums on IP enforcement for foreign governments . In FY 2020, this HSI -led training occurred in the Dominican Republic. The IPR Center works closely with partner agencies, overseas attach\u00e9s, and U.S. embassies to deliver training and support capacity building through such venues as the interagency International Law Enforcemen t Academy (ILEA) program; training events delivered by the USPTO and INTER POL; and the country -specific and regional programs that are funded by the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (State INL) and DOJ International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Section (formerly Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordinator - IPLEC) in conjunction with HSI Attach\u00e9 offices directs, organizes and delivers regional IPR training in the form of lectures and presentations to foreign customs, police, prosecutors, and magistrates. The IPR Center training programs are usually 3- 5 days in length and focus on IPR enforcement, in particular on investigation and prosecution of IPR violations and associated c rimes, such as smuggling and money laundering. The training programs are interactive workshops led by subject matter experts and focus particular on health and safety counterfeited items such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, automotive parts, and health and beauty products. With the growing number of e -Commerce marketplaces, the training programs have an Internet -investigations focus as well. Private sector representatives or associations are also invited to participate in many of the training programs to highlight the challenges their industry sector may face in a particular region and to highlight the necessity of government and industry cooperation. In FY 20 20, the IPR Center participated in 26 international training and outreaches in support of these programs. HSI continues to work closely with its law enforcement counterparts, particularly those who received training in IP enforcement. The following are examples of events that HSI either organized or supported via this program.

Page 77 of 177 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Page 78 of 177 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE The Department of Justice (the \"Department\" or \"DOJ\")1 submits the following Fiscal Year 2019 (\"FY 2019\") annual report to the United States Congress pursuant to Section 404 of the Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008 (\"PRO IP Act\" or \"Act\"), Pub. L. No. 110- 403.2 The Act imposes a number of annual reporting requirements on the Attorney General, including actions the Department has taken to implement Title IV of the Act (\"Department of Justice Programs\") and \"a summary of the efforts, activities, and resources the [Department] has allocated to the enforcement, investigation, and prosecution of intellectual property crimes.\" The Act requires similar reporting by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") on its intellec tual property (\"IP\") enforcement efforts pursuant to Title IV of the Act. To the extent a particular request seeks information maintained by the FBI, the Department respectfully refers Congress to the FBI Fiscal Year 2019 Report to Congress on Intellectua l Property Enforcement (\"FBI's Annual Report\"). Section 404(a) of the PRO IP Act requires the Attorney General to report annually to Congress on the Department's efforts to implement eight specified provisions of Title IV during the prior fiscal year. Those provisions and the Department's efforts to implement them during FY 2019 ( i.e., October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019) are set forth below. In addition, working closely with the Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (\"IPEC \"), the Department contributed to the FY 2017- 2019 Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement, as it did with the 2013 Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement (June 2013), the Administration's Strategy on Mitigating the The ft of U.S. Trade Secrets (February 2013), the Administration's White Paper on Intellectual Property Enforcement Legislative Recommendations (March 2011), and the IPEC's annual reports, among other things. The Department continues to participate in a number of IPEC -led working groups. 1 Appendix A (in this section) contains a glossary of acronyms referenced throughout this report. 2 The FY 2020 Pro- IP Act Report was not yet available at the time of publication, so the FY 2019 report has been reproduced here. Page 79 of 177 (a)(1) State and Local Law Enforcement Grants In FY 2019, t he Office of Justice Programs (\"OJP\") awarded grants to support state and local IP law enforcement task forces under statutory authority provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, Public Law No. 116- 6, 133 Stat. 13, 113, and as informed by Section 401 of the PRO IP Act. The Intellectual Property Enforcement Program (\"IPEP\"), as the grant program is known, is designed to provide national support through training and technical assistance and improve the capacity of state and local criminal justice systems to address criminal IP enforcement, including prosecution, prevention, training, and technical assistance. Under the program, grant recipients e stablish and maintain effective collaboration and coordination between state and local law enforcement, including prosecutors, multi -jurisdictional task forces, and appropriate federal agencies, including the FBI and United States Attorneys' Offices. The i nformation shared under the program includes information about the investigation, analysis, and prosecution of matters involving IP offenses as they relate to violations of state and local criminal statutes. The program is administered by the Bureau of Jus tice Assistance (\"BJA\"), a component of OJP. In FY 2019, OJP was able to grant six awards totaling $2,254,345 to local and state law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies. The following FY 2019 new awards cover expenses related to: performing criminal en forcement operations; educating the public to prevent, deter, and identify criminal violations of IP laws; establishing task forces to conduct investigations, forensic analyses, and prosecutions; and acquiring equipment to conduct investigations and forens ic analyses of evidence. \"(1) With respect to grants issued under Section 401, the number and identity of State and local law enforcement grant applicants, the number of grants issued, the dollar value of each grant, including a break down of such value showing how the recipient used the funds, the specific purpose of each grant, and the reports from recipients of the grants on the efficacy of the program supported by the grant. The Department of Justice shall use the information provided by the grant recipients to produce a statement for each individual grant. Such stateme nt shall state whether each grantee has accomplished the purposes of the grant as established in Section 401(b). Those grantees not in compliance with the requirements of this title shall be subject, but not limited to, sanctions as described in the Financ ial Guide issued by the Office of Justice Programs at the Department of Justice.\" Page 80 of 177 Since the inception of the program, OJP has awarded over $30 million in grants to support state and local law enforcement agencies, training and technical assistance providers, and an IP public education campaign. Of this total amount of funding, state and local law enforcement agencies have received over $23 million. Throughout the duration of the program, these agencies have made seizures totaling over $850 million, which includes counterfeit merchandise and other property as well as currency. During a one - year period July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019, grantees reported seizures totaling $179,721,197 ($178,562,461.40 in counterfeit merchandise and other property, and $1,158,735.95 in currency). Over this same one -year period, grantees engaged in the following law enforcement activities: 305 individuals were arrested for violations of IP laws; 138 state and local IP search warrants were served; and 407 piracy/counterfeiting organizations were disrupted or dismantled. This data comes from the Bureau of Justices Assistance's Performance Measurement Tool (PMT) for recipients of IPEP awards. Examples of how state and local law enforcement used prior IPEP grants include: The Essex County Prosecutors Office IP Unit/Task Force conducted an investigation in conjunction with the New Jersey Department of the Treasury Division of Taxation Office of Criminal Investigation. The Department of Homeland Security also assisted in this investigation. This investigation targeted numerous individuals and businesses that were suspected of selling smuggled cigarettes into New Jersey with counterfeit New Jersey tax stamps affixed to them. This investigation resulted in the execution of seve n search warrants, the arrest of four individuals, the seizure of numerous bank accounts, the seizure of Award Number Grantee Amount 2019 -H3269 -IL- IP Office $400,000.00 2019 - CA-IP City of Los Angeles $352,000.00 2019 -H3235 - NC-IP North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State $352,000.00 2019 -H3250 -NJ- IP Essex County Prosecutor's Office $350,345.00 -H3261 PA-IP Pennsylvania State Police $400,000.00 2019 -H3252 - MO-IP City of Saint Louis Metropolitan Police Department $400,000.00 Page 81 of 177 over $100,000.00 is U.S. currency, and the seizure of over 500 counterfeit tax stamps. These charges are pending prosecution in Essex County Superior C ourt. The Virginia State Police had several major accomplishments during this reporting period. The Virginia State Police continues to work with Pfizer on a very large prescription fraud drug ring within Virginia. The Virginia State Police are working sev eral counterfeit credit card cases that have resulted in leads in other states involving the same suspects. These cases are still under investigation. The Virginia State Police also continued to utilize shared databases to work with other agencies to provi de intelligence regarding its investigation. The liaison activity established by the Virginia State Police has allowed them to be more specialized in assisting and educating other law enforcement agencies about the fight against intellectual property crime s in Virginia. The agents trained also have conducted training to make civilians and other law enforcement agencies aware of intellectual property crimes. Six agents have attained the status of Certified Fraud Examiner. The Virginia State Police also were able to utilize its funds to purchase equipment and supplies to aid in their investigations. BJA continues to support one -day training events on IP rights for state and local law enforcement agencies across the country through cooperative agreements with the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C). Between October 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019, NW3C conducted these training sessions for 212 attendees from 85 agencies in 6 locations. During this time, NW3C also conducted technical assistance for five IP EP Grantee task forces. Additional technical assistance was provided by request to two other law enforcement agencies. NW3C's online IP resource to improve investigative and prosecutorial approaches to the problem of IP theft was utilized by 159 students. Since the inception of the program, BJA has supported the following: 110 trainings for 2,609 attendees from 1,301 agencies 16 seminars for 538 attendees from 185 agencies 39 technical assistance visits for 568 attendees from 130 agencies 295 students r epresenting 277 agencies have accessed the online IP resource NW3C launched the website IPTheft.org to provide a common place for IPEP grantees and law enforcement to find training, resources, and technical assistance that will aid in their intellectual property theft investigations. The website also contains legal resources for prosecutors and judges as well as resources for the general public. In the coming year, NW3C plans to promote the website through its communication platforms and grow the site in t erms of available training and resources. Page 82 of 177 Examples of how attendees utilized the training and technical assistance include: NW3C instructors performed a technical assistance visit with multiple law enforcement agencies in Louisville, Kentucky. Louisville Metro Police executed a search warrant and seized over $1.5 million worth of counterfeit goods. This was a misdemeanor offense under Kentucky laws. After discussing the penalties imposed for similar offenses in other states with the NW3C instruc tors, the Kentucky law enforcement officials began pursuing legislative changes to the intellectual property rights statutes in the state of Kentucky to increase the penalties for these types of crimes. During a technical assistance visit to the North Car olina Secretary of State's IP task force, an NW3C IP Instructor facilitated collaboration between Homeland Security Investigations agents in Roanoke, Virginia and North Carolina law enforcement officials to investigate intellectual property rights violatio ns discovered at a mailing facility in North Carolina with counterfeit items also going to Western Virginia. These investigations developed evidence of probable cause, leading to multiple search warrants, arrests, and thousands of dollars of counterfeit goods seized, as well as an ongoing collaborative relationship between Virginia and North Carolina to combat intellectual property crime. (a)(2) Additional Agents of FBI Pleas e see the FBI's Annual Report, which will be submitted separately pursuant to Section 404(c) of the PRO IP Act. \"(2) With respect to the additional agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation authorized under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 402(a), the number of investigations and actions in which such agents were engaged, the type of each action, the resolution of each action, and any penalties imposed in each action.\" Page 83 of 177 (a)(3) FBI Training Please see the FBI's Annual Report, which will be submitted separately pursuant to Section 404(c) of the PRO IP Ac t. (a)(4) Organized Crime Plan As in FY 2009 through FY 2018, Congress did not appropriate funds to support Section 402(b) of the PRO IP Act in FY 2019.3 Nevertheless, the Department has continued to take a number of actions in an effort to implement this provision. The actions, described below, include (1) increased information shar ing and coordination and (2) training and outreach. However, the Department will not be able to provide a specific number of prosecutions directly resulting from these increased efforts for at least two reasons. First, the Department can retrieve statistic al information from its database based on the statute charged but not based on the type of defendant or group that committed the offense. Second, it is difficult to determine whether prosecutions involving organized crime groups have resulted directly from these organized crime plan efforts or other ongoing efforts. In addition to the ongoing activities detailed in PRO IP Act Reports for fiscal years 2009 through 2019, the Department has taken the following additional actions to address this important issue: 3 Section 402(b) provides that \"[s]ubject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this subsection, and not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Attorney General, through the United States Attorneys' Offices, the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property section, and the Organized Crime and Racketeering section of the Department of Justice, and in consultation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other Federal law enforcement agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, shall create and implement a comprehensive, long -range plan to investigate and prosecute international organized crime syndicates engaging in or supporting crimes relating to the theft of intellectual propert y.\" \"(3) With respect to the training program authorized under section 402(a)(4), the number of agents of the Federal Bur eau of Investigation participating in such program, the elements of the training program, and the subject matters covered by the program.\" \"(4) W ith respect to the organized crime plan authorized under section 402(b), the number of organized crime investigations and prosecutions resulting from such plan.\" Page 84 of 177 Increased Information Sharing and Coordination The Department, through the Criminal Division, is continuing to coordinate with federal investigatory agencies to work with the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center in an ong oing effort to develop and implement a mechanism to both contribute data to the Center to address intelligence gaps as they relate to IP, among other things. The Center has provided operational, intelligence, and financial support to investigations where international organized crime groups are involved in IP offenses. Training and Outreach In FY 2019, the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (\"CCIPS\") of the DOJ's Criminal Division has continued to strengthen the Department's ability to combat organized IP crime through training and outreach with international counterparts and organizations, which often encounter IP crime committed by organized crime groups. These training and outreach activities are described in section (a)(7)(B) of this Report.

Primary investigative and prosecutorial responsibility within the Department rests with the FBI, the United States Attorneys' Offices, CCIPS in the Criminal Division, the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section (\"CES\") in the National Security Divis ion (\"NSD\"), and, with regard to offenses arising under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Consumer Protection Branch of the Civil Division. Each of these components is described briefly below. In addition to enforcing existing criminal laws protecting IP, the Department has continued its tradition of contributing to major legislative developments updating criminal IP laws, including: the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, which was notable not only for creating a federal civil cause of action for misapp ropriation of trade secrets, but also increased criminal fines for organizational defendants who steal commercial trade secrets, and allowed prosecutors to bring racketeering charges based on the theft of trade secrets; the Foreign and Economic Espionage P enalty Enhancement Act of 2012, which increased fines for theft of trade secrets committed with the intent to benefit a foreign entity; the Theft of Trade Secrets Clarification Act of 2012, which clarified that the Economic Espionage Act applies to trade s ecrets that are \"related to a product or service used or intended for use in interstate or foreign commerce\"; the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2012, which enhanced penalties for certain offenses involving counterfeit military goods; the Food a nd Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which created a new offense for trafficking in counterfeit drugs; the PRO IP Act of 2008; the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005, which criminalized \"camcording\" (the illegal copying of movies in a theater) and unauthorized distribution of pre -release works over the Internet; the No Electronic Theft Act of 1997, which criminalized the unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copyrighted works even without a commercial purpose or financial gain; and the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, which criminalized the theft of trade secrets, including economic espionage.4 The Department made substantial contributions to the criminal enforcement proposals contained in the Administration's White Paper on Intellectual Property Enforcement Legislative Recommendations (March 2011), the majority of which (described above) were enacted into law, with the exception of felony penalties for copyright infringement by online streaming. The Department looks forward to working with Congress as it considers additional proposals. The Department coordinates closely with IPEC in addressing the Administration's priorities on IP enforcement and implementing the IPEC's FY 2017- 2019 Joint Strategic Plan (\"JSP\") on Intellectu al Property Enforcement. As part of the JSP implementation, the Department participates in a variety of interagency working groups designed to address topics including engagement with private stakeholders; money laundering / criminal financing; 4 For an overview of the Department's policies and efforts in the five years prior to the enactment of the PRO IP Act in October 2008, the Department's PRO IP Act First Annual Report 2008- 2009 may be found online at https://www.justice.gov/iptf/pro -ip-act-reports . The Department's FY 2010- FY 2018 PRO IP Reports are available at the same location. Page 87 of 177 engagement with other countries; domestic application of the \"Whole of Government\" and \"Specialized Office\" approaches to IPR protection and enforcement; storage, destruction, and disposal of seized counterfeit goods; trade secrets / cybersecurity; and advancing the JSP's \"Calls for Research.\" CCIPS and CHIP Program The Department carries out its overall IP criminal prosecution mission through the United States Attorneys' Offices and CCIPS, which works closely with a network of over 270 specially - trained federal pr osecutors who make up the Department's Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (\"CHIP\") program. CCIPS is a section within the Criminal Division consisting of a specialized team of forty prosecutors who are devoted to enforcing laws related to compute r and IP crimes. Fifteen CCIPS attorneys are assigned exclusively to IP enforcement. These attorneys prosecute criminal cases, assist prosecutors and investigative agents in the field, and help develop and implement the Department's overall IP enforcement strategy and legislative priorities. CCIPS attorneys are available to provide advice and guidance to agents and prosecutors on a 24/7 basis. CCIPS attorneys also provide training on criminal enforcement of IP laws to prosecutors and investigative agents both domestically and abroad. CCIPS also houses the Cybercrime Lab, which provides support in evaluating digital evidence in IP cases. The Lab is currently staffed with nine computer forensics experts. In addition to evaluating digital evidence, the Lab's e xperts have provided extensive training on the use of digital forensics tools in IP cases to law enforcement audiences around the world. CCIPS continues to place a high priority on fostering international cooperation and coordination of criminal IP enfor cement efforts. The Section has developed relationships with foreign law enforcement through international casework as well as through training and outreach. An important component of the Department's international enforcement efforts is the U.S. Transnati onal and High Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement Network (\"GLEN\") of regional International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (\"ICHIP\") attorneys (formerly, the Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordinator (\"IPLEC\") program). With the support of the State Department, DOJ has posted ICHIPs in Bucharest, Romania; Hong Kong; Sao Paolo, Brazil; Abuja, Nigeria; Bangkok, Thailand; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and The Hague, Netherlands. The GLEN also now includes two ICHIPs based in Washington, D.C. to assist the regional ICHIP Advisors with the subject matter areas of Global Dark Web and Cryptocurrency issues and Global Internet Based Fraud and Public Health issues, and a Global Cyber Forensic Advisor also based in Washington, D.C. In 2020, the Network wi ll expand to include regional ICHIPs based in Panama City, Panama; Zagreb, Croatia; and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The CHIP program is a network of experienced and specially -trained federal prosecutors who aggressively pursue computer crime and IP offenses. Each of the 94 United States Attorneys' Offices has one or more CHIP coordinator. In addition, 25 United States A ttorneys' Page 88 of 177 Offices have CHIP Units, with two or more CHIP attorneys.5 CHIP attorneys have four major areas of responsibility including: (1) prosecuting computer crime and IP offenses; (2) serving as the district's legal counsel on matters relating to those offenses and the collection of electronic evidence; (3) training prosecutors and law enforcement personnel in the region; and (4) conducting public and industry outreach and awareness activities. CES and the NSCS Network Within NSD, CES \u2014one of NSD's principal litigating components \u2014is responsible for coordinating and conducting investigations and prosecutions of a wide variety of national security offenses, including economic espionage.6 In June 2015, NSD, recognizing the increasingly acute and costly threat that economic espionage poses to the U.S. national and economic security, released its \"Strategic Plan for Countering the Economic Espionage Threat.\" This plan aims to heighten awareness of the threat in order to deter and mitigate economic espionage. The plan also seeks to coordinate efforts within the government to counter the threat, including through operational disruption, increased and improved training, and the provision of technical advice and expertise. In January 2017, CES released its \"Str ategic Plan for Countering the National Security Cyber Threat,\" which recognizes that our nation's adversaries are also stealing intellectual property through cyber -enabled means and proposes a strategy specifically designed to disrupt such efforts. NSD is currently in the process of implementing both plans. In 2012, the Department established the National Security Cyber Specialists (\"NSCS\") Network to create a \"one -stop- shop\" for attorneys, investigators, and members of the private sector looking to comba t national security cyber thefts \u2014including economic espionage and trade secret theft \u2014with all appropriate legal tools. Each U.S. Attorney's Office has at least one representative to the NSCS Network, and in each of the last six years NSCS Network represent atives have convened in the D.C. area for specialized training focusing on legal and other issues at the intersection of national security and cybersecurity. The NSCS representative provides technical and specialized assistance to his or her colleagues wit hin the relevant U.S. Attorney's Office, and serves as a point of contact for coordination with the Department's headquarters. At headquarters, all NSD components, CCIPS, and other relevant sections of the Criminal Division are members of the Network. The Department relies on the NSCS Network to disseminate intelligence and other information to the field, to train prosecutors on investigating national security cybercrimes, and to coordinate and de -conflict national security cyber investigations. 5 CHIP Units are currently located in Alexandria, Virginia; Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Dallas, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Missouri; Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; Newark, New Jersey; New Haven, Connecticut; New York, New York; Orlando, Florida; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Sacramento, California; San Diego, California; San Jose, California; Seattle, Washington; and Washington, D.C. 6 In 2015, CES changed its name from the \"Counterespionage Section\" to better reflect the scope of its work. Page 89 of 177 Interagen cy Coordination In addition to investigating and prosecuting IP crime, the Department has worked closely with other federal agencies directly, and through the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (\"IPR Center\"), to improve IP enforcem ent domestically and overseas.7 These activities have included training investigators and prosecutors in the investigation and prosecution of IP crimes; contributing to the Office of the United States Trade Representative's Special 301 process of evaluatin g the adequacy of our trading partners' criminal IP laws and enforcement regimes; helping to catalogue and review the United States government's IP training programs abroad; and implementing an aggressive international program to promote cooperative enforc ement efforts with our trading partners and to improve substantive laws and enforcement regimes in other countries. (a)(7)(B) Summary of Overall Successes and Failures of Such Policies and Efforts The Department achieved notable success in FY 2019 both domestically and abroad. Some of these efforts are highlighted below: Prosecution Initiatives The Department continues to prioritize IP investigations and prosecutions that involve (1) health and safety, (2) trade secret theft or economic espionage, and (3) large -scale commercial counterfeiting and online piracy. The Department has also increased its focus on IP crimes that are committed or facilitated by use of the Internet or perpetrated by organized criminal networks. (1) Health and Safety The Department's health and safety initiative brings together private, state, and federal enforcement resources to address the proliferation of counterfeit goods posing a danger to consumers, including counterfeit and illegally prescribed pharmaceuticals, automotive parts, and military goods. In FY 2019, this initiative resulted in a number of significant prosecutions, including those set forth below: 7 These federal agencies include Customs and Border P rotection (\"CBP\"), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal Investigations, the Department of C ommerce's International Trade Administration, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the Defense Logistics Agency 's Office of Inspector General , Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investig ations (\"ICE -HSI\"), the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\"), the General Service Administration's Office of Inspector General, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Office of Inspector General , the Department of State's Office of International Intellectual Property Enforcement, the Army Criminal Investigation Command's Major Proc urement Fraud Unit, the Air Force Office of Special Investigat ions, the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General, the Federal Maritime Commission, and the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General.

The statutes were grouped together to eliminate double -counting of cases and/or defendants where more than one statute was charged against the same defendant. However, this chart may not include cases or defendants if only a conspiracy to violate one of these offenses was charged. Page 120 of 177 In addition, the chart below details FY 2019 statistics for criminal IP cases broken down by type of charge.10 Charge Cases charged Percentage Trademark Trafficking in counterfeit goods, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2320 31 48% Copyright Act Economic espionage, 18 U.S.C. 1831 Theft of trade secrets, 18 3% 22% Total 64 100% (a)(7)(D) Department -Wide Assessment of the Resources Devoted to Enforcement of IP Crimes The Criminal Division currently devotes fourteen full -time attorneys, along with paralegals and support staff, in CCIPS to IP issues. CCIPS also provides substantial support to the IPR Center, assigning at least one attorney, and sometimes more, to help id entify and de - conflict investigative leads, as well as develop and execute national enforcement initiatives. The CHIP Network consists of AUSAs who are specially trained in the investigation and prosecution of IP and computer crimes. Every U.S. Attorney 's Office has at least one CHIP attorney, and those districts that have historically faced the highest concentration of IP and high- tech crimes tend to have multiple CHIP attorneys. Over the last year, more than twenty NSD attorneys have worked on hacki ng investigations (most of which involve the theft of information, including but not limited to trade secrets) and economic espionage investigations. As described above, the NSCS Network consists of more than 100 AUSAs and attorneys at Department headquart ers who receive specialized annual training in the investigation and prosecution of national security cyber offenses, including the theft of IP and other information. Under the ICHIP program (formerly known as the IPLEC program), DOJ has had a Department attorney stationed in Bangkok, Thailand, since January 2006 to handle IP issues in 10 EOUSA compiled the statistics for number of cases charged broken down by IP statute. These statistics may not reflect cases where only a conspiracy to violate one of these offenses was charged, and there may be double -counting of cases where more than one statute was charged in the same case. Page 121 of 177 Asia. Between November 2007 and March 2011, a separate DOJ attorney was stationed in Sofia, Bulgaria, in order to handle IP issues in Eastern Europe. While funding for this position expired in 2011, DOJ has worked with the Department of State to post a DOJ attorney in Bucharest, Romania since 2015 to continue to handle IP issues in that region. DOJ also expanded its ICHIP program in FY 2015 by placing a DOJ attorney in Brasi lia, Brazil, for a six -month term. With the assistance of the State Department, DOJ expanded the ICHIP program in FY 2016 by posting new regional ICHIPs in Hong Kong and Sao Paolo, Brazil. In FY 2017, the State Department and DOJ prepared to field a new IC HIP position in Abuja, Nigeria. The Nigeria ICHIP deployed in October 2017. Most recently, in FY 2019, the State Department and DOJ added new regional ICHIP positions in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and The Hague, Netherlands, two new ICHIP Advisors based in Wa shington, D.C. with the subject matter expertise in Global Dark Web and Cryptocurrency issues and Global Internet Based Fraud and Public Health issues, and a Global Cyber Forensic Advisor also based in Washington, D.C. In 2020, the ICHIP Network will expand to include regional ICHIPs in Panama City, Panama; Zagreb, Croatia; and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This will bring the total number of ICHIPs to twelve, plus one Global Cyber Forensic Advisor. In addition to evaluating digital evidence, the CCIPS Cybercrime Lab technicians have provided extensive training on the use of digital forensics tools in IP cases to law enforcement audiences around the world. IP enforcement is also an integral part of the mission of four sections of the Department's Civil Division: the Intellectual Property Section, the National Courts Section, the Consumer Protection Branch, and the Civil Appellate Staff. Through the Civil Division's Intellectual Property Section, the Department brings affirmative cases when United States' IP is infringed, including Uniform Domain- Name Dispute -Resolution Policy proceedings where domain owners have used trademarks owned by the United States in a manner that is likely to confuse the publ ic. The National Courts Section initiates civil actions to recover various penalties or customs duties arising from negligent or fraudulent import transactions, many of which include importation of counterfeit goods. The National Courts Section also defends CBP enforcement of the ITC's Section 337 exclusion orders at the Court of International Trade; these orders are an important tool for patent enforcement. The Consumer Protection Branch conducts civil and criminal litigation under the Food, Drug, and Cosm etic Act, including prosecuting counterfeit drug and medical device offenses and assisting AUSAs throughout the country with their counterfeit pharmaceutical and device cases. Finally, the Civil Appellate Staff represents the United States in copyright and trademark cases in the courts of appeals, including participating as an amicus or intervenor in private IP litigation involving important government interests and defending decisions of the Copyright Office and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office against constitutional and statutory challenges. Page 122 of 177 (a)(8) Efforts to Increase Efficiency The Department works hard to ensure the effective use of limited resources devo ted to fighting IP crime. One of the most important ways to reduce duplication of effort is to ensure that law enforcement agencies are pursuing unique case leads, and that prosecutors are not following prosecution strategies that duplicate those in other districts. To that end, CCIPS continues to provide ongoing support to the IPR Center in Arlington, Virginia. Among other things, the IPR Center serves as an investigation clearinghouse for FBI, ICE -HSI, CBP, FDA, and other agencies. CCIPS also works closel y with the CHIP Network to assist in coordinating national prosecution initiatives. Along similar lines, NSD works closely with the NSCS Network to assist in coordinating national prosecution initiatives designed to counter the national security cyber threat. Department attorneys will continue to work with the IPR Center and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force to identify and de -conflict investigative leads, as well as assist the CHIP and NSCS Networks to ensure that investigations and prosecutions are streamlined, not duplicated, and that charges are brought in the appropriate venue. \"(8) A summary of the efforts, activities, and resources that the Department of Justice has taken to \u2014 (A) minimize duplicating the efforts, materials, facilities, and p rocedures of any other Federal agency responsible for the enforcement, investigation, or prosecution of intellectual property crimes; and (B) enhance the efficiency and consistency with which Federal funds and resources are expended to enforce, investigate, or prosecute intellectual property crimes, including the extent to which the Department has utilized existing personnel, materials, technologies, and facilities.\" Page 123 of 177 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CASES FY20 20 COPYRIGHT / PRE -RELEASE / CAMCORDING / COUNTERFEIT (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2319, 2318) Acting U.S. Attorney Announces Federal Charges And International Operation To Dismantle Online Piracy Group. On August 26, 2020, the indictments were unsealed charging Umar Ahmad, 39, George Bridi, 50, and Jonatan Correa, 36, with copyright infringement. Bridi's indictment also included wire fraud for involvement in the Sparks Group, an international piracy group involved in illegally distributing movies and television shows on the Internet, and conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate. Bridi, a citizen of the United Kingdom, was arrested on Sunday in Cyprus on an INTERPOL Red Notice based on the U.S. criminal charges. The United States will seek Bridi's extradition to stand trial in the United States. Correa was arrested in Olathe, Kansas, wher e he will be presented in federal court. Ahmad, a citizen of Norway, remains at large. According to the allegations contained in the Indictments, between 2011 and the present, Ahmad, Bridi, Correa, and others known and unknown, were members of the Spar ks Group. In furtherance of its scheme, the Sparks Group fraudulently obtained copyrighted DVDs and Blu-Ray discs from wholesale distributors in advance of their retail release date by, among other things, making various misrepresentations to the wholesal e distributors concerning the reasons that they were obtaining the discs prior to the retail release date. Sparks Group members then used computers with specialized software to compromise the copyright protections on the discs, a process referred to as \"c racking\" or \"ripping,\" and to reproduce and encode the content in a format that could be easily copied and disseminated over the Internet. They thereafter uploaded copies of the copyrighted content onto servers controlled by the Sparks Group, where other members further reproduced and disseminated the content on streaming websites, peer -to-peer networks, torrent networks, and other servers accessible to the public. The Sparks Group identified its reproductions by encoding the filenames of reproduced copyr ighted content with distinctive tags, and also uploaded photographs of the discs in their original packaging to demonstrate that the reproduced content originated from authentic DVDs and Blu- Ray discs. Ahmad and Bridi arranged for discs to be picked up, m ailed, or delivered from distributors located in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and New Jersey to other members of the Sparks Group, including Correa, prior to their official release date. Ahmad, Bridi, and Correa then reproduced, and aided and abetted the reproduc tion of, these discs by using computer software that circumvented copyright protections on the discs and reproducing the copyrighted content for further distribution on the Internet. The Sparks Group has caused tens of millions of dollars in losses to film production studios. dismantle -0 Page 124 of 177 New Kensington Woman Pleads to Copyright Infringement Charge.

On October 16, 2019, drug dealer Trevon Antone Lucas was sentenced in federal court to 15 years in prison for selling the counterfeit oxycodone pills containing deadly fentanyl that caused the overdose death of a La Jolla resident in June of 2018. Lucas, a resident of Highland, California, pleaded guilty in June to Distribution of Fentanyl Resulting in Death. In his plea, he admitted that he posted online advertisements for the illegal sale of presc ription pills. The investigation revealed that Lucas was warned about the danger of the pills he was selling on two separate occasions. In late 2017, Lucas was warned that the pills he was selling were counterfeit and contained fentanyl that was much str onger than oxycodone pills. Then, just two months prior to the victim's death in mid -2018, Lucas was explicitly warned that counterfeit pills containing fentanyl had caused the overdose of a San Diego resident. Lucas was undeterred and continued to sell the counterfeit pills. According to Lucas' plea agreement, on the evening of June 29, 2018, Lucas met the victim and sold him nine \"blues,\" a slang term for prescription oxycodone Page 132 of 177 pills, for $240. The \"blues\" purchased from Lucas were counterfeit and contained deadly fentanyl \u2014the same pills that Lucas had previously been warned about selling. The victim died after consuming the pills. The victim's mother found him dead in his room the following morning. Three other individuals, Cenclair Marie Fields, K evin Vandale Chandler and Donovan Adontas Carter were charged in the same indictment with conspiring with Lucas to distribute prescription hydrocodone pills. All three have since pleaded guilty and been sentenced.

As part of a plea agreement, Levandowski, 40, of Marin County, California, pleaded guilty to one of the 33 counts of trade secrets theft originally filed against him in 2019. In pleading guilty, Levandowski admitted that, from 2009 to 2016, he worked in Google's self -driving car program, known then as Project Chauffer. Levandowski admitted that, during this time, he was aware his empl oyment agreement required him to keep Google's valuable non- public information confidential. He also admitted knowing that the non- public information related to Project Chauffeur was sensitive and subject to the confidentiality requirement. Levandowski a dmitted that, in 2016, as he was preparing to leave Google, he downloaded thousands of Project Chauffer files onto his personal laptop. He also admitted downloading a variety of files from a corporate Google Drive repository. Among these files was an int ernal tracking document entitled \"Chauffeur TL weekly updates - Q4 2015.\" The update contained a variety of confidential details regarding the status of Project Chauffer. Levandowski admitted he downloaded this file with the intent to use it to benefit himself and Uber Technologies, Inc. As part of his plea agreement, Levandowski admitted that the stolen document was Google's trade secret, and that a reasonable estimate of the loss attributable to his theft was up to $1,500,000. As part of the plea agre ement, prosecutors agreed to dismiss the remaining 32 charges against Levandowski. However, prosecutors presented evidence to the court of Levandowski's broader course of conduct, including downloading thousands of files from an internal, password- protect ed Google server.

German elected to testify at the hearing and falsely testified that he was directed by a supervisor to copy and move the trade secret files. (SDGA, FBI) National Sentenced for Stealing Trade Secrets Worth $1 Billion. On February 27, 2020, Hongjin Tan, a Chinese National and U.S. legal permanent resident, was sentenced to 24 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $150,000 in restitution for stealing proprietary information worth more than $1 billion from his employer, a U.S. petroleum company. In November 2019, Tan pleaded guilty to theft of a trade secret, unauthorized transmission of a trade secret, and unauthorized possession of a trade secret. Tan was employed as an as sociate scientist for the U.S. petroleum company starting in June 2017 until his arrest in December 2018. The defendant was assigned to work within a group at the company with the goal of developing next generation battery technologies for stationary energy storage, specifically flow batteries. In his plea agreement, Tan admitted to intentionally copying and downloading research and development materials without authorization from his employer. On Dec. 11, 2018, Tan used a thumb drive to copy hundreds of files. He subsequently turned in his resignation and was escorted from the premises on December 12, 2018. Later that day, he returned the thumb drive, claiming that he had forgotten to do so before leaving his employer's property. Upon examination, it wa s discovered that there was unallocated space on the thumb drive, indicating five documents had previously been deleted. Investigators with the FBI searched Tan's premises and found an external hard drive. They discovered that the same five missing files from the thumb drive had been downloaded to the hard drive. Tan maintained the files on a hard drive so he could access the data at a later date. Further accessing the material would have been financially advantageous for Tan but caused significant financial damage to his Oklahoma employer. Sentencing is set for February 12, 2020.

(NDIL, FBI) -new Second Defendant Arrested in Case Alleging Theft of Trade Secrets from American Aviation Company . On October 2, 2019, an Italian national was arrested in Marino, Italy, pursuant to a provisional arrest request from the United States in a case involving two defendants charged with conspiring to steal trade secrets from an American aviation company. Alexander Yuryevich Korshunov, 57, and Maurizio Paolo Bianchi, 59, were charged by a criminal complaint on August 21, 2019. Korshunov was arrested on August 30 at Naples International Airport in Italy. The pair were indicted on September 11 with conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets and attempted theft of trade secrets. The indictment was unsealed on October 4, 2019. According to the indictment, Korshunov was an employee of a Russian state- owned company and had previously been a Russian public official whose service included the Minist ry of Foreign Affairs. Bianchi was a former director at Avio S.p.A, an Italian aerospace company until 2012. GE Aviation purchased the aerospace business from Avio S.p.A. in 2013 and operates the business as Avio Aero with its headquarters in Turin, Ital y. GE Aviation is one of the world's top aircraft engine suppliers and is headquartered in the Southern District of Ohio. After leaving Avio S.p.A, Bianchi went to work for a company called Aernova in Forli, Italy. Korshunov was employed at United Engine Corp (UEC), which included a subsidiary named Aviadvigatel (a branch of the Russian state -owned company), which had been \"entity listed\" by the U.S. Department of Commerce in September 2018 for acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Aernova and Aviadvigatel had a contract during the time of the alleged conduct. It is alleged that between 2013 and 2018, Bianchi - on behalf of Korshunov - hired current or former employees of GE Aviation's Italian subsidi ary to do consulting work related to jet engine accessory gearboxes for Bianchi and Korshunov. The employees' statements of work typically stated that \"the holders of patent and intellectual property obtained as a result of the work are...the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation.\" Throughout the consulting, employees allegedly used trade secrets Page 138 of 177 owned by GE Aviation to create the technical report. The effort focused on accessory gearboxes made by Avio Aero, which are external engine com ponents that provide power to systems such as hydraulic pumps, generators and fuel pumps. The affidavit details that Korshunov arranged and paid for employees to meet with him in June 2013 at the Paris Air Show in Le -Bourget, France, and in 2014 in Milan, Italy, to discuss and revise the technical report. (SDOH, NSD- ESPIONAGE (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831) Chinese Citizen Sentenced For Economic Espionage, Theft Of Trade Secrets, And Conspiracy. On August 31, 2020, Hao Zhang, 41, of China, was s entenced to eighteen months in prison and ordered to pay $476,835 in restitution following his conviction at trial on charges of economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and conspiring to commit both offenses. On May 16, 2015, Zhang was arrested upon e ntry into the United States from the People's Republic of China (PRC). The 32- count indictment, which had previously been sealed, charged six individuals with economic espionage and theft of trade secrets for their roles in a long- running effort to obtain U.S. trade secrets for the benefit of universities and companies controlled by the PRC government. Evidence submitted during the course of the four-day bench trial demonstrated that, from 2010 to 2015, Zhang conspired to and did steal trade secrets from t wo companies: Avago, a designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of analog, digital, mixed signal and optoelectronics components and subsystems with a focus in semiconductor design and processing, headquartered in San Jose, California, and Singapore; and Skyworks, an innovator of high performance analog semiconductors headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts. It was found that Zhang intended to steal the trade secrets for the benefit of the People's Republic of China. According evidence pres ented during the bench trial, Zhang stole trade secrets relating the performance of wireless devices. Evidence at trial further showed that, in October 2006, Zhang and his co- conspirators started a business in China to compete with Avago and Skyworks. One of Zhang's co -conspirators, Wei Pang, started working at Avago at the same time. Zhang and Pang illicitly shared trade secrets with each other and with co- conspirators in China while they worked for the U.S. companies. Zhang and Pang then connected the ir venture to Tianjin University (TJU) in China, an instrumentality of the Chinese government. By 2009, they left their work in the United States to relocate to China, following a plan laid out by TJU officials to form another company, Novana, in the Caym an Islands. During that time, Zhang obtained patents in his own name using trade secret information he knew was stolen from Avago. Additional evidence demonstrated that Zhang engaged in economic espionage to help TJU and Zhang's Chinese company unfairly compete in the multi- billion dollar global market for cell phone RF filters. Zhang's sentencing hearing is scheduled for Aug. onnel charged with computer fraud, economic espionage and wire fraud for hacking into credit reporting agency Equifax. On February 10, 2020, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging four members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) wi th hacking into the computer systems of the credit reporting agency Equifax and stealing Americans' personal data and Equifax's valuable trade secrets. The nine -count indictment alleges that Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, Xu Ke, and Liu Lei were members of the PLA 's 54th Research Institute, a component of the Chinese military. They allegedly conspired with each other to hack into Equifax's computer networks, maintain unauthorized access to those computers, and steal sensitive, personally identifiable information of approximately 145 million American victims. According to the charges and other information presented in court, the defendants exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts Web Framework software used by Equifax's online dispute portal. They used this access to conduct reconnaissance of Equifax's online dispute portal and to obtain login credentials that could be used to further navigate Equifax's network. The defendants spent several weeks running queries to identify Equifax's database structure and s earching for sensitive, personally identifiable information within Equifax's system. Once they accessed files of interest, the conspirators then stored the stolen information in temporary output files, compressed and divided the files, and ultimately were able to download and exfiltrate the data from Equifax's network to computers outside the United States. In total, the attackers ran approximately 9,000 queries on Equifax's system, obtaining names, birth dates and social security numbers for nearly half o f all American citizens. The indictment also charges the defendants with stealing trade secret information, namely Equifax's data compilations and database designs. The defendants took steps to evade detection throughout the intrusion, as alleged in the indictment. They routed traffic through approximately 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries to obfuscate their true location, used encrypted communication channels within Equifax's network to blend in with normal network activity, and deleted compress ed files and wiped log files on a daily basis in an effort to eliminate records of their activity. The defendants are charged with three counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit economic espionage, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, as well as two counts of unauthorized access and intentional damage to a protected computer, one count of economic espionage, and three counts of wire fraud. (NDGA, (Under Seal) Chinese National Who Worked at Monsanto Indicted on Economic Espionage Charges. On November 21, 2019, Haitao Xiang, 42, formerly of Chesterfield, Missouri, was indicted by a federal grand jury on one count of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, three counts of economic espionage, one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets and three counts of theft of trade secrets. According to the indictment, Xiang was employed by Monsanto and its subsidiary, The Climate Corporation, from 2008 to 2017, where he worked Page 140 of 177 as an imaging scientist. Monsanto and The Climate Corporation developed a digital, on- line farming software platform that was used by farmers to collect, store, and visualize critical agricultural field data and increase and improve agricultural productivity for farmers. A critical component to the platform was a proprietary predictive algorithm referred to as the Nutrient Optimizer. Monsanto and The Climate Corporation considered the Nutrient Optimizer a valuable trade secret and their intellectual property. In June 2017, the day after leaving employment with Monsanto and The Climate Corporation, Xiang bought a one -way plane ticket to China. Before he could board his flight, Xiang was intercepted at the airport by federal officials who seized copies of the Nutrient Optimizer. - espionage -charges PRC State -Owned Company, Taiwan Company, and Three Individuals Charged With Economic Espionage. On November 1, 2018, an indictment was unsealed charging a state - owned enterprise of the People's Republic of China (PRC) with crimes related to a conspiracy to steal, convey, and possess stolen trade secrets of an American semiconductor company for the benefit of a company controlled by the PRC government. All of the defendants are charged with a conspiracy to commit economic espionage, among other crimes. The crimina l defendants are United Microelectronics Corporation (\"UMC\"), a Taiwan semiconductor foundry; Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, Co., Ltd. (\"Jinhua'\"), a state-owned enterprise of the PRC; and three Taiwan nationals: Chen Zhengkun, a.k.a. Stephen Chen, age 55; He Jianting, a.k.a. J.T. Ho, age 42; and Wang Yungming, a.k.a. Kenny Wang, age 44. UMC is a publicly listed semiconductor foundry company traded on the New York Stock Exchange; is headquartered in Taiwan; and has offices worldwide, including in Sunnyv ale, California. UMC mass produces integrated -circuit logic products based on designs and technology developed and provided by its customers. Jinhua is a state - owned enterprise of the PRC, funded entirely by the Chinese government, and established in February 2016 for the sole purpose of designing, developing, and manufacturing dynamic random -access memory (DRAM) technology. Prior to the events described in the indictment, the PRC did not possess DRAM, and the Central Government and State Council of the PRC publicly identified the development of DRAM and other microelectronics technology as a national economic priority. In addition, the United States filed a civil lawsuit seeking to enjoin the further transfer of the stolen trade secrets and to enjoin ce rtain defendants from exporting to the United States any products manufactured by UMC or Jinhua that were created using the trade secrets at issue. According to the indictment, the defendants were engaged in a conspiracy to steal the trade secrets of Micr on Technology, Inc. (Micron), a leader in the global semiconductor industry specializing in the advanced research, development, and manufacturing of memory products, DRAM. DRAM is a leading -edge memory storage device used in computer electronics. Micron is the only United States -based company that manufactures DRAM. According to the indictment, Micron maintains a significant competitive advantage in this field due in large part from its intellectual property, including its trade secrets that include deta iled, confidential information pertaining to the design, development, and manufacturing of advanced DRAM products. According to the indictment, Chen was a General Manager and Chairman of an electronics corporation that Micron acquired in 2013. Chen then became the president of a Micron subsidiary in Taiwan, Micron Memory Taiwan (\"MMT\"), responsible for Page 141 of 177 manufacturing at least one of Micron's DRAM chips. Chen resigned from MMT in July 2015 and began working at UMC almost immediately. While at UMC, Chen ar ranged a cooperation agreement between UMC and Fujian Jinhua whereby, with funding from Fujian Jinhua, UMC would transfer DRAM technology to Fujian Jinhua to mass -produce. The technology would be jointly shared by both UMC and Fujian Jinhua. Chen later b ecame the President of Jinhua and was put in charge of its DRAM production facility. While at UMC, Chen recruited numerous MMT employees, including Ho and Wang, to join him at UMC. Prior to leaving MMT, Ho and Wang both stole and brought to UMC several M icron trade secrets related to the design and manufacture of DRAM. Wang downloaded over 900 Micron confidential and proprietary files before he left MMT and stored them on USB external hard drives or in personal cloud storage, from where he could access t he technology while working at UMC. -economic- espionage Department of Justice Antitrust Division Business Reviews The Antitrust Division issued a number of business review letters relating to IP issues over the last year, including in response to the COVID -19 pandemic as discussed further below. The Department's business review procedure ( 28 CFR \u00a7 50.6) allows parties to ask the Antitrust Division for its enforcement intentions with respect to proposed conduct. This process provides transparency on the Department's enforcement policies and considerations to the parties involved as well as to the business community. Outreach To study how intellectual property rights, licensing, and collaboration promote competition and innovation in the life science sector, in September 2020, the Division held a joint workshop with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. The agencies in vited a variety of stakeholders from government, industry, research laboratories, and academia, who discussed the importance of intellectual property protection and procompetitive collaboration to innovation in life sciences.11 This workshop will help to i nform the Antitrust Division's policy development in this area in the future. COVID- 19 The Division has supported robust and balanced intellectual property protection during the COVID -19 pandemic. For example, the Division worked with other federal agencies to provide guidance on international efforts aimed at facilitating the licensing of intellectual property related to COVID -19. The Division also announced an expedited business review process for proposed conduct related to the pandemic. As part of this effort, the Division issued a favorable business 11 Promoting Innovation in the Life Science Sector and Supporting Pro -Competitive Collaborations: The Role 177 review letter to several pharmaceut ical companies planning to share information about their monoclonal antibody treatments targeting COVID -19.12 The Antitrust Division's Life Science Workshop, which it hosted jointly with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, also discussed the importance of intellectual property protection and procompetitive collaboration to innovation during the pandemic.13 12 Letter from the Hon.

The Department of S tate focuses on representing the interests of U.S. IP rights holders; deterring access to counterfeit and pirated goods that can harm consumers; and highlighting the integral role that IP rights protection plays in supporting creativity, innovation, and economic growth. Areas in which U.S. embassies work with their host governments include increasing political will for strengthening copyright, patent, trademark, and other IP protections, as well as combatting forced technology transfer, online piracy and counterfeit goods production and sale. With direction and support from ambassadors and deputy chiefs of mission, economic sections at embassies typically lead such engagement, along with support from U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) IP Attach\u00e9s and Department of State - funded Department of Justice (DOJ) International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (ICHIP) advisors . As the COVID- 19 pandemic struck, limiting in -person work and travel and forcing reduced staffing at overseas posts, the Department of State quickly shifted to telework. To limit all but the most critical in -person activities, the Department of State adopted widespread use of video- conferencing and other tech nologies, enabling the Department of State to continue crucial bilateral dialogues, create and participate in a broad range of IP -related events and activities, discuss IP issues with interagency partners, and advance U.S. IP priorities overseas. A sampl ing of bilateral engagement includes: Science and Technology Agreements (STAs): The United States finalized STAs with Finland, Hungary, Indonesia, North Macedonia, Slovenia, and Spain. All STAs include an IP rights annex. Free Trade Agreements (FTAs): T he United States began formal FTA negotiations via teleconferences with the United Kingdom in May 2020 and with Kenya in July 2020, both of which are expected to include detailed IP chapters.

The Department of State raises IP awareness internationally through public diplomacy events, including marking World Intellectual Property Day in countries around the world. This year, the White House issued a proclamation recognizing April 26, 2020 as World Intellectual Property Day in order to celebrate the \"benefits of intellectual property to our economy and country.\" The proclamation highlighted the links between strong IP protection and prosperity and public health and safety. In support of this effort, the Department of State's Diplomatic Note blog featured an essay on the importance of IP to health and safety. ( https://www.state.gov/world -ip-day-april-26- 2020%E2%80%AF%E2%80%AF/ ) Embassies also shared a video on the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) theme of \"Innovate for a Green Future,\" ran essay and/or video contests, and posted ambassadorial statements on IP's importance. These acti vities were especially important to highlight as malicious actors find new opportunities to exploit the coronavirus pandemic through counterfeit and pirated goods marketed online. These actors target vulnerable populations by promoting fraudulent, ineffec tive, or even harmful treatments and \"cures.\" INL also supports World IP Day by providing training and technical assistance to foreign enforcement partners to help them strengthen and enforce IP laws that ensure the prosperity of all people around the wor ld. Recognizing the critical role medical countermeasures play in controlling and ending a public health emergency, the U.S. government remains committed to working closely with partners overseas to respond to and mitigate the impact of this devastating p andemic. The U.S. government is undertaking significant investments and establishing unprecedented partnerships with industry and innovators to develop and appropriately scale the manufacture of safe and effective COVID -19 vaccines and therapeutics as qui ckly and as safely as possible. Intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement is essential for preserving the innovation incentives necessary for the rapid development of medical countermeasures to fight COVID -19 and future disease threats, to protect the integrity of medical supply cha ins, and to ensure the quality of personal protective equipment. We also applaud the private sector's work with governments to facilitate global access to vaccines and therapeutics, and we encourage these types of voluntary, non- exclusive, and innovative partnerships. International Organizations The Department of State participates in U.S. delegations to multilateral forums and international organizations with global intellectual property rights protection implications including: the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Council, the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade, WIPO, the World Customs Organization (WCO) Enforcement Committee, the I ntellectual Property Rights Experts Group (IPEG) of the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, and various other United Nations bodies. The United States reports on its incentives to promote and encourage technology transfer to least-developed country (LDC) WTO members in the annual Article 66.2 Report. The Department of State's Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs (EB) receives input from Page 146 of 177 missions overseas, regional and functional bureaus, and interagency partners on the range of U.S. government technology transfer and capacity building activities around the world. EB submits the Article 66.2 Report to the WTO TRIPS Council annually. The broad range of activities covered in this report, including laboratory -based scientific collaboration, capacity building and education, and IP enforcement activities, highlight the United States' efforts to promote effective and voluntary transfer of technology to LDC members. The U.S. Transnational and High- Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement N etwork (GLEN) International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Advisor (ICHIP) Program The GLEN consists of ICHIPs, experienced DOJ prosecutors posted at U.S. missions to strengthen enforcement coordination and deliver capacity building, Global Cyber Forensics Advisors (GCFAs), tasked to deliver law enforcement investigative training in digital forensics, and long -term federal agent mentors. The GLEN is supported by INL funds, and INL manages the GLEN with DOJ. The GLEN works with foreign countries to strengthen IPR and related cybercrime cooperation and designs training to lead to more effective investigation and prosecution of IPR and related cybercrime offense. INL consults closely with EB in program development and implementation. The ICHIP officers have regional responsibilities to: (1) assess the capacity of law enforcement authorities throughout the region to enforce intellectual property rights; (2) develop and deliver foreign training and technical assistance designed to enhance the capacity of foreign justice sector personnel to enforce intellectual property rights; (3) assist in developing or strengthening foreign justice sector institutions dedicated to enforcing intellectual property rights; (4) monitor regional trends in intellectual property protection and computer crimes; and (5) provide expert assistance in support of USG intellectual property and computer crimes policies and initiatives in the region. GCFA training advances similar goals and objectives in the area of di gital forensics training for foreign partner investigators. The long -term federal agent mentors are deployed to supplement the work of the ICHIPs and GCFAs through sustained hands -on mentoring. Building on early successes, the Department of State has w orked closely with the Justice Department to expand the ICHIP program into a global network. The GLEN presently deploys 12 ICHIPs, 11 supported by INL funds (one is DOJ/Office of International Affairs -funded), who work collaboratively within and across their regions, stationed in Panama City, Panama; Zagreb, Croatia; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; The Hague, Netherlands; Hong China S\u00e3o Paulo Bucharest, Romania; Abuja, Nigeria; Bangkok, Thailand; and two ICHIPs deployed out of Washington, D.C., w ho specifically address dark market/cryptocurrency and online consumer protection- related aspects of cybercrime and IP theft. INL also provides funding to the ICE-HSI-led National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (IPR) Center and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to deliver foreign law enforcement training and technical assistance to complement the work of the GLEN. ICE-HSI and USPTO -delivered workshops ensure that patent and trademark agencies and foreign border and customs agencies receive IP enforcement capacity building tailored to their missions. ICE -HSI and USPTO programming is closely coordinated with the work of the Page 147 of 177 GLEN. INL funds also support ICE-HSI providing U.S. trainers to participate in INTERPOL - managed IP workshops around the world. Investment Climate Statements Every year, economic officers at U.S. embassies and diplomatic missions prepare reports analyzing over 170 foreign markets to help U.S. companies make informed business decisions regarding over seas investments and operations. Each Investment Climate Statement focuses on an individual market and includes a chapter on intellectual property rights. These reports are also included in the Department of Commerce's Country Commercial Guides. Contr ibutions to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative's IPR -related Reports EB provided extensive support to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and the interagency team for the 2020 Special 301 Report process. At EB's request, posts a round the world submitted detailed analyses on IPR protection and enforcement conditions as part of the annual review. The bureau obtained input from several posts that offered significant contributions to USTR's Notorious Markets Report. Post insights i nto \"on- the-ground\" events deepened U.S. departments' and agencies' knowledge of IP protections in host countries. EB, working with U.S. embassies and consulates around the world, engages with U.S. stakeholders and foreign governments to ensure that the U .S. government's position is informed by the full range of views on the pertinent issues and to encourage trading partners to engage fully, and with the greatest degree of transparency, with the full range of stakeholders on IP matters. In conjunction wit h USTR and posts, EB's Office of Intellectual Property Enforcement helps develop action plans with benchmarks for each country that has been on the Special 301 Report's Priority Watch List for at least one year. The action plans aim to encourage progress on high-priority IP concerns and identify, where possible, appropriate ways in which the U.S. government can assist. Capacity Building and Training The Department of State, using foreign assistance anti -crime funds managed by INL, has a longstanding program to provide U.S. government capacity -building training and technical assistance to foreign law enforcement partners to combat IPR crime and to deter widespread commercial -scale pirated and counterfeit goods and services. The Department of State works with other agencies to prioritize assistance to developing countries that are named in USTR's Special 301 Report as countries of concern. Examples of training successes include: The South American regional ICHIP advisor trained 80 Brazilian state and federal police, prosecutors, customs officers, and regulatory officials on best practices in the investigation and prosecution of complex trademark infringement crimes at physical mar kets. The interagency group attending the program was created by the ICHIP to increase cooperation on these complex investigations. Under the ICHIP's mentorship since the inception of the Page 148 of 177 program, the group had significant operational successes, includin g seizing approximately 3,842 tons worth of counterfeit goods worth over $300 million USD, and a recent seizure of 1,100 pirate internet protocol television (IPTV) boxes from 27 stores at Santa Efig\u00eania mall in S\u00e3o Paulo. The IPTV boxes contained pirated films and series as well as applications that facilitate illicit streaming of premium channels. Addressing the distribution of these boxes is a top priority for the U.S. private sector, and this raid marked the first time the ICHIP -mentored interagency gr oup coordinated a seizure of these boxes with U.S. copyright holders. ICHIP Hong Kong is working with the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi to set up e -consultations with Vietnamese Supreme People's Court (SPC) staff on the drafting of a \"Judicial Resolution\" to guide trial court judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys on the application of seminal 2018 amendments to the nation's IPR criminal statutes. ICHIP Hong Kong would like to organize virtual consultations by U.S. subject matter experts from DOJ -CCIPS and other agencies, such as USPTO and the Copyright Office. The ICHIP for global health and public safety mentored 15 prosecutors in Barbados on best practices for seizing a U.S. -based fraudulent COVID -19 website. The ICHIP presented strategies for appr oaching registrars and other providers successfully. He also walked through the various open source tools prosecutors can use to begin an investigation of a target site and identify the registrar. The ICHIP also stressed the importance of using U.S.-prom oted tools for international cooperation, such as the G7 24- 7 network, to secure preservation of valuable domain and account information from foreign providers in the early stage of these investigations. The Chief of the Department of Public Prosecutions in Barbados appreciated the presentation and said the presentation would help her colleagues prepare to investigate fraudulent COVID -19 websites. In addition, the COVID -19 pandemic drove extraordinary growth in online activity. This has provided a key lifeline to health, educational, and social services, but it has also increased vulnerabilities among private citizens, corporations, and government entities. While the COVID -19 restrictions have created some operational obstacles, the rise in traditional and unique cybercrimes brought the demand for U.S. assistance in these areas to the forefront. In spite of the challenges presented by the global response to the COVID pandemic, particularly on travel and face- to-face mentoring, ICHIPs continued an ambit ious schedule with dozens of virtual trainings involving officials from 54 countries. ICHIPS conducted 21 trainings on cybercrime issues related directly to COVID -19 that were aimed at facilitating foreign law enforcement's ability to detect, prevent, and combat such crime. ICHIPs also participated as presenters and subject matter experts in support of other U.S. government capacity building efforts and diplomatic bilateral discussions with partner governments. Examples of ICHIP COVID -19-related trainings include: An ICHIP -led webinar delivered to 186 leading members of the private sector in Malaysia covered the importance of law enforcement/private sector cooperation and best practices for companies to protect themselves against cybercrime. It also provided an overview of the current trends in COVID -19-related cybercrime, such as healthcare organizations Page 149 of 177 being targeted for ransomware, increased numbers of COVID -19 related domains used for cybercrime, internet fraud, and video- teleconferencing hi jacking. An ICHIP co -hosted a webinar for 20 Romanian law enforcement officers on investigating ransomware attacks during the COVID -19 pandemic, a timely topic because Romania, like the rest of the world, was being hit with a dramatic increase in cyber - attacks, particularly those that appear to be launched by transnational criminal organizations. ICHIPs partnered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat to present the first webinar of their COVID -19-related criminal enforcement series. ICHIPS led a virtual workshop and mentoring session for a Pharma Crime Working Group with representatives from Ghana, Botswana, Zambia, Kenya, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, Nigeria, Liberia, and the Gambia that focused on taking down fraudulent COVID -19 websites, including what to include in take -down requests to internet service providers On a global level, the Department of State's nearly 1,500 economic officers, together with 12 USPTO Intellectual Property (IP) Attach\u00e9s, secured the participation of representatives from foreign ministries and law enforcement officials in training programs that bolster IP law and enforcement efforts. The Department of State organized International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) visits for IP policy and enforcement stakeholders from Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. These programs also included representatives of the Europe an Parliament, European Commission, and European Union Intellectual Property Office. The Department also gave presentations to IP officials and private sector stakeholders from China, Bulgaria, and Ukraine, among others. At an IP conference targeted to Latin American countries that the International AntiCounterfeiting Coalition (IACC) hosted, the Department of State presented and engaged with several key IP officials from throughout Latin America. Through the National IPR Coordination Center in Alexandria , Virginia, the Department of State engaged with Colombian, Egyptian, and Saudi enforcement officials, and participated in a Digital Pi racy Summit. These activities, plus meetings with numerous other U.S. business associations and companies, enabled the Department of State to understand better key IP enforcement concerns around the world and share best practices with international IP pro fessionals. Representatives of the Department of State accompanied the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC) on several international visits, including to the Middle East, North Africa, East Asia and Europe. The Department of State also played an integral part in the interagency process to implement appropriately the Presidential Memorandum of April 3, 2019, on Combating T rafficking in C ounterfeit and P irated G oods. Page 150 of 177 EB organized a webinar with the U.S. Embassy in Manila that highlighted U.S. government and private sector efforts to combat the proliferation of counterfeit products in Southeast Asia. Over 70 participants from the Government of the Philippines, the U.S. government, and the private sector joined the event. EB presenters were joined by speakers from the ICE-HSI National IPR Coordination Center, and they shared best practices, potential areas of collaboration and global initiatives on enforcement, health, and security hazards related to counterfeit products as well as tactics for tracking down online sellers. Attendees appreciated EB's core messaging of the importance of IPR protection to safeguard the economy, protect consumers' health and safety, and cut off possible support for criminal activity. EB, in partnership with US PTO's Global IP Academy, coordinated a two- day virtual training course on IPR for U.S. government officials. The course, which is usually held in- person at the USPTO, was held virtually because of the COVID -19 pandemic. Most participants were Foreign Service Officers preparing for onward assignments, and the training also included civil servants and locally employed staff of U.S. embassies. Experts and stakeholders briefed attendees on the fundamentals of intellectual property, U.S. government positions on current IP \"hot topics,\" and U.S. industry priorities. These officials are now better equipped to advocate for U.S. rights - holders overseas and to articulate U.S. government policy positions in bilateral discussions and in international fora. EB also trained Foreign Service Officers and representatives from various U.S. government agencies in sessions of the Foreign Service Institute's Political- Economic and Commercial Tradecraft classes, including a virtual class because of the COVID -19 pandem ic. The training gave officers and locally employed staff the latest U.S. policy perspectives on debates on international IP issues, enabling them to advocate better for U.S. rights holders overseas. In addition, Department of State representatives gave external presentations in response to requests from the public. The Department of State participated in the U.S. Department of Commerce \"STOPFakes\" domestic roadshows in Newark, New Jersey, San Jose, California, and Sacramento, California. STOPFakes r oadshows bring start -ups, entrepreneurs, and small - to medium -size businesses together with U.S. government officials to learn how to identify and protect various intellectual property assets. They also learn about mechanisms for obtaining IP protection i n overseas markets, strategies for determining where to seek protection, and the value of copyright and trade secret protection to their businesses. EB presented information on the role that the Department of State plays in helping U.S. companies protect their IP rights overseas and provided the attendees with points of contact in Washington and at U.S. diplomatic posts abroad. When the Department of Commerce launched STOPFakes webinars in place of in -person events during the COVID -19 pandemic, EB took the Department of State message online with a talk on IPR as a national economic security issue while sharing information about resources and cooperative efforts with other U.S. government agencies that can help U.S. firms abroad. Page 151 of 177 DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY Page 152 of 177 DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY Department of the Treasury Appendix for FY20 Annual Report Treasury IP -related efforts on Customs Treasury authority for border enforcement of intellectual property laws, along with certain other customs revenue functions, has been delegated to DHS and is carried out by CBP and ICE (see Treasur y Order 100- 16 and 6 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 212, 215). Under the delegation, Treasury retains the sole authority to approve any regulations concerning copyright and trademark enforcement at the border and works closely on these promulgations with DHS and its components. Treasury efforts to identify and address certain IP -related risks to national security through the CFIUS process The Secretary of the Treasury serves as Chairperson of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). CFIUS is an interagency committee authorized to review certain transactions that could result in control by a foreign person over a U.S. business in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States. Pursuant to the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), which was signed into law on August 13, 2018, and subject t o its implementing regulations, CFIUS also has the authority, among others, to review certain non -controlling investments by foreign persons in U.S. businesses that produce, design, test, manufacture, fabricate, or develop critical technologies , and this r eview may include aspects of a technology's underlying intellectual property . The Department of the Treasury published final regulations to implement FIRRMA, including the aforementioned authority, in January 2020 and the regulations became effective on February 13, 2020. Among other things, the regulations that became effective in February extended the require ments of the pilot program (discussed below) that mandated the filing of a declaration with CFIUS for certain foreign investment transactions inv olving a U.S. business that produces, designs, test s, manufactures, fabricates, or develops one or more critical technologies where there is a specified connection to one or more of 27 specified industries. T his mandatory notification requirement was subs equently modified on October 15, 2020. Instead of focusing on a connection to one or more specified industries , the rule is now based on whether certain U.S. Government export control authorizations would be required to export, re -export, transfer (in country), or retransfer such U.S. business's critical technology to certain transaction parties or their owners. As discussed above, p rior to the rulemaking in 2020, CFIUS had issued an interim rule in the fall of 2018 setting forth the scope of, and procedures for, a pilot program covering certain investments by foreign persons in certain U.S. businesses with critical technologies and establishing a mandatory declaration requirement . This pilot program was in effect fr om November 10, 2018 through February 12, 2020. Page 153 of 177 CFIUS does not enforce intellectual property laws. If, however, during its review of a transaction CFIUS identifies a risk to U.S. national security arising from a foreign person's acquisition of, or acc ess to, the intellectual property of a U.S. business, and if other authorities are not adequate or appropriate to address the identified risk, CFIUS will seek to mitigate such risk. Mitigation measures could take a variety of forms, including but not limi ted to: placing the intellectual property in escrow; controlling the foreign person's access to the intellectual property; requiring mechanisms to monitor and enforce such access controls; and ensuring U.S. Government access to, or insight into, the intell ectual property. If CFIUS determines that the identified risk cannot be resolved through mitigation, it will refer the transaction to the President, who can suspend or prohibit the transaction. Treasury authority to impose sanctions under Executive Order 13694, as amended, in response to certain malicious cyber -enabled activities, including the theft of trade secrets for commercial or competitive advant age or private financial gain. Treasury continue s to encourage referrals from relevant departments and agencies, including law enforcement and intelligence agencies , regarding targets for potential designation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended by E.O. 13757. The Executive Order a uthorizes t he imposition of sanctions on individuals and entities determined to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in, certain malicious cyber -enabled activities, including those \"causing a significant misappropriation of funds or economic resources, trade secrets, personal identifiers, or financial information for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain.\" Page 154 of 177 OFFICE OF THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE Page 155 of 177 OFFICE OF THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE USTR Appendix for FY 2020 Annual Report One avenue to promote intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement abroad is through engagement with our trading partners. Through such engagement, the Administration advocates for strong IP protection and enforcement in other countries for, inter alia , creative works, brands, designs, trade secrets and inventions by U.S. creators, inventors, artists and businesses. Through direct engagement with foreign counterparts, the Office of the U.S . Trade Representative (USTR) emphasizes the importance that the U.S. government places on protecting and enforcing IP, and presses for concrete action by trading partners to protect and enforce IP rights, including those owned by Americans. To advance the Administration's objectives, USTR uses a broad range of trade policy tools to promote strong IP rights protection and enforcement, including Section 301 of the Trade Act ; the annual Special 301 review of IP protection and enforcement and related market access issues ; trade agreement negotiations; monitoring and enforcement of those agreements; trade and investment framework agreements; participation in the TRIPS Council at the World Trade Organization; and high- level engagement in multilateral and bilateral meetings. Given the international competitiveness of U.S. innovative and creative industries, the United States considers strong and effective protection and enforcement of IP rights as critical to U.S. economic growth and American jobs. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, 45.5 million American jobs in 2014 were directly or indirectly supported by \"IP -intensive\" industries, and these jobs paid higher wages to their workers. In addition, in 2014, these IP -intensive industries accounted for $6.6 trillion in value added and 38.2 percent of the U.S. GDP. (See Department of Commerce, Intellectual Property and the U.S. Economy: 2016 Update , at https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/IPandtheUSEconomySept2016.pdf .) Innovation and creativity are key export strengths for the United States. To help ensure that American innovators and creators compete on a level playing field around the world, the U.S. Government uses all the tools at its disposal to promote effective IP rights protection and enforcement by its trading partners. The USTR initiatives that have advanced IP rights protection include the following. Section 301 Investigation into China's Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property and Innovation Law, Policies, Practices and Actions On August 14, 2017, the President of the United States issued a Memorandum instructing the Trade Representative to determine whether to investigate under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411), laws, policies, practices, or actions of the government of China that may be unreasonable or discriminatory and that may be harming American IP rights, innovation, or technolog y development. See 82 FR 39007. After consultation with the appropriate advisory committees and the inter -agency Section 301 Committee, on August 18, 2017, USTR initiated an investigation into certain acts, policies, and practices of China related to technology transfer, IP, and innovation. See 82 FR 40213. The investigation included a public hearing on October 10, 2017, and two rounds of public written comments from interested Page 156 of 177 members of the public. On March 22, 2018, based on the investigation in res ponse to the Presidential Memorandum, the Trade Representative issued a detailed report determining that China's acts, policies, and practices that force or pressure U.S. right holders to transfer technology and IP are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce, and are thus actionable under Section 301(b) of the 1974 Trade Act. In a notice published in the Federal Register on April 6, 2018, the Trade Representative found: China uses foreign ownership restrictions, such as joint venture requirements and foreign equity limitations, and various administrative review and licensing processes, to require or pressure technology transfer from U.S. companies; China's regime of tech nology regulations forces U.S. companies seeking to license technologies to Chinese entities to do so on non- market -based terms that favor Chinese recipients; China directs and unfairly facilitates the systematic investment in, and acquisition of, U.S. companies and assets by Chinese companies to obtain cutting -edge technologies and intellectual property and generate the transfer of technology to Chinese companies; and China conducts and supports unauthorized intrusions into, and theft from, the computer networks of U.S. companies to access their sensitive commercial information and trade secrets. The President directed the Trade Representative to take all appropriate action under Section 301, including considering increased tariffs on goods from China. On April 6, 2018, USTR published a proposed list of products imported from China, worth approximately $50 billion in imports that could be subject to additional tariffs. After hearings and the receipt of numerous written comments, the USTR imposed additional tariffs of 25 percent on approximately $34 billion worth of imports from China, effective July 6, 2018. After a subsequent round of hearings and submissions, the USTR imposed additional tariffs of 25 percent on approximately $16 billion worth of impor ts from China, effective August 23, 2018. On September 24, 2018, USTR announced the imposition of tariffs of 10 percent on approximately $200 billion worth of imports from China, rising to a rate of 25 percent effective January 1, 2019. At the directio n of the President, the Trade Representative postponed the increase in the rate of additional duty for this third tranche of products in light of progress in discussions with China, but, on May 10, 2019, increased the level to 25 percent after China retrea ted from specific commitments from earlier rounds of negotiations. In May 2019, USTR requested comment and, in June 2019, held a public hearing on a proposed tariff modification adding an ad valorem duty of up to 25 percent on additional products of China with an annual trade value of approximately $300 billion. On November 20, 2018, USTR released a report updating information on its Section 301 investigation of China's acts, policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual Page 157 of 177 property and innovation.14 USTR Robert Lighthizer indicated that \"[t]his update shows that China has not fundamentally altered its unfair, unreasonable, and market -distorting practices that were the subject of the March 2018 report on our Section 301 investigation.\"15 On March 23, 2018, the United States requested consultations with China under the WTO Dispute Resolution Understanding (in matter DS542). Consultations on DS542 were held in July 2018 but they did not resolve the dispute. On October 18, 2018, the United States requested that the WTO Dispute Settlement Body establish a panel to examine the U.S. complaint. After China blocked the first U.S. request for a WTO dispute settlement panel as provided for in the rules for dispute settlement proceedings, the Unit ed States repeated its request to establish a WTO dispute settlement panel and a panel was established at the November 21, 2018 meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body. In March 2019, China revised the measures that the United States had challenged. On Ju ne 18, 2020, the WTO panel informed the Dispute Settlement Body that it had accepted a request from the parties to suspend the dispute, in light of ongoing consultations between the parties. In August 2019, the Trade Representative, at the direction of the President, determined to modify the action being taken in the investigation by issuing a notice imposing an additional duty of 15 percent on $120 billion of Chinese goods effective September 1, 2019, and an additional duty of 15 percent on $160 billion of Chinese goods effective December 15, 2019. The Trade Representative also received public comments regarding a proposed modification to increase the rate of additional duty from 25 percent ad valorem to 30 percent ad valorem on goods of China covered by the three prior tariff actions, with an approximate annual trade value of $250 billion. On January 15, 2020, the United States and China signed a Phase One trade agreement that requires structural reforms and other changes to China's economic and tra de regime in the areas of intellectual property, technology transfer, agriculture, financial services, and currency and foreign exchange. In light of progress in the negotiations with China, and at the direction of the President, the Trade Representative determined to suspend indefinitely the imposition of the additional duties of 15 percent on $160 billion of Chinese goods that had been scheduled for December 15, 2019. In addition, on February 14, 2020, the United States reduced from 15 percent to 7.5 percent the tariffs that it imposed on $120 billion of Chinese goods on September 1, 2019. NAFTA and the United States, Mexico, and Canada Agreement (USMCA) On May 18, 2017, USTR notified Congress of the Administration's intent to initiate NAFTA renegotiations. Securing effective protection and enforcement of IP for U.S. rights holders is a key element of all trade engagement, including these negotiations. The Administration notified Congress of its intent to sign a trade deal in August 2018. That outcome included strong IP provisions related to copyright, patents, trademarks, geographical indications, enforcement (including civil, criminal, border, administrative), trade secrets and other IP priorities. 14 158 of 177 In November 2018, under the leadership of President Trump, the United States, Mexico and Canada reached an agreement to modernize the 24 -year-old NAFTA into a 21st century, high- standard agreement. The United State -Mexico -Canada Agreement (USMCA) entered into force on July 1, 2020. The USMCA will support mutually beneficial trade leading to freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth in North America. It includes a modernized, high- standard IP chapter, which breaks new ground in U.S. trade and IP policy. It contains comprehensive protections against misappropriation of trade secrets, including by state -owned enterprises. It provides the most robust border enforcement mechanisms of any prior F TA. In addition, strong copyright protection and enforcement, more transparency in the grant of geographical i ndications (GI) protection or recognition, and full national treatment also promote the strong and effective protection and enforcement of IP rights that is critical to driving innovation, creating economic growth, and supporting American jobs.16 New Trade Negotiations On October 16, 2018, USTR notified Congress of the Administration's intent to initiate negotiations with the United Kingdom (UK ). On May 5, 2020, USTR launched FTA negotiations with the UK, seeking a high- standard, comprehensive agreement in which the United States and the UK can demonstrate global leadership in IP. USTR's negotiating objectives for the U.S.- UK Trade Agreement are at: https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Summary_of_U.S. -UK_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf . On March 17, 2020, USTR notified Congress of the Administration's intent to initiate negotiations with the Republic of Kenya. On July 8, 2020, USTR formally launched trade agreement negotiations between the United States and the Republic of Kenya , seeking a comprehensive, hig h-standard agreement that can serve as a model for additional agreements across Africa. USTR's negotiating objectives for the U.S.- Kenya Trade Agreement are at: https://ustr.gov/sites/default/f iles/Summary_of_U.S. -Kenya_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf . Ongoing Trade Agreement Implementation and Enforcement In 2018, Ambassador Lighthizer completed negotiations to amend and modify KORUS . In these negotiations , the United States achieved steps to im prove the large trade deficit in industrial goods and to address KORUS implementation concerns that have hindered U.S. export growth. In the realm of pharmaceutical reimbursements, the USTR secured Korea's commitment to, within 2018, amend its Premium Pricing Policy for Global Innovative Drugs to make it consistent with Korea's commitments under KORUS on ensuring non-discriminatory treatment for U.S. pharmaceutical exports.17 In FY 2020, USTR led discussions of the KORUS Committee on Medicines and Medical Devices to address Korea's amended Premium Pricing 16 United States -Mexico -Canada Trade Fact Sheet: Modernizing NAFTA into a 21st Century Trade Agreement (October 1, 2018) https://ustr.gov/about 159 of 177 Policy for Global Innovative Drugs and other concerns with respect to the implementation KORUS's pharmaceutical and medical device pricing provisions. In FY 2020, the U.S . continued to engage with Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners (including Australia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and Morocco) to ensure that FTA obligations, including those related to IP, are being implemented. USTR Special 301 R eport Each year, pursuant to statute, USTR issues the Special 301 Report on the adequacy and effectiveness of protection and enforcement of IP by our trading partners. The Special 301 Report is an important tool to engage with our trading partners to promote strong protection for U.S. creative and innovative industries, as well as to promote compliance with trade commitments. USTR actively employs the Special 301 process to identify and address key IP challenges for American businesses and to document an d encourage continued progress in countries that undertake legislative and enforcement reforms following engagement under Special 301. USTR released the 20 20 Special 301 Report in April 2020. (The 2020 Report is at https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2020_Special_301_Report.pdf , and the related press release is In the report, USTR highlighted serious and ongoing concerns with respect to the environment for IP rights protection and enforcement in China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and other markets. In addition, USTR announced that it woul d conduct an Out -of-Cycle Review (OCR) for Malaysia and Saudi Arabia. The Special 301 Report reflects the Administration's continued resolve to encourage adequate and effective IP protection and IP rights enforcement worldwide. The 2020 Special 301 Rep ort identifie d a wide range of concerns, including: (a) the deterioration in IP protection and IP rights enforcement in a number of trading partners; (b) discriminatory and/or non- transparent measures that act as market access barriers to U.S. pharmaceutic al products and medical devices; (c) unresolved inadequacies in trade secret protection in China, India, and elsewhere; ( d) troubling \"indigenous innovation,\" technology transfer, and localization policies that may unfairly disadvantage U.S. right holders in markets abroad; ( e) the continuing challenges of online copyright piracy; ( f) measures that impede market access for U.S. products embodying IP and U.S. entities that rely upon IP protection; and ( g) other ongoing, systemic IP rights enforcement issues in many trading partners around the world. A Special 301 Out -of-Cycle Review is a tool that USTR uses to encourage progress on IP issues of concern. Out -of-Cycle Reviews provide an opportunity to address and remedy such issues through heightened engageme nt and cooperation with trading partners and other stakeholders. Out-of-Cycle Reviews focus on identified IP challenges in specific trading partner markets. Successful resolution of specific IP issues of concern can lead to a positive change in a trading partner's Special 301 status outside of the typical period for the annual review. Conversely, failure to address identified IP concerns, or further deterioration as to an IP -related concern Page 160 of 177 within the specified Out -of-Cycle Review period, can lead to an adverse change in status. As of the end of FY 2020, an out -of-cycle review was proceeding on Malaysia and Saudi Arabia. Notorious Markets List The Notorious Markets List ( NML ) highlights select online and physical marketplaces that reportedly engage in or facilitate substantial copyright piracy or trademark counterfeiting. USTR has identified notorious markets in the Special 301 Report since 2006. In 2010, USTR announced tha t it would begin publishing the NML separately from the annual Special 301 Report, pursuant to an Out -of-Cycle Review. USTR first separately published the 2010 NML in February 2011, and has published a n NML for every year since. In the NML , USTR highlights markets not only because they exemplify global concerns about counterfeiting and piracy, but also because the scale of infringing activity in such markets can cause significant economic harm to U.S. IP right holders. Some of the identified markets reportedly are host to a combination of legitimate and unauthorized activities. Others reportedly exist solely to engage in or facilitate unauthorized activity. The NML does not purport to be an exhaustive list of all physical and online markets worldwide in which IP rights infringement takes place. A goal of the NML is to motivate appropriate action by the private sector and governments to reduce piracy and counterfeiting. The operators of several websites identified in past NMLs have begun to wo rk with right holders to address counterfeiting and piracy. Several markets have also ceased operations or have been the focus of government enforcement efforts. The 2019 Notorious Markets List was issued in April 2020. (The NML is at https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2019_Review_of_Notorious_Markets_for_Counterfeiting_and _Piracy.pdf , and the related 2019 NML includes a focus that explores the nexus between online piracy and malwar e. As of the close of FY2020, the 2020 NML is expected to be issued i n the coming months. India The U.S. maintains bilateral engagement with India on IP issues through the High -Level IP Working Group under the United States -India Trade Policy Forum (TPF). USTR, working with its interagency partners (USPTO, U.S. Copyright Office, ITA, DOJ, Health and Human Services, FTC, and others), sought to revitalize the on- going engagement with Indian government counterparts during FY 2020, including continued exchanges and activities centere d on the robust protection of IP and enforcement of IP rights , with a focus on areas such as copyright, trade secrets, patents, and promoting innovation and creativity through high- level government policies. Page 161 of 177 World Trade Organization Council on Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Council) The World Trade Organization (WTO) provides an additional venue for USTR to lead engagement with trading partners on IP rights issues, including through accession negotiations for prospective Mem bers, the Council for Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Council), and the Dispute Settlement Body. In FY 2020, the United States advanced its IP and Innovation agenda in the TRIPS Council by focusing on intellectual property a nd innovation in connection with the development of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The United States is working with member states including , Australia, Canada, Chile, Chinese Taipei, the European Union, Japan, Hong Kong, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, New Zealand, and the U nited K ingdom , examining how IP protection and enforcement promote innovation and creativity to meet societal challenges and needs . World Trade Organization Accession Governments in the process of negotiat ing the terms for accession to the WTO work with WTO Members, including the United States, to appropriately update and strengthen their IP regimes as well as to expand trade and enhance the investment climate for innovative and creative industries. Othe r Fora In addition to the WTO (which is the principal forum for addressing trade -related aspects of intellectual property), the United States also advanced these issues in other fora during FY 2020, including the OECD, WIPO, APEC forum and various U.N. bodies. In the APEC Intellectual Property Experts Group (IPEG), the United States is organizing a series of three workshops , beginning in September 2020, for IPEG members on the importance of industrial design protection and how developing modern design protections across APEC economies will promote economic growth. The United States also issued a survey for IPEG members on treatment of, and approaches to, illicit streaming devices (ISDs) under domestic laws or regulations, with results used to establis h a baseline of information on how such devices are dealt with in the APEC region and inform future IPEG work, including possible adoption of a best practices document or building capacity of relevant officials. Examples of Additional Areas of IP Righ ts Engagement In November 2019, the U.S.- Ukraine Trade and Investment Council meeting provided an opportunity for USTR to continue engagement with Ukraine on longstanding IP protection and enforcement issues. In addition, the meeting also provided an opportunity for USTR to announce the partial restoration of Ukraine's Generali zed System of Preferences (GSP) benefits due to tangible steps Ukraine is taking to reform its system for the collective management of royalties. Page 162 of 177 In March 2020, USTR sent a delegati on to South Africa to engage on USTR's open GSP review on South Africa. USTR is conducting a review of South Africa's GSP status after accepting a petition from the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) asserting that South Africa is not providing adequate copyright protection and that if South Africa enacts two pending copyright bills, it will move even further from international norms. In October 2019, the U.S. hosted the annual U .S.-Central Asia TIFA meeting, and provided an update regarding the activities of the Central Asia IP Working Group, which serves as an important mechanism to provide sustained engagement on IP issues and help improve IP regimes in the region. Engagement with Stakeholders and the Public USTR frequently seeks public input from all sectors of society, including private citizens, non- governmental organizations, academia, consumer groups, small and medium -size businesses, and the business community (including innovators, content providers, and technology and other service providers ). To this end, USTR holds public hearings; seeks written comments regarding negotiation objectives through Federal Register notices; chairs regular sessions with designated public advisory committe es; and disseminates trade policy materials such as press releases, factsheets , and statements on the USTR website. These dialogues are critical at every stage of USTR's work, including in connection with the process of negotiating, implementing , and enforcing trade rules. USTR also seeks public input for the annual Special 301 and Notorious Markets List processes. The annual Special 301 Report identifies countries that fail to adequately and effectively protect or enforce IP rights or use unfair barriers to limit market access for U.S. businesses that rely on IP. The Notorious Markets List highlights prominent online and physical marketplaces that reportedly engage in or facilitate substantial copyright piracy or trademark counterfeiting. USTR publishes requests for public comment in the Federal Register that provide opportunities for public input and rebuttals, and the submitted comments are available online. In addition, USTR holds a public hearing for the Special 301 process. In addition to requesting comments from the public and holding a public hearing on IP matters, IP trade policy figured heavily in USTR's broader stakeholder and Congressional outreach, including in a range of domestic and international fora. Page 163 of 177 COPYRIGHT OFFICE Page 164 of 177 COPYRIGHT OFFICE Appendix for FY20 Annual Report This appendix summarizes some of the key activities taken by the United States Copyright Office in FY 2020. Overview The Copyright Office marks its 150th anniversary in 2020. During FY2020, the Copyright Office experienced a change in leadership. In late 2019, Karyn A. Temple resigned as the 13th Register of Copyrights , having served as Acting Register for over two y ears and as Register from March 27, 2019, through January 3, 2020. Librarian of Congress Dr. Carla Hayden appointed Maria Strong as Acting Register, effective January 5, 2020. On September 21, 2020, Librarian of Congress Hayden announced that she appoint ed Shira Perlmutter as the 14th Register of Copyrights. Ms. Perlmutter step ped into her new position in late October 2020, and Ms. Strong returned to her position as Associate Register of Copyrights and Director of Policy and International Affairs. During FY 2020, the Office continued to work on a breadth of copyright -related issues, including efforts to modernize the Office's IT operations; the implementation of Title I of the Orrin G. Hatch -Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act (MMA, P.L. 115- 264), known as the Music Licensing Modernization Act; engagement with Canada and Mexico on the implementation of their USMCA obligations; and the introduction or completion of several policy studies. The Copyright Office examined and registered hundreds of thousands of copyright registration claims, recorded transfers of ownership, and administered statutory licenses. The Office also provided law and policy advice to Congress, provided expert advice to the federal courts and executive branch agencies on domes tic and international copyright matters, and conducted public outreach efforts. Please visit https://www.copyright.gov/ for more information on all the Office's activities. Reports & Studies for Congress The Co pyright Office advises Congress on national and international issues relating to copyright. (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(b)(1).) This advice includes providing requested opinions on pending and existing legislation as well as providing topical analysis on areas of c opyright law. The Office maintains its commitment to transparency by ensuring that all members of the copyright community \u2014including copyright owners, technology companies, consumers, public interest groups, academics, and the general public \u2014have robust opportunities to participate and contribute to the Office's policy studies, reports, and recommendations. During FY 2020, the Office completed two studies and initiated two new studies. Section 512 Study (May 2020) Page 165 of 177 On May 21, 2020, after conducting a multi -year study, the Copyright Office published Section 512 of Title 17, a report considering the effectiveness of the notice -and-takedown system under section 512 of title 17 of the Copyright Act. The report, the firs t U.S. government analysis of section 512 since the passage of the DMCA in 1998, addresses various provisions of section 512, including safe harbor eligibility for online service providers, repeat infringer policies, knowledge requirement standards, and voluntary initiatives to improve the operation of the notice -and- takedown system. The Office initiated this study in December 2015 upon the recommendation of the then- Register of Copyrights and upon the request of the then- Ranking Member of the House Judici ary Committee. The study consisted of an initial notice of inquiry seeking public comments on thirty questions pertaining to areas of section 512\u2014which received over 92,000 comments \u2014and two initial public roundtables in May 2016. A second notice of inqui ry was issued in November 2016 to seek information on additional questions raised in response to the initial inquiry and during the initial roundtables. The second inquiry also invited parties to submit empirical research studies on the operation of the s afe harbor provisions. The Office received seventy -nine comments and nine empirical studies. In April 2019, the Office held a final roundtable attended by over fifty individuals representing a variety of companies and organizations, which discussed domes tic case law and international developments regarding liability for infringing content online. The Report concluded that the operation of the section 512 safe harbor system today is no longer balanced in the way that Congress intended in 1998. In reachi ng this conclusion, the Office identified five principles that guided its analysis, including that Congress intended to incentivize cooperation between online service providers and rightsholders, but that cooperation cannot be the only answer. The Report identified areas where the implementation of section 512 differs from Congress' original intent, including specificity within takedown notices, and took note of concerns raised by user advocacy groups regarding improper notices under the system. The Repor t also identified areas outside of the statutory arena that both rightholders and online service providers can utilize to increase the effectiveness of section 512. The Report did not recommend any wholesale changes to Section 512, but instead pointed to areas where Congress may wish to restore the original balance between rightholders and online service providers that Congress sought to achieve. In response to the Report, two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Intellectual Propert y sent a letter to the Office on May 29, 2020, requesting responses to a series of follow -up questions about the Report and requesting technical assistance. The Office submitted its response on June 29, 2020. As part of the ongoing work related to the st udy, the Office held three online discussions in September 2020 to lay the groundwork for sustained engagement on standard technical measures (STMs). The discussions pertained to both the potential of STMs and the challenges of identifying and adopting ST Ms to improve the functioning of the section 512 framework. Page 166 of 177 On September 30, 2020, the Office launched a new webpage dedicated to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The new webpage consolidates information and resources about various aspects of the DMCA, including section 512's safe harbors and notice -and-takedown system, section 1201's anti -circumvention provisions, and section 1202's copyright management information protections. More information on the study can be found at https://www.copyright.gov/policy/section512/ . Fee Study - 2019 (February 2020) On February 19, 2020, the Copyright Office issued its final rule adopting a new fee schedule for various services offered by the Office. The new fee schedule went into effect on March 20, 2020. Congress authorized the Register to set and adjust Copyright Office fees that are fair, equitable, and give due consideration to the objectives of the copyright system. The Office adjusts its fees at appropriate intervals after conducting a study of the actual cost to the Office for providing its fee -based services. The Office initiated a new cost study in June 2017 and proposed a new fee schedule in May 2018, based on that cost study. In June 2019, the Office issued a limited updated proposal with respect to fees for recordation of documents related to copyright and new prospective group registration options. Following receipt of public comments in response to a June 2019 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and a subsequent adjustment of certain fees, the Office presented a final proposed schedule and analysis of copyright fees to Congress on October 16, 2019, as required by law. Pursuant to the Copyright Act, the proposed schedule of fees we nt into effect on March 20, 2020, after Congress elected not to exercise its ability to disapprove of the schedule within 120 days following receipt . In addition to the fees submitted to Congress, the Office reviewed and adjusted certain other fees that are not required to be submitted to Congress. As provided in section 708(a), these adjustments are made by the Office based on its costs and after carefully considering public comments. On March 18, 2020, the Office hosted a webinar to introduce the new fee schedule and fee changes. This docket can be found at https://www.copyright.gov/rulemaking/feestudy2018/ . State Sovereign Immunity Study (Ongoing) In response to the Supreme Court's ruling in Allen v. Cooper , Senators Thom Tillis and Patrick Leahy Congress sent a letter to the Copyright Office on April 28, 2020, asking the Office to commence a public study to discover the degree to which copyright owners are experiencing copyright infringement by states without adequate remedies under state law (https://www.copyright.gov/policy/state -sovereign -immunity/letter.pdf ). Page 167 of 177 In Allen v. Cooper , the Supreme Court held that Congress did not validly abrogate states' sovereign immunity through the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act of 1990. To commence the stu dy, the Copyright Office issued a notice of inquiry on June 3, 2020, requesting comments on issues, such as specific instances of infringement committed by states, whether the infringement was intentional or reckless, and the availability of remedies under state law. The Office has extended the deadline for comments to October 22, 2020. The Office also plans to hold public roundtables and may request additional comments in the future. A copy of the request for comments can be found at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR - 2020- 06-03/pdf/2020- 12019.pdf . Unclaimed Royalties Study (Ongoing) In connection with the MMA, the Mechanical Licensing Collective (\"MLC\") is tasked with administering the new blanket license under section 115 of the Copyright Act, distributing royalties to songwriters and music publishers, and, among other duties, implementing policies and procedures for distributing unclaimed accrued royalties and i nterest after a prescribed holding period. A s directed by the MMA, and in consultation with the Government Accountability Office, the Copyright Office is undertaking a study to recommend best practices that the MLC may implement to identify and locate musical work copyright owners with unclaimed royalties, encourage those copyright owners to claim their royalties, and ultimately reduce the incidence of unclaimed royalties. The study is due in July 2021. To initiate the Unclaimed Royalties Study, the O ffice held a kickoff symposium on December 6, 2019, which included educational discussions of these issues by a broad array of industry stakeholders, songwriters and artists, and other members of the public, including members of the MLC and the Digital Lic ensee Coordinator (\"DLC\"), which represents licensee interests. To further assist the public in submitting comments to the study, the Office commissioned an April 2020 report addressing global collective management organizations' approaches to obtaining ownership information, reducing the instance of unclaimed royalties, and royalty distribution. On June 2, 2020, the Office issued a notice of inquiry seeking public comments for this report and plans to hold public roundtables in the future. Information on this study, including videos of the symposium, the April 2020 report, and the notice of inquiry, can be found at https://www.copyright.gov/policy/unclaimed -royalties/ . Rulemakings During FY 2020, the Copyright Office engaged in a number of additional rulemakings. Some rulemakings were in response to the COVID -19 pandemic, as a way to ensure that copyright owners had proper avenues to register and protect their works. Page 168 of 177 A list of bot h open and closed rulemakings is available at https://www.copyright.gov/rulemaking/ . An illustrative list appears below. MMA Rulemakings The MMA was enacted in October 2018 and requires, among other things, that the Copyright Office adopt a number of regulations to govern the new blanket licensing system created under Title I of the MMA, known as the Musical Works Modernization Act. The bl anket licensing system replaces the existing song -by-song compulsory licensing structure for making and distributing musical works with a blanket licensing system for digital music providers to make and distribute digital phonorecord deliveries ( e.g., perm anent downloads, limited downloads, or interactive streams). The blanket licensing system will be available January 2021. In September 2019, the Office issued a notice of inquiry seeking comments on a number of subjects, including notices of license ; notices of nonblanket activity ; usage reports and adjustments ; information to be included in the mechanical licensing collective's database ; database usability, interoperability, and usage restrictions ; and the handling of confidential information. After r eviewing the comments submitted in response to the notice of inquiry, the Office has issued five notices of proposed rulemaking, each focusing on one or more of the regulatory categories identified in the September 2019 notice of inquiry. Three proposed r ules (and an additional notification narrowing in on issues related to transparency and the new public database) were published April 22, 2020. A fourth proposed rule was published on July 17, 2020. On September 16, 2020, the Office moved forward with two interim rules and the fifth proposed rule. The first interim rule addresses notices of license, data collection efforts, reports of usage and payment by digital music providers and related records of use, notices of nonblanket activity and reports of usa ge by significant nonblanket licensees, and data collection efforts by musical work copyright owners . The second interim rule addresses t he obligations of the MLC to report and distribute royalties paid by digital music providers under the blanket license to musical work copyright owners. This notice of proposed rulemaking concerns the MLC's regular reporting and distribution with respect to \"matched\" uses of works, and does not address separate considerations related to the MLC's duty to distribute unc laimed royalties after a prescribed holding period, which is the subject of a separate policy study. The first proposed rule concerns confidentiality, and propose s various categories of permitted disclosure and use of confidential information by the MLC a nd DLC , including the MLC's statutorily -required unclaimed royalties oversight committee and dispute resolution committee . The second proposed rule addresses requirements regarding the cumulative statements of account related to pre -blanket license uses of works that digital music providers are required to Page 169 of 177 submit to the mechanical licensing collective, for such providers to qualify for the statutory limitation on liability for unlicensed uses of musical works prior to the license availability date . The third proposed rule relates to the MLC 's public musical works database, database access, and database use, and other considerations related to facilitating transparent operations of the new collective. For more on the MM A and the Office's implementation of the new law, see https://www.copyright.gov/music -modernization/ . Eighth Triennial Section 1201 Rulemaking Proceeding under the DMCA On June 22, 2020, the Copyright Office initiated the eighth triennial rulemaking proceeding under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which provides that the Librarian of Congress, upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, may adopt t emporary exemptions to section 1201's prohibition against circumvention of technological protection measures that control access to copyrighted works. In accordance with the statute, the Librarian's determination to grant an exemption is based upon the re commendation of the Register of Copyrights, who also consults with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce. The ultimate goal of the proceeding is to determine whether there are particular classes of works as to which users are, or are likely to be in the next three years, adversely affected in their ability to make non -infringing uses due to the prohibition on circumventing access controls. As outlined in its June 2020 notice of inquiry, which launched the eighth triennial rulemaking, the Office is again using a streamlined procedure for the renewal of exemptions that were granted during the seventh triennial rulemaking. Parties that are seeking expansions to existing exemptions, or are seeking new exemptions, must submit a petition for a new exemption. Those petitions, and renewal petitions that are meaningfully opposed, will be subject to a more comprehensive rulemaki ng process, including three rounds of written comments and public hearings. For the Eighth Triennial Rulemaking, the Office received renewal petitions for all exemptions granted during the Seventh Triennial Rulemaking. The Office also received 26 petiti ons to either grant a new exemption or expand an existing exemption and received fifteen comments in response to renewal petitions. In conjunction with the notice of inquiry initiating the eighth triennial rulemaking, the Office held a public webinar on J une 23, 2020. Modernization During FY 2020, the Copyright Office issued a number of notices related to rulemakings intended to help improve the registration process for copyright claimants. These included rules establishing a group registration for short online literary works and establishing a group Page 170 of 177 registration for newsletters. The Office also issued a notice of inquiry directed at registration considerations with respect to works published online. On June 3, 2020, the Office issued a notice of prop osed rulemaking on amending certain regulations governing the recordation of notices of termination under sections 203 and 304(c) of the Copyright Act. The proposed amendments a re intended to improve efficiency in the processing of termination notices and to provide additional guidance to the public in this area. The Office also provided notice of changes to the examination process for certain notices of termination that pertain to multiple grants and solicited public comments on two additional subjects of injury pertaining to notices of termination. The Office is currently reviewing the comments it received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. A response to the notice of proposed rulemaking is forthcoming in FY21. On March 3, 2020, the Offi ce issued a statement of policy and notice of inquiry announcing several intended practice updates to the copyright registration system, in conjunction with the new electronic registration system currently under development as part of the Office's moderniz ation process. The eleven registration practice updates include, among other updates, substantive changes to the copyright registration application and utilizing the online public record system. On January 23, 2020, the Office issued a supplemental inter im rule in anticipation of the pilot program for an electronic recordation system through which certain remitters could record certain types of documents electronically online. The supplemental rule and pilot program further the Office's recordation moder nization process, with the Office launching the pilot program on April 27, 2020. The supplemental rule made no changes to the Office's recordation rules for submissions outside of the pilot program. Activities in Response to COVID- 19 The Copyright Office has taken a number of actions to ensure that mission -critical functions continue during the ongoing challenges caused by COVID -19. These functions include those services that track our statutory obligations to administer the Copyright Act and to pr ovide expertise and advice on domestic and international copyright law matters to Congress, the courts, and executive branch agencies. The Office expanded its capabilities to receive and process certain electronic submissions and applications for various services offered by the Office, including establishing a dedicated email address for these submissions and applications . For example, s ervices that required handwritten signatures and delivery by mail or other physical means can now utilize electronic sub missions to meet certain filing requirements . The Office updated its regulations to facilitate this process. The Office also implemented an interim rule related to the registration of secure tests in response to the pandemic . Prior regulations require d that , in order to be eligible for this special registration option, secure tests must be administered \"at specified centers ,\" that is, physical locations. Due to COVID- 19, certain tests normally administered at specified centers are Page 171 of 177 temporarily being ad ministered remotely. Under the interim rule, these tests will remain eligible for registration as secure tests, provided the administrator employs sufficient security measures . In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act, P.L.116 -136), which was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Acts adds a new section, section 710, to Title 17 of the Copyright Act, allowing the Register to toll, waive, adjust, or modify deadlines or procedural provisions on a temporary basis in response to a presidentially -declared national emergency. Pursuant to the CARES Act and the emergency relief authority it grants, th e Copyright Office adjust ed the applicable timing provisions in specific cases where compliance would have been possible but for the national emergency. The Acting Register has continuously determined that the disruptions to the copyright system caused by the ong oing national emergency remain in effect and that the modifications therefore should be extended for up to an additional sixty days , most recently extendin g to modifications to January 8, 2021. Examples of these modifications apply to timing provi sions related to certain registration claims, notices of termination, and section 115's paper -based provisions. The Office is continuing to monitor the effect of the national emergency on these and other components of the copyright system and will consider further adjustments as circumstances warrant. International Activities Throughout the year, the Copyright Office continued to provide outreach and education regarding copyright issues to foreign visitors. The Office also hosted international vi sitors to discuss and exchange information on the U.S. copyright system and significant i nternational copyright issues. The Office works with other agencies, including the State Department, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), to participate in meetings organized by those agencies, or to have visitors in those programs meet with the Office directly. Advise Executive Branch Agencies on International Copyright & Trade Matters The Copyright Office supports USTR and other executive branch agencies by serving on official delegations and negotiating teams, as part of its statutory dut ies (17 U .S.C \u00a7 701(b)). In FY 2020, attorneys in the Office of Policy and International Affairs a t the Office supported USTR's work on the USMCA implementation and negotiation of new FTAs with the United Kingdom and Kenya, as well as serving on the U.S. government delegations to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) for meetings with the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights (SCCR). The Office also participated in the annual Special 301 review facilitated by USTR, including the Notorious Markets out -of-cycle review, and engaged in regular consultation with executive branch agencies on copyright law and enforcement developments in other countries, including Page 172 of 177 draft legislation and guidance documents , compliance efforts, World Trade Organization trade policy reviews and accessions, and reviews under trade preference programs . Artificial Intelligence & Copyright - Co -Sponsored with WIPO On February 5, 2020, the Copyright Office and WIPO co -sponsored a symposium that took an in-depth look at how the creative community currently utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to create original works. Panelists' discussions included the relationship between AI and copyright , what level of human input is sufficient for the resulting work to be eligible for copyright protection, the challenges and considerations for using copyright -protected works to train a machine or to examine large data sets , and the future of AI and copyright policy. The Office also submitted a response to the WIPO Conversation on Intellectual Property (IP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) , which sought comments on AI's impact on copyright authorship and ownership, copyright infringement and copyright infringement exceptions, and deep fakes. In the Office's first response, dated February 14, 2020, the Office acknowledged the increasing intersection of AI and copyright law, particularly in terms of copyright authorship. The Office echoed these same statements in its written submission to the WIPO Conversation on Intellectual Property and Artificial Intelligence: Second Session, dated July 2020, and recognized the complexities surrounding the development of copyright law and policy at the national and global level to accommodate these new technologies .
