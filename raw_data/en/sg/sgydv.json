Related Articles Breastfeeding (and Formula Feeding)It's important to know whether you will breastfeed or bottle-feed your baby prior to delivery, as the breasts' ability to produce milk diminishes soon after childbirth without the stimulation of breastfeeding. Breast milk is easily digested by babies and contains infection-fighting antibodies and cholesterol, which promotes brain growth. Formula-fed babies actually need to eat somewhat less often since formula is less readily digested by the baby than human milk. This article explores the advantages and disadvantages of both forms of feeding. Can Drinking Water Help Prevent a Stroke?Many studies have proven that proper hydration at the time of a stroke is linked to better stroke recovery. It is possible that dehydration causes blood to be thicker. Viscous blood causes the body to retain sodium and increases blood pressure. Drinking enough water regularly prevents dehydration. This may play a role in keeping the blood less viscous, which in turn prevents a stroke. Watery EyesAlways tearing up? Everyday things can make your eyes water, but so can some medical conditions.

Ibuprofen intravenous (IV)Ibuprofen intravenous (IV) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administered into the vein (intravenous) to treat pain, fever, and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in newborn babies. Side effects of ibuprofen vary depending on the type of treatment, which can include nausea, vomiting, gas (flatulence), headache, low red blood cell count (anemia), presence of bacteria in blood (bacteremia), low protein levels in blood (hypoproteinemia), high blood pressure (hypertension), sepsis, bleeding in the brain, cessation of breathing (apnea), bacterial pneumonia, dizziness, and others. Newborn Infant Hearing ScreeningA newborn infant hearing screening is performed before a child is discharged from the hospital. If an infant doesn't pass the test, a rescreen is performed. Detecting hearing loss at an early age increases a child's chance of having a healthy and more productive life. There are two methods of testing hearing in infants: auditory brainstem response (ABR) and otoacoustic emission (OAE). Both tests are accurate, automated, and don't require a visible response from the infant. nitric oxide gasNitric oxide gas is used for treating hypoxic respiratory failure in newborns caused by impaired lung function, which leads to low oxygen levels in the tissues (hypoxia). It may also be used for cystic fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), sickle cell crises, diagnosis of sarcoidosis, and others. Common side effects of nitric oxide gas include low blood pressure (hypotension), withdrawal, complete or partial collapse of a lung's lobe or an entire lung (atelectasis), blood in urine (hematuria), high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia), whistling sound while breathing due to obstructed airway (stridor), infection, cellulitis, and sepsis. 7 Ways Water Benefits the BodyDrinking water benefits digestion, metabolism, toxin elimination, and other functions.

Health benefits of hydration include improvements in mood, skin health, and ability to work out. oxytocinOxytocin is a synthetic form of the natural human hormone oxytocin used to induce or improve uterine contractions during delivery and to prevent uncontrolled bleeding (hemorrhage) after the delivery. Common side effects of oxytocin include serious allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction), premature ventricular contractions, postpartum hemorrhage, pelvic hematoma, irregular heart rhythms (cardiac arrhythmia), bleeding in the space between the brain and its membrane (subarachnoid hemorrhage), fatal afibrinogenemia, hypertensive episodes, nausea, vomiting, and rupture of the uterus. Oxytocin should not be used otherwise during pregnancy or when breastfeeding. What Does the ASPA Gene Do?ASPA (aspartoacylase) is the gene that codes for a protein called aspartoacylase. Aspartoacylase is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of a molecule called N-acetylaspartate (NAA), which is found in high concentrations in the brain. Mutations in the ASPA gene can lead to a deficiency in aspartoacylase activity, which can cause a rare genetic disorder called Canavan disease. Children with Canavan disease typically have a severe intellectual disability and may have problems with movement, feeding, and breathing.
