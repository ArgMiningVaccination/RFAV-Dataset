Subsequently, this information may be used to inform decisions and guide efforts to improve community health and wellness . A Community Health Needs Assessment provides information so that communities may identify issues of greatest concern and decide to commit resources to those areas, thereby making the greatest possible impact on community health status . This assessment for Englewood Health is part of a regional project conducted by Profes sional Research Consultants, Inc. (P RC) for the Community Health Improvement Partnership (CH IP) of Bergen County (\"the Partnership \"). PRC is a national ly recognized health care consulting firm with extensive experience conducting Community Health Needs Assessments in hundreds of communities across the United States since 1994. Methodology This assessment incorporates data from multiple sources, including primary research (throug h the PRC Community Health Survey and PRC Online Key Informant Survey), as well as secondary research (vital statistics and other existing health -related data). It also allows for trending and comparison to benchmark data at the state and national levels. PRC Community Health Survey Survey Instrument The survey instrument used for this study is based largely on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), as well as various other public health sur veys and customized questions addressing gaps in indicator data relative to health promotion and disease prevention objectives and other recognized health issues . The final survey instrument was developed by the Partnership and PRC and is similar to a previous survey used in the region in 2016 , allowing for data trending . Community Defined for This Assessment For Englewood Health, the community of focus (referred to as \"service area \" in this report) is defined as each of the residential ZIP Codes comprisin g the primary and secondary service area s of Englewood Health . This community definition, determined based on the ZIP Codes of residence of most recent patients, is illustrated in the following map. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 6 Sample Approach & Design A precise and carefully executed methodology is critical in asserting the validity of the results gathered in the PRC Community Health Survey. Thus, to ensure the best representation of the population surveyed, a mixed -mode methodology was implemented. This included targeted surveys conducted by PRC via telephone (cell phone and landline ) or through online que stionnaires, as well as a community outreach component promoted by the study sponsors through social media posting and other communications. RANDOM -SAMPLE SURVEYS (PRC) For the targeted administration, PRC administered 1,156 surveys at random throughout the hospital service area . COMMUNITY OUTREACH SURVEYS (Community Health Improvement Partnership of Bergen County ) PRC also created a link to an online version of the survey, and the Partnership promoted this link throughout the various communities in ord er to drive additional participation and bolster overall samples. This yielded an additional 640 surveys to the overall sample. In all, 1,796 surveys were completed through these mechanisms . Once the interviews were completed, these were weighted in propor tion to the actual population distribution so as to appropriately represent the service area as a whole. All administration of the surveys, data collection, and data analysis was conducted by PRC. For statistical purposes, for questions asked of all respo ndents, the maximum rate of error associated with a sample size of 1,796 respondents is \u00b1 2.3% at the 95 percent confidence level. Sample Characteristics To accurately represent the population studied, PRC strives to minimize bias through application of a proven telephone methodology and random -selection techniques . While this random sampling of the population produces a highly representative sample, it is a common and preferred practice to \"weight \" the raw data to improve this representati veness even further . This is accomplished by adjusting the results of a random sample to match the geographic distribution and demographic characteristics of the population surveyed (poststratification), so as to eliminate any naturally occurring bias . The following chart outline s the characteristics of the service area sample for key demographic variables, compared to actual population characteristics revealed in census data . [Note that the sample consisted COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 7 solely of area residents age 18 and older; data on children were given by proxy by the person most responsible for that child 's health care needs, and these children are not represented demographically in this chart.] Population & Survey Sample Characteristics (Englewood Health Service Area, 2022) Sources: US Census Bureau, 2011 -2015 American Community Survey. 2022 PRC Community Health Survey, PRC, Inc. Notes: FPL is federal poverty level, based on guidelines established by the US Department of Health & Human 40 to 64 65+ White Hispanic Diverse Races<200% FPLActual Population Final Survey SampleDiverse 10.8% American Native 1.1% Multiple/Other 1.2% The sample design and the quality control procedures used in the data collection ensure that the sample is representative . Thus, th e findings may be generalized to the total population of community members in the defined area with a high degree of confidence. INCOME & RACE/ETHNICITY INCOME Poverty descriptions and segmentation used in this report are based on administrative poverty thresholds determined by the US Department of Health & Human Services. These guidelines define poverty status by household income level and number of persons in t he household (e.g., the 2021 guidelines place the poverty threshold for a family of four at $26, 500 annual household income or lower). In sample segmentation: \"very low income\" refers to community members living in a household with defined poverty status; \"low income\" refers to households with incomes just above the poverty level and earning up to twice (100% -199% of) the poverty threshold; and \"mid/high income\" refers to those households living on incomes which are twice or more (200% of) the federal pove rty level. RACE & ETHNICITY In analyzing survey results, mutually exclusive race and ethnicity categories are used. All Hispanic respondents are grouped, regardless of identity with any race group. Other race categories are non -Hispanic categorizations (e.g., \"White\" reflects non -Hispanic White respondents). COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 8 Online Key Informant Survey To solicit input from key informants, those individuals who have a broad interest in the health of the community, an Online Key Informant Survey also was implemented a s part of this process. A list of recommended participants was provided by the Community Health Improvement Partnership of Bergen County ; this list included names and contact information for physicians, public health representatives, other health professionals, social service providers, and a variety of other community leaders. Potential participants were chosen because of their ability to identify primary concerns of the populations with whom they work, as well as of the community overall . Key in formants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of the survey and providing a link to take the survey online ; reminder emails were sent as needed to increase participation . Local stakeholders were asked to provide input about communities in Berge n County ; the input also included stakeholders who work more regionally or statewide . In all , 146 community stakeholders in Bergen County took part in the Online Key Informant Survey, as outlined below: ONLINE KEY INFORMANT SURVEY PARTICIPATION KEY INFORMANT TYPE NUMBER PARTICIPATING Physicians 17 Public Health Representatives 15 Other Health Providers 39 Social Services Providers 26 Other Community Leaders 49 Final participation included representatives of the organizations outlined below.

In the online survey, key informants were asked to rate the degree to which various health issues are a problem in their own community. Follow -up questions asked them to describe why they identify problem areas as such and how these might better be addressed. Results of their r atings, as well as their verbatim comments, are included throughout this report as they relate to the various other data presented. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 10 Focus Groups & Key Informant Interviews To complement the survey and other findings, multiple focus groups were held through out the county among those representing the following populations: African American Community Leaders Elder Care Providers EMT/First Responders Health Officers from Bergen County Communities Korean Language Speakers LGBTQ+ Community Members Mental Health a nd Substance Use Providers Latinx Community Leaders Youth Service Providers In addition, a series of one -on-one interviews was also conducted with a variety of key informants . These focus groups and interviews were conducted by 35th Street Consulting, LLC, and a summary of the findings from these research activities can be found as an appendix to this report. Public Health, Vital Statistics & Other Data A variety of existing (secondary) data sources was consulted to complement the research quality of this Community Health Needs Assessment . Data for the service area were obtained from the following sources (specific citations are included with the graphs throughout this report): Center for Applied Research and Engagem ent Systems (CARES) , University of Missouri Extension, SparkMap (sparkmap.org) Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Office of Infectious Disease, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention Centers for Disease Control & Preve ntion, Office of Public Health Science Services, Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services, Division of Health Informatics and Surveillance (DHIS) Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Office of Public Health Science Services, Natio nal Center for Health Statistics ESRI ArcGIS Map Gallery National Cancer Institute, State Cancer Profiles OpenStreetMap (OSM) US Census Bureau, American Community Survey US Census Bureau, County Business Patterns US Census Bureau, Decennial Census US Depar tment of Agriculture, Economic Research Service US Department of Health & Human Services COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 11 US Department of Health & Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation US Department o f Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Note that secondary data for the service area reflect county -level data for Bergen County , New Jersey . Benchmark Data Trending A similar survey was administered in the service area in 2016 by PRC on behalf of the Partnership . Trending data, as revealed by comparison to prior survey results, are provided throughout this report whenever available (however, note that the hospital's geographic service area definition has changed slightly since t he 2016 survey data were collected) . Historical data for secondary data indicators in Bergen County are also included for the purposes of trending . Bergen County Data Because this assessment was part of a broader, regional project conducted by the Partners hip, a Bergen County benchmark for survey indicators is also available . New Jersey Risk Factor Data Statewide risk factor data are provided where available as an additional benchmark against which to compare local survey findings; these data represent the most recent BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) Prevalence and Trends Data published online by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . State -level vital statistics are also provided for comparison of secondary data indicators. Nationwide Risk Factor Data Nationwide risk factor data, which are also provided in comparison charts, are taken from the 2020 PRC National Health Survey ; the methodological approach for the national study is similar to that employed in this assessment, and these data may be generalized to the US population with a high degree of confidence. National -level vital statistics are also provided for comparison o f secondary data indicators. Healthy People 2030 Healthy People provides 10 -year, measurable public health objectives \u2014 and tools to help track progress toward achieving them. Healthy People identifies public health priorities to help individuals, organiz ations, and communities across the United States improve health and well - being. Healthy People 2030, the initiative's fifth iteration, builds on knowledge gained over the first four decades. Healthy People 2030's overarching goals are to: Attain healthy, t hriving lives and well -being free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death. Eliminate health disparities, achieve health equity, and attain health literacy to improve the health and well -being of all. Create social, physical, and eco nomic environments that promote attaining the full potential for health and well -being for all. Promote healthy development, healthy behaviors, and well -being across all life stages. Engage leadership, key constituents, and the public across multiple secto rs to take action and design policies that improve the health and well -being of all. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 12 The Healthy People 2030 framework was based on recommendations made by the Secretary's Advisory Committee on National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives fo r 2030. After getting feedback from individuals and organizations and input from subject matter experts, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) approved the framework which helped guide the selection of Healthy People 2030 objectives. Information Gaps While this assessment is quite comprehensive, it cannot measure all possible aspects of health in the community, nor can it adequately represent all possible populations of interest . It must be recognized that these information gaps might in s ome ways limit the ability to assess all of the community 's health needs. For example, certain population groups \u2014 such as the homeless, institutionalized persons, or those who only speak a language other than English or Spanish \u2014 are not represented in t he survey data . Other population groups \u2014 for example, pregnant women, undocumented residents, and members of certain racia l/ethnic or immigrant groups \u2014 might not be identifiable or might not be represented in numbers sufficient for independent analyses . In terms of content, this assessment was designed to provide a comprehensive and broad picture of the health of the overall community . However, there are certainly medical conditions that are not specifically addressed . Public Comment Englewood Health made its prior Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) report publicly available on its website; through that mechanism , the hospital requested from the public written comments and feedback regarding the CHNA and implementation strategy . At the time of this writing, Englewood Health had not received any written comments . However, through population surveys and key informant feedback for this assessment, input from the broader community was considered and taken into account when identifying and prioritizing the significant health needs of the community . Englewood Health will continue to use its website as a tool to solicit public comments and ensure that these comments are considered in the development of future CHNAs . COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 13 IRS Form 990, Schedule H Compliance For non -profit hospitals, a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) also serves to satisfy certain requirements of tax reporting, pursuant to provisions of the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act of 2010 . To understand which elements of this report relate to those requested as part of hospitals ' reporting on IRS Schedule H (Form 990) , the following table cross -references related section s.

From these data, opportunities for health improvement exist in the area with regard to the following health issues (see also the summary tables presented in the following section). The Areas of Opportunity were determined after consideration of various criteria, including: standing in compar ison with benchmark data (particularly national data) ; identified trend s; the preponderance of significant findings within topic areas; the magnitude of the issue in terms of the number of persons affected; and the potential health impact of a given issue . These also take into account those issues of greatest concern to the community stakeholders (key informants) giving input to this process. AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFIED THROUGH THIS ASSESSMENT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES Barriers to Access - Inconvenient Office Hours - Cost of Physician Visits - Cost of Prescriptions - Appointment Availability - Finding a Physician - Lack of Transportation Skipping/Stretching Prescriptions Specific Source of Ongoing Medical Care CANCER Leading Cause of Death Cancer Incidence - Including Prostate Canc er Cancer Prevalence DIABETES Prevalence of Borderline/Pre -Diabetes HEART DISEASE & STROKE Leading Cause of Death High Blood Cholesterol Prevalence HOUSING Stress About Rent/Mortgage Housing Conditions INJURY & VIOLENCE Unintentional Injury Deaths Violent Crime Experience Intimate Partner Violence MENTAL HEALTH \"Fair/Poor\" Mental Health Diagnosed Depression Symptoms of Chronic Depression Stress Difficulty Obtaining Mental Health Services Key Informants: Mental health ranked as a top concern. \u2014continued on the following page \u2014 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 15 AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY (continued) NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY & WEIGHT Food Insecurity Difficulty Accessing Fresh Produce Overweight & Obesity [Adults] Overweight & Obesity [Children] Key Informants: Nutrition, physical activity, and weight ranked as a top concern. ORAL HEALTH Regular Dental Care [Adults] POTENTIALLY DISABLING CONDITIONS High-Impact Chronic Pain Alzheimer's Disease Deaths RESPIRATORY DISEASE COVID -19 Deaths Asthma Prevalence [Adults] Asthma Prevalence [Children] Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Prevalence SUBSTANCE USE Cirrhosis/Liver Disease Deaths Unintentional Drug -Related Deaths Illicit Drug Use Use of Marijuana Personally Impacted by Substance Use (Self or Other's) Key Informants: Substance use ranked as a top concern. Prioritization of Health Needs Key Informant Input Prioritization of the health needs identified in this assessment (\"Areas of Opportunity\" above) was initially determined based on a prioritization exercise conducted among community stakeholders (representing a cross -section of community -based agencies and organizations) in conjunction with the administration of the Online Key Informant Survey. In this process, these key informants were asked to rate the severity of a variety of health issues in the community. Insofar as these health issues were identified through the data above and/or were identified as top concerns among key informants, their ranking of these issues informed the following priorities: 1. Mental Health 2. Substance Use 3. Nutrition, Physical Activity & Weight 4. Diabetes 5. Respiratory Diseases (includi ng COVID -19) 6. Heart Disease & Stroke 7. Potentially Disabling Conditions 8. Cancer 9. Access to Healthcare Services 10. Oral Health 11. Injury & Violence COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 16 Not prioritized within the list above is Housing , which potentially impacts outcomes for all of the above. Community Feedback On October 19, 2022, the Partnership convened an online meeting with community partners to review and discuss the findings of this assessment. At that time, it was determined to address the issues identified above within the reframed priority areas as follows, each examined for health disparities and social determinants, viewed through the lens of health equity, and addressed using a whole -person approach: Healthy Minds (e.g., behavioral health, mental health, subst ance use, stress) Healthy Bodies (e.g., chronic disease, prevention, and awareness) Building Bridges (e.g., housing , food insecurity, barriers to health care access ) Hospital Implementation Strategy Englewood Health will use the information from this Community Health Needs Assessment to develop an Implementation Strategy to address the significant health needs in the community . While the hospital will likely not implement strategies for all of the health issues liste d above, the results of this prioritization exercise will be used to inform the development of the hospital 's action plan to guide community health improvement efforts in the coming years. Note: An evaluation of the hospital 's past activities to address th e needs identified in prior CHNAs can be found as an appendix to this report. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 17 Summary Tables: Comparisons With Benchmark Data The following tables provide an overview of indicators in the Englewood Health service area , as well as trend data.

Social determinants of health (SDOH) have a major impact on people's health, well -being, and quality of life. Example s of SDOH include: - Safe housing, transportation, and neighborhoods - Racism, discrimination, and violence - Education, job opportunities, and income - Access to nutritious foods and physical activity opportunities - Polluted air and water - Language and literacy ski lls SDOH also contribute to wide health disparities and inequities. For example, people who don't have access to grocery stores with healthy foods are less likely to have good nutrition. That raises their risk of health conditions like heart disease, diabe tes, and obesity \u2014 and even lowers life expectancy relative to people who do have access to healthy foods.

Based on demographic and economic statistics, the CNI provides a score for every populated ZIP code in the United States on a scale of 1. 0 to 5.0. The CNI score is an average of five different barrier scores that measure various socio -economic indicators. A score of 1.0 indicates a ZIP code with the least need, while a score of 5.0 represents a ZIP code with the most need compared to the US national average (score of 3.0). The CNI is strongly linked to variations in community healthcare needs and is a good indicator of a community's demand for a range of healthcare services.

They need to refer and not just take on patience to make money - Other Healthcare Provider COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 54 Just not enough resources in an emergency. Hard to access help, many insurances do not cover. Stigma. - Social Servic es Provider Access to care, stigma, diagnosis. - Community/Business Leader Lack of resources and poor post diagnostic follow up. COVID -19 has exacerbated behavioral and mental health issues. Lack of resources. - Community/Business Leader Access to servi ces to manage their mental health and to learn coping strategies. - Other Healthcare Provider Access to care. Stigma associated with the illness. Lack of mental health literacy - people experiencing challenges lack the awareness of mental health signs and symptoms therefore don't associate their challenges with mental health hence do not seek support/treatment. Suicide - the # of lives lost to suicide and people who attempt suicide warrant a public health crisis just like COVID. The Dept of Ed's policies n eed to be transformed to incorporate mental health education into every subject from K -12: 1x only education 1x/year is ineffective. Lack of awareness of resources - the 2 -1-1 system that is funded by the state with the intent of serving as a single point of access to resources has not been and continues to be ineffective. Mental health program names are confusing/unclear. Family/child mental health urgent care/resource center is needed. Specialized supportive housing is needed. Seamless connections and coo rdination of care is lacking=people don't get coordinated care - Social Services Provider Lack of access to mental health supports. Every long wait times for mental health supports. Mental health staff shortages. Not enough culturally competent practition ers/inability to provide services in other languages. Cost. - Social Services Provider Access to counseling and treatment, education. - Public Health Representative Access and stigma of gaining access. - Community/Business Leader Accessing and finding a ppropriate resources. Waiting time to be seen by professionals. - Other Healthcare Provider Access to care that's not a clinic setting. It seems any doctor that you would want to bring your family to are generally out of network and don't take health insu rance. Other options are more clinic situation which seem to be a volume practice. - Physician Lack of services and affordability. - Community/Business Leader Inadequate mental health inpatient & outpatient facilities, insufficient psychologists, long wa iting lists. Insufficient child/adolescent psychiatrist & neuropsychiatrists. Inadequate housing for people with combined mental health & housing issues. Inadequate mental health services for people without housing. Inadequate addiction services. - Physici an There are not enough IOP's or long -term involuntary beds for people in crisis, especially children. There are not enough therapists that take insurance. - Other Healthcare Provider Lack of Mental Health services at the local Health Departments. - Public Health Representative Lack of mental health facilities for the I/DD population. Lack of services for eating disorders, especially for youth. - Social Services Provider Access to care for both psychotherapy and psychiatric care. - Physician Hard to fi nd services to support adults and pediatric mental health concerns. - Other Healthcare Provider Waitlists for treatment as long as eight months. Psychiatrists who don't take insurance. Lack of Medicaid providers. The entire system is backlogged, from Outp atient to Day Programs to hospitals. - Social Services Provider Access. - Community/Business Leader Lack of timely access and coverage. - Other Healthcare Provider Access to care. - Public Health Representative Denial/Stigma The stigma surrounding mental health outreach. As an African American many sad misconceptions about mental health issues keep many in the black and brown communities from seeking the much -needed help they should be receiving. More seminars and educational info is needed to educate those communities to let them know mental health is nothing to be ashamed of and certainly getting help is a courageous and respectable thing to do. - Community/Busines s Leader There is still a huge stigma about getting help. And not enough resources. - Other Healthcare Provider Discrimination, Denial, Lack of education, Lack of support services for clients and family members. People with mental illnesses should receiv e treatment and support and should not become part of the penal system. Family members often find it exhausting and frustrating to deal with a family member with a mental illness. If there are financial issues, it is even less likely that the person in nee d of treatment will be able to receive that treatment. Sometimes families move away leaving their family member on his own out of frustration. - Community/Business Leader COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 55 Mental health has become a large issue not just in Bergen County but across the nati on. I believe the biggest challenge for people is overcoming the stigma that is attached to mental health issues. Someone that is suffering from mental issues can be perceived as \"crazy\" or unstable causing them to not receive a job offer or be socially accepted. There are also limited therapists that accept insurance or are affordable to those that do not have insurance. Because of the limited covered services, many people go untreated which causes their issues to escalate and become so overwhelming, they are not able to function in society. - Other Healthcare Provider Acknowledgement that there is an issue, access to care and support, stigma. The pandemic has markedly increased mental health issues. - Other Healthcare Provider Stigma with reaching out fo r supports and the lack of supports out there. - Social Services Provider The stigma of having mental health issues and the accessibility of mental health services. - Community/Business Leader Shame and discomfort around asking for help. - Social Service s Provider One of the biggest challenges continues to be the stigma, talking about mental health, admitting one is struggling or has a family member who is, and accepting it as an illness that needs attention and often one from which someone can recover o r at least live with. - Social Services Provider Even before COVID, there are an overwhelming amount of mental health issues not only in adults but more so in youth. The stigma attached to acknowledging there is an issue with yourself of a loved one is th e first hurdle to jump over. Many are not ready to do that because of the fear of judgement. With the pandemic, youth are experiencing high levels of anxiety. They cannot express themselves and are holding it all in. - Public Health Representative The sti gma that you are weak if you need help, especially among males. - Community/Business Leader I see stigma associated with issues of mental health to be the biggest issue facing people today. This is especially true in minority communities. In addition, too many people do not realize or accept that positive life events can also lead to a mental health crisis --such as postpartum depression or anxiety. - Community/Business Leader I think people try to hide their mental health issues. They also try to avoid ta king medication due to stigma or due to side effects. - Physician Affordable Care/Services Affordable providers, most are out of pocket payments. Education and prevention programs needed at a younger age. - Other Healthcare Provider Complete lack of affo rdable resources, lack of resources in general. Available resources overburdened. Lack of Inpatient beds. Deficiencies in pediatric and adolescent care and lack of resources. - Other Healthcare Provider Access to affordable mental health services. - Other Healthcare Provider Access to professionals can be costly and finding the right doctor can be challenging. I'm concerned that people with depression may give up trying to find the right doctor. - Public Health Representative Access to affordable quality care. - Community/Business Leader Due to COVID -19 COVID caused significant mental health problems with people of all ages, especially teens and children. - Community/Business Leader COVID 19 and the severe isolation that brought on among residents in th e community. - Social Services Provider The COVID -19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on the mental -wellness of NJ residents of all ages. Though the physical health impact seen during the past two + years is widely known and continues to be experience d by many, the long -term outcome of the pandemic will certainly show that the impact on mental health is even greater. Statistics already show increased and steadily increasing levels of anxiety, depression, and substance misuse, especially including among those without a prior history of these symptoms. We expect to see that impact continue to manifest itself and increase for years to come. That view is already widely held among health -care providers in NJ and beyond. - Community/Business Leader I think t he pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of many, but in particular older residents who may be suffering from social isolation and loneliness. For the past two years many have had to be isolated, particularly if they were at high -risk for COVID and even now many do not feel comfortable being out in public even if they are fully vaccinated and boosted. There is also a stigma still attached to mental illness which may be inhibiting many from being able to seek support our counseling servi ces. - Community/Business Leader Incidence/Prevalence Depression and anxiety area frequently diagnosed within our facility as well as others. Data shows it has increased in terms of primary diagnosis within the last six years. - Other Healthcare Provider High rates of depression, psychosis, and suicidality. - Physician COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 56 This is a really big issue in my community. As with other diseases, especially for mental health, language is very important, but there are very few psychiatrists who can speak Korean. A professional with a medical background is absolutely necessary, not a social worker or counselor. Currently, many people are suffering from this mental health in the Korean community. - Community/Business Leader Lack of Providers Scarcity of mental health providers. Overuse of Emergency Departments for non -emergency mental health needs. Gaps in insurance coverage; exceptional scarcity of providers who accept Medicaid. - Other Healthcare Provider Not enough providers, especially prescribers. Not enough housing and resource options. Difficult to access services, especially i f you're working poor. - Social Services Provider Lack of providers, wait lists, lack of specialists. Neuropsychology, substance abuse counseling, marriage, and family. - Other Healthcare Provider Access to Care for Uninsured/Underinsured Accessing servi ce if uninsured. Appointments can be expensive, requiring multiple visits. Less reimbursement for mental health related appointments as they are \"out of network\". Looking for drugs to deal with issues. Drug dependency. - Other Healthcare Provider Access t o services when they do not have private insurance. - Community/Business Leader Diagnosis/Treatment Seeking help/insurance/financial. - Other Healthcare Provider Those with mental health issues are not given real therapy and services. Mental health in th is country is ignored until someone acts out and the answer is to throw them in jail, which does not help either. - Other Healthcare Provider Insurance Issues Insurance limitations often restrict length of stay. New Bridge Medical has the most beds, but H oly Name and Hackensack have Psychiatric Units. However, housing, and intermediate support are sorely lacking. - Community/Business Leader Developing a therapeutic alliance with an outpatient psychiatrist, especially so for children and adolescents. The biggest barriers are high deductibles, copays, burdensome arbitrary managed care requirements and shady practices by insurance companies purposely designed to stop individuals from getting treatment (i.e. costing the insurance company money this quarter). I myself was sued sent to collections by the hospital that my own family member works for, for a bill that I didn't know existed before the collectors started calling. Why? Because somebody, somewhere misspelled my name by one letter and my insurance provid er denied payment. Am I expected to believe that with all my insurance information, my social security number and entire medical record, the insurance company or hospital could not possibly have connected those dots? Fraud has been institutionalized in hea lth care and instead of going after the perpetrators we are putting pressure on physicians. - Physician Alcohol/Drug Use Substance abuse and depression and anxiety. - Community/Business Leader Drugs, functional alcoholism, depression, child suicide attem pts. - Other Healthcare Provider Co-Occurrences Significant increase in mental health conditions as a result of COVID. - Other Healthcare Provider Anxiety and depression. - Community/Business Leader Suicide Rates Suicide, anxiety, and depression are ver y high and the backlog for students and adults to access services is extremely long. - Community/Business Leader Suicidal ideation. Post -Pandemic trauma depression and anxiety. - Social Services Provider Isolation Many are faced with isolation, depressio n, loneliness, and anxiety. It has been a challenge to get services with the lack of available clinicians. - Social Services Provider Isolation and loneliness is a major cause of depression and other mental health issues. - Community/Business Leader COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 57 Awar eness/Education Lack of basic knowledge on mental health. What, why and how to cope with the disease, in addition to social stigma against the disease. - Community/Business Leader Access for Medicare/Medicaid Patients Lack of providers taking Medicaid and uninsured patie nts to address mental health care. - Social Services Provider Follow -Up/Support Finding support and a consistent provider. For the uninsured or the underinsured, finding counseling or psychiatric services can be difficult to navigate, even when an individ ual is ready to come forward and seek help. - Public Health Representative Funding Lack of funding for programs that do provide help. Barriers to programs, accessible housing, mental health advocacy. - Social Services Provider Impact on Families When peo ple have mental health issues, the caregiver needs to take care the client for 24 hours a day. It means that the caregiver's quality of living can be dropped due to the client's health issues. - Community/Business Leader Impact on Quality of Life They hav e an issue dealing with everyday problems. - Other Healthcare Provider Time, energy, finances, stigma. - Other Healthcare Provider Language Barrier Little or no access to care especially for patients with limited English proficiency. - Physician Prevent ion/Screenings Mental health should be screened at every medical visit and attended to.

RELATED ISSUE See also Nutrition , Physical Activity & Weight and Tobacco Use in the Modifiable Health Risk s section of this report. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 65 Among those rating this issue as a \"major problem, \" reasons related to the following: Incidence/Prevalence High prevalence of stroke diagnoses. - Physician Women's risk of heart disease is increasing, and the aftermath of a stroke can leave a person disabled. - Public Health Representative Hearing more about it lately and know a few peopl e who have died recently in the community. - Community/Business Leader Still so many patients have CAD and PVD. It is sometimes shocking how bad the leg swelling is on patients and how far they will let it go without getting care. - Physician Common diag nosis. - Community/Business Leader There are pockets of spaces in our community where heart disease and stroke are still of great concern. - Other Healthcare Provider Many clients that I sit down with for nutrition counseling suffer from hypertension and high cholesterol. - Other Healthcare Provider Prevalence rate is very high. - Community/Business Leader Cases of hypertension are high in number. - Public Health Representative The increased incidence proves that these are major problems. - Other Healt hcare Provider Awareness/Education Awareness of lifestyle choices. - Other Healthcare Provider Lack of information about how to prevent and address. - Community/Business Leader High blood pressure. People in my community are under educated about the side effects of high blood pressure. - Community/Business Leader Because people do not pay attentio n to warning signs. We don't pay enough attention to nutrition and exercise. - Community/Business Leader Lack of awareness and lack of affordable lifestyle programs. - Other Healthcare Provider Nutrition Lack ongoing Outpatient Nutrition care to support lifestyle changes to improve outcomes. - Public Health Representative Access to heart healthy diet, education, exercise, transportation to doctor's visits. - Public Health Representative Lifestyle Heart attack is a major cause of death. Lifestyle choices make heart disease and/or stroke a probability. - Community/Business Leader It's a problem in all communities. Our lifestyles lend itself to developing these issues. - Social Services Provider Obesity The community in general are overweight and not acti ve as much as other areas of the country. - Community/Business Leader I see a major increase in obesity and sedentary lifestyle and heart disease is a natural byproduct of that. - Physician Vulnerable Populations BC has a number of historically underserv ed populations. These groups were disproportionally challenged by heart disease. - Community/Business Leader There are specific population such as the Latin X and Black communities that have increase numbers of people who are not aware of their risks for heart disease and stroke. Lack of education, lifestyle, medication compliant, and altogether lack resources. - Community/Business Leader Access to Care/Services When they have heart disease and stroke as their major problems, they have less access to the daily activity than normal healthy adults. It could be the major issue that the patience have less access to daily living activity. - Community/Business Leader COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 66 Comorbidities More than 50% of our residents have diabetes that is not well controlled which le ads to heart disease and stroke. Not having access to healthy food options and not being able to afford gym memberships. - Social Services Provider Co-Occurrences These are complications of uncontrolled chronic diseases and downstream effects of poor acce ss to health care earlier in life. - Physician Diagnosis/Treatment For underserved populations, high blood pressure and hypertension are under diagnosed and under treated making the likelihood of a stroke higher. Despite taking medication, there is not en ough focus on shifting lifestyle thus making treatment less effective for underserved populations taking medications. Obesity and under activity are issues across black, Hispanic and the elderly. - Social Services Provider Disease Management These chronic conditions require ongoing care and monitoring. People who are uninsured don't have access to care. - Other Healthcare Provider Cancer ABOUT CANCER Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. ...The cancer death rate has declined in recent decades, but over 600,000 people still die from cancer each year in the United States. Death rates are higher for some cancers and in some racial/ethnic minority groups. These disparities are often linked to social determinants of health, including education, economic status, and access to health care. Interventions to promote evidence -based cancer screenings \u2014 such as screenings for lung, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer \u2014 can help reduce cancer deaths. Other effective prevention strategies i nclude programs that increase HPV vaccine use, prevent tobacco use and promote quitting, and promote healthy eating and physical activity. In addition, effective targeted therapies and personalized treatment are key to helping people with cancer live longe r. - Healthy People 2030 (https://health.gov/healthypeople) COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 67 Age-Adjusted Cancer Deaths The following chart illustrates age -adjusted cancer mortality (all types ) in the service area .

They need more options and education on how to make it manageable. - Social Services Provider High prevalence among population. - Physician Many of our residents have severe arthritis that significantly affects their quality of life. - Social Services Provider COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 95 Increase in hip replacements , increase in obesity , Increased patients in pain , this is visible on any given day and any of the local s uperstores watching people struggle . Be it walking or just getting around , plus my patient population seems to suffer greatly from pain and disability - Physician Many people suffering and cost of treatments that are out of the mainstream AKA medication. - Community/Business Leader There is an entire community of people who are wheelchair bound or homebound. I've recently become more aware of this community. They usually order groceries online. - Other Healthcare Provider Previously I worked in a medical clinic where all the patients we saw had some sort of chronic pain. Whether it was low back pain, carpal tunnel or arthritis, almost every person had some sort of long -lasting issue that was affecting them. In many cases, it was so extreme that they were unable to work or complete activities of daily living because of their pain. Arthritis effects almost everyone at some point in their life and there are more people that live with pain and do report it or see a physician. - Other Healthcare Provider Aging Population Seems to be a complaint among seniors. - Community/Business Leader We have an older population, and a significant population that physically work hard. - Social Services Provider In the work I do with older residents and people who are food i nsecure, most suffer from sort of chronic pain and/or disability issue that impacts their daily quality of life. I think in many cases they just accept their circumstances and do not always know how to find the right kind of care to address the issue. In m any cases there is little awareness of self -care strategies for managing these conditions as they are not offered in most primary care settings. - Community/Business Leader Many of the senior population experience severe arthritis and chronic pain on a da ily basis. - Social Services Provider Access to Care Limited resources for people with disability, dangerous obstructed and broke sidewalks. No exercise facilities for people with disability, insufficient adapted affordable housing for people with disabi lities. - Physician They have still lack of social services such as aide services, assistance for caregivers. - Community/Business Leader Services/supports for individuals living with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities and their families through the age continuum and including those with co -occurring medical conditions. There are not enough practitioners and/or services that are culturally appropriate/competent, accept private insurance, Medicaid, offer sliding scale and offer transportation a ssistance. - Social Services Provider More assistance is needed to help adults with their dental, eye, and hearing issues. There is a need for low cost and accessible dental services. Low cost and available hearing aids. Low cost and affordable eye care a nd eyeglasses. Older adults often neglect their dental needs -- a high quality dental clinic that operates with a sliding scale or is covered by NJ Assistance is a necessity. - Social Services Provider Access to diagnostic resources like MRI to make accur ate diagnosis. Cost of physical therapy to aid in recovery. Proper pain management. - Physician Affordable Medications/Supplies Lack of access to non -narcotic pain management. - Other Healthcare Provider People with disabilities often require support tha t they can't afford or is not available. Chronic pain contributes to depression and substance abuse if not managed well. Often chronic pain suffers are unable work impacting all aspects of their life. - Other Healthcare Provider Diagnosis/Treatment More a nd more people are suffering from chronic pain as well as those who have disabilities. There's a lack of knowledge by physicians and especially pain management doctors. Or education is needed to assist those with disabilities and chronic pain be with Physi cal therapy language speech therapy and integrative medicine modalities such as breathing and meditation which are valuable tools... A more round in education is needed for those serving those patients with disabilities and chronic pain. As a speech patholog ist I had excellent training worked with the team and have also trained in mind -body and other tools and techniques to assist those with disabilities and chronic pain. To know they're not learning to change thinking, to change attitudes and behaviors... Pati ents need to be heard in believed not just administer drugs... Rehabilitation is essential and mind -body techniques are essential - Other Healthcare Provider Co-Occurrences Disability can lead to many other problems. Immobility made it difficult to get a co vid test, to get a vaccine. Transportation can be an issue. Chronic pain can lead to drug dependency, and other hazards of immobility. it is a great financial and emotional stressor. - Other Healthcare Provider COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 96 Disease Management Many suffer from chronic pain and tend to ignore or take medications that do not help the root of the problem. - Social Services Provider Due to COVID -19 People with disability are disproportionately affected by COVID -19 Pandemic. There is a great need to scale up disability to b e included in all levels of the healthcare systems especially primary care. - Community/Business Leader Isolation When someone becomes disabled, their access to the world changes leaving them isolated. People suffering from chronic pain, particularly women, are not recognized. Doctors are often suspicious that they may be drug seeking. - Public Health Representative Lack of Providers Not enough physical medicine and rehab specialists and challenging payment models for physical therapy and occupational therapy, and pain and palliative care. - Physician Youth Assistance to children with learning disabilities and diseas es. Multiple sclerosis, etc. and programs once they finish high school. - Social Services Provider Culture Many first -generation Koreans living here are self -employed. They work more than 10 hours a day and usually eat out two or more meals a day. As a r esult, eat a lot of fast foods that contain a lot of salt, sugar and fat. Also, because they do not have time, they neglect to exercise or take care of their health. - Community/Business Leader Alzheimer 's Disease ABOUT DEMENTIA Alzheimer's disease is the most common ca use of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in U.S. adults.1 Nearly 6 million people in the United States have Alzheimer's, and that number will increase as the population ages. Dementia refers to a group of symptoms that cause problems with memor y, thinking, and behavior. People with dementia are more likely to be hospitalized, and dementia is linked to high health care costs. While there's no cure for Alzheimer's disease, early diagnosis and supportive care can improve quality of life. And effort s to make sure adults with symptoms of cognitive decline \u2014 including memory loss \u2014 are diagnosed early can help improve health outcomes in people with dementia. Interventions to address caregiving needs can also help improve health and well -being in people with dementia. - Healthy People 2030 (https://health.gov/healthypeople) COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 97 Age-Adjusted Alzheimer 's Disease Deaths Age-adjusted Alzheimer 's disease mortality is outlined in the following chart.

By 2060, the researchers estimate there will be 3.2 million Hispanic s and 2.2 million African Americans with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. - Community/Business Leader Alzheimer's is prevalent among community seniors who are not getting the support they need. They are mostly relying on their family members or spouse who is frail as well. - Community/Business Leader Increasing numbers of older adults, and people with diagnosis of dementia. - Public Health Representative COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 98 As people live longer there is a greater chance of Alzheimer's Disease. At a recent program for older adults, 75% of the audience present raised their hand when asked if they had been touched by Alzheimer's Disease within their family. Lack of Geriatricians practicing in the area. General Internists don't seem to have specific training in identi fying and caring for people with dementia. Respite and homecare services are not easily accessible or affordable. Day care program at CHCC closed creating a void in day care services for people needing such services in NW Bergen County. - Social Services P rovider Aging Population As the population ages, the rate of dementia increases. Care is expensive limiting the choices families have to help care for the person with dementia. - Social Services Provider As the population is aging and living longer, this is a problem. EBP tells us that 6.2 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's. - Community/Business Leader Serving seniors, we notice issues comparable to this disease, but the individual does not realize this, nor do they have family to assist. - Social Services Provider The population is aging. I know more and more friends who struggle with parents that have dementia. - Other Healthcare Provider Aged community. - Social Services Provider Vulnerable Populations BC has a number of historically unde rserved populations. These groups were disproportionally challenged by dementia, including caregivers. There is a lack of programing in the community. - Community/Business Leader There are many elderly immigrants in this area. Of course, old people are th ose aged 80 -90 years old, but there are a lot of people at 65 who are now eligible for Medicare. I mean A LOT! Many of them are lonely elderly people with few friends or hobbies. However, there is very little dementia prevention education or related facili ties conducted in their language. A related program, seminar, or group meeting is necessary at a hospital trusted by the community rather than a non -profit organization. - Community/Business Leader Awareness/Education Lack of knowledge, stigma attached. B ut Holy Name Medical Center Tina teachers eight is very active in promoting and giving classes and diagnosis treatment and caregivers. - Other Healthcare Provider Lack of knowledge and accessibility. - Community/Business Leader Access to Care/Services Limited long -term-care facilities that will care for this population. - Public Health Representative Difficult to access Neurology care.

It is also challenging to treat because of the level of care that is required, and the expense that co mes along with it. - Public Health Representative Impact on Families Alzheimer's is a family disease. Many families are not educated on resources, the disease and future planning. - Social Services Provider I do not think there is enough support for care givers or enough money to help those families. - Other Healthcare Provider Impact on Quality of Life Dementia is a crippling condition that gradually robs the identity of an individual and this has a tremendous effect not just on the individual but perhap s more so on their families. Assisted living facilities are often perceived to provide sub -standard care and there seems to be a frequent back and forth of individuals with dementia between these facilities and hospitals.

This calculation allows us to examine the proportion of the population who is at a healthy weight, or who is overweight or obese (see table above). ABOUT OVERWEIGHT & OBESITY Obesity is linked to many serious health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer. Some racial/ethnic groups are more likely to have obesity, which increases their risk of chronic diseases. Culturally appropriate programs and policies that help people eat nutritious foods within their calorie needs can reduce overweight and obesity. Public health interventions that make it easier for people to be more ph ysically active can also help them maintain a healthy weight. Healthy People 2030 (https://health.gov/healthypeople) Body Mass Index (BMI), which describes relative weight for height, is significantly correlated with total body fat content. The BMI should be used to assess overweight and obesity and to monitor changes in body weight. In addition, measurements of body weight alone can be used to determine efficacy of weight loss therapy. BMI is calculated as weight (kg)/height squared (m2). To estimat e BMI using pounds and inches, use: [weight (pounds)/height squared (inches2)] x 703. In this report, overweight is defined as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 and obesity as a BMI 30 kg/m2. The rationale behind these definitions is based on epidemiological data that show increases in mortality with BMIs above 25 kg/m2. The increase in mortality, however, tends to be modest until a BMI of 30 kg/m2 is reached. For persons with a BMI 30 kg/m2, mortality rates from all causes, and especially fro m cardiovascular disease, are generally increased by 50 to 100 percent above that of persons with BMIs in the range of 20 to 25 kg/m2. - Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults: The Evidence R eport.

Inadequate access to afford able organic food. Poor quality water supply in parts of Bergen County. Density of fast -food restaurants. - Physician Lack of education, lack of access to healthier experiences, affordable gyms. The high costs to healthier options. - Social Services Provi der Knowledge, access to food. - Community/Business Leader People are not aware of good nutritional health. They do not avail themselves to physical activities that would reduce weight issues. - Community/Business Leader COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 115 Many people are unaware how to go about making lasting changes in diet and lifestyle. Also, t here are many people with a \"fad diet\" mentality who have unrealistic expectations about effort and results and how quickly results should come. Mental health is another challenge because it's an integral piece of making lifestyle changes. - Other Healthca re Provider Lack of information about healthy eating. Lack of exercise. - Community/Business Leader We are a sedentary nation. As people age, they are not educated on the food and budgets they can work with. People are not walking or exercising because t hey may not feel safe and exercise buddies for homebound older adults does not exist. Fixed incomes make it hard to buy enough food. Cheap food is unhealthy food and healthy food is expensive food. - Social Services Provider Insufficient Physical Activity As a society, we are becoming more sedentary. Fast food and processed food are typical food choices. Healthy foods are expensive. - Public Health Representative We don't exercise enough and don't pay attention enough to nutrition. - Community/Business Le ader To me, a huge challenge is the normalization of little physical activity, of reliance on poor food choices due to the pressures of lifestyle. And weight gain that too many people interpret as unavoidable. - Community/Business Leader Lack of exercise . - Social Services Provider Lack of better physical activity in schools. More knowledge of nutrition and weight to school age children. - Social Services Provider Lack of physical activity and lack of information about nutrition lead to increased weight , which is a health issue. - Community/Business Leader Nutrition Ongoing Outpatient nutrition services for obesity. - Public Health Representative Nutrition, physical activity, and mental health issues are our biggest problems in the community. - Physici an Food insecurity, i.e., those living in food deserts or who do not have the resources to access a steady source of fresh, nutritious foods. - Public Health Representative Food insecurity. - Community/Business Leader Without being directly connected to a program, many are not receiving adequate nutritional meals and exercise. Day program at least provide lunch (some breakfast) to seniors Mon -Fri. However, without this connection, many lack a standard 3 meals and physical exercise. - Social Services Prov ider Overeating and now with businesses closing, so many new restaurants, and take out places are moving in. Coupons and promotions may make them affordable but whether or not, the food is properly prepared, high in fat, calories may not be considered by the customer. Obesity is linked to many chronic diseases. High cost of foods especially healthier foods may limit choices for some families. More people rely on Uber. Lyft instead of walking - Other Healthcare Provider Fast food, busy lifestyles, and apat hy. - Physician Access to Affordable Healthy Food Access to healthy food that is easy to prepare. Food prices have skyrocketed, and many have difficult affording healthy options. - Physician Poor access to affordable food options, low health literacy, hi gh stress jobs. - Physician Affordable health food. Affordable weight loss and exercise programs and transportation. - Other Healthcare Provider Low income/poverty level, not enough access to healthy food items and unable to afford gym memberships. - Social Services Provider For nutrition, is the lack of income to afford healthy food. Lack of free or low -cost wellness programs in our local neighborhoods. - Social Services Provider Access to affordable, healthy food. The quality of food and presentation of said food that is served to students in schools is subpar. Schools have sent the message that phys ed/activity is not important hence it was cut/reduced from daily schedules. Businesses do not incorporate physical activity but allow smoking breaks. Weig ht issues are linked with inadequate access to natural food, high consumption of processed foods, poor portion control and lack of awareness of shifts in nutritional needs as people age. These issues become even more complex and profound when they are appl ied to special needs populations like those who live with chronic health conditions (inc physical, mental and substance disorders). - Social Services Provider Lifestyle I think the stay at homework has increased the sedentary lifestyle and increased daily snacking. I see it all day in my office. Back pain from sitting around all day. Weight gain from snacking while at home all day. Drinking more due to stress and isolation - Physician COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 116 Busy, stressful lifestyles and low priority. - Other Healthcare Provider Many people are too busy for self -care. - Other Healthcare Provider Affordable Care/Services The expense of working with a nutritionist she's not covered certainly by Medicare and o ther medical insurance plans. This needs to be widely available and insurance needs to be accepted Nutrition is key physical activity nutrition and weight loss community programs and programs for nutrition weight loss and physical activity within a hospita l setting need to be affordable and offered and a continual basis - Other Healthcare Provider In my community there are not enough resources and appropriate education on obesity and weight management and how it can be directly influence by proper nutritio n and proper physical activity. In specific communities of social economic challenges and non -English speaking communities, the ability to seek educational and/or medical services as preventative services is lacking. The overall importance of preventive me dicine (i.e., holistic nutrition, proper/safe physical exercise and weight loss/management, etc.) is not heavily emphasized. - Community/Business Leader Affordable gyms, places to workout, willpower to exercise. Dangerous streets for those want to walk, r un and bike as low -cost ways to exercise. - Social Services Provider Obesity People are overweight and obese because of poor nutrition and no exercise. They don't know about healthy eating and exercise. Many immigrants come to the US and want to \"fit in\" so they start eating all the bad stuff so they fit in. Low -income people don't always have access to healthy foods or safe places to exercise. - Other Healthcare Provider High rate of obesity, poor eating habits, lack of exercise. Use of medications such as steroids which augment weight gain. - Physician High rate of obesity, poor eating habits, lack of exercise. Use of medications such as steroids which augment weight gain. - Physician Aging Population Isolated older adults may lack access transportatio n to shop for food and may not know how to access or afford food delivery services. They may also suffer from loss of appetite. Lower -income residents may not be able to afford fresh food to have a balanced diet. The pandemic exacerbated these problems as well as contributing to greater obesity, as people at home consumed more food and may have had less opportunity for exercise. Those who were able to afford to visit a fitness center or gym have been unable to do so for the last two years, - Community/Busin ess Leader People in my community very much mirror state average on these indexes. For older, low -income residents we see many subsisting on low -quality nutrition foods that are the least expensive to purchase and do not engage in regular physical activit y. We have also seen that as food prices continue to increase people who are already food insecure are priced out of buying fresh produce, lean meats, and dairy, etc. Obesity continues to be an issue for those who are living at or below the poverty line. T his then leads to a host of comorbidities such as diabetes, heart disease, and inflammation. - Community/Business Leader Built Environment Not enough spaces/parks for residents to utilize. Not enough affordable recreational activities for residents. High cost of nutritional foods. Poor quality/unhealthy school breakfast and lunch. - Social Services Provider In the summer access to transportation to access plenty of the Bergen County parks. Access is only possible by car. Bike lanes not clearly delineated for cyclist including young children and elderly, people with disabilities in wheelchair or other forms of pedestrian transportation. In the winter: low -cost facilities available for indoor sports for adults and the elderly. Lack of awareness of other feed ing programs to help stretch family food budgets. Minimal availability of nutrition education resources for non -English speakers. Underutilization of SNAP and SNAP ed programs. Lack of park adaptations in urban towns to make park more readily available for people with disabilities. - Social Services Provider Lack of Time People are so busy working that they don't have time to exercise and eat right. - Social Services Provider Lack of priority, not enough time for cooking, lack of nutrition knowledge. No t ime for physical activities, and choosing unhealthy food on the daily menu. - Other Healthcare Provider Due to COVID -19 COVID increased the community lockdown and restriction to movement. It also increased the mental health and behavioral issues both in t he community and in schools. These issues increased the sedentary nature of our community. - Community/Business Leader COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 117 Eating Disorders Access to eating disorder treatment without private insurance. - Community/Business Leader Incidence/Prevalence Metabo lic syndrome X is rampant and being treated as five to ten different medical conditions by five to ten different providers. - Physician COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 118 Substance Use Alcohol Age-Adjusted Cirrhosis/Liver Disease Deaths Heavy alcohol use contributes to a sig nificant share of liver disease, including cirrhosis .

Need to get the education piece out there. - Public Health Representative COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 123 Stigma, lack of understanding of the detox process. - Other Healthcare Provider Stigma, criminalization of addiction, and now a prevailing attitude about cannabis being safe. Adolescents are presenting to hospitals with psychosi s and delirium secondary to high potency THC intoxication as well as intoxication with synthetic cannabinoids. This is a brewing, unrecognized epidemic. - Physician Shame - avoidance - awareness - education - substance -abuse, needs to be looked at not as a s tigma but as a disease. From law -enforcement schools and doctors screening for substance -abuse... Pharmacies on the lookout...I noticed from a professional standpoint not personal... But Alcoholics Anonymous narcotics anonymous and programs for families and frie nds of the alcoholic or drug addict such as Al -Anon Naranon Alateen all can provide a wealth of information support recovery. Doctors, schools, workplace, houses of worship, need to be vigilant as well - Other Healthcare Provider The stigma associated wit h substance abuse is still high even though efforts to address this have been taking place. That aside, just knowing where to look for treatment can be overwhelming. There are a good number of people who think that New Bridge Medical is the only place to p rovide this sort of treatment and frankly they still have a questionable reputation in the minds of people who may have had experiences with this facility when it was under a different name. We also don't do enough to assist families living with substance abusers in getting help for themselves as well as their loved ones. - Community/Business Leader Denial. Prevalence of drugs in the community and ease of access. The problem may increase with the loss of restrictions on recreational marijuana, which can be a gateway drug. Addiction is a very difficult condition to treat. Family shame may prevent recognition of problem and treatment of the problem. Not enough treatment options - Community/Business Leader Stigma and bias. Too few providers with expertise in addiction medicine. - Physician Lack of desire, financial status, and lack of resources. - Other Healthcare Provider Shame and lack of awareness. - Community/Business Leader Stigma.

Lack of meaningful referrals when a problem is identified. - Social Services Provider Access to Care/Services Places that people can access easy and long waits to get in a program. - Other Healthcare Provider The lack of fear if a person is caught with an illegal substance. Once a person gets out of rehab, provide a program or support group so the person is not back again into the same physical environment as previously. - Social Services Provider Inadequate safe injection facilities for IV drug us ers. Inadequate Inpatient/Outpatient treatment facilities. Continue iatrogenic supply of habit -forming drugs in ETC's and by PCP's and other MD's. - Physician Spaces and available beds.

More awareness abou t the local resource availability. - Public Health Representative The greatest barrier for those that are suffering from substance abuse are resources that are available right away. When someone that has an addiction problem decides they want to get help, we only have a short window of opportunity to react and get the patient the help they need. There are many times, where a facility does not have a bed available until a few days later which causes a person to relapse or runaway from help. - Other Healthca re Provider Availability and cost of treatment. - Other Healthcare Provider Access to supportive programs, especially in low -income areas such as Newark. Lack of infrastructure in low - income areas. Lack of educational infrastructure on availability of su bstance abuse treatment in low -income areas. - Other Healthcare Provider Not enough long -term beds, especially for those without insurance, as well as the stigma that comes with addiction. - Public Health Representative Affordable Care/Services Cost. - Community/Business Leader Money, rehab is expensive. A 30 -day detox doesn't work. - Other Healthcare Provider The greatest barrier to accessing substance abuse treatment is cost and whether insurance will cover the cost. - Community/Business Lead er Difficult to access services, especially if you're working poor. - Social Services Provider Affordable treatment services. - Community/Business Leader COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 124 Cost. - Public Health Representative Cost, staff, and providers needed. - Other Healthcare Provide r Insurance Issues Getting treatment in many cases depends on insurance coverage. There needs to be more walk -in facilities for substance abusers with or without insurance coverage. - Community/Business Leader Insurance payments do not correlate to patie nt outcomes and encourage patient visits to increase revenue. All forms of FDA approved MAT should be encouraged. Greater access to LAI to encourage successful recovery without revenue incentives where daily methadone treatments are the business model to m ake money. - Community/Business Leader Insurance coverage, stigma, and awareness. - Community/Business Leader Lack of health coverage and can't afford the costs. Stigma, they don't want to ask for help/denial. - Social Services Provider Lack of Provider s Providers and insurance. - Other Healthcare Provider Lack of providers. - Other Healthcare Provider Not enough providers educated to treatment for different substance issues. - Physician Awareness/Education Lack of awareness. - Other Healthcare Provid er Lack of education on what constitutes substance abuse, especially alcohol and tobacco abuse. Stigma associated with getting treatments. - Community/Business Leader Lack of awareness of resources. Stigma associated with substance use disorders. Facture s in the system of care --- lack of coordinated care (refer to the comments offered in the mental health section regarding creation of unique client ID, QR code, etc.). Lack of housing (parent and child housing; sober living; supportive housing] and employ ment options to support people in recovery. Resistance of school systems to address the issue every day through comprehensive education rather than a 1x/yr assembly. Absence of comprehensive and coordinated effort to tackle the issue (i.e. - every one of t he 70 towns in BC operate independently of each other.

I beli eve that many people have moved away from your ordinary cigarettes and are now using electronic vapes which has caused the increase in tobacco use. The smell and taste are in a variety of flavors which makes it more appealing and since the flavors are exot ic it also prevents people from smelling of cigarette smoke. This is what causes not only and older population to be using tobacco but younger kids as well.

Sometimes people don't get recommended health care services, like cancer screenings, because they don't have a primary care provider.

Many olde r and low-income residents may not be aware of resources available to them in the community.

Community/safety net providers n eed to be reimbursed at more adequate rates in order to hire and retain qualified staff. Health care providers have been limiting hours of operation to be more traditional office hours. This is difficult for adults who work and unable to take off for an ap pointment. Need solutions for greater accessibility to care for all. - Public Health Representative Medical office have become a business. Seems to have been a major shift from the old -world doctors who got to know their patients due to the need for an in creased administrative process. - Physician Most of the clients I treat have told me that the major problem with finding a health care provider is that providers do not call them back. I believe there is a problem with coordination of care. Drugs, alcohol, and lack of self -care are major problems th at I see often - Other Healthcare Provider It is difficult to find and establish a therapeutic alliance with a psychiatrist. Managed care forcefully dictates the delivery of substandard care by for example focusing on superfluous and time -consuming paperw ork that directly interferes with the therapeutic alliance or attempting to prevent psychiatrist from practicing psychotherapy or even spending any significant amount of time understanding their patients. The model that is pushed on psychiatrists is a non -evidence -based fantasy and the vigor with which is enforced is an atrocity and directly causing harm to patients. Insurance companies often seem to try to sabotage patient care at every turn in the name of profits. Psychiatrists would be able to help many more people if they were free to practice psychiatry. - Physician The cost of health care is the biggest challenge related to accessing services. - Public Health Representative Easy to access information for physician specialists available on the web. - Other Healthcare Provider Affordable Care/Services Cost and availability of providers, hours of service for those who work full time. Need evening and weekend appointments. - Social Services Provider Cost and access to affordable health care. Undocumente d folks.

Cost to the company. - Community/Business Leader Vulnerable Populations People who are low -income, uninsured, and undocumented have limited access to healthcare because they can't afford to pay for services or are afraid to apply for assistance.

Several seniors indicated they do not receive care because it is not covered 100% by insu rance. - Social Services Provider Awareness/Education Not nearly enough focus on oral health, and people don't understand how connected oral health is to physical health. Few people have dental insurance. Dentists are expensive. People who don't take care of their teeth often have issues that will cost thousands to fix. - Other Healthcare Provider COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 144 People do not understand the correlation to your mental and physical health and how important it is. - Community/Business Leader A lot of people don't realize the relationship between oral health and general physical health. - Community/Business Leader Health literacy, access, insurance coverage. - Community/Business Leader Access to Care for Uninsured/Underinsured Dental insurance is not always offered by emp loyers, so regular visits are expensive. - Public Health Representative Oral health is not available to uninsured children. Oral health is not available to the underserved community. - Other Healthcare Provider No dental insurance. Low to very low -income families. No non -profit dental clinics. - Social Services Provider Access for Medicare/Medicaid Patients There are no private practitioners or comprehensive dental clinics that accept Medicaid/care in Bergen County. Oral health is connected to all other aspects of health. This gap in the continuum of care profoundly impacts those who depend upon public benefits and those who live with a chronic health condition, like mental illness. - Social Services Provider Medicare does not cover dental care. Many older adults will go preventative care until they are forced to deal with oral health issues. - Social Services Provider Affordable Insurance Dental insurance pronouns are high, and public have cost concerns for d ental services. - Public Health Representative Fear Many people are scared of going to the dentist. Oral health is vital to general health. My PSA's need to be made to discuss the importance of maintaining good oral health. From young children to seniors - Especially due to COVID people are scared to see their dentists - Other Healthcare Provider Income/Poverty Finances. - Other Healthcare Provider Nutrition Poor oral health due to poor nutrition. - Social Services Provider COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 145 LOCAL RESOURCES Perceptions of Local Health Care Services \"How would you rate the overall health care services available to you?

INFORMANT INTERVIEWS Themes from Focus Groups and Interviews with Strategic Leaders: Bergen County, New Jersey The Bergen County Community Health Improvement Partnership (CHIP) comprises representatives from Bergen County Health Department, Christian Health Care NJ-Ramapo Ridge Behavioral Health, Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, Hackensack Meridian Health, Holy Name Medical Center, and Valley Health. We work together to improve the health and wellbeing of all people living in Bergen County. Every three years, these partners conduct a collaborative Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) to document the health status of our community, demonstrate health trends and disparities, and create a community -wide resource for Bergen County. This information is used to evaluate our collective efforts toward health improvement and formulate strategies to advance health equity. Part of this process is talking with real people about their perceptions and experiences in Bergen County. 35th Street Consulti ng, a New Jersey -based, woman -owned business, was engaged by the Bergen County CHIP to conduct interviews with community leaders and facilitate focus groups with people from all walks of life in Bergen County. Including the voices of people who live and work in our community helps contextualize statistical data and glean insights into disparities. These conversations help create practical, place -based solutions to improve the quality of life for all people in Bergen County, New Jersey. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 155 The participants in both the focus groups and the one-on-one interviews were asked a similar array of questions. The following questions were included in the focus groups and interviews. From June through September 2022, 35th Street Consulting conducted nine focus groups with individuals representing segments of the Bergen County population whose perspectives are often underrepresented in planning and decision -making. Focus groups provide an environment in which in-depth discu ssions lead to greater understanding of the \"whys\" behind research findings, as well as creating space to solicit candid feedback on experiences and attitudes. These insights are essential to crafting relevant, actionable plans that engage the enthusiasm, resources, and interest of the partner agencies. Some focus groups were conducted in person, while others were conducted virtually. Discussions were conducted in English and Korean languages. The focus groups included people representing the following populations: What stands out to you as a significant accomplishment in recent yea rs that has most impacted the community? What challenges brought about by COVID do you think will take our community the longest time to recover from? What are the most pressing concerns you are seeing among the people you serve now? o How is that different than it was before COVID? o What are the biggest barriers you have in connecting people with what they need now? How is the way your institution operates the same or different now than before COVID? o What works better? o What is harder? In your experience, what do you think should be the top 3 priorities the Bergen County Health Improvement Partnership should tackle to improve the health and quality of life of the people you serve? What should health care and public health do differently to address the priority areas you identified? In the future, when you think back to this time, what do you think you will remember most? If you had a magic wand that could fix one problem you see, what would you fix? COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 156 In addition to the nine focus groups, 35th Street conducted 13 interviews with select strategic leaders representing a wide range of expertise across Bergen County. These one-to-one conversations were valuable in diving deeply into the experiences of stakeholder groups, capturing unique perspectives, gathering input on priority needs, and mining recommendations for problem -solving at a systems level. The following individuals participated in virtual interviews between June and September 2022. A summary of the themes that emerged from analysis of the data gathered from the focus groups and the interviews is listed here. Key elements impacting these themes will explored in the following pages. Lynn Algrant, Greater Bergen Community Action Helen Archontou, YWCA Northern NJ Dr. Hillary Cohen, CME Englewood Health Liz Corsini, Bergen Family Center Dr. Mohammed Elrafei, Christian Health Ramapo Ridge Psychiatric Hospital Sofia Magnifico, Christian Health Michael McCann, FORGE Health Commissioner Germaine Ortiz Kristine Pendy, Bergen New Bridge Health Vito Veneruso, North Hudson Community Action Deborah Visconi, Bergen New Bridge Medical Center EJ Vizzi, Age Friendly Teaneck Chairwoman, Commissioner Tracy Zur COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 157 Bergen County bore the brunt of COVID -19 at the very beginning of the pandemic Bergen County experienced the devastating impact of COVID -19 infection and death earlier than most other places in the world. On March 13, 2020, the US declared COVID -19 a global pandemic triggering a nationwide shut down beginning March 15, 2020. On March 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control issued a domestic travel advisor y for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut due to high community transmission of COVID -19 through that area. Within the state of New Jersey, the northern counties closest to New York City including Bergen County, were the most dramatically impacted by COVI D-19 infection, transmission and death at that time. While unprecedented efforts were occurring worldwide to identify processes to stop the spread of COVID -19, there were very few known strategies to protect from, treat, and stop the virus during the early months of 2020. By April 10, 2020, the New York City area, including Bergen County, had more COVID -19 cases and deaths than any other country in the world, elevating COVID -19 as the leading cause of death for all people in 2020 in Bergen County. The lessons learned in Bergen County saved lives worldwide, but at a cost. The early onset of a new and deadly virus impacted individuals and families, but also took a toll on the capacity of health care providers, social services providers for vulnerable populations to continue to provide care. The physical toll on people in these professions combined with restrictions required for educational institutions , economic hardships , and other factors reduced the pipeline of newly trained workers in these fields. \"We [Bergen County] were the guinea pigs... we shared our learning, and we saved other people.\" \"We d on't have the workforce to meet the need. We saw a big hit to the nursing staff, a lot retired through COVID ...Hoping the healthcare industry gets that influx of college students and graduates who want to come here right now we don't have enough ...Everybod y has upped their salaries - baristas make the same as entry level mental health specialists. We can't keep up.\" \"People don't want to work in the [health care/social service/first responder] industry anymore. For the salaries we offer, people can work at Foot Locker and make the same money and not risk their lives.\" \"There were about 25 of us here every day [at work], scared to death. We watched people die, really quite a remarkable time. A bunch got rea lly sick with Delta at the beginning, long haul COVID and anxiety... we couldn't get the vaccine because were not considered essential, so lots of us got really sick.\" COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 158 Mental Health: The pandemic period negatively impacted mental health, especially for already vulnerable populations and frontline workers. People in Bergen County struggle with trauma stemming from the COVID -19 pandemic period from myriad sources including: o Living in unsafe households during the pandemic quarantine period o Grief and loss from COVID -19 period o Financial crisis o Fear, exhaustion, illness, stress, and burnout among frontline workers including: Healthcare workers EMTs and first responders Social services providers Educators at all levels Elder care workers Essential services workers o Extended isolation, especially among: Children/adolescents Seniors People with disabling conditions People in recovery Need for Mental Health Support exceeds current capacity, especially for: o Anxiety and Depression o Substance Use, especially alcohol o Young people \"Staff are at their wits end - anything that is difficult becomes personal. It's easier to stick yourself in someone else's shoes when you have the mental space to be able to do that.\" \"So much teen mental health need now. The pandemic was an earthquake and now a tsunami is coming. The levels of anxiety and depression is troublesome.\" \"Healthcare providers have been traumatized and have PTSD. Many didn't go home in order to try and save their families. They had separate silverware, etc. to try and ke ep their family safe.\" \"There is a lot of PTSD from what we all endured as a society.\" COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 159 \"There are two Bergen Counties\" - Bergen County is a very expensive place to live. Even though the percentage of people in poverty is relatively low, it still represents a large number of individuals and families. There are more people in need than it seems The cost and availability of the internet is a huge barrier for many Many front -line staff do not make a living wage based on Bergen County's cost of living Housing costs are very high for renters and homeowner s; emergency housing and affordable housing does not meet demand Inflation is impacting families, seniors, small businesses as resources from COVID are diminishing Food Security continues to be a wide-reaching concern throughout the pandemic including today Small business owners have not recovered financially \"[The fact that] young people can't afford to live here is a huge problem.\" \"Bergen County is considered so wealthy. When we think about fed and state standards of living, $50,000 is great in North Carolina, but it's nothing in Bergen County.\" \"Living here is impossible for normal people.\" \"This is one of the wealthiest counties in the nation. How can children go to bed hungry here?\" \"Internet should be a public utility like water and electricity are. Should not be an optional thing in this society. If you don't have internet or means to pay for it or understanding of speed etc. is a big barrier.\" COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 160 Breaking down silos: Care and services in Bergen County are many, but seem disconnected, complicated, and limited by resources. Because Bergen County is largely affluent, the resources that do exist to help are less apparent than in other communities. There are resources but people don't know about them Disconnected care makes it hard for people in need to find an \"on ramp\" to access services Long wait times can exacerbate existing problems, erode trust No common source or location to share or gather information about resources o Lack of available data to identify disparities based on demographic characteristics o Disconnected services reduce the availability of support for people, and impacts the investment of money and resources for care services o Many individuals and community agencies do not have consistent access to the internet \"Everyone is really desperate in their own little nook. We need to come together to work on systemic issues that have always been there. COVID blew that wide open.\" \"Why does it have to be so hard? I can't even share my food with other organizations, even if they have need. There's so much red tape.\" \"Our people are not keeping up with the pace - our people are not able to navigate online.\" \"There are lots of silos, secrecy and competition even within the helping communities because dollar s are so scarce.\" \"Social safety net has more holes than string around here.\" COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 161 Inclusion is important : Work needs to be done to rebuild trust in health care. COVID -19 revealed and highlighted existing inequities , which, combined with fear and widespread misinformation during the pandemic, exacerbated mistrust. Representation matters: patients willing to discuss discrimination (racism, LGBTQ+ discrimination, language and country of origin) when they feel welcome, understood, and able to use their preferred language Language/culture barriers including lack of LGBTQ+ affirming care and messaging Continuity of Care : not having a primary care provider relationship negatively impacts health outcomes and trust in health care o Lower income people in Bergen are less likely to have a primary care provider o Disconnected care creates opportunities for misinformation Fear based delay in routine care appointments since the pandemic started negatively impacts health outcomes and trust There are many CBO's who are willing to share what they know but are not being connected to the conversation Sense that race/ethnicity/language/income/education impacted what care was provided o Essential workers from fields beyond health care and first responders , especially frontline workers of color and people with limited income felt they were not prioritized for safety measures from PPE to vaccines to information from the beginning for the pandemic Rise in race-based hate community -wide instills fear, isolati on \"It was so awful to see racism play out in who didn't get care, and who lost people, who didn't know if their families were going to make it.\" \"[Regarding COVID -19 vaccines] We didn't have hesitancy problems, we had access problems in communities of color. Once we had access then we didn't have hesitancy. \" \"We have a lot of work to do. Racial justice is the most important issue. A lot of this could have been prevented.\" \"We are in a public health crisis with racism. Not mitigate, we need to eliminate systems of oppression, especially those that impact black and brown.\" \"NA/AA/ and other Anonymous meetings are few and far between in New Jersey. And there are lots of LGBTQ people who are not willing to go to a church.\" \"Early on [in the pandemic, there] was fear, and the sense that systems didn't care for people of color same way as white folks.\" COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 162 Data collected from these conversations will be used to develop collaborative action planning to advance the health and well-being of all people in Bergen County. This report has been prepared on behalf of the Community Health Improvement Partnership (CHIP) of Bergen County.

COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 163 EVALUATION OF PAST ACTIVITIES Year End Report 2021: 2020 -2022 Community Health Needs Assessment OVERVIEW This 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Year End Report contains highlights of key initiatives and a full overview of the community activities provided by Englewood Health to support the health of the populations we serve. While continuing to manage the ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic, Englewood Health engaged our patients and community member s in a wide range of impactful educational opportunities, prevention programs, and wellness efforts. The majority of programs and activities detailed below reflect the use of a successful virtual engagement platform. The selection and criteria for the En glewood Health (EH) community health initiatives are guided by the hospital's implementation strategy, updated in 2019 based on the most recent results and analysis identified in the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment. The process for generating this a nnual report includes the Population Health team meeting with respective service lines and departments to discuss and capture the 2021 goals, objectives, strategies and accomplishments. For purposes of review, below are the 2020 - 2022 EH goals and object ives. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 164 KEY HIGHLIGHTS Significant community benefit activity occurred as Englewood Health continued to manage the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic and provide educational opportunities and programming to the community. In an effort to expand access to the COVID -19 vaccine, EH opened a dedicated vaccination facility in Englewood Cliffs, as well as conducted 5 highly promoted community vaccination events, providing nearly 1,000 vaccines for vulnerable populations in the Eng lewood area. EH remained actively committed to efforts around cancer care and detection during the pandemic. EH promoted several programs to educate community members around the importance of receiving regular cancer screenings. EH's Cancer Education and Early Detection Goal 1: Increase Access to Health Education, Screening and Prevention Services Objective 1 Provide education and intervention regarding wellness, health promotion, prevention efforts, risk factors, and healthy behaviors (nutritional, physical, and emotional health / wellness) Objective 2 Conduct screenings for chronic disease risk factors (e.g., cancer, high blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI) and provide referrals to appropriate treatment or services Objective 3 Implement programs and events with local and regional collaboratives that address issues related to wellness, prevention, and risk factors Objective 4 Expand upon our system -wide care management programGoal 2: Improve Health Status Through Chronic Disease and Care Management Objective 1 Provide programs that promote education and awareness of chronic and complex conditions Objective 2 Promote chronic disease management programs (diabetes, cardiovascular, stroke and cancer) Objective 3 Provide linkage to care, with increased access to providers and navigation within physician network Objective 4 Create customized care plans to manage patients with complex conditions Goal 3: Promote Positive Mental, Social, and Emotional Health Objective 1 Expand efforts to reduce stigma Objective 2 Continue to offer behavioral health educational programs and screenings in community -based settings, with a focus on priority populations Objective 3 Expand behavioral health care services in the Englewood Health Physician Network Objective 4 Improve access to behavioral health treatment Objective 5 Collaborate with local and regional partners to address behavioral health issuesGoal 4: Address Issues That Prevent or Delay Individuals from Accessing Care and Resources Objective 1 Develop innovative solutions for improving access to care, for the community at -large and patients attributed to the Englewood Health Physician Network Objective 2 Implement navigation services that remove barriers to care (language, age/transportation) Objective 3 Expand program and policies that screen for and address social determinants of health, with a focus on nutrition and food security Objective 4 Implement local and regional efforts to address social determinants of health and access to care issues COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 165 (CEED) Program, funded through the New Jersey Department of Health, Division of Family Health Services, screened 88 patients for breast and cervical cancers in 2021. Lung cancer screenings continued to increase in 2021, with over 770 screen ings completed. In addition, cancer care patient navigators aided in connecting over 120 uninsured patients with charity care. EH continued its strong focus on the Diabetes Education program, once again obtaining recognition by the American Diabetes Associ ation for meeting the national standards of Diabetes self-management education, which it has held for over 20 years. EH also offered free Diabetes testing supplies for uninsured women with Gestational Diabetes and worked in conjunction with the North Hudso n Community Action Corporation Englewood Health Center to provide needed Diabetes support to its patient population. In addition, dietary counseling and education were provided for pregnant patients referred by the North Hudson Community Corporation. The E H Korean Center's team successfully pivoted during COVID and took on a large -scale virtual health programming effort to engage the Korean population on important health issues and COVID safety information. This effort resulted in over 1.4 million views of this virtual content, covering various chronic conditions and providing consistent and timely medical information. EH promoted the cardiac health and wellness of community members through trainings and educational programming. In 2021, over 2,300 individu als were trained in various CPR courses, including advanced cardiac life support, pediatric advanced life support, pediatric emergency assessment recognition and stabilization, and basic life support. The Bloodless Medicine and Surgery Department continue d hosting virtual education seminars for the community; these seminar topics included ways to better care for your health and lifestyle choices, understanding bloodless medicine, the future of the bloodless program at Englewood Health. 5 virtual seminars w ere held, reaching approximately 10,000 participants. The Population Health Care Management Team held a second very successful free 12 -week Diabetes management virtual program for EHPN (Englewood Health Physician Network) patients with the goal of effecti vely managing their diabetes through education and behavior modification. This program built upon the success of the first series held in 2020. Patients participated in a skills -based program around exercise, healthy eating, effectively managing medication and testing blood sugar levels, and developing emotional skills to manage stress while dealing with a chronic condition. EH supported the Population Health Department's community outreach by maintaining and expanding a series of strategic community partnerships, allowing EH to bring meaningful programming and content to the community. These included the continuation of the Healthy Eating Partnership, which provided free meals, nutritional education, and interventional tools presented by EH Diabetes Educators. In 2021, the program expanded its virtual engagement and reached new partners in the community through contact -free meal pick -up and virtual nutrition education presentations. EH continued its focus on the Social Determinants of Health by growing the Food Insecurity Response Initiative (FIRI), which screens patients for food insecurity and seamlessly connects them to on -going food resources. In 2021, FIRI expanded to include the North Hudson Community Action Corporation and the Englewood Health emergency department, both of which are areas with defined needs. EH also actively supported wellness in community youth through programming addressing emotional, physical and nutritional wellness. In response to the impact of the ongoing pandemic, Englewood Health has pivoted to include crucial programming, both virtual and in -person, to support the youth population. This includes a virtual rotation of the Discovery Program, a 4 -week health and wellness series educating youth on practical life skil ls surrounding emotional, physical and nutritional health. EH also continued to provide emotional support to youth through yoga, art therapy and stress management and coping skills workshops. EH further invested in the behavioral health of the community, a s the ongoing pandemic has resulted in an even greater demand for support and services. EH has held more than 25 emotional wellness events, impacting more than 3,600 community members. EH continued the behavioral health partnership with the Bergen Family C enter to provide individual therapy, youth art therapy workshops, youth wellness presentations and virtual yoga that reached a combined 230 youth. In addition, emotional wellness programming was provided to adults through a partnership with the Bergen Fami ly Center, reaching over 75 adults and parents in the COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 166 community. Overall, EH provided a range of very timely virtual behavioral health programming to a wide range of ages from youth to seniors, as well as an ethnically diverse audience. EH also held a larg e education and skill -building workshop supporting caregivers of individuals with dementia, to teach how to effectively cope and manage during this unprecedented time of solitude. Additionally, in response to the pandemic and the increase in depression, is olation, and anxiety, EH increased the number of virtual yoga and meditation classes provided to our community partner agencies, as well as the community at large.

The annual Behavioral Health Conference was held virtually with 82 behavioral health profess ionals in attendance. The topic was \"Universality of Trauma\". EH continued to effectively integrate mental health screenings into the primary care visits. The results help physicians identify depression, anxiety, and stress, thus allowing them to refer patients for behavioral health care proactively. In 2021 EH began to implement the C -SSRS (Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale) to provide mental health screening services and appropriate care for community members admitted to the Emergency Depart ment. As stated above, EH continues to support the behavioral health of the community by creating convenient and affordable access to licensed clinical professionals including psychiatrists, licensed clinical social workers, addiction specialists, and oth er healthcare professionals.

We will continue to make this a priority for 2022 and main tain a strategic focus on a selection of partner agencies to help engage and support health equity in the EH service area community. Goal 4: Address issues that prevent or delay individuals from accessing care and resources Objective 1: Develop innovativ e solutions for improving access to care, for the community at large and patients attributed to the Englewood Physician Network COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 176 The Food Insecurity Response Initiative (FIRI) Food Access program continues to be available to EHPN physician's offices to addr ess food insecurity. Identified patients are directly connected to local food resources through the Center for Food Action and other food pantries. 94 EHPN patients were identified as food insecure. EHPN Care Coordinators follow up with patients to link to services. Monthly follow -up is conducted with the Center for Food Action to ensure patients are receiving services. 2022 Goals will involve implementing Unite Us (formally Now Pow), a community referral management platform for addressing the social determ inants of health (SDOH), chronic health and social conditions. This will allow EHPN Care Coordinators to provide comprehensive, closed -loop referrals and general resources to better support patients and the community at large. Objective 2: Implement navigation services that remove barriers to care (language, age / transportation) EH patients identified as food insecure through the FIRI Food Access Program (See Goal 4 Objective 1) are able to receive food packages delivered directly to their home once every two weeks. All EH material is translated in to multiple languages to remove barriers to patients and community members. All FIRI materials are translated into Spanish and Korean to support the linguistic needs of EH patients and community members in need of food access. EH offers the Uber Health program; patients in need are able to utilize the service to receive free transportation both to and from any EH appointment or office to make EH health services more accessible. This program also h elped patients and community members overcome transportation barriers to attending COVID -19 vaccination appointments. EH provided nearly 30,000 rides. Objective 3: Expand programs and policies that screen for and address the social determinants of health, with a focus on nutrition and food security. The Food Insecurity Response Initiative (FIRI) Food Access continued to screen patients for food insecurity in the Mother/Baby and Bariatrics Departments and all offices in the Englewood Health Physician's Netw ork (EHPN) for food insecurity. In 2021 the FIRI program expanded to include the Emergency Department and the North Hudson Community Action Corporation. o Nearly 26,000 patients were screened for food insecurity in 2021. o Over 200 patients were connected with local resources. In 2021, additional Hudson County food partners were provided to better connect patients and community members to food resources. Goals for 2022 include the distribution of the \"A Guide to Healthy Eating with Food Pantry Ingredients\" book lets to local food pantry clients. Additionally EH will provide educational workshops to the community on nutrition and healthy eating using the food provided by a food pantry. Objective 4: Implement local and regional efforts to address social determinan ts of health and access to care issues. Goal to begin implementation of Unite Us (formerly Now Pow) (see Goal 4 Objective 1) in 2022 throughout the EH network. EH will open the Shirvan Family Live Well Center in 2022 to engage and educate at -risk populatio ns on preventative health and wellness measures. The center will be located at 55 W. Palisade Ave in downtown Englewood and all services provided will be free. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 177 Year End Report 2020: 2020 -2022 Community Health Needs Assessment EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Community Health Needs Assessment Year End report reflects both highlights and a summary of the events, programs, and activities Englewood Health has engaged in throughout 2020. The intended plans and activities that were committed to for 2020 were u niversally upended (in March of 2020) due to the resources and restrictions required to manage the COVID -19 pandemic. Englewood Health was able to quickly pivot and, in addition to meeting the medical needs surrounding COVID -19 care, create impactful educ ational opportunities and programs for our community and our patients during this time of crisis. The selection and criteria for the Englewood Health (EH) community health initiatives are guided by the hospital's strategic plan, updated in 2019 based on t he most recent results and analysis identified in the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment. The process for generating this report includes the Population Health Team meeting with respective service lines and departments to discuss and capture the 2020 g oals, objectives, strategies and accomplishments. For purposes of review, below are the EH goals and objectives. Goal 1: Increase Access to Health Education, Screening, and Prevention Services Objective 1 Provide education and intervention regarding wellness, health promotion, prevention efforts, risk factors, and healthy behaviors (nutritional, physical, and emotional health / wellness) Objective 2 Conduct screenings for chronic disease risk factors (e.g., cancer, high blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI) and provide referrals to appropriate treatment or services Objective 3 Implement programs and events with local and regional collaboratives that address issues related to wellness, prevention, and risk factors Objective 4 Expand upon our system -wide care management programGoal 2: Improve Health Status Through Chronic Disease and Care Management Objective 1 Provide programs that promote education and awareness of chronic and complex conditions Objective 2 Promote chronic disease management programs (diabetes, cardiovascular, stroke and cancer) Objective 3 Provide linkage to care, with increased access to providers and navigation within physician network Objective 4 Create customized care plans to manage patients with complex conditions COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 178 Significant accomplishments occurred in a year that was unprecedented in our history. In -person activities from March 2020 through the balance of the year were significantly reduced, requiring a new virtual path forward for much of our community benefit p rogramming. Our assessment of participation thus, for the most part, reflects a virtual engagement. EH participated in over 50 community events allowing the hospital to impact more than 10,000 community members. EH continues to strongly support the Popu lation Health Department's community outreach by maintaining and expanding a series of strategic community partnerships, allowing EH to bring meaningful programs and content to the community. These include the continuation of the Healthy Eating Partnership with the local food banks, the Community Chest, and the North Hudson Community Action Corporation Englewood Health Center . The Partnership continues to provide free meals, nutritional education, and interventional tools presented by EH Diabetes Educators. In the fall of 2020, the program was able to evolve to allow for contact -free food pick - up and virtual education presentations of the material. Additionally, EH increased its dedicated focus on the Social Determinants of Health and launched a new compreh ensive program titled the Food Insecurity Response Initiative (FIRI), which includes EH screening of patients for food insecurity and seamlessly connecting them to on -going food resources. EH also actively supported wellness in the schools, teaching emotio nal and nutritional wellness in the freshmen health classes at Dwight Morrow High School. This included a focus on two goals: one, teaching an understanding of diabetes prevention and nutrition awareness with the goal of fostering behavioral changes to pre vent the development of diabetes. Secondly, the program focuses on increasing awareness around emotional challenges like stress and anxiety to help the students cultivate tools to better manage these challenges in their daily lives. The program is delivere d by EH Diabetes Educators and Social Workers. However, the program was interrupted by COVID and due to the challenges faced by the local school system, the decision was made to place the program on hold.

In response to this burgeoning situation, EH held more than 30 emotional wellness events, impacting more than 3,300 community members. EH la unched a new behavioral health partnership with the Bergen Family Center to provide individual youth therapy, youth art therapy workshops, youth wellness presentations and virtual yoga that reached a combined 150 youth. Overall, EH provided a range of ver y timely virtual behavioral health programming to the community at large, which engaged a wide range of ages from youth to seniors, as well as an ethnically diverse audience. Due to COVID, many of the programming topics centered on how to cope with the st ress and challenge of living through a pandemic, how to parent during a pandemic, and how young people can manage and cope successfully with the stress and anxiety of the current crisis. EH also held a large education and skill -building webinar supporting caregivers of individuals with dementia, to teach how to effectively cope and manage during this unprecedented time of solitude. Additionally, in response to the pandemic and the depression, isolation, and anxiety it brought, EH increased the number of v irtual yoga and meditation classes provided to our community partner agencies, as well as the community at large. These were run in multiple languages. EH maintained its focus on the fundamentals of wellness and through partnerships with local agencies (W omen's Rights and Information Center as well as local churches), providing multiple skills -based month -long health and wellness workshops for adults from vulnerable populations (youth postponed to 2021). The workshops focused on nutrition, healthy cooking , exercise and emotional wellness, all grounded in developing practical skills for a healthy life. In an effort to expand access to the flu vaccine, EH partnered with the Englewood Health Department to create a free drive -thru flu vaccine event for the c ommunity, providing over 150 vaccines for vulnerable populations in the Englewood area. EH has remained actively committed to its efforts around cancer care and detection during the pandemic. Despite in -person screening and educational sessions being put on hold, EH continued to care for patients via virtual telemedicine visits and oral treatments. Oncologists and nurse practitioners were redeployed to support the intensive care unit (ICU) and were assigned to care teams to communicate and dialogue with f amilies about a patient's condition related to COVID. EH's Cancer Education and Early Detection (CEED) Program, funded through the New Jersey Department of Health, Division of Family Health Services, was limited due to COVID guidelines, but screened 36 pat ients for breast and cervical cancers in 2020. Lung cancer screenings increased in 2020, with approximately 450 screenings completed. EH continues to be strongly focused on the Diabetes Education Program, once again supporting its recognition by the Amer ican Diabetes Association for meeting the national standards for Diabetes self -management education, which it has held for over 20 years. EH also offered free Diabetes testing supplies for uninsured women with Gestational Diabetes and worked in conjunctio n with the North Hudson Community Action Corporation Englewood Health Center to provide needed Diabetes support to its patient population. The Population Health Quality Care Team launched a very successful free 12 -week Diabetes management virtual program with EHPN (Englewood Health Physician Network) patients with the goal of effectively managing their diabetes through education and behavior modification. Patients participated in a skills -based program around exercise, healthy eating, effectively managing medication and testing blood sugar levels, and developing emotional skills to manage stress while dealing with a chronic condition. The EH Korean Center's team successfully pivoted during COVID and took on a large scale virtual health programming effort to engage the Korean population on important health issues and COVID safety information. This effort resulted in over 30,000 views of this virtual content, covering various chronic conditions and providing consistent and timely medical information.

Care Coordinators outreached to over 4,000 patients regarding COVID results and referred COVID discharges to follow -up care. o Patients who were uninsured were referre d to the North Hudson Community Action Corporation for services. 177 appointments were referred. Care coordinators continued to follow up with patients after the referral. EH rapidly evolved to telehealth services in response to COVID and providers were ab le to utilize this technology to see almost 78,000 patients. Barriers such as transportation were therefore removed. As previously stated in Priority Area: Wellness and Prevention, Goal 1, the FIRI Food Access program is available to all EHPN offices, allo wing EHPN to connect patients with food resources. 54 patients were identified as food insecure through the EHPN offices and linked to resources. Objective 4: Create customized care plans to manage patients with complex conditions EHPN Care Coordinators co ntinued to create patient -centered care plans for patients identified as \"high -risk\" by providers. These care plans focus on a variety of complex conditions and are focused on the patient's health needs, including addressing dementia, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking cessation. Priority Area: Behavioral Health Goal 3: Promote positive mental, social and emotional health Objective 1: Expand efforts to reduce stigma EH remains committed to supporting the mental, social and emotional health of all ages and groups and our overall community and reduce stigma.

Objective 2: Continue to offer behavioral health educational programs and screenings in community -based settings, with a focu s on priority populations EH has recognized the increase need of behavioral health services due to the impact of COVID. In 2020, over 33 behavioral health programs, including mindfulness, meditation, anxiety management, and emotional support were held. The se events impacted over 3,300 community members. EH ran 7 behavioral and emotional education presentations to support parents, youth and families during COVID with a focus on navigating new challenges and the family experience. These presentations reached over 200 parents and youth. The senior population remains a priority for EH behavioral health programming. An educational program was held for families who have a loved one with dementia, with 25 community members positively impacted. In addition, a virtua l program for \"Families Dealing with Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease\" reached 10 community members. The annual Behavioral Health Conference was held virtually with 140 behavioral health professionals in attendance. The topic was \"Practical and Realistic S trategies for Dementia Care During a Pandemic\". EH continues to effectively integrate mental health screenings into the primary care visits. Each patient receives a screener to be completed. The results help physicians identify depression, anxiety, and s tress, thus allowing them to refer patients for behavioral health care earlier, when more treatment options are available, and treatment is usually more effective. As stated above EH continues to support the behavioral health of the community by creating c onvenient and affordable access to licensed clinical professionals including psychiatrists, licensed clinical social workers, addiction specialists, and other healthcare professionals. EH continues to grow the number of embedded therapists in the primary care setting so they are easily accessed either by appointment or in the moment when needed. One additional LCSW was hired in 2020. 2021 will focus on running a third annual conference aimed towards cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and anxiety manageme nt, offering program around Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and supporting EH Team Members from the long -term emotional impacts of the pandemic. Objective 3: Expand behavioral health care services in the Englewood Physician Network EH transitioned t o telehealth for behavioral health care to continue to deliver services to patients despite the implications of COVID.

We will continue to make this a priority for 2021 and maintain a focus on a selection of partners to help engage and support health equity in the Englewood Community. Goal 4: Address issues that prevent or delay individuals from accessing care and resourc es Objective 1: Develop innovative solutions for improving access to care, for the community at large and patients attributed to the Englewood Physician Network In October of 2020, The Food Insecurity Response Initiative (FIRI) Food Access program was made available to EHPN physicians' offices for food insecurity. Identified patients are directly connected to local food resources through the Center for Food Action and other food pantries. 54 EHPN patients were identified as food insecure. EHPN Care Coordina tors follow up with patients to link to services. Quarterly follow -up is conducted with the Center for Food Action to ensure patients are receiving services. EHPN Care Coordinators provided follow up to patients regarding COVID results and referred dischar ged patients who were uninsured to the North Hudson Community Action Corporation (See Priority Area: Chronic and Complex Conditions, Goal 2). EH has increased access to telehealth services to continue to care for patients in light of COVID (See Priority Ar ea: Chronic and Complex Conditions, Goal 2). EH established the Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity Council (DIEC) to promote and address health equity and diversity within our community and our EH team. 2021 Goals will involve potentially utilizing Now Pow, a community referral management platform for addressing social determinants of health (SDOH), chronic health and social conditions. This will allow EHPN Care Coordinators to provide comprehensive, closed - loop referrals to better support patients in th e EHPN network. Objective 2: Implement navigation services that remove barriers to care (language, age / transportation) EH patients identified as food insecure through the FIRI Food Access Program (See Goal 4 Objective 1) are able to receive food packages delivered directly to their home once every two weeks.

COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 191 Year End Report 2019: 2017 -2019 Community Health Needs Assessment EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Community Health Needs Assessment report reflects both highlights and a summary of th e events, programs, and activities that Englewood Health has engaged in throughout 2019. The selection and criteria for the Englewood Health (EH) initiatives are guided by the continued implementation of the hospital's strategic action plan, initially deve loped in 2016. The process for generating the report includes the Population Health group meeting with the respective service lines and departments to discuss and capture the 2019 goals, objectives, strategies and accomplishments. For purposes of review b elow are the EH goals and objectives. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 192 Significant accomplishments have occurred over the last year including EH participation in over 200 community events allowing the hospital to impact close to 25,000 community members. EH continues to strongly support the Population Health Department's community outreach by creating a series of strategic community partnerships, allowing EH to bring meaningful programs and content to the community. These include the co ntinuation of the Healthy Eating Partnership with the local food banks, the Community Chest, and the North Hudson Community Action Corporation Englewood Health Center . The Partnership continues to provide free meals and nutritional education, presented by EH Diabetes Educators, for families at the local churches and senior living facilities. EH has written and developed a Healthy Eating on a Budget cookbook that provides education and awareness of how individuals and families can eat healthy and nutritious meals with very little money. Each meal per person is $4.25 or less. The cookbooks are provided to the low -income population in the community along with portion correct plates that families can use to better understand meal composition and proper portio n sizes. EH continues to actively support wellness in the schools and teaches emotional and nutritional wellness in the freshmen health classes at Dwight Morrow High School. This includes a focus on two goals; one, teaching an understanding of diabetes p revention and nutrition awareness with the goal of fostering behavioral changes in an effort to prevent the development of diabetes. Secondly, the program focuses on increasing awareness around emotional challenges like stress and anxiety and helps the stu dents to cultivate tools to better manage challenges in their daily lives. The program is delivered by EH Diabetes Educators and Social Workers. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 193 EH continues to aggressively support the behavioral health of the community by developing and running offsit e programming that supports a wide range of ages and demographics in the community. This includes a focus on the aging population, as well as families, including parents and students in relevant topics including how to cope with the stress and challenges o f aging, and stress and anxiety in young people. Additionally, educational materials have been created and are distributed on these topics throughout the community.

Through partnerships with local agencies EH has launched multiple healt h and wellness month long workshops for both adults and youth targeting more at -risk populations and their unique wellness challenges. The workshops focus on nutrition, healthy cooking, exercise and emotional wellness all grounded in developing practical skills for a healthy life. The programs are run in multiple languages. EH is actively committed to its efforts around cancer care and detection. EH has participated in over 21 community outreach events including screenings and educational sessions impac ting close to 5,000 community members. This includes 3 three screening events where 145 people were screened for various cancers. EH continues to be strongly focused on the Diabetes Education Program, once again supporting its recognition by the American Diabetes Association for meeting the national standards for Diabetes self -management education, which it has held for over 20 years. EH also offered free Diabetes testing supplies for uninsured women with Gestational Diabetes and worked in - conjunction wi th the North Hudson Community Action Corporation Englewood Health Center to provide needed support to its patient population. The hospital also works closely with the Englewood Health Department and provides funding for a Youth Educator for the Reach and Teach program in the Englewood school system, who works with students on an array of issues ranging from nutrition and wellness to sexually transmitted diseases to drug and alcohol addiction. A detailed account of programming that occurred during 2019 for each of the hospital's four goals can be found in the following Progress Report section.
