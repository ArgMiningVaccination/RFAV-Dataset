The gathering has been postponed from its original date (March 29 - April 1, 2022) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Healing Our Spirit Worldwide (HOSW) brings together thousands of Indigenous leaders and health care professionals from around the world to share and celebrate the healing power of traditional Indigenous knowledge and cultures. The gathering features presentations as well as cultural performances, healing activities and entertainment by Indigenous performers. This international event is held every four years. In 2023, it will be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, on the Coast Salish territories of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleilwaututh Nations. These are three of more than 200 First Nations in British Columbia - home to one of the world's most diverse assemblies of living Indigenous cultures. The gathering is an opportunity for original peoples who have a history of colonial impact to share knowledge, wisdom, learning and experiences. These new and old teachings will foster relationships, understandings and new opportunities - and in doing so they will reinforce our resilience as Indigenous peoples.

In 2013 it assumed responsibility for the health programs and services formerly handled by the federal government for First Nations people living in the province of British Columbia. The FNHA's vision is to transform the health and well-being of BC's Indigenous people. This vision is centred on wellness - rather than illness - and on exploring what wellness means to the First Nations people the organization serves. It is an ambitious vision that has generated interest around the world, and so the FNHA is proud to host Healing Our Spirit Worldwide. The International Indigenous Council for Healing our Spirit Worldwide (IICHOSW) is the governance body that provides support, guidance and advice to the hosts of Healing Our Spirit Worldwide. The Council has developed the following statement of beliefs: These beliefs form the foundation for our principles and values: Inclusiveness: we will make every effort to include Indigenous Nations around the world in the Movement Diversity: we respect the diversity of Indigenous Peoples everywhere Respect: we respect the culture, the traditions, the values and beliefs of Indigenous peoples worldwide Working Together: we work together in the spirit of cooperation and healing Sharing: we promote the sharing of programs, ideas and information on the health and healing of Indigenous peoples Reciprocity: we are committed to the giving and sharing but also to the obligation of receiving the ideas, cultures and beliefs of all Indigenous People worldwide "}
