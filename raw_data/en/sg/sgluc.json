A few of us tend to suffer from recurrent tonsillitis either due to a genetic tendency or due to a constant low immunity. Children are more commonly infected as compared to adults. Tonsils produce Lymphocytes (white blood cells), which are the fighter cells, responsible for forming a strong immune system and protecting the human body from foreign invasion/infection.
