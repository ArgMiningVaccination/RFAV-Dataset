This paper sets out the basis on which exemplarydamages will be awarded according to the Australi an law of tort. Although the situations in which such an award will be made are rare, Australian c ourts have been prepared to flexibly countenance the use of such a device in a widening range of situations. Importantly, Australian courts willcountenance the use of exemplary damages irrespective of the tort used to frame the plaintiff's cause of action. It is therefore the nature of the behaviour complained of, rather than the cause of actionselected, which will determine the availability or otherwise of exemplary damages. INTRODUCTION This necessarily brief review of the law relating to examplary damages in Australia has the following goals. Firstly, it summarises the role or f unction of exemplary damages within the context of actions in tort in Australia, and then goes on to examine the scope of awards of exemplary damages within the same context. Some difficult and unresolved issues arise, notably the apparent extension of exemplary damages into the realm of negligence, and the tension between criminal and civil punishment. Arguments in relation to these and other contentious issues are considered, andin conclusion, an opinion is reached as to the degree of match between the apparent reality of exemplary damages in Australia and their envisa ged role according to the Law Reform Commission of the United Kingdom's report No. 247.[1] THE ROLE OF EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN AUSTRALIA Unlike compensatory damages, the focus of exemplary damages is on the conduct of the defendant, and in particular, the degree to which th e defendant's conduct \"shocks the tribunal of fact, representing the community.\"[2] Exemplary damages are therefore seen as being separate from,though nevertheless parasitic on [3] compensatory damages.[4] They are awarded when the behavior of the defendant, in addition to causing some compen sable damage to the plaintiff, consists of a \"conscious wrongdoing in contumelious disregard of a nother's rights.\"[5] In that sense the role of exemplary damages is to punish the defendant fo r his or her high handed or wrongful conduct and to deter the particular defendant, as well as pot ential defendants, from committing such an act in future. The award of exemplary damages demonstr ates the court's detestation of the action in question [6], and as such is a mark of opprobrium against the defendant. In addition, it has beenargued that there are broader social considerations to be taken into account, for example to teach tortfeasors that \"tort does not pay\" [7], and to assuage any urge for revenge felt by victims and thus to discourage any temptation to engage in self-help likely to endanger the peace. [8]page 2 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1SCOPE OF EXEMPLARY DAMAGES It is apparent that exemplary damages have been awarded by courts in a wide range of circumstances. Traditionally, exemplary damages we re only associated with intentional torts - including trespass to land [9], trespass to the pers on [10], trespass to chatte ls [11], defamation [12] and deceit [13]. Even if the scope were stopped at th at point, the breadth of application of exemplary damages in Australia would be quite wide comp ared with the prevailing conditions in other jurisdictions, notably England among common law jurisdictions. More recently however, Australian courts have contemplated the question of whether exemplary damages are available to plaintiffs who have framed their actions in negligence rather than in some other (intentional) tort. This tre nd has been noted by several authors who have voiced their concerns that the extension of exemplary da mages into the realm of negligence is a dangerous state of affairs. One recent editorial claims that there is a \"pressing need for the High Court to define the proper parameters for the award of exemplar y damages\" [14] while others have noted the confusion amongst contemporary practitioners as to the appropriate bounds and rules for theapplication of exemplary damages. [15] Perhaps the confusion in relation to the awar d of exemplary damages in negligence matters can be best clarified with reference to the High Court's judgment in Gray v Motor Accident Commission [16] in which a general principle appear s to have been developed. The court noted that it expected that awards of exemplary damages in negligence matters would be rare [17], but that in those rare instances, an important principle in determining the availability of exemplary damages was that attention should be paid to the conduct of the defendant, not the nature of the tort chosen by the plaintiff to bring action against the tort feasor [18]. Thus although exemplary damages have been awarded in product liability cases [19], cases where employers knowingly failed to create a safe working environment and persisted with th at unsafe environment irrespective of the known danger of doing so [20] as well as cases of medi cal negligence [21], the mere fact that those particular actions were brought in negligence is arguably of residual importance. Thus it appears thatAustralian courts have not seen fit to create a general principle on scope founded on the nature of the action brought, but rather, have determined th at they should look behind the type of action, to determine whether the award of exemplary damages would be in accordance with the objectives for the award of such damages noted previously. COMMON LAW RESTRICTIONS TO SCOPE Exemplary damages are often described as anom alies within civil law remedies, perhaps due to the similarities between the language of punishme nt, deterrence and moral retribution within the law of civil exemplary damages and the criminal la w. Indeed, one of the most difficult issues faced by courts is the extent to which they ought to take into account any punishments meted out in criminal jurisdictions to defendants subsequently the subject of an action in tort. One earlyconsideration of this issue suggests that if criminal punishment has already been given, no exemplary damages should be awarded since this would be to punish the defendant twice for thesame act. [22] A recent revisitati on of the same issue resulted in the majority of the High Court ofAllied Academies International Conference page 3 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002Australia concluding that \"where, as here, the criminal law has been brought to bear upon the wrongdoer and substantial punishment inflicted, we consider that exemplary damages may not be awarded...because we consider that the infliction of substantial punishment for what is substantially the same conduct as the conduct which is the subject of the civil proceeding is a bar to the award.\" [23] However, the law is not as straightforwar d as the statement above would suggest. For example, what if the punishment meted out by the criminal court was not \"substantial\"? Thejudgment in Gray v Motor Accident Commission speci fically declined to comment on what that term would be taken to mean, but an analysis of the tr anscript [24] reveals some division in the court. McHugh J, at p 17 states \"...take a case where in sulting words are used of a very bad kind, the magistrate might give a bond, might not even pr oceed to conviction, but in a civil case it might nevertheless, in all the circumstances call for the award of exemplary damages. So arguably, the fact that you have been punished in a criminal court would not deter the court from awarding exemplary damages.\" This indicates a willingness on the part of at l east some members of the court to view the \"bar\" as discretionary rather than absolute, but other members of the court, notably Kirby J, were not happy with such an open position. Thus Kirby J makes comments such as \"...but that would mean that the sentencing judge would have to say, \"now, steady on, one day somebody might come along and seek to recover damages and I've got to k eep that in mind and, therefore, I've got to reduce the punishment that I impose to make sure that you do not double count.\" [25] Indeed, several questions of significance have been explicitly left open. In addition to questions about the meaning of the term \"substan tial\", questions are raised about the position when criminal proceedings are possible or probable (t hough have not yet commenced) at the time of civil proceedings, about the position when an accused is exonerated of criminal charges, and thenecessary degree of overlap between the criminal and civil actions brought. Thus while the position seems relatively clear when an individual has been imprisoned as a result of an earlier criminal acti on, and is now the subject of civil proceedings arising out of the same or substantially the same actions which resu lted in the original criminal proceedings, the law is not at all clear in many other situations. In passing, prior to examining critiques of the operation and role of exemplary damages in Australia, it is noted that a further common law restriction on exemplary damages - relating to the law of cont ract. Simply, punitive damages are not recoverable for a breach of contract unless the conduct constituti ng the breach is also a tort for which exemplary damages are recoverable. [26] CONCLUSION To state that exemplary damages should be an exceptional and rarely rewarded remedy is in essence a statement of hope. If society adopts behavioral standards in which high-handeddisregard for the rights of others is a less observed phenomenon, then the UK Law ReformCommission's desire will be a reality. The positi on in Australia, notw ithstanding the apparent extension of the applicability of exemplary damage s identified in this pape r, is in accordance with that statement of hope. [27] The fulfillment of the second leg of th e test - the reservation of suchpage 4 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1damages for wrongdoings that would otherwise go unpunished, is less certain. This is because of the identified possibility that exemplary damages ma y in certain circumstances be awarded against an individual who has already been punished within the criminal syst em. It is in this respect that great vigilance is required, and it is in this respect that the most fundamental and as yet unresolved problems with the law of exemplary damages have arisen.

Kamery, Christ ian Brothers University Sarah T. Pitts, Christian Brothers University ABSTRACT The impact of the Prospective Payment Syst em and increased enrollment in HMOs and PPOs has placed greater pressures on hospitals for discounts. In a market characterized by increasedprice competition, the most efficient hospitals will survive and others fail. An increase in thenumber and frequency of hospitals involved in merger activity suggests that merging is a way tobecome more efficient rather than closing. This paper presents a theoretical framework investigating the cost structure of merged and cl osed hospitals prior to mergers and closures and uses a cost differential model to determine all cost s relevant in the decision to close or to merge. Pressure from patients and HMOs to lower costs has forced many community hospitals to consider closing. It is recommended that closing hospitals should consider merging in order to continue serving their community. INTRODUCTION Large HMOs, such as Kaiser Permanente, Etna/U.S. HealthCare, Blue Cross, and PacifiCare, have redefined health care in the Unite d States. National health care inflation has ranged from twenty to twenty?nine percent dependi ng on geography (Omachonu, 1998). A relatively few major procedures account for the rising share of the nation's medical costs. Some of the higher costs are for treatments such as MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), CT scans (ComputerizedTomography), nuclear medicine, liver transplants, care for premature newborns, bone marrowtransplants, and coronary bypass surgery. Hospital bills for treatments such as these may exceed$100,000. Like other busin esses, hospitals must compete for la nd, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability. Many community and regional hospitals lack the above mentioned factors. Therefore, smallcommunity hospitals and large acute care medical centers are hoping to enhance quality, reducecosts, eliminate unnecessary duplication and serve more people by working together. One in 12 American community hospitals eith er merged, was acquired, or acquired another hospital in 1995, according to the pressure group Public Citizen. Of the 447 hospitals involved insuch activities, more than two?thirds were in five states: California, Texas, Florida, Wisconsin, and Ohio (Firshein, 1996). Many of these mergers and acquisitions involved Columbia/HCA.According to the American Hospital Association' s 1997 hospital statistics, the number of American community hospitals declined from more than 5,700 in 1984 to less than 5,300 in 1996.Approximately twenty percent of all community hosp itals have changed ownership in the past three years (AMA, 1998).page 6 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1LITERATURE REVIEW Previous studies explaining hospital merger activity offered ambiguous findings, and mostly suffered from a lack of support in economic theory and shortcomings in the analytical procedures (Mobley, 1990). Empirical studies focused on hospital?wide efficiency (length of stay, occupancy, admissions per bed, and full?time equivalent staff per patient day) rather than inter?hospitaldifferences in efficiency (Shortell, 1988; S hortell & Hughes, 1988; Becker & Sloan, 1985). A considerable portion of the merger literature is devoted to empirically testing the benefits of multi-hospital system affiliation, and comparing MHS hospitals and independent hospitals onhospital?specific economic performance outcomes (Ermann & Gabel, 1984). Research on the motivation for hospital mergers usually concludes that the underlying reasons why hospitals merge are monetary (Miller, 1996). Although the monetary need may act asa catalyst in starting the merger process, many re searchers do not report why there is a monetary need. Improvements in the health of older populations have been accompanied by substantialgrowth in medical expenditures (McClellan & Noguc hi, 1998). Like any other industry, the hospital industry is experiencing a period of technological change. McClellan and Nogochi (1998) define high?tech innovations as those with large fixed or marginal costs when they are applied. Far more medical technologies have large fixed development costs. Hospitals with the latest technology and break?through treatments will better serve their patients than hospitals lacking this technology.Thus, the ability to serve patient s becomes a critical issue in the argument to merge or close a hospital. Studies conducted by McClellan & N oguchi (1998) found that an outcome gap will develop between hospitals that \"lead\" and those th at \"trail\" in the diffusion of new knowledge about readily available treatments. The leading hospitals are likely to be those that treat high volumes of patients, thus allowing their medical staff to be more knowledgeable and specialized. The studyconcludes that patients treated at hospitals slow er to adopt new technology will tend to be treated with the technology later, if at all. Results from the study by McClellan and Nogochi (1998) provethat smaller hospitals with lower capital budge ts will not compete nor survive against a multi-hospital system. In addition to rapid technological change, hospita ls are also experiencing an increase in the involvement of managed health car e providers. HMOs and PPOs have forced hospitals to cut costs. While many support the reduction in costs, it has left some hospitals on the verge of bankruptcy.It is at this point that many hos pital administrators would make the decision to close (O'Cleverly, 1993). The hospitals forced to close were relatively small; the median size for each hospital wasapproximately 60 beds. Closure was not an outcome that resulted from one year of badperformance. It usually took at least three years of deteriorating operations for a hospital to close (O'Cleverly, 1993). Most of the studies supporting cl osure for near bankrupt hospitals point to years of inefficiency and overall operational ineffectiveness. If these hospitals were to merge, they most likely would be closed anyway. Contrary to O'Cleverly's findings (1993), some researchers have stated that for?profit hospital owners are able to bring in the necessary capital and expertise to troubled hospitals. Many hospitals studied were bankrupt and would most likely have closed had they not been bought by another organization (West, 1998). Other hospitals converted because their boards believed theyAllied Academies International Conference page 7 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002would not be able to survive in the long run as st and?alone facilities. Once integrated into a larger health network, the hospitals studied (rural and community) were given the necessary upgrades in technology and staff to support the surrounding comm unities. The findings of Gerson and Vernanec (1997) also illustrate the need fo r community hospitals to merge with more efficient providers of health care rather than closing. A continued incr ease in outpatient care and further reduction in the nursing staff at many hospitals has resulted in servi ce that is less than desirable. The nursing staff is the backbone of the hospital. Without a proper nursing staff the hospital cannot operate effectively. Multi-hospital systems are able to pr ovide the necessary staff to support the needs of their hospitals, thus supporting the community. The studies by Gerson and Vernanec (1997) andWest (1998) illustrate that cost effectiveness is a benefit from merging, but most importantly, theoverall quality and service a hospital provides to patients is greatly improved. THE MODEL A cost differential model may be used to determ ine all costs that are relevant in the decision to close or merge a hospital. This model is de rived from traditional cost accounting models which separate value?added costs from non value-added costs. Merchandising firms that must decide ifa particular segment or product line should be discontinued or expanded commonly use thisapproach. The traditional model intentionally does not account for sunk costs. The purchase of land and equipment would be ignored. The cost differential model, while using the same principles, mustbe adapted to fit the hospital industry. This mean s that some sunk costs in health care are relevant in decisions concerning the merging or closing of a hospital. Opportunity costs must also be determined before any decisions are made. Due to the costs of continued service and speci alization, within the last few years, hospitals have started to aggressively advertise their particular services. For example, the Memphis,Tennessee metropolitan area has four major hospitals. Each hospital claims to provide specialized care. Saint Francis Hospital advertises its st roke emergency care and assisted living facilities. Methodist?Le Bonheur offers a physician referral service. Le Bonheur is known as a leadingchildren's hospital. Baptist Hospital operates one of the largest health care networks in West Tennessee and Northern Mississippi. Health car e organizations are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on marketing, advertising, and promo tional efforts aimed at attracting new customers (Omachonu, 1998). Media attention is expensive. Smaller community hospitals do not have thesefunds. For example, Panola Hospital in Mississippi (located about fifty miles south of Memphis) is a small, rural hospital. It is struggling to retain patients. Unfortunately, Panola Hospital will not survive against the Baptist health network. A merg er with Baptist or another large institution would enable Panola to continue serving the community through specialized care. Service is thecompetitive edge for any business including hospitals (Omachonu, 1998).page 8 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1QUALITY CONTROL COSTS The focus on quality performance, a trend bordering on impatience on the health plan front, is sure to determine who leads and who survives among hospitals (Gerson & Vernarec, 1997). Maintaining quality control is costly, but necessary. Many people believe that most rural andcommunity hospitals leave much to be desired with respect to quality. Hospital quality, whilerelated to other service industries, has unique dimensions. Consumers (patients) and observers (visitors) use facilities related quality and human factor quality to gauge the quality of hospital service (Oswald, Turner & Snipes, 1998). Many smaller hospitals do not have the funds or theresources to renovate facilities and patient rooms. Th ey may also lack the staff needed to adequately care for multiple patients. Retaining a large staff is expensive. When hospitals are on the verge ofbankruptcy and/or closure, excess staff is the first to be cut. There is a need for medical care in all communities. When failing hospitals decide to close, an opportunity cost arises. The hospital building may be sold or it may remain empty for years. The community will still be without hosp ital care in either case. If the hospital decided to merge with a larger hospital network, the building would serv e its original purpose and the community would benefit by having a hospital. In the hospital industry, high costs usually result in high prices. Hospitals that closed generally had higher charges. More of the hospitals that closed were classified as rural and had lower wage and salary costs. Prices increased shar ply in the year prior to closure. These hospitals had extremely low levels of investment in net fixed assets, which suggests that they had not keptpace with technological developments. This failure may have driven medical staff and their patients away (O'Cleverly, 1993). RESULTS The cost differential model presented develops the theory that hospitals should merge rather than close. Many smaller community hospitals do not have the necessary resources and funding to continue operating in a highly competitive industry. The results from the cost model document this to be the trend. As stated in the model, many rural and comm unity hospitals have been forced to close because of ineffective management and overall inefficient operating procedures. Many of the problems surrounding ineffective management woul d be eliminated through merging. Experienced managers at the larger health care institutions would be able to run the troubled hospital as a business. This would be the first step in rebu ilding operational structure at the community hospital level. The management of the partner hospital could then bring in an adequate size staff. The ruralhospital is no longer responsible for paying the hosp ital staff. Funding for such expenditures would be allocated to each hospital in the network. The rising cost of medical procedures is another compelling reason why troubled hospitals must merge rather than close. Community and rural hospitals are not able to raise the capitalnecessary to finance the latest technologies. It makes sense for the smaller hospital to develop apartnership with a larger hospital in the surroundi ng area. Both hospitals would benefit. TheAllied Academies International Conference page 9 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002community hospital would not have to finance expe nsive equipment, and the larger hospital could increase market share. Technological expenditures are the major expenditures at any hospital,regardless of size (Omachonu, 1998). CONCLUSION Merging is a win-win situation for most hosp itals involved. The smaller hospital no longer must cut costs at the expense of patient care. The capital and resources available from the parenthospital would lead to an overall hospital expa nsion. Additional physicians and nurses could be retained. Needed technological improvements woul d be made, greatly increasing the level of care provided to each patient. The option of specialization in specific emergency needs or areas ofpatient care would attract new patients as well as additional staff. The community hospital wouldnot specialize in acute care. Patients needing this type of care would be transferred to the parent hospital. This is a way that hospitals attempt to maximize overall efficiency. Also, larger hospital networks have been able to follow their acquisiti ons with deals and discounts with suppliers, giving the entire chain the best prices enjoyed by any of its partners prior to any deals (Kenkel, 1995).

SEX\"? Philip McGough, Sonoma State University ABSTRACT The paper reviews Justice Scalia's 1998 opinion in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., arguing that Justice Scalia, after holding that same-sex harassment could be actionable under Title VII, deliberately chose not to consider directly whether Joseph Oncale's harassment was \" because of... sex\" and therefore actionable, perhaps in order to get all eight of the other justices to join his opinion. But the opinion implies that it adequately addresses the statutory \"because of sex\" requirement in same-sex harassment and remands Oncale and a companion case, Belleville v. Doe,to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in its light. Not surprisingly, Oncale has given minimal and confusing guidance to the Circuits of the U.S. C ourt of Appeals dealing with the issues of when the statutory requirement of \"because of ...sex\" is satisfied in same-sex harassment cases.page 12 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1Allied Academies International Conference page 13 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002DALTON V. CAMP: DEFINING A MANAGER'S FIDUCIARY DUTIES J. Reagan McLaurin, American University of Sharjah Dalton v. Camp, a case which was heard recently on appeal by the North Carolina Court of Appeals (Dalton v. Camp 2000) (Dalton v. Camp 1999), and the cases cited by the Court in itsdecision, highlight the current state of law in No rth Carolina regarding an manager's duty of loyalty to his employer. Specifically, this case focuses on a manager's fiduciary duty not to compete with his employer while still in his employ, and legal consequences of such action. In this case, the plaintiff, Robert Earl Dalton d/b/a B. Dalton & Company (\"Dalton\"), publishes employment magazines for other companies. After contracting with Klaussner Furniture Industries (\"KFI\") in July of 1993 to publish th eir employment magazine, Dalton hired David Camp as General Manager and charged him with the responsibility to produce the KFI magazine. AsDalton contracted with other companies to produce their magazines, he gave Camp the responsibilityfor these magazines as well. In December, 1995, Camp hired Nancy Menius to work with him.Neither employee has a specific covenant not to compete with Dalton. In January 1997, Dalton, Camp and Menius met with KFI to discuss renewing the publication contract. In the case at hand, Dalton alleges that all parties left this meeting with anunderstanding that the then-current relationship would continue, although perhaps with modifiedterms. Shortly after this meeting, Camp began m eeting with KFI's representative while Camp was still employed as General Manager, sometimes at Dalton's place of business, to discuss a separate contract. Camp asserts that the KFI representative initiated the meetings. According to Dalton, Menius and Camp discussed forming a competing company several times in February of 1997. On February 28, Me nius resigned. Camp and Menius claim that no substantial talks took place until after Menius quit. After Menius left Da lton's employ, she and Camp prepared a business plan for M illennium Communication Concepts, Inc. (\"MCC\"), and presented it to a lender in March of 1977. In this business plan, they presented Camp as a former employee of Dalton. On March 13, 1977, Menius incorporated MCC with Camp and Menius as sole officers,directors, and shareholders. At about the same time that MCC was incorporated, MCC contracted with KFI to publish their employment magazine. Camp signed this contract for MCC while still employed by Dalton.Then, on March 26, Camp resigned and informed Dalton of his actions in forming MCC and contracting with KFI. MCC eventually established contracts with other clients of Dalton. Dalton filed suit against David Camp, Nancy J. Menius, and Millennium Communication Concepts, Inc., for breach of fiduciary duty of loya lty, conspiracy to appropriate customers, tortious interference with contract, interference with pr ospective advantage and unfair and deceptive trade practices. The plaintiff's claim for tortious inte rference with contractual and business relations was dismissed on September 12, 1997. Prior to trial, the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the remaining claims was granted on July 13, 1998. Dalton appealed to the NC Court of Appeals onpage 14 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1the summary judgment ruling, contending that the trial court erred, since there were issues of material fact in evidence. The North Carolina Court of Appeals first heard the case and released a decision on August 16, 1999 (Ibid). However, in light of its decision in another case, Sara Lee Corp. v. Carter (Sara Lee Corp. v. Carter 1998) (\"Sara Lee 2\"), the North Carolina Supreme Court remanded the case back to the Court of Appeals on February 16, 2000. The Court of Appeals issu ed their revised ruling on June 6, 2000. Then, on October 5, 2000, the Supreme Court allowed a motion by N. C. Citizens forBusiness and Industry to file an Amicus Curiae brief in the case (Dalton v. Camp 2000), and on the same date allowed a motion by the defendants for di scretionary review of the (more recent) decision of the Court of Appeals, on two of the three issues identified by that Court (Dalton v. Camp 2000). In its decision on June 6, 2000, the Court of A ppeals identified four separate issues for consideration. First, the Court considered the cl aims by Dalton of breach of the (fiduciary) duty of loyalty by the defendants. In considering this issu e, the Court reasoned that a fiduciary relationship may be created by \"instilling a special confidence\" in another party. They cite Speck v. N.C. Dairy Foundation (Speck v. N.C Dairy Foundation 1984), speci fically as it cites Abbitt v. Gregory (Abbitt v. Gregory 1931). Abbitt v. Gregory sets the precedent for modern North Carolina case law indiscussing what situations might fall under the heading of \"fiduciary relationship\". In Abbitt v.Gregory, the Supreme Court of North Carolina explained: It is difficult to define legally the exact extent of the meaning of the term \"fiduciary\" to include every relationship of that character, but the relationshi p exists where there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound to act in good faith and in due regard to the one reposing the confidence..................................................................................................It is immaterial whether the relation between [plaintiff and defendant] was that of principal andagent... The courts generally have declined to define the term \"fiduciary relation\" and thereby excludefrom this broad term any relation that may exist between two or more persons with respect to therights of person or property of either... The rela tion may exist under a variety of circumstances; it exists in all cases where there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and goodconscience is bound to act in good fa ith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing confidence.(Ibid) Once a fiduciary relationship is created, the Court reasoned, its existence \"binds the individual to act with good faith and loyalty to wards the one instilling confidence.\"(Dalton v. Camp 2000) Here they refer to the Court of Appeals hear ing of the Sara Lee Cor p. v. Carter case (\"Sara Lee 1\"). In Sara Lee 1, the Court of Appeals stat ed that an \"employee is bound to the exercise of the utmost good faith, loyalty, and honesty toward his ... employer\". Citing McKnight v. Simpson's Beauty Supply, Inc. (McKnight v. Simpson's Beauty Supply 1965), the Court enjoined an employee to \"faithfu lly serve his employer and perform his duties with reasonable diligence, care and attention.\" In McKni ght, the N.C. Court of Appeals specifically states that this promise is implied in every employment contract, not necessarily by the contract terms, but by the operation of law. Finally if, in violation of these common tenets of all employer/employee relationships, an employee \"deliberately acquires an interest adverse to his employer\" (Dalton v. Camp 2000), theAllied Academies International Conference page 15 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002Court concludes that such an employee has clearly violated his duty of l oyalty. The Court found that Dalton had presented sufficient evidence a) that Dalton had instilled a special confidence in Camp; b) that with such confidence, Camp was bound to act with loyalty toward Dalton; c) that theemployee/employer relationship created a duty on Camp 's part to serve Dalton with reasonable care; and d) that \"Camp had clearly acquired an interest adverse\" to Dalton. Camp, et. al., argued that, per Fletcher, Barnhardt & White, Inc. v. Matthews (Fletcher, Barnhardt & White, Inc. v. Matthews 1990), the lowe r court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Camp was correct. In that case, the Appeals Court determined that merely forming a companywhile in another's employ is not sufficient grounds to show breach of duty of loyalty. In this case, however, the Court states that Dalton has shown sufficient evidence that Camp went beyond merely forming a company, and they therefore reversed the lower court's grant of summary judgment infavor of Camp on the complaint of breach of duty of loyalty. In examining the charge of breach of loya lty against Menius, how ever, the Court found no evidence that Menius went beyond \"mere preparations to compete\", and they therefore upheld thegrant of summary judgment in favor of Menius. When, in October, 2000, the N.C. Supreme Court granted the Defendants' motion for discretionary review of the (mor e recent) Appeals Court decision (Dalton v. Camp 2000), this issue of breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty is th e issue which the Court refused to review. The second issue addressed by the Court in Da lton v. Camp was whether the Plaintiff had presented a genuine issue of material fact regard ing Defendants' unfair and deceptive trade practices. In its decision, the Court declared that he ha d, citing Chapter 75 of the North Carolina General Statutes, which establishes a cause of action for such practices. The Appeals Court reached thisrevised decision after the Supreme Court's opinion in Sara Lee 2 (Sara Lee Corp. v. Carter 1999), and remand of the case back to the Appeals Court. Prior to the Supreme Court's re view of Sara Lee Corp. v. Cart er, North Carolina Courts had held that the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act did not apply to employer/employeerelationships and, in fact, the Appeals Court reached this conclusion in its first hearing of the case (Dalton v. Camp 1999). However, in Sara Lee 2, the Supreme Court broke new ground on the issue. First, quoting the Unfair Trade Practices Act, it declared \"Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive act s or practices in or affecting commerce, are declared unlawful.\" (North Carolina General Stat utes quoted in Sara L ee Corp. v. Carter 1999) In this case, \"defendant's acts were conclusively ' unfair or deceptive'\" (Sara Lee Corp. v. Carter 1999), therefore the Court move d on to examine the question of whether the acts of Carter were \"in or affecting commerce\". They concluded that the acti ons of Carter were \"in or affecting commerce\" and therefore within the scope of the Act. Finall y, and most critically for Dalton v. Camp, the Court examined whether employer/employee relationships can fall within the scope of the Act. In their conclusions, the Supreme Court declared that \"Even though defendant was an employee, he nevertheless engaged in self-dealing conduct and ' business activities'... On these facts, defendant's mere employee status at the time he committed these acts does not safeguard him from liabilityunder the Act.\"(Ibid) Upon review of the Supreme Court's decision, the Appeals Court reconsidered its findings in Dalton v. Camp. Although it had found that the employer/employee relationship precluded thepage 16 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1Plaintiff from holding Camp, et. al ., liable for deceptive trade practi ces, it now explored the question from a fresh perspective. Following the Supreme Court's lead, it looked for the existence of threefactors in determining an issu e of deceptive trade practices: \"(1) an unfair or deceptive act or practice, or unfair method of competition, (2) in or affecting commerce, and (3) which proximately caused actual injury to the plaintiff or his bus iness.\"(Murray v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. quoted in Dalton v. Camp 2000) The Court found that Camp had \"used a position of confidence to solicit the plaintiff's customers and compete with the plaintiff while still in his employment,\" that he \"concealed his behavior from the plaintiff,\" and that \"these acts ... amount to unfair and deceptive tradepractices.\"(Dalton v. Camp 2000) In deciding whether Camp's acts were \"in or affecting commerce,\" the Appeals Court again looked to the Supreme Court's decision in Sara Lee 2.Following the Supreme Court's definition of comme rce, the Appeals Court found that, since Camp \"solicited plaintiff's customers and obtained th eir business...while on official business for the plaintiff,\"(Ibid) the conduct of Camp was \"in or affecting commerce.\" Lastly, the Appeals Court determined that Dalton had presented sufficient evid ence of material fact to determine his \"actual injury.\" In conclusion, the Appeals Court reversed the grant of summary judgment for Camp on the issue of unfair and deceptive trade practices. Examining the case against Menius, the Appeal s Court found that the relevant actions of Menius all took place after she left Dalton's empl oy, and that these actions do not constitute unfair and deceptive trade practices under such conditi ons. Finally, the Appeals Court reexamined its findings in regard to MCC. In its original decision, the Court had found that since the employer/employee relationship protected Menius and Camp from charges of unf air and deceptive trade practices, and that MCC acted solely through them, it also was not liable. Now, in light of Sara Lee 2 and its conclusions about Camp, the Appeals Court reversed itself and d eclared that sufficient evidence of material fact existed to justify a claim of unfair and deceptive trade practices against MCC. The third issue that the Appeals Court examin ed is the issue of whether Dalton had shown sufficient evidence to bring a claim of tortious in terference with prospective business advantage. In order to do so, Dalton must have shown that a cont ract with KFI would have ensued if not for the actions of the defendants. Further, the Court declar ed that the \"defendants must not be acting in the legitimate exercise of their own right, 'but with a design to injure the plaintiff or gain someadvantage at his expense.'\" (Ibid, quoting from Owens v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of Hickory, N.C., Inc. 1992) Since evidence had been presented showing that not only was KFI satisfied with Dalton's performance under the original contract, but that the relationship had continued beyond the original terms of the contract, and that there was every indication that it would have continued, except for the actions of the defendants. The defendants claimed that Camp had \"an unqualified right tocompete\", but the Court pointed out that \"this argument impermissibly ignores Camp's ongoing duty to plaintiff as the general manager of plaintiff's company.\" Since it had already determined that there was a real issue as to whether Camp had breached his duty of loyalty, the Court also determined that there was a real issue as to whether Camp was \"acting in the legitimate exercise of his ownAllied Academies International Conference page 17 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002rights.\"(Ibid) Therefore it reversed the summary judgment in regard to the claim of tortious interference with prospective business advantage against Camp. Since it had already determined that there was not sufficient evidence to uphold a claim of breach of duty of loyalty against Menius, it also decided that there was not evidence to support a claim of tortious interference against her, and upheld the summary judgment in her favor. However, since MCC acted through Camp, and there was suffi cient evidence of such a claim against Camp, the Appeals Court again reversed its earlier decision in light of Sara Lee 2, and reinstated Dalton'sclaim of tortious interference against MCC. The fourth and final issue addressed by the C ourt of Appeals was the question of whether Dalton had shown sufficient evidence to support a clai m of conspiracy against the defendants. Since the plaintiff testified that he did not have anythi ng more than suspicions that Camp and Menius had conspired with one another, the Court upheld th e grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants. After deciding the four main issues in the cas e, the Appeals Court explored the question of damages. In order to recover damages, the plainti ff must show that the amount being sought is based upon a reasonable standard, so that they may be \" calculated with a reasonable certainty.\" Further, the plaintiff must show that th e damages being sought were the \"natural and probable result of the defendants' conduct.\" Finally, evidence of past regul ar profits may be used to determine the extent of damages.(Ibid) The Appeals Court decided that sufficient evidence had been presented by the plaintiff to withstand a motion for summary judgment, based on th e testimony of plaintiff's expert witness, and therefore that defendants' motion for summary judgment regarding damages should be denied. In its decisions in Dalton v. Camp, the Appeals Court cited the North Carolina Supreme Court's decision In Re Burris (In Re Burris 1965), to wit \"where an employee deliberately acquires an interest adverse to his employer, he is disloyal.\" (Dalton v. Camp 2000) Burris roots its opinionin a quote from an 1877 case which was heard before the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, Dieringer v. Meyer (Dieringer v. Meyer 1877). In that case, the Court 's declaration states succinctly the root philosophy, from both common and case law, of the issues in Dalton v. Camp: Manifestly, when a servant becomes engaged in a business which necessarily renders him a competitor and rival of his master, no matter how much or how little time and attention he devotesto it, he has an interest against his duty. It woul d be monstrous to hold that the master is bound to retain the servant in his employment after he has thus voluntarily put himself in an attitude hostile to his master's interests. (Ibid) Given the right of the master (employer) to di scharge the servant (employee) who has taken an interest against his employer, it is a small step to granting that employer the right to lay claim fordamages against the employee. Although North Caro lina Courts had allowed such suits for breach of fiduciary loyalty, they had seen the employer/em ployee relationship as a bar to claims of unfair and deceptive business practices. After the North Ca rolina Supreme Court's decision in Sara Lee 2, and now the Court of Appeals subsequent revision of its decision in Dalton v. Carter, the precedent has been set for other courts to set the standa rd higher for an employee's behavior. Particular emphasis will now be put on the importance of the employee's fiduciary relationship with thepage 18 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1employer and the trust that it implies and demands. Not only will directors and officers of corporations be held to this high standard of moral behavior, but also the manager who holds the power to start a business on the side in direct competition with his employer and to claim the employer's customers for his own. CONCLUSION As noted, the Supreme Court of North Carolina has agreed to review Issues Two and Three of the Appeals Court decision in Dalton v. Camp. Significantly, they refused to review Issue One, the decision regarding breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty against Camp. Clearly, Dalton has presented sufficient evidence to bring a claim against Camp for this charge. Regardless of theoutcome of the Supreme Court's review in this cas e, and the eventual outcome of the trial, if it should take place, the Courts have made it clear in these cases, and the others they cited, that this immoral behavior by an employee in a position of fiduciary responsibility cannot be accepted orcondoned by society, and the wronged parties in such actions may seek relief in the court system. Ethically and legally, this is as it should be.Allied Academies International Conference page 19 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT & FAIR USE OF PARODY J. Reagan McLaurin, American University of Sharjah \" All rules of law contain implied extensions and implied limitations and are therefore subject to interpretation. Fair use in the current statute is a classicillustration of a very general rule, the interp retations of which vary widely. As might be expected, copyright owners, who control the playing field by carefully selecting which cases come to court, tend to give the fair use doctrine a very narrow reading, while users (always the defendants) naturally take a broader view.\" The concept of copyright law, through its various incarnations, is as old as the United States. The framers of the U.S. constitution saw the law as a means to balance the rights of artistic creatorswith the rights of users. (Ibid) It is a common misconception that the sole purpose of copyright law is to protect creators of works against anyone tr ying to steal their work. The copyright law's designated intent, as stated explicitly within th e U.S Constitution, and interpreted by federal courts and Congress, is not to ensure the enrichment of creators but rather to promote the public welfare by the advancement of knowledge. (Ibid) This paper is concerned with the legal use of parody as a fair use exception to the exclusive rights granted creators under the Federal copyright la ws. Specifically, the paper will address, what, in the eyes of the law, are the determining factors in whether a work of parody (e.g., music, movie, literature, photograph) captures the legal essence of parody or infringes on the creation of an earlier work, per the Copyright Act of 1976, because it does not transform the earlier work. The Copyright Act of 1976 identifies four fact ors that must be considered by the courts before allowing fair use as a defense. These four factors are: The purpose and the character of the use, including whether such use is of a commerc ial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; the nature of the copyrighted work; the amount a nd substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and the effect of the use upon the potential market for and value of the copyrighted work Parody is one of four types of satire: The other types are diatribe, narrative, and burlesque. The root of the word, which is \"parodia,\" literally means a song sung beside something. Webster's New World Dictionary defines parody as \"literary or musical composition imitating thecharacteristic style of some other work or of a writer or composer, but treating a serious subject in a nonsensical manner, as in ridicule.\" (Johnson, M. & Spilger, U.) Herein lies the legal balancing act surrounding copyright infringement and parody; the parody intends to gain attention by imitationand using humor at the expense of the original work and/or creator. So, it follows that more often than not the original creator of the work that is parodied is not receptive to their work being ridiculed. U.S. case law bears this out by virtue of the numerous cases in which the target of a parody tried to prevent or discontinue the publica tion and/or distribution of the work of parody to consumers. This paper will highlight influen tial cases that illustrate how U.S. courts havepage 20 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1interpreted the fair use doctrine as it relates to copyright infringement and parody. Moreover, this paper will discuss in depth two cases that clearly demonstrate the legal issues one must considerwhen evaluating the leg itimacy of a work of parody when based on an earlier copyrighted work. The first case, Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. (1994) (Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.1994), is crucial to understanding the relationship between a work of parody, and the copyrighted work against which it is based, because it delineates the necessary factors that make such a work ofparody legal. The second case, Dr. Suess Enterpri ses, L.P. v. Penguin Books, USA, Inc. (Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P. v Penguin Books, USA, Inc. 1997) , is an example of how a work of so-called parody capitalizes on an earlier copyrighted work without successfully transforming the copyrighted work through targeted criticism. Not surprisingly, as the mediums by which creative expression were delivered expanded during the 20th century, the more pressing an issu e copyright infringement became with respect to parody. Never was this more apparent than with the advent of television. In 1955, when television was in its infancy, in Columbia Pictures Cor poration v. National Broadcasting Company (Columbia Pictures Corporation v. National Broadcasting Company 1995), Columbia Pictures sued NBC because the network broadcast a parody of the m ovie From Here To Eternity in a television production called From Here to Obscurity. Th e parody used the same general settings and characters as in the original work, but the tone and development of the characters were noticeably different. The California District Court ruled that the NBC production was a form of parody that is a recognized literary art form that transfers a serious copyrighted work into a comic one. Thismeans the parody must contain recognizable elements of the original copyrighted work. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals observed in 1956 in Be nny v, Loews Inc., (Benny v. Lowes Inc. 1956) the fact that a serious dramatic work is copied pr actically verbatim, and th en presented with actors walking on their hands or with other absurdities, does not avoid copyright infringement. (Ibid) The case of Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. 1994 (Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. 1994) was heard by the United States Supreme Court in 1993 and illustrates the high court'scontemporary interpretation of parody as it relates to an earlier copyrighted work. In the early 1990s the musical rap group \"2 Live Crew\" produced thei r own version of Roy Orbison's \"Pretty Woman.\" The rap group had asked for permission to use \"Pretty Woman\" from the holder of the song'scopyright holder, Acuff-Rose Musi c. When Acuff-Rose Music refused to grant permission 2 Live Crew went ahead and put their version on their album entitled \"As Clean as They Wanna Be.\" Acuff-Rose Music sued the rap group when 250,000 copi es of the album sold. Initially, the case was brought before the U.S. district Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The court ruled 2 Live Crew was not guilty of copyright infringement because the group had substituted \"predictable lyricswith shocking ones\" in order to demonstrate \"how bland and banal\" the Orbison song is. The court granted summary judgment for the rap group. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded the case on the basis of the Court of Appeals' conclusions that (1) the commercial nature of parody rendered the par ody presumptively unfair under the first of the four factors provided within the Copyright Act of 1976, (2 ) by taking the heart of the original and making it the heart of a new work, the group had qualitatively taken too much of the original under theCopyright Act's third factor, and (3) harm to the market for purposes of th e Copyright Act's fourth factor had been established by a presumption attaching to commercial uses.(Ibid) Allied Academies International Conference page 21 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002The case of Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. would now be heard before the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reve rsed and remanded the case. In an opinion by Justice Souter, communicating the unanimous view of the court, he noted that the Court of Appeals had erred in basing its judgment on the conclusion that the parody's commercial nature rendered theparody presumptively unfair under the first and fourth factors of the Copyright Act of 1976. Inestablishing a legal definition of parody the Supr eme Court noted that if the commentary has no critical bearing on the substance or style of the original work, which the alleged infringer merely uses to attract attention, the claim to fairness in borrowing from another work diminishesaccordingly.(Ibid) After comparing the text of the intended parody with the te xt of the original song, the court observed that while we might not assign a high rank to the parodic element here, we think it fair to say that the 2 Live Crew song reasonably could be perceived as commenting on the originalor criticizing it, to some degree. 2 Live Crew juxtaposes the romantic musings of a man whose fantasy comes true, with the degrading taunts, a bawdy demand for sex, and a sigh of relief fromparental responsibility.(Stewart, David O. Rock around the docket.) The case of Dr, Suess Enterprises, L.P. v. Pe nguin Books, USA, Inc.(Dr. Seuss Enterprise, L.P. v. Penguin Books, USA, Inc. 1997) was heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The case concerned the satirical parody of the O.J. Simpson double murder trial entitled The Cat NOT in the Hat! A Parody by Dr. Juice. The arguments centered on whether the authors of this so-called work of parody infri nged on the copyright and trademark of the well known The Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss.(Ibid) Seuss Enterprises, a California limited partnership, owns most of the copyrights and trademarks to the works of the deceased Theodor Geisel, the author and illustrator of the famous children's books written under the pseudonym \"Dr. Seuss.\" Between 1931 and 1991, Geisel wrote,illustrated, and published at least 47 books that resu lted in approximately 35 million copies currently in print worldwide. Seuss Enterprises has li censed the Dr. Seuss creations, including The Cat in the Hat character, for use on clothing, in interactive software, and in a theme park.(Ibid) In 1995, author Alan Katz and illustrator Ch ris Wrinn collaborated to produce the book The Cat Not in the Hat! satirizing the O.J. Simpson doubl e murder trial. The publishers and distributors of the book were not licensed or gi ven permission, nor did they ask, to use the writings, illustrations, or characters owned by Seuss. Consequently, Seu ss Enterprises filed a complaint for copyright and trademark infringement, submitted an application for a temporary restraining order, and sought apreliminary injunction after learning of an adve rtisement promoting the book. Seuss Enterprises alleged that The Cat Not in the Hat! illegally used substantial protected elements of its copyrighted works, used six unregistered and one registered Suess trademarks, and weakened the unique appeal of its well known copyrights and trademarks. In response, book author, Katz, filed a declaration stating that The Cat in the Hat was the \"object fo r [his] parody\" and portions of his book derive from The Cat in the Hat only as \"necessary to conjure up the original.\" Among the legal codes, acts, and statutes Suess cited as having been violated was the Copyright Act of 1976. Prior to th e Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals hearing the case a California district court denied the request for the temporary restraining order, but it set a hearing date for thepreliminary injunction. Meanwhile, the book was still slated for publication. On March 21, 1996,the district court granted Seuss Enterprises' request for a preliminary injunction. page 22 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1To address the issues of alleged copyright a nd trademark infringement the district court employed a two-pronged approach that determined if (1) there was copying and (2) if an audience of reasonable people would perceive substantial similarities between the accused work and protectedexpression of the copyrighted work. The district court summarized the issue by noting, \"In the Ninth Circuit, the issue is whether the works are substan tially similar. Substantial similarity may be found whenever the works share significant similarity in protected expression both on an objective level and a subjective, audience-response level.\" To counter, Penguin and Dove argued they did not infringe on any of Suess' protected copyrights because their book utilized characteristics of the copyrighted work that are not eligible to be copyrighted or that have fallen into the public domain. In the Suess case the Ninth Circuit of Appeals observed that parody is regarded as a form of social and literary criticism, having a socially significant value as a free speech under the First Amendment. The court used the criteria whereby th e work of parody is perm itted as a \"fair use\" of a copyrighted work if it takes no more than is n ecessary to recall the target of the parody. Penguin and Dove underscored the point that the Supreme Court in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose determined that it was wrong to rule that the commercial, profit-making nature of the defendant's infringementcreated a presumption of no fair use defense, because the other elements of the fair use doctrine were not thoroughly considered. The Nint h Circuit Court of Appeals noted that the court found that The Cat Not in the Hat! was not entitled to a parody fair use defense because it failed to target theoriginal work, not due to the commercial nature of the work. The district court concluded that The Cat in the Hat is the central character, appearing in nearly every image of The Cat in the Hat. Th e court observed that Penguin and Dove used that character's image, copying the Cat's Hat and using th e image on the front and back covers and in the text. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirm ed the district court's decision writing, \"We have no doubt that the Cat's image is the highly expressive core of Dr. Seuss' wo rk.\" The Circuit Court went on to write, \"We completely agree with the district court that Penguin and Dove's fair use defense is pure shtick and that their post-hoc characterization of the work is completelyunconvincing\" Finally, the Circuit Court summarized, \"In light of the fair us e analysis, we conclude that the district court's finding that Suess Ente rprises showed a likeli hood of success on the merits of the copyright claim was not clearly erroneous. Th is court can affirm the grant of the preliminary injunction based on the copyright or trademark infringement claims.\"(Ibid) CONCLUSION The Copyright Act of 1976 has served as a tool to courts in establishing parody as a fair use when based on an earlier copyrighted material. In both Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. (1994), 510, U.S. 569 (U.S. Supreme Court) and Dr. Suess Enterprises, L.P. v. Penguin Books, USA, Inc. we see that the courts have judged the strength of the claim of fair use of parody based on the extent to which the parody transforms the copyrighted material through targeted criticism. Campbellshowed sufficient evidence in the court's eyes that the 2 Live Crew's version of \"Pretty Woman\" was a fair use of parody because it was intended to be a direct criticism of Roy Orbison's version of \"Pretty Woman.\" Conversely, the California Distri ct Court ruled, and the Ninth Circuit Court ofAllied Academies International Conference page 23 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002Appeals upheld, that Penguin Books, USA, Inc. di d not show sufficient proof that the book they published was a targeted criticism of Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat. Rather, both courts concluded that the authors of The Cat NOT in the Hat! infringed on Suess' copyright by stealing the Cat'simage. The book used the image as a vehicle to provide commentary on the O.J. Simpson double murder trial, not the work of Dr. Suess. In a ny case of copyright infri ngement involving parody the courts will establish whether the parody meets the criteria for \"fair use\" protection by determining whether the so-called parody transforms the copyr ighted work through some sort of commentary. If the examining court finds that the work in que stion is a parody then it will consider each of the four factors as provided in the Copyright Act of 1976. In the eyes of the Copyright Act of 1976, when the work in question does not meet one or more of the four factors then copyright infringement has occurred.page 24 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1Allied Academies International Conference page 25 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002VETERINARY MALPRACTICE: THE IMPACT OF THE HUMAN-ANIMAL BOND J. Reagan McLaurin, American University of Sharjah David Snyder, Medical University of South Carolina One of many factors that should be considered when discussing industry trends is the role of society. Veterinary Medicine has seen a tremendous change in recent years. Although othersfactors have contributed to industry changes, soci ety and societal expectations have contributed on many levels. Among these are the change in the rela tionships of owners and their pets, the increase in the number of specialist and specialties available for veterinary clients, and the increase ofmalpractice suits filed against veterinarians th roughout the United States. These changes seldom, if ever, are the sole reason for current or futu re industry trends, but in their own way each has contributed to the profession's progress. In what ways have relationship changes and the rise ofspecialist contributed to the increase of malpractice suits? In order to explore this question it is essentia l to understand what prompted the other changes and what our judicial system's position was rega rding animals. Until recently animals within a household were referred to as \"pets.\" Historically these animals or pets were viewed as property, like a piece of furniture, by our judicial system a nd therefore judgments were limited to the market value or replacement cost of the pet. In many st ates this is still the cas e, but current case law is bringing about change. Presently, Harvard La w School offers course s in animal law and organizations such as the Animal Legal Defens e Fund are developing across the country. So why are we seeing trends advocating the rights of anim als and animal owners? And what do these trends mean for animal service industries? From the beginning of time animals have filled many roles in the lives of humans, from working and service positions to companions. Times have changed, but the multitude of roles filledby our pets has not. Canines or dogs still work and serve in working capacities throughout ourcountry. Some dogs are utilized as guard or prot ection canines, some for hunting or sport, others as service dogs for the handicapped or physically challenged, and others as companions for individuals and families. Whatever the role and whatever the species of animal, humans have cometo place a higher value on the lives of the animals in our society. As a result of the changes in societal views of animals, animal service industries have faced many challenges and changes recently. Among the animal service industries affected by the changesare pet food manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, pet insurance companies, boarding kennels,groomers, breeders, animal trainers, and veteri narians. Overall consumers demand a higher quality of service because the consumer is more educated about pet related issues and generally places a higher value on the pet. One of the recent changes directly affects our legal system. Pet owners believe that the judicial system should recognize the role animals play in the lives of people. A recent trend has led to a terminology change from \"pet\" to \"companion animal.\" The term is intended to denote thesignificance of the human-animal bond. This bond is at the heart of the issues affecting our legalpage 26 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1system. Lawyers, specifically pet attorneys, deal with issues ranging from malpractice to custody battles to wills and estates. A shift in legal precedent has occurred because more attorneys are willing to battle for the rights of companion animals as family members. Lawyers do not expectanimals to be viewed as equals to humans, but they are asking courts to recognize and \"honor the special kinship\" shared by owners and compani on animals.(Traster, Tina 2001) Additionally, lawyers are learning to maneuver within a judicial system that historically treats animals as things rather than family members. Recently, attorneys have been asking that an emotional value be placed on companion animals, therefore granting animals greater protec tion and empowering owners in disputes against animal service industries. Although many areas with in the industry have been affected one has been greatly impacted, veterinarians. Subsequently the boundaries of the veterinarian's liability havechanged. Unlike their human counterparts, veterinarians do not routinely carry malpracticeinsurance; rather they are covered by the Amer ican Veterinary Medical Association's (AVMA) Liability Insurance Trust. Traditionally, the relati onship between the veterinarian and the pet owner has been very friendly, respectful, and built upon trust. A recent st udy conducted by a group of animal health professionals and funded by Pfizer Animal Health found that veterinarians were among the top three most trusted professionals according to the individuals surveyed.(Brown, John,Silverman Jon 1999) Therefore, veterinarians relied upon their bonded relationship with theirclients to forego the settlement of disputes within the judicial system. According to the AVMALiability Insurance Trust, from 1976 to 1986 clai ms paid involving canines amounted to $993, 277 and legal fees amounted to $886,906. In feline cases paid claims amounted to $312,161 and legalfees amounted to $155,473.(Wilson, James 1988) During th is ten-year period the total expenses for small animal claims and legal fees amounted to $2,347,817. Given the number of veterinarianspracticing and the number of owned pets during thes e years, the risk for the individual veterinarian was minimal. But times have changed and veterinarians are experiencing their own subsequentchanges as more owners are seeking the services of attorneys in civil cases claiming malpracticeagainst veterinarians. Veterinarians need to understand tort law, specifically negligence law because most practitioners will incur some form of professional liability during their career; either in the form of negligence related to the injury of a client while on the premises of the veterinary clinic or hospital, or in the form of malpractice from injuries, d eath, or the escape of a client's animal. Under our judicial system the law of malpractice is an exte nsion of the law of negligence. According to Dr. James Wilson, JD \"in either case, to maintain the veterinary profession's integrity and to minimize the high costs associated with practicing defens ive medicine, practitioners must learn to avoid malpractice suits.\" Additionally, veterinarians mu st consider that many clients are not willing nor can they afford to pay the high costs of defensive medicine. How does the law define malpractice? Malpracti ce is \"the failure of a professional, such as a veterinarian, to perform services pursuant to the 'standard of care'.(Veterinary Malpractice) The standard of care is what other professionals in the same geographic region and with similar specialization within the same field would do under th e same circumstances. Therefore, the attorney for the plaintiff must prove that the animal ha d the specified condition, the veterinarian had a standard of care to take a certain action, the veterinarian did not take the action required by theAllied Academies International Conference page 27 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002standard of care, and the animal became ill or died as a result of the veterinarian's failure to take the required action. The burden of proof is upon the plai ntiff's attorney, as the defendant is presumed innocent. The first element to be proved is that the animal had the specified condition. This may be the easiest of the four to prove and is generally satisfied by submitting the patient's medical record asevidence. The American Veterinary Medical A ssociation recommends that each patient's medical record be documented according to a standard format referred to as S.O.A.P.ing the patient. Theacronym stands for subjective or the history supp lied by the owner, objective or the findings on the physical exam, assessment or the working diagnosis that may contain three or more diagnosis to be ruled out, and the plan or treatme nt. The assessment portion of the patient record can substantiate the first condition necessary to prove malpracti ce. If possible, a s econd opinion affirming the original veterinarian's diagnosis would provide support for the first element. The second essential element to prove is the standard of care that requires veterinarians to \"exercise the care and diligence as is ordinarily exercised by skilled veterinarians\" and must come from an admissible source of evidence.(Posni en v Rogers 1975, Ruden v Hansen 1973, & Brockett v Abbe 1964) The source may be an authoritative veterinary textbook or source of literature suchas a journal, or it may be a letter from another vete rinarian stating the standard of care. Courts may ask for evidence regarding the applicable standard of care from any of the following three places: the state's veterinary practice act, rules and regul ations adopted by the state board of veterinary examiners, and standards that have been establishe d by state or national veterinary associations like the AVMA and AAHA, American Animal Hospital A ssociation.(Wilson, James) An individual who is considered an expert in the field or is recogni zed as an authority will have greater credibility. If a letter is submitted as evidence it must contain the following: a statement establishing that the individual is a veterinarian in the same field of specialization and practices in the same general geographic location as the defendant; that he or she has reviewed the medical record completed bythe defendant for the owner's pet; that there is a st andard of care for the condition indicated; that the testifying veterinarian is familiar with the standard of care and that such standard requires specifiedtreatment; that the defendant's patient medical reco rd is void or absent of those treatments specified by the standard of care; that the animal would not have become ill or died had the standard of care been followed; and the failure of the defendant to treat the animal pursuant to the applicable standard of care constitutes veterinary malpractice. The di fficulty for the plaintiff is locating a veterinarian willing to testify against another veterinarian. Th e courts can be reluctant to apply the locale rule and some states are qualifying their own standard s by including additional phrases addressing locale. The state of North Carolina includes the phrase \"similarly situated\".(Williams v Reynolds 1980) The issue of \"skilled veterinarians\" is even more complicated and subjective. Medicine, in general, changes at a rapid rate and requires indivi duals within the profession to stay abreast of new techniques and advances. The failure of an individua l to continue one's education can lead to their failure to meet the standard of care. Veterinarian s can also be subject to a higher standard of care if they perform special procedures rather than refe rring the patient to a specialist. This area is highly controversial because geographic and financial factors effect owner's decisions in pet care. Traditionally, veterinarians are trained to provide care in all aspects of veterinary medicine becausespecialist were rare, but with technological and medi cal advances it is nearly impossible for a singlepage 28 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1veterinarian to master all areas of medicine. Veterinarians are used to doing it all, but in today's world this is very unrealistic. There are not enough hours in the day to read all the necessary journal articles or attend wet-labs to learn the techniques associated with new procedural and surgicaltechniques. These facts are forcing veterinarians to change their mentality about their profession. The third element requires proof that the veterinarian did not take the action required by the standard of care. Again, the patient's medical record will be needed as evidence to support what treatment was provided and determine whether or not it was consistent with the applicable treatment for the condition. The treatment is recorded in the Plan (P) section of the medical record documenting the patient's visit. When the standard of care in malpractice cases is applied it may be a case of omission of a medically indicated dia gnostic procedure or treatment, or the commission of an act that produces an undesired or adverse result. The fourth element is often the most problematic because of the inherent risks associated with veterinary medical procedures. It is necessary that the plaintiff prove the animal would nothave become ill or died if the standard of care were followed. In the cas e of death, a pathologist must perform a necropsy to determine the cause of death. In most cases the primary cause of death is reported to be failure of the heart to beat, th en the secondary factors are listed. Therefore, the pathologist must testify that all the secondary f actors are \"consistent with only one interpretation, namely the condition resulted from the failure of th e veterinarian to perform up to the standard of care\".(Veterinary Malpractice) In the event th at illness occurs but does not result in death the burden of proof is further complicated because ag ain the plaintiff must find a qualified veterinarian to testify as to the animal's condition, the applicab le standard of care, the required treatment, the treatment provided, and the illness resulting from treatment. In either case the expert testimony mustbe presented in such a manner to make it comprehensible for the layperson sitting on the jury, if thecase is before a jury rather than a judge. Each of the four elements is complicated and difficult to prove. The process can be expensive and frustrating. Therefore, the owner must weigh the expense of such an undertaking against the potential recovery. In so doing, the ow ner is best served by reviewing current case law in his or her state and region to determine if he or she will best be served by directly approaching the veterinarian for compensation, pursuing action in small claims court, or filing a civil suit. In addition to determining the state or regions hi story in malpractice cases, the plaintiff needs to consider the types of damages applicable to the case. Three basic types of damages can beawarded: nominal, compensatory, and punitive. In conjunction with these three types of damages,juries may consider special damage awards, cons equential, and general damages. Compensatory damages includes special damages and addresses the fair market value of the animal which can be determined by deposing expert witnesses who can tes tify as to the market for the type and species of animal in question. According to Favre and Loring's Animal Law, consequential damages can be in the form of expenses incurred in attempting to prevent the death and permanent disability of the animals (including veterinary fees); lost income while anim als are out of service; loss of use of the animal (e.g., as a stud or dam); or costs incurred search ing for a lost animal (e.g., expenses relating to attempts to find an animal that escapes a veterinary clinic or boarding facility including posters,Allied Academies International Conference page 29 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002classified ads, owner's trips to the pound, lost work time, and telephone expenses).(Favre DS, Loring Law 1983) Punitive damages are not limited to the market value of the pet and are awarded in addition to compensatory damages. Recoveries for punitive or exemplary damages are awarded \"only forthe willful, malicious, intentional, or fr audulent acts or for gross and wanton acts of negligence.\"(Hannah HW 1971) Although such dama ges are intended to punish the defendant and are not covered by professional liability insurance, they are difficult to prove. In Law and Ethics of the Veterinary Profession, James Wilson, DVM, JD defines general damages as \"those caused by and flowing naturally from the negligence of the defendant, likedamages in the form of pain and suffering or em otional distress.\"(Wilson) Prior to 1988 appellate courts had upheld such awards in only a few stat es, but more recently the courts have acknowledged the human-animal bond by imposing greater awards due to pain and suffering or emotional distress. The precedents vary in each jurisdiction, as do the damages awarded. Some courts, such asHawaii's, \"allow for recoveries absent bodily impact , the need for medical or psychiatric assistance, or the witnessing of the negligent action.\"(Campbe ll v Animal Quarantine Station 1981) At this time courts have yet to clearly define the criteria that might be used in determining the appropriate damages for situations involving the injury or loss of a pet. But courts have been affected by thecomparisons between heirlooms and pets in decidi ng damages. In a 1978 article of the UC Davis Law Review, the author argues that damages have been awarded for the emotional distress of the loss of an heirloom, therefore similar recoveries should be allowed for losses of or injuries to pets.(Mazor, D 1978) The legal precedent allowing recovery for lost items of sentimental valueshould extend to include companion animals. In the eyes of the owner, their companion has significant sentimental value that exceeds the market value historically associated with animals. The human-animal bond is the single element at the heart of most cases involving veterinary malpractice. Companion animal owners are fully aware that settlements and judgments can neither erase the wrongs already done nor bring back a now deceased companion, but they do wantveterinarians held accountable for their actions or inactions. Most importantly, companion animal owners want the bond they share with their furry companions acknowledged and respected. As a result, the veterinary profession and animal industrie s are experiencing a rise in cases naming them as defendants. On October 12, 1999, Jean Townsend filed a class action suit in Hampton County South Carolina against Pfizer, Incorporated for the wr ongful death of her beloved chocolate Labrador Retriever, George. The suit claims that Pfizer willfully misrepresented the known adverse reactions,specifically death, associated with their Non-st eroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) \"Rimadyl.\" The suit claims that Pfizer failed to sufficiently advise the veterinary profession of all the known adverse reactions, thus causing veterinarians to prescribe a potentially fatal pharmaceutical topatients without first evaluating liver and kidney values. Pfizer contends that the package insertclearly states the \"potential for fatal outcomes\" and that the number of known deaths directly associated to Rimadyl is less than 1%.(Jean Town send v Pfizer, Incorporated.) The case has yet to be settled or determined.page 30 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1CONCLUSION Until recently animals were viewed by our legal system as objects, the only arguable fact is what is the current fair market value. Fortunate ly, our society is changi ng and our judicial system is committed to representing the society. No l onger are animals objects; they are companions. Americans are bonded to their furry friends and many consider them children. This emotional attachment is becoming respect by our courts and owners are fighting for the rights of theircompanions on all legal fronts. New precedents are being set at amazing rates throughout the country with west coast systems setting the standard. Not only are owners fighting in the legal syst em and for new legislation to protect animal rights and enact stricter laws, but owners demand a higher quality medicine from their veterinarians. No longer can the veterinarian provide all the services needed, but it is not in his best interest to do so. With technological and medical advances there is a greater demand for specialist in veterinarymedicine. The general practitioner is held to the st andard of care of a specialist if he opts to provide such treatment. Therefore, the veterinarian must weigh the needs of the patie nt and the risk to his own profession before embarking upon a specialty service. Although many may argue that our legal system is being bogged down by cases that would best be settled out of the courts, the new challenges facing our system are setting tremendousprecedents that exemplify the bond shared by the human owner and the animal companion. Such new standards will improve the quality of medici ne provided by veterinarians and other animal industries. Allied Academies International Conference page 31 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002SAME SEX DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFITS J. Reagan McLaurin, American University of Sharjah David Snyder, Medical University of South Carolina A growing number of public and private sector employers today are offering health benefits to the same-sex domestic partners of employees as part of their total compensation packages. TheHuman Rights Campaign (HRC), a national organiza tion devoted to gay and lesbian issues, has compiled a database of nearly 3700 employers offering domestic partner health benefits (HumanRights Campaign). Of the companies represente d in the database, 122 are Fortune 500 companies, 100 are state and local governments, and 133 are colleges and universities. The rest are acombination of private sector for-profit and non-profit employers. HRC additionally cites a 1999 survey by The Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Education Trust that found that 18% of U.S. employers provided health benefits to domestic partners (Human Rights Campaign). This figure is up five percent from a survey by KPMG Peat Marwick in 1997 (Human Rights Campaign). Companies offer domestic partner benefits for two primary reasons. First, companies choose to offer domestic partner benefits as a competitive means of recruiting and retaining employees.Traditional benefit models use marriage as the de termining factor to extend benefits. As the definition of the American family changes, thes e older models do not provide a safety net for employees and their families. Companies are now modifying their benefit packages to encourageexisting employees to stay and to entice potential employees to join. The other reason for offering domestic partner be nefits is due to new legislation and court decisions (Kasten, Bruce J. and Edward J. Pisarcik 1998). Several courts in recent years haveinterpreted state nondiscrimination laws to mean that employers must provide benefits to the domestic partners of employees. These decisions have been made based primarily on laws thatprohibit discrimination based on marital status and sexual orientation. The purpose of this paper is to examine the development of case law around the issue of domestic partner benefits provided by public employe rs. The development of this area of law centers on the threshold question of whether a public employer is obligated to offer domestic partner benefits if state legislation prohi bits discrimination based on marital status, sex or sexual orientation. \"Domestic partner,\" for this paper, means a same-s ex, spousal equivalent. Benefits for opposite-sex, unmarried partners are not discussed. The discussion of private sector employer obligation is omitted due to the pre-emptive effect of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (or ERISA). ERISA is a body of federal regulation that governs voluntarily established empl oyee benefit plans of private sector employers (United States Department of Labor 2001). Its purpos e is to set standards for employee benefit plans to ensure they are fair and financially sound. Benefits such as pensions and health insurance arecovered. Because ERISA does not mandate benefits , private sector companies are not required by ERISA to offer benefits for domestic partners or otherwise. In addition, since no federal law prohibits discrimination based on marital status or sexual orientation, ERISA does not requirepage 32 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1benefits to be equally available for classifications other than those covered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Finally, ERISA does not regul ate the benefit plans of public employers. The findings of this paper are based on cas e summaries, court opinions and articles found on the issue of domestic partner benefits. It examines several essential cases that have beenidentified as having a significant impact on th e development of case law around the issue of domestic partner benefits. Because the developmen t of case law for domestic partner benefits has evolved in the past five to ten years, they are re latively new and seem to have relevance in today's work environment. The development of case law around the issue of domestic partner benefits has been a confusing and perplexing path. Over the past five to ten years, numerous cases have arisen out of requests from public employees, particularly public university employees, to include their domestic partners on their health coverage benefits. These benefits are typically available to the legallymarried spouses of employees. They have not been so easily obtained by either same-sex orunmarried, opposite-sex partners. Unfortunately, there has been no decisive case to lead the wayin answering the question of obligation among public employers to provide domestic partnerbenefits. The examination of this issue begins at the federal level. There have been no cases brought before the federal circuit courts or Supreme Cour t to explore this question. One reason for this is there are no federal laws or regulations that prohibit employment discrimination based on either sexual orientation or marital status. Because of this, state and local governments have been left to draft nondiscrimination legislation that includes these classifications as protected classes. Thesecases are then tackled within the state court system. There have been efforts over the pass twenty years or so by the U.S. Congress to pass legislation that would amend Title VII of the Ci vil Rights Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation (Bagley, Constance E.). Currently, protection fr om employment discrimination is extended based on race, religion, national origin, sex, age and di sability (Human Rights Campaign). The latest attempt to include sexual orientation manifested in the form of a bill called the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. Even if this legislation were to pass, though, the terms of the act state that \"it does not apply to the provision of employee bene fits to an individual for the benefit of the domestic partner of such individual.\" (Employment Nondiscrimination Act) This has also been the case with many state laws attempting to provide equal rights protections. The problem with leaving this issue to be a ddressed solely by the states is the variety of forms in which legislature-authored nondiscriminati on laws come. In addition, various state trial and appellate courts enforce legislation based on the character of the court. This has producedmixed results that contribute to the lack of one decisive case. The most striking example of this variability was two cases settled simultaneously in March 1997. Both of these cases attempted to use state law that prohibits discrimination based on marital status to answer the threshold question of obligation. The first case was Rutgers Council of AAUP Chap ters v. Rutgers State University. In 1992, five employees of Rutgers State University app lied to enroll their same-s ex domestic partners as dependents in the New Jersey Stat e Health Benefits Pl an (SHBP). Their application was denied based on the opinion of the Deputy Attorney Genera l that same-sex domestic partners could not beAllied Academies International Conference page 33 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002considered eligible dependents under New Jersey la w. The employees filed a complaint against the State and the case was eventually heard before the New Jersey Appellate Court. They alleged the denial of domestic partner benefits violate of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD) which prohibits marital status and sexual orienta tion discrimination; violated an executive order from New Jersey's governor which banned sexua l orientation discrimination within state government; and violated the right to equal protection under the New Jersey Constitution. Basedon these claims, it was the position of the plaintiffs that the term \"dependent\" should be construedto \"include domestic partners who are the functi onal equivalent of spouses.\" (Rutgers Council of AAUP Chapters v. Rutgers State University 1997) The court unanimously denied all the claims fo r domestic partner benefits. In delivering its opinion, the court recognized that it had considered the changing definition of \"family\" in recent cases to decide whether unmarried domestic partners, both gay and straight, should be treated asdependents or family. The presiding judge went on to say, however, that \"in dealing with statutory and contract interpretation, we have not been disposed to expanding plain language to fit more contemporary views of family and intimate relati onships.\" (Rutgers Council of AAUP Chapters v. Rutgers State University) The appellate court cited that the SHBP Act presents in clear language thathealth insurance may be extended only to legal s pouses of state employees and unmarried dependent children under the age of twenty-three. In taking this view, the court went on to provide a brief history of same-sex marriage litigation to demonstrate that the court has rec ognized no such a union. Additionally, the court noted that same-sex partners were not the only couples excluded from marrying. Since cousins, siblings or anyone else related too closely by blood were not allowed to marry they were therefore excluded from obtaining spousal benefits. The court then app lied this reasoning to the issue of the plaintiffs' claim of discrimination based on marital status and sexual orientation. After noting that theplaintiffs were required to show intentional disc rimination in such a claim, the court found no reason to believe the legislative body that authored the SHBP Act had intentionally discriminated againstgays and lesbians. It had excluded, however, a larger category of couples that could not marry andtherefore could not qualify for spousal benefits. In University of Alaska v. Tumeo, the court t ook a different approach to reviewing the claim of discrimination based on marital status. Again, in this case, two university employees applied to enroll their same-sex domestic partners in the stat e's health insurance plan. The university denied their applications stating that the self-insured plan did not allow coverage for domestic partners. The question before the court was whether the denial violated Alaska's Human Rights Act, which bars employment discrimination based on marital status . This court took the stance that by providing health coverage for married employees and not for unmarried employees, the university wascompensating married employees to a greater exte nt. Therefore, by \"using marital status as a classification for determining which of its employ ees will receive additional compensation . . . [the university was violating] state laws prohibiting mar ital status discrimination.\" (University of Alaska v. Tumeo 1997) The court did not fo cus on the definition of dependent , as did the New Jersey court. There was one complicating factor in University of Alaska that could potentially moot the court's finding, however. After the original trial court ruled in favor of the university employees, the Alaska legislature amended its Human Rights Act by inserting a clause that exempted claimspage 34 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1based on employee benefits. The Alaska legisl ature amended the Human Rights Act to read: \"Notwithstanding the prohibition against employmen t discrimination on the basis of marital status or parenthood . . ., an employer may, without violating this chapter, provide greater health andretirement benefits to employees who have a spouse and dependent children than are provided toother employees.\" (Leonard, Arthur S. 1997) De spite this action, the Alaska Supreme Court continued its examination because it found ther e was still a live controversy surrounding the case. Because of the legislature's actions , the result of this case may not ha ve the impact it could have had on similar cases in the future. Another reason for the ruling in the Rutgers cas e was an existing exemption clause in New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination. The court held that while the law indeed prohibiteddiscrimination against an employee because of ma rital status or sexual orientation, it nonetheless, provided an exception for employee benefit and in surance programs. The court noted that the authors of this legislation had seemingly anticipated a claim of this type by explicitly stating,\"nothing contained in this act . . . shall be construe d . . . to interfere with the operation of the terms or conditions and administration of any bona fide retirement, pension, employe e benefit or insurance plan or program.\" (Leonard, Arthur S.) In the benchmark case Tanner v. Oregon Health Sciences University, the appellate court of Oregon made a drastic departure from the decision of Rutgers. The court decreed that denial ofhealth benefits to same-sex domestic partners was a violation of both the Oregon Civil Rights Law and the equal protection provision of Oregon's Constitution. Unlike Rutgers or University of Alaska, this judgment was made on the prohib ition of employment discrimination based on sex. This departure was due, in part, to the unique la nguage of Oregon's Civil Ri ghts Law. The law goes further than \"banning discrimination based on the sex of an employee. [It also] bans discrimination based on the sex 'of any other person with whom the individual associates.'\" (Leonard, Arthur S. 1999) The court interpreted this provision to incl ude a prohibition of disc rimination based on sexual orientation. Unfortunately, another provision of the Civil Rights Law exem pts bona fide employee benefit plans from discrimination claims, as seen earlier. Therefore, the judge could not make a judgment solely on this provision. The court then turned to the constitutional claim of the case. Again, unlike the equal protection provisions of the federal constitution or most state constitutions, Oregon's constitutionstates that no citizen or class of citizens shall be granted privileges or immunities that are not equally provided to everyone. (Leonard, Arthur S.) Th e court concluded the classification of sexual orientation was an \"inherently suspect\" classificati on under the \"level of scrutiny\" test of Oregon's constitution. Based on this reasoning, the court furthe r concluded that the state violated the Oregon constitution by not providing benefits to one \"class of citizens\" that it provided to another. In other words, by not compensating gay employees with domes tic partners to the same extent as straight, married employees the state violated the \"privileges and immunities\" clause of its constitution. More and more cities, counties and public entities across the U.S. are implementing domestic partner benefit programs. They have created th ese programs as a means of employee retention and recruitment. Some of these employers are located in the southern states sometimes referred to as the Bible Belt. Atlanta, GA; Broward County and Gainesville, FL; and Chapel Hill, NC are a few public employers located in this region. In add ition, cities such as Madison, WI; Denver, CO; andAllied Academies International Conference page 35 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002Chicago, IL are some employers located in the mid-western region. Religious conservatives have attacked these programs as immoral and illegal. For the most part, however, these benefit programs have withstood attacks in court and continue to pr ovide the safety net for which they were intended. Court cases in Atlanta, GA and Madison, WI have shown that public employers do not overstep their legal boundaries by extending health benefits to the domestic partners of employees. Public employers and employees have also successfully used collective bargaining agreements to provide domestic partner benefits. As with bona fide state benefit plans, collective bargaining agreements must specifically state that benefits will be extended to the domestic partners of employees and they must clearly define spouse or dependent. In the conclusion of the Rutgers opinion, the court suggested that collective bargai ning agreements could be one means of obtaining domestic partner benefits. Though private sector obligation is omitted from th is report, it is worth noting that the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals is currently deciding the fate of a San Francisco ordinance that affects private sector employers. The Equal Benefit Ordi nance requires contractors doing business with the city to provide the same benefit considerations to unmarried, domestic partners as they give to the legally married spouses of employees (Kasten & Pisa rcik). This requirement lasts for the duration of the employment contract. U.S. District Court Judge Claudia Wilken ruled in Air Transport Association of America v. City of San Francisco (Air Transport A ssociation of America v. City and County of San Francisco 1998) that the ordinance can apply to non-ERISA-regulated benefits such as bereavement leave, sick leave and vacations (Fried, Rinat 1999). This case is especially worthwatching since Seattle and Los Angeles passed si milar ordinances in 1999 (Cenicerso, Roberto 1999). If successful, other cities across the country could begin to implement comparableordinances. Some speculate that these ordina nces could possibly \"withstand an ERISA challenge by arguing that they are not requiring all employers to provide domestic partner benefits, only those who want to do business with the city.\" (Ceniceros, Roberto) SUMMARY & CONCLUSION The threshold question is whether public employers are obligated to provide domestic partner benefits when state laws prohibit discrimination based on marital status, sex, or sexual orientation. In this examination, four broad issues arise: ther e is no federal precedent to answer this question, there has been no uniform approach to the app lication of nondiscrimination laws, nondiscrimination laws often have benefit exemption clauses, and state civil rights laws and constitutions are phrased such that cases have little application in other juri sdictions. Each of these issues has provided results that are a bit bewildering rather than bringing the issue into sharper focus. The cases, while important to the development of case law, provide no clear path in answering the question of whether public employe rs are obligated to provide domestic partner benefits to employees. The claim of discrimina tion based on marital status and sexual orientation in states where civil rights laws include these classifications, have been restrained by benefit exemption clauses and restrictive language with which these laws are phrased. In addition, theoutcome of each case has been subject to the charact er of the court and the direction in which the court searches for answers. The \"frontier ethos\" of the West Coast seems to propel courts to rulepage 36 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1in favor of expanding civil rights legislation to provide domestic partner benefits, while the East Coast remains more conservative and reluctant to such expansion. Finally, decisions made in onestate court are limited to their application in other jurisdictions. Future cases are likely to providean equally mixed bag of results until a strong, decisive case is brought before the federal court system. The immediate reality is that Americans will conti nue to struggle with this issue. States and municipalities will continue to author and implement nondiscrimination legislation as well as tooffer domestic partner benefit programs. For the time being, such legislation and benefit programs seem to be the best response until a decisive cas e is provided. For the l ong run, amended state and federal legislation is needed to clear up the c onfusion when analyzing the question of obligation. This is particularly true concerning the confusion that comes from existing definitions of spouse and dependent in state benefit plans. These benefit plans were written in a time when it wasinconceivable to foresee such a broad definition of the family. New legislation and benefit programs should consider this to avoid future litigation.Allied Academies International Conference page 37 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002NAVIGATING THE LEGAL MINEFIELDS IN NICHE MAIL ORDER BUSINESSES: MARKETING LAW PRIMER FOR CATALOG RETAILERS AND E-TAILERS David M. Savino, Ohio Northern University Dexter R. Woods, Ohio Northern University Lee B. Savino, Ohio Northern University ABSTRACT Modern mail order businesses serve their customers through a variety of traditional and innovative marketing practices. This paper applies the discipline of marketing law to discuss a variety of legal trade requirements for niche (special product) mail order businesses at the local,national, and international levels. The paper discu sses legal marketing issues relating to product development, promotion, distribution, and sale, and also discusses including emerging marketing cyberlaw. INTRODUCTION We live in an era where various forces have helped reshape American and world economies in terms of structure and use of resources of business operations. While many of the \"old guard\" businesses still exist in today's economy, many of these traditional business entities either had toalter their level of operations or search for alternative methods to produce and/or sell goods tosurvive. The recession seen in the United States tw o decades ago to a great degree eliminated the large, inefficient elements in the manufacturing sector while sending warning signals to variousservice sector operations such as retailers. Wh ether because of economic realities, changes in technology, the recent terrorist attacks of Sept ember 11 (Del Franco, 2001), or the changes in consumer buying patterns, much current retail marke ting is in the form of mail order cataloging and e-tailing operations by the small business community. By some estimates, as far back as 1995roughly 40 percent of the gross national product was comprised from the small business sector with about 4 percent of the population seriously considering the development of a small businessenterprise (Bursey, 1995). In addition, in spite of the burst of the popularity of e-commerce stocks, the actual practice of e-tailing is on the rise, especially those firms who were traditionally thebrick-and-mortar only retailers of the past. Tr aditional retailers and many newer small businesses find it hard to ignore the obvious fact that e-tailing offers new ways to sell to the consumer (Ferriolo, 2000) and that the National Retail Foundation reports that total online spending averaged about $3 billion a month during the year 2000 (Abend, 2000). All these reports indicate that niche marketi ng is increasing in every conceivable commodity from the traditional pharmaceutical industry with mail order prescriptions and \"online drugs\" tospecialty products of interest to large consumer constituencies. In fact, some organizations havepage 38 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1reported that the use of mail order and e-comme rce have significantly changed their mode of operations and their marketing strategies. For example, one pharmacist, once an independent drug store owner, closed his business to conduct a much more lucrative and successful mail orderbusiness (Ukens, 1996). GROWTH OF MICRO-SPECIALISTS, NICHE CATALOGS, AND LEGAL PROBLEMS Micro-specialist marketing to niche areas that were once thought of as merely interesting potentialities are now being aggressively undertaken. Companies specializing in narrow and deepassortments of specific categories have been gain ing consumer support, especially those who have gone public and become leaders in their sub-categories (Doolittle, 1998). However, with all thesuccesses and rewards of being in a rapidly growi ng segment of the retailing sector comes the reality of being competitive while simultaneously abiding by the legal standards at various levels of the economy. The naive notion of not knowing the legal imp lications is not acceptable and can easily kill a successful enterprise. For example, whether its mail order sales of alcohol to minors (Girard, 1997)or trying to sell restricted products such as radar detectors in Virginia, hearing enhancementproducts in California, or alcoholic beverage s in Vermont and New Hampshire (Dowling, 1995), specialty catalogers not aware of certain legal restrictions on their products have paid severepenalties. MARKETING LAW PRIMER AND APPLICATION Navigation of marketing law requires some knowledge of the law and also the ability to apply the law to a particular enterprise. Accordingly, the following paragraphs set forth basiccomponents of marketing law and concurrently apply the law to an example niche catalogretailer/e-tailer of gifts for professionals (e.g. doctors). This paper considers only marketing law issues , which are those legal issues most directly involved in developing, promoting, distributing, and selling a product. Such legal issues arise from a variety of state, national, and international la ws and many involve emergi ng issues of cyberlaw, which is law governing the use of computers and th e Internet (Ferrera, Lichtenstein, Reder, August & Schiano, 2001). This paper does not discuss gene rally non-marketing legal issues such as choice of entity, capitalization, licenses/permits, zoning, taxes, insurance, and hiring personnel. With respect to developing and promoting a pr oduct, niche businesses must not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of other businesses, and they must establish and protect their ownintellectual property rights. For example, a new business with a new name must avoid infringingupon the rights of other businesses by searching corpor ate filings and fictitious name filings in states and/or counties so as to not use a name deceptively similar to existing names. Moreover, thebusiness should search the United States Patent and Trademark Office website (http://www.uspto.gov) to determine name and product availability under federal law. Onlinetrademark searches are available with the Tradem ark Electronic Search System (TESS), and online patent searches are also available for full text a nd page image databases. E-tailers must find andAllied Academies International Conference page 39 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002reserve a domain name for their web site via the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Because the Internet is international, e-tailers must also consider possible infringement and protection of intellectual property at the international level. Businesses can protect their names or products via patent, copyright, and trademark protection. Patents give inventors exclusive right s to make, use, or sell useful novel products or processes. A U.S. patent generally takes at leas t eighteen months and costs thousands of dollars to obtain. To be protected internationally, an inventor has to file in individual countries. Copyrights generally give owners of creative works the right to preclude others from using the works without permission for the life of the author plus seventy years. Copyrights occur automatically, but authors gain further rights with a copyright notice (\u00a9 or Copyright, Year, Author) and even further rights with a copyright registration with the C opyright Office (http://www.loc.gov/copyright/). International copyright protection exists for signa tories of the Berne Convention, which recognizes copyrights of other signatory countries, but enfo rcement mechanisms are weak. Some businesses would rather attempt to maintain a trade secret in stead of registering their product. With respect to the marketer of professional gifts, the idea of the business itself would not be patentable or copyrightable. However, the pa per catalog and web pages of the business would be automatically copyrighted and could be afforded greater pr otection with a copyright notice and a copyright registration. Information (including product name) in marketers' catalog and web pages are critical to product promotion and may be trademarkable. Tr ademarks are words, symbols, sounds, smells, or anything else companies use to distinguish their goods and services from others. Generally,trademark ownership in the U.S. is by senior use. However, registration helps prove senior use and permits federal legal action. A registered mark is designated with the \u00ae. An unregistered trademarkor service mark can be designated with TM or SM. International law differs with respect totrademarks in that ownership is determined not by fi rst to use, but instead by first to register, in each particular country. The profe ssional gift business could register its name and any other distinguishing marks, or at least employ the TM sy mbol. The business must not violate other marks or copyrights. For example, the business could not use in its catalog or se ll as part of its products depictions or reproductions of the profession done by prior creators unless the copyright has expired or the copyright owner has granted permission. Also, the business should obtain signed releases from persons who serve as models for the catalog. The business' Internet catalog similarly should not use copyrighted or trademarked images and al so should not use links to or banners of other companies without permission so as to imply a false association betwee n businesses (Oswald, 2002). Marketing laws protect not only intellectual pr operty rights of owners in the development and promotion of products, but numerous state, fede ral, and international laws protect consumers from the improper marketing of products. The federal Lanham Act protects both business competitors and consumers by prohibiting busine sses from passing off or palming off other businesses' products as their own. It also prohib its unfair commercial disparagement of competitors' products and other types of false advertising. Similarly, the Federal Trade Commission prohibitsunfair or deceptive acts or practices, and issues ge neral guides on topics such as substantiation, bait advertising, deceptive pricing, use of the word s \"free\" and \"sale\", warranty disclosures, endorsements and testimonials, and \"green marketi ng\" (product environment claims). The FTC alsopage 40 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1issues specific guides on particular products such as dietary supplements, eye care surgery, food advertising, jewelry, furniture, and vocational/distance learning. Moreover, the FTC has specificmail order rules about shipping times, delay notifications, refunds, cancellations, and customerrescissions (FTC & DMA, 2002). Finally, the FTC has special regulations on advertising and the Internet, which state that the previous guides also apply to Internet advertising and specially mention privacy issues, including the collection and usage of customer information (FTC, 2002). Use of the Internet makes any business international, and subs equently susceptible to international privacy law, such as the European Union Data Protection Di rective (Baumer and Poindexter, 2002). Countries may also have packaging and labeling requireme nts, including bilingual re quirements. Internet advertisements also expose companies to state regulations, such as those against unsolicited email(spam). Nevada, Washington, and California have such laws, with California's law, for example, providing for no unsolicited email and requiring adver tisements to contain em ail headers with \"adv.\" Each violation of the California law subjects o ffenders to civil remedies and possible criminal remedies of a $1,000 fine and six months' imprisonment (Steingold, 2001). Businesses also need to know marketing law that regulates the distribution and sale of products. In distributing products, marketers must be aware of antitrust and franchise laws forparticular selling arrangements. In selling products, companies need to know what constitutes abinding contract, what type of pa yment to accept, who bears the risk of shipping loss, what express and implied warranties are present, how to redu ce product liability, and how to resolve disputes. Each of these questions raises further questions. For example, does a contract become binding when a customer places an automated telephone order or when the business ships the product? Should the business accept cash, credit cards (with the attendant 3-5% fees), and/or personal checks (with bad check risks)? Does the seller have to collect and remit sales or use tax (Keup, 1993)? Who bears the risk of loss if a shipped product gets lost or destroyed? Who should the business ship with and should it purchase shipping insurance? What warra nties should be offered, or should all warranties (including those that would otherwise be implied) be disclaimed? Which states (e.g. Connecticut, Kansas, and California) preclude standard discla imers (Steingold, 2001)? What is the exposure for product liability in each state and internationa lly? How can product liability, including strict liability in the U. S. European Union, and Japan) be minimized? For example, should certainprofessional gifts (such as profession-related beany- type bears or various types of decorative pieces) be labeled as not suitable for young children or as not suitable for functional use? Does the law of the state or the country of the seller or of th e buyer apply, and where would a lawsuit take place? What are other ways to resolve disputes, including ways to resolve Internet disputes (Miller & Jentz, 2002)? The marketer needs to consider all of th ese questions, and more, in distributing and selling its product. CONCLUSION Even small, niche marketers must concern th emselves with a plethora of state, national, international and Internet marketing laws in order to minimize legal liability. The paper has presented an overview of such laws along with a pplying the laws to a typical niche marketer who sells via direct mail catalogs and Internet e-tailing.Allied Academies International Conference page 41 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002REFERENCES Abend, J., (2000).

When such a situation arises, one party to thecourtship or engagement may seek to recover gifts of money or property previously given to the other party, requiring a legal determination of the partie s' respective rights in the money or property.\" 1 ABSTRACT Business law/legal environment professors frequently and successfully use engagement ring disputes in the classroom to illustrate several important legal concepts, including rights in personal property, conditional gifts and transfers, contract s involving a promise to marry, ava ilability of various legal and equitable remedies, and federal ta x implications of property transfers. Equally important, students relate well to the subject matter, perhaps because it is closer to their lifeexperience, and appreciate being appraised of the ne w, no-fault developments in the field. Hence, the authors of this article re-examined the topi c of engagement gifts, and discovered a marvelous niche of interwoven and evolving legal concepts t hat can successfully be used throughout a business law/legal environment course to provide students a rich learning experience. The article begins with a hypothetical situa tion involving a controversy between a formerly engaged couple fighting over ownership of a val uable engagement ring, as well as other presents given during their courtship. The hypothetical is a composite of several leading cases resolving engagement gift disputes, and should generate lively student discussion. Thereafter, questions areposed that (1) explore the principal legal theories employed by courts in resolving engagement gift quarrels, (2) examine how the outcome may change as the circumstances of the parties vary (for example, if one the engaged parties dies before the marriage can take place, is a minor, or ismarried to someone else at the time of their engagement), (3) assess the impact of so-called \"Heartbalm Laws\" on engagement gift lawsuits, (4) investigate the possibility of third-party rights to engagement gifts, (5) probe the impact of the parties' marital status, capacity, and wrongfulconduct in recovering courtship gifts, and (6) exami ne the federal tax consequences of engagement gifts. 1 Elaine Marie Tomko, J.D., Rights in Respect of Engagement and Courtship Presents When Marriage Does Not Ensue, 44 A.L.R.5th 1 (1996).page 44 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1Allied Academies International Conference page 45 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002HAM v. DELOITTE: SELF-REGULATION IN THE ACCOUNTING INDUSTRY IS CALLED INTO QUESTION Edward J. Schoen, Rowan University Stephanie Weidman, Rowan University Phillip Lewis, Rowan University Diane Hughes, Rowan University ABSTRACT In recent years, major public accounting firms have experienced a significant increase of malpractice claims, as disappointed investors s eek deeper pockets from wh ich they hope to gain compensation for investment losses. While such litigation is not cause for surprise, the manner in which the major accounting firms pooled their malpractice insurance coverage certainly was.Equally surprising was the disclosure that execu tive officers from the largest public accounting firms routinely consulted on, and routinely refrained from becoming expert witnesses in, malpracticecases pending against them. The disclosure of this conduct, which raises several significant issues related to the legal, professional and ethical responsibilities of public accounting firms, surfacedduring the litigation of an intentional interference with contractual relations claim brought by aformer partner in one \"Big Five\" public accounting firm against another \"Big Five\" public accounting firm and its general counsel. The issues that emerged during the litigation and are explored in this article are: (1) the professional and ethical responsibilities of the \"big-five\" public accounting firms in renderingauditing and consulting services to clients and the success of the accounting profession to regulate itself, (2) the implications of cooperative, info rmation-sharing contacts among executive officers of the large public accounting firms undertaken to mi nimize liability for, and malpractice insurance fees covering, negligently rendered accounting services, (3) the legal obligations imposed onprofessionals employed by accounti ng firms and the elements that must be proved to establish a claim for negligently rendered accounting serv ices, and (4) the overlapping web of professional responsibilities as public accounting firms employ staff from more than one professional field. In order to make the informati on most useful to business facu lty, the factual scenario that emerged during the litigation, gleaned from the numerous depositions and discovery documentssubmitted to the court, is provided initially. Thereafter, specific questions addressing the abovenoted issues are posed and answered by the authors of this article.page 46 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1Allied Academies International Conference page 47 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002SUPREME COURT TO STATE EMPLOYEES, \"GET OFF THE BUS!\" John W. Yeargain, Southeastern Louisiana University ABSTRACT Beginning in 1996 with the Seminole Tribe of Fl orida case the United States Supreme Court has used the Eleventh Amendment of the U.S. C onstitution to deprive state employees of rights granted to them by federal statutes to sue their state employers in federal courts. So far the court has declared that state employees may not use federal courts to protect them from their home states'governments in areas such as overtime pay, age discrimination, and disabilities. Seven of the federalcircuit courts of appeal have held the same rule applies to family medical leave. Only one of the federal circuits has dared to be different on family medi cal leave. If one goes back to the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, an 1896 decision in which the court declared separate but equal wasconstitutional if based on race, language very simila r to the current court holdings against state employees can be found. It is ironic that most of these cases are five to four decisions and that the extra vote needed to support this new creation of second class citizen is Justice Clarence Thomas. INTRODUCTION In 1991, the Seminole Tribe sued Florida and its governor alleging that Florida had refused to negotiate gaming activities in a tribal-state compact. Florida moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that the suit violated its sovereign immunity from suit in federal court. When the districtcourt denied the motion, Florida took an interlocut ory appeal. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court and held Flor ida immune from suit. Seminole Tribe took writs to the Supreme Court which it granted. The question to be answered was did the Eleventh Amendment prevent Congress from authorizing Indian tribes to sue states to enforce rights granted to the tribes by federal statutes passed under the Indian Commerce Clause? The court's answer by that five tofour vote was yes. The Eleventh Amendment reads: \"The Judici al power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\" Notice there is no mention of Indian tribes or citizens of the same state in the amendment. But at the beginning of the opini on written by the Chief Justice it is noted that \"we have understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but for the presupposition ... which it confirms\" that each state is a sovereign entity under our federal system and that a sovereign may not be sued by an individual without its consent ( Seminole, 1996). But Congress can abrogate the states' immunity from suit. The test the court applies is two pronged. First, did Congress clearly express its intent to abrogate the immunity. Second, didpage 48 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1Congress have the power under the Constitution to do so. The court agr eed that Congress had clearly abrogated the states' immunity from suit in the act by permitting the tribes to go into federal district court if the state refused to negotiate a compact. The second prong of the test Congress failed to meet. The only provisions of the Constitution that the court had held authorized Congress toabrogate states' immunity from suit are the Four teenth Amendment wherein section 5 provides that \"Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropr iate legislation, the provisions of this article,\" and the Interstate Commerce Clause. It was this latter holding that the current court was ready to overrule, thereby ignoring stare decisis . In 1989, in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. five justices had found that the Interstate Commerce Clause granted Congress the power to abrogate statesovereign immunity. But because only four justi ces had signed one opinion and Justice White had been the fifth vote in a separate opinion in which he wrote that he did not agree with the reasoning of the other four but concurred in their holding, the Chief Justice used this split to call it a pluralityholding and got the previously mentioned four justi ces to join him in overturning this precedent. The four justices that had dissented in the case were Scalia joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist andJustices O'Connor and Kennedy. And now they had their fifth vote in Justice Thomas. Thus, with this case the court removed Congress' authority to abrogate state immunity from suit under any of its Article I powers. STATE EMPLOYEE CASES Three years after its decision in Seminole Tribe the court faced a case dealing with a group of state prison guards who had not been paid overtime by their employer, the state of Maine. The employees had originally sued in federal district court in Maine. But while the suit was pending, the court issued its opinion in Seminole Tribe . Based on that holding, the district court dismissed the suit. The employees then filed a suit in state court. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) which required workers to be paid overtime also au thorized private actions against states in their own courts. In the case of Alden v. Maine, the state district court dismissed the suit on sovereign immunity ground and the Maine Supreme Judicial Court affirmed. The employees took writs to theSupreme Court. In an opinion wr itten by Justice Kennedy with the same justices concurring as in the Seminole Tribe case, the court held that while it was clear that Congress intended to abrogate the states' immunity from suit when it passed the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Eleventh Amendment and the very basis of dual soverei gnty between the states and federal governments prevented Congress from doing so. The powers delegated to Congress under Article I of the UnitedStates Constitution did not include the power to s ubject nonconsenting states to private suits for damages in state courts. Further, Maine had not consented to suits for overtime pay and liquidateddamages under the statute in question ( Alden , 1999). The following year the Supreme Court was faced with a series of cases involving state employees who had sued their employers under th e Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) as amended. Three sets of employees filed suit seeking monetary damages. In all cases the respective state employer moved to dismiss on the basis of its Eleventh Amendment immunity. One district court granted the motion to dismiss and th e other two denied the motion. All three appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which consolidated the cases and held that the ADEA didAllied Academies International Conference page 49 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002not validly abrogate the states' Eleventh Ame ndment immunity. The Supreme Court held by the same five members as in the Alden case that Congre ss did not have the power to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity because it had not provided sufficient evidence in its reportedhearings of widespread states' abuse of employees based on age. This time it was Justice O'Connor who wrote the majority opinion. She noted that the previous year the court had reaffirmed the central holding of Seminole Tribe in Alden , which was now a firmly established precedent, that if th e ADEA was based solely on Congress' Article I commerce power, then private petiti oners, such as the state employees, could not sue their state employers. However, the court recognized Congr ess' power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment: \"The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, theprovisions of this article,\" to abrogate the stat es' sovereign immunity. But while Congress had the power to enforce restrictions on the states under the amendment, it was the court's power to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation ( Kimel , 2000). The court used its congruence and proportionality test in analyzing Section 5, Fourteenth Amendment issues to see if the congressional hearings leading up to the passage of the ADEA established a pervasive abuse by the states of employees based on age. The court concl uded that the hearings had not done so. Therefore, the ADEA was not appropriate legislation under Se ction 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Age discrimination, wrote O'Connor, was not a suspect classification like race or gender. Thus, states could discriminate based on age without violating the Equal Protection Clause of the FourteenthAmendment if the age classification was rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The very next term the cour t faced cases dealing with T itle I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Writing for the fringe five, Chief Justice Rehnquist in a relatively short opinion, held that Alabama employees could not recover monetary damages due to the state's failure to adhere to the provisions of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act because the Eleventh Amendment prevented such actions. One of the plaintiffs, Ms. Garrett, had a position as Director of Nursing at the University of Alab ama in Birmingham Hospital. In 1994 she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a lumpectom y, radiation, and chemotherapy. Because of her course of treatment, she took leave from work. U pon returning to work in July 1995, her supervisor informed her she would have to give up her directorship. She then applied for and was given a transfer to a lower paying job as nurse manager. Ms. Garrett filed suit in federal district court against Alabama seeking money damages under the ADA. Alabama moved for summary judgmenton the basis that the ADA exceeded Congress' power to abrogate its Eleventh Amendmentimmunity. The district court granted the state's moti on. On appeal the Eleventh Circuit held that the ADA validly abrogated Alabama's Eleventh Amendment immunity. The Supreme Court grantedcertiorari to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeal on whether a person could sue a state formoney damages in federal court under the ADA. The Chief Justice went through the usual steps in thwarting Congress's attempt to make laws with uniform application throughout the United St ates. He noted the Eleventh Amendment while not mentioning suits brought by citizens against thei r own states had been extended to cover such suits by the courts prior holdings, such as in Kimel and Seminole Tribe of Florida . Congress could make states subject to suit in federal court if it validly exercised its power under section five of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, to do so, Congr ess had to prove by its official hearings andpage 50 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1reports \"a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end\" ( Garrett , 2001). It was up to the court to decide whether Congress had adequately identified in its hearings and reports a history and pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by the states against the disabled. Congress had to establish a record of wide-spread abuse by a number of states to va lidly exercise its section five authority. The court believed the record of congressional hearings on the ADA fa iled to prove a pattern of irrational state discrimination against the disabled in state employment. The last group of cases to come before the fe deral Courts of Appeal, although not before the Supreme Court, are those involving state employees suing for money damages under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1987 (FMLA). Seven circuits, the first, second, third, fifth, sixth, eighth, and eleventh, have held that the FMLA was not pr operly passed by Congress under its Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment power ( Hibbs , 2001). The one dissenter has been the ninth circuit. In the case of Hibbs v. HDM Department of Human Resources et al. , a three judge panel unanimously held that Congress had validly exercised its Section fi ve power when it permitted state employees to sue their state employers in federal district court to enforce their rights under FMLA. FMLA does have four subparts and the panel noted that all of the other circuits that had held the opposite had either been looking at other subparts or had not made it clear which subparts they were addressing. Only the Fifth Circuit in Kazmier v. Mary Widmann had addressed the subpart which the Ninth Circuit panel was reviewing. That panel had reached th e opposite conclusion of the Ninth. The subpart at issue was the right of an employ ee to take up to twelve weeks of uncompensated leave to care for a sick spouse, parent, or child (Section 2612(a)(1)(C)). Hibbs had sued the Nevada Department of Human Resources for violations of FMLA. He had received permission to take leave to care for his sick spouse. Evidentially, he had sufficient accumulated leave available for paid leave. He then thought he would be able to take an additional twelve weeks of unpaid leave unde r FMLA. His employer disagreed and terminated Hibbs after a hearing. Hibbs then filed suit in federal district court against his state agency. Nevada moved forsummary judgment which was granted on the federal cl aims. Hibbs appealed to the ninth circuit. The panel held that Congress had clearly intended to abrogate the states Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court and that FMLA was va lidly enacted under Congress' section five power. The panel noted that whereas the Supreme Court cas es dealing with age and disability only required a rational basis test, FMLA dealt with gender di scrimination which required a heightened scrutiny test. The Supreme Court test for Section five was the congruence and proportionality test. The panelbelieved that it could look at more than just the r ecord developed in Congressional hearings. It could also look at the historical statutory treatment of women by state statutes. ( Hibbs , 2001). The panel reversed the district court's granting of Nevada 's motion for summary judgment on the FMLA claim and remanded the case for further proceedings. At th is time, Nevada has not filed writs with the Supreme Court. CONCLUSION In reading these cases, one is struck by the language employed by the majority. If they cannot point to a law, or case holding, they do not hesitate to liberally construe the intent of theAllied Academies International Conference page 51 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002writers. Witness their extraordinary reading of the Eleventh Amendment, which makes no mention of a citizen of a state being forbidden to sue his own state. The language of contempt for Congress used by the court also reminds one of the language used in Plessy v. Ferguson . In that 1896 case, the Supreme Court confronted the state of Louisiana's attempt to enact a state law which required passenge r railroads to have separate cars for white and black passengers. Mr. Plessy, who was seven eighths Caucasian and one eighth black, boarded atrain in Louisiana and took a seat in the car desi gnated for whites. A conductor ordered him to leave the car and sit in the one designated for colored. U pon Plessy's refusal to obey, he was taken off the train by a police officer and jailed in the parish prison. Plessy filed suit claiming the Louisiana statute was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, the former which abolished slavery and the later which prohibited states from passing laws which violated the Equal Protection Clause of its reside nts. The majority agreed that the aim of the Fourteenth Amendment was to enforce the equality of the races before the law; however, like the current majority, it could make its own interpretation of legislative intent, and in this case \"it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, asdistinguished from political equality...\"( Plessy , 1896). In an attitude very similar to the current majority's view of the disabled in the Garrett cas e, the Plessy majority wrote that \"Legislation is powerless to eradicate racial instincts or to abolish distinctions based upon physicaldifferences...\"( Plessy , 1896). One gets the feeling that the current Rehnquist majority would feel very comfortable in the company of the Plessy majority. They have the same ability to read into legislation what they want. They will go outside congressional reports when n ecessary to enforce their viewpoint, such as in their interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment appl ying to citizens of a state suing their own state, but they will demand some as yet undefined pattern of state violations before they will permitCongress to exercise its section five authority under the Fourteenth Amendment to pass legislation.Thus, under the current court majority state em ployees not only are paid less than private employees, but they also have fewer rights. Stat e employees have been denied access to a federal forum. At least Mr. Plessy got to ride on the train. REFERENCES Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq. (1994).

I. E. Jernigan, III, UNC Charlotte Joyce M. Beggs, UNC Charlotte ABSTRACT Medical science currently has the technology fo r DNA-based genetic testing for diseases and disorders ranging from cancer to birth defect s and mental disorders such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. Although genetic testing is not a routine practice, the availability of the testingtechnology is a controversial issue worthy of discussion and consideration. The purpose of thepaper is to explore the issue of genetic testing and to compare genetic testing to drug and HIVtesting. Usage of genetic testing has increased in the United States. In March, 1999, blood banks began phasing in genetic fingerprinting tests to e liminate hepatitis C and HIV infections that were not identified by current testing methods. The cost of the new nucleic acid testing (NAT) wasestimated at $6 to $7 per unit of blood (The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, March 6, 1999).Louisiana recently enacted a law that will require DNA samples from everyone arrested in thatstate. Similar proposals for testing all those arrested are pending in North Carolina and New York (U.S. News & World Report, March 15, 1999). United States policymakers have begun to address the genetic testing issue on a limited basis. There have been occasional discussions about protecting individual pr ivacy rights, preventing premium rate discrimination by insurance companies, and avoiding potential employmentdiscrimination by employers (Wall Street Journal, March 12, 1999). President Clinton issued anexecutive order limiting the use of genetic test resu lts on decisions to hire, promote, or extent particular benefits to federal employees (The Washington Post, February 12, 2000). The debate in other countries, especially th e United Kingdom, has been much more vocal. The concerns are related to how and by whom gene tic tests should be used and to the prevention of discrimination based upon genetic information. A majo r fear is that health insurance providers will deny coverage to individuals at increased risk of a genetic disorder. Information and knowledge of genetic testing does not appear to be widespread. In a National Opinion Research Center (NORC) poll, sixty-three percent of respondents indicated that they knew something, but not very much, about genetic screening/testing, genetic therapy, andgenetic engineering. Sixteen percent reported t hat they knew a great deal, and 19 percent reported that they knew nothing at all about genetic screening/testing, genetic therapy, and geneticengineering (Singer, E., Corning, A., & Lamis, M., 1998). As information on the ramifications ofgenetic testing is communicated to the general public , the issue has the potentia l to escalate into a politically charged debate.page 54 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1Allied Academies International Conference page 55 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002VIRTUAL MERGERS AND ANTITRUST LAW IN HEALTH CARE W.R. Koprowski, Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi Steven J. Arsenault, College of Charleston ABSTRACT Although the health care industry has experienced tremendous consolidation during the past two decades, many hospitals have been excluded bec ause of religious, financial or legal restrictions that have prevented their merger. More recently, however, health care organizations have employeda variety of innovative structures to permit par ticipating entities to coordinate certain operational functions while maintaining varying degrees of independence. Because these collaborations achievemany of the benefits of a true merger, they are often referred to as \"virtual mergers.\" Thoughvirtual in name, these collaborati ons face real antitrust sc rutiny. As with actual mergers, virtual mergers must meet the requirement s of Section 7 of the Clayton Ac t, whose primary objective is to prevent mergers that have an anti-competitive effect . In addition, the operations of the virtually merged entity are subject to antitrust scrutiny under the Sherman Act, which has the potential forsignificant civil and criminal sanctions. In the first virtual merger case to reach the courts, the virtually merged entity was subjected to a She rman Act analysis. Even though the U.S. Department of Justice and the New York State antitrust authoritie s were notified prior to the merger, as required by the Clayton Act, and did not object, the price fixing and market allocation activities of the virtual merger did not survive the Sherm an Act analysis. The results of this case in conjunction with increased activism among health insurers and state attorneys general may portend a new round ofantitrust enforcement under the Sherman Act, against, ironically, the operations of virtually merged entities whose formation initially survived antitrust scrutiny under the Clayton Act.page 56 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1Allied Academies International Conference page 57 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002THE DOMAIN NAME GOLD RUSH MEETS ADR Donavan Ropp, California State University, Bakersfield Brian McNamara, California Sta te University, Bakersfield ABSTRACT The University of Nowhere owns a trademark for the \"University of Nowhere\" and for the University of Nowhere \"Winners,\" the university's sports teams. It also owns the domain name \"www.un.edu.\" The University uses its Internet site to inform the public about its academicprograms as well as its accomplishments on the spor ts fields. The University has been recognized as one of the top universities in the United States for many years. The University has also competed successfully for numerous NCAA titles over the years. The University disc overs that Mr. First, owner of Fast Services of America, Inc., re gistered and is using the Internet domain name \"universityof nowhere.com\" and \"universityofnow herewinners.com\" on a continuing basis. The University contacts Mr. First, who informs the Uni versity that he has no intention of relinquishing the domain names unless the University pays him $10,000 and gives him two lifetime passes to all\"Winner\" games. The University declines the o ffer and writes a letter to Mr. First informing him that he must stop using the Uni versity domain names immediately. Mr. First responds by sending the University an invoice for $10,000 and two lifetime tickets to \"Winner\" events. The cover letterto the invoice states that he will not stop using the domain names until the invoice is paid. This is now a dispute. It is going to cost money for bot h parties, regardless of the outcome. Additionally, there is the new area of law to contend with t hat relates to alleged cybersquatting and the improper use of domain names. This paper will explore and review approaches for resolving this disputethrough legal remedies, negotiation, mediation, and arbitration.page 58 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1Allied Academies International Conference page 59 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002Special Section on Ethics and Regulatory Issuespage 60 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1Allied Academies International Conference page 61 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002THE FACTORS OF AGE AND SEX ON THE PERCEPTION OF ETHICS Marilyn Butler, Sam Houston State University Mona Barragan, Sam Houston State University Sara A. Hart, Sam Houston State University W. Hadley Leavell, Sam Houston State University Bala Maniam, Sam Houston State University ABSTRACT Ethical issues are of great interest to the nation's business schools, management professionals, men and women of business on the front lines of decision making, and the general public they serve. Are the nation's business sc hools adequately preparing students for the challenge of public trust? Two (2) surveys were administered in the spri ng of 2000 to alumni and fa culty of a mid-sized regional state university to evaluate the state of ethics in business and society and the perceivedeffectiveness of ethics preparation as an aspect of the education. The alumni were surveyed todetermine the following: their perception of ethics in society and business, their experience inworkplace decision-making, and their opinion regarding business ethics/social responsibilitypreparation as applied to the workplace. A separate survey was distributed to faculty members. The purpose of the survey was to determine the following: their perception of ethics in society andbusiness, responses regarding the reasons for unethical behaviors in the workplace, and theiropinion of the ethical decision-making ability of their students. Both students and faculty believe they are living in a time of general ethical decline. Societal decline is believed to be greater than ethical d ecline in business. The faculty and alumni responses were cross-referenced demographically. In examining the demographic information, a patternemerges from the data indicating that perceptions of ethical behavior are influenced by age and sex more than any other factorspage 62 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1Allied Academies International Conference page 63 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002IDENTIFYING THE PROSOCIAL ATTITUDES WHICH UNDERLY PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS: THE ALTURISM, RECIPROCITY, AND CYNICISM MODEL Robert D. Hatfield, Mo rehead State University James H. Turner, Morehead State University Martha Lair Sale, University of South Alabama Ronald G. Cheek, University of Louisiana at Lafayette ABSTRACT Prosocial behaviors can be seen as the social glue in organizations. Organ presents the most common structure of prosocial behaviors ca lled Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCBs). This article suggests a model to help describe the prosocial attitudes that underlie prosocialbehaviors. The ARC Model of Prosocial Attitude s includes Altruism, Reciprocity, and Cynicism. This article reinterprets Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Organ's OCBs in light of the prosocialattitude model suggested Each variable in the ARC model is discussed and ideas for future research are included. Managers and researchers alike have a strong de sire to understand what predicts behaviors that provide the necessary mortar between em ployees that improves both the work and the workplace. There are attempts to develop a tax onomy of behaviors which describe the construct of \"prosocial\" within an organization (see Sm ith, Organ and Near, 1983; Organ, 1988; George and Brief, 1992). A metaanalysis of the construct of prosocial behaviors called OrganizationalCitizenship Behaviors (OCBs) shows that the five elements of Altruism, Conscientiousness, Civic Virtue, Courtesy, and Good Sport (\"Sportsmanship\") have stimulated a considerable amount ofattention and research (Organ and Ryan, 1995). A prosocial construct that is based less uponbehaviors and more upon attitudes n eeds to be identified. This paper presents a construct based upon attitude called the ARC Model of Prosocial Attitudes. THE ARC MODEL OF PROSOCIAL ATTITUDES Attitudes can be defined as the general affec tive, cognitive and intentional responses toward objects, other people, themselves or social i ssues (Petty and Cacioppo, 1981). This definition includes the \"ABC\" components of an attitude: affect, behavioral intentions, and cognition (Rosenberg and Hovland, 1960). Whereas the O CB conceptualization is focused upon behaviors, the three prosocial attitudes focus upon the affect, be havioral intentions, and cognitions that support prosocial acts at work. We argue that there are three fundamental attitudes that exist which facilitatesocial organization and organizations: Altr uism, Reciprocity, and Cynicism (ARC). Altruism is a prosocial attitude thought of as a predisposition to unselfishly help and focus upon others, associated with the affect of compassion, and manifested behaviorally into acts ofpage 64 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1cooperation, caring, giving assistance, etc. Reci procity is a prosocial attitude thought of as sensitivity to the behaviors and attitudes of others combined with the belief that there should be a return or balance of behaviors and attitudes. In a sense, this is an equity and social exchange concept. Reciprocity is manifested behaviorally by our being friendly in return for friendliness we received from someone else. We are courteous in return for courteousness and we often return anger when we receive anger. Cynicism is a distru sting dimension characterized by a predisposition to question the motives of others, skepticism, and warine ss. In a sense, this is the only attitude in this scheme that is cast as negative. It is often mani fested behaviorally into acts of distrust such as rechecking or questioning because we question the motives of the other person. While other attitudes might be associated with prosocial activity, it is our contention that these attitudes, ARC, provide a reasonably satisf actory and parsimonious model for explaining the basis for the \"social glue\" in organizations (Brief and Downey, 1983). Business practitioners andresearchers most often deal with the required pa radox of self-interested individuals that the firm needs working together cooperatively. EXHIBIT 1 The ARC Model of 3 Prosocial Attitudes: Altruism \u00c5----- Reciprocity ----- \u00c6 Cynicism We are separating the concept of skepticism from Cynicism in that the latter goes so far as to question the motivation of others. At worst, C ynicism leads to paranoia. In less severe forms, Cynicism is found in attitudes like the fundamental attribution error. We assert that Cynicism is necessary becau se people are not merely one-dimensional actors who are only self-focused all of th e time. If we were, organizati ons would fall apart and we could not exist socially. Because we are prosocial by nature and attitude, an exploiter might attempt to take advantage of our Altruism. Cynicism can pr otect us from the worst of possible exploitations. Cynicism also enables trust. For instance, we often cynically view those in power positions who might exploit us with their power. However, we often follow and suppor t people in power, so we consciously determine when we can let down our de fense of Cynicism. Only then can we commit fully. In order for this kind of prosocial limit on self interest to exist, we must be able to protectourselves from opportunistic and free-riding behavior. Altruism creates vulnerability. One weakness of Cynicism is that this attitude must not only impugn the motivations of others, it must assume in so me situations that those intentions are to take advantage, to exploit. We even have a name for a common manifestation of this, the \"Fundamental Attribution Error\". The seer attributes failures in others to internal cau ses in them (Gilbert and Malone, 1995). However, situational and other causes may fully explain the failures. Positiveattributions are equally enlightening. Allied Academies International Conference page 65 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002Maslow's Hierarchy and Organ's OCBs ARC Model Maslow's \"hierarchy of needs\" (Maslow, 1970) was not designed to define prosocial attitudes or behavior, but does identify motiv ational elements of social behaviors. \"Social\" needs are the middle need. The hierarchy can be understood as series of needs that start fully focused upon oneself and then go outward; toward others. Contrary to some explanations, Maslow did not intendthe self to be the highest order need. In his last interview, Maslow said, \"the ultimate happiness for man is the realization of pure beauty and truth, which are the ultimate values. What we need is asystem of thought - you might even call it a religion - that can bind humans together\" (Hoffman,1992). One can see that the highest level, penned as \"self actualization,\" was always intended assomething beyond the self, since \"self\" esteem was already listed in the fourth progressive need. The lower order needs, Physiological and Safe ty, are self protecting. The focus is upon the self and the goal is to maintain security and su rvival. These needs correspond with the function of Cynicism. The primary goal of the attitude of Cyni cism is self-protection and fending off those who might take unfair advantage of us. The higher order needs of Social and Esteem acknowledge the importance of others, rather than focusing upon the self. Belonging, being love d, being valued, are all \"other focused\". We motivationally progress by satisfying these needs we are moving out toward others, just as weattitudinally move away from Cynicism and toward Altruism and responsibility. EXHIBIT 2 ARC Model Compared to Maslow's Needs Hierarchy and Organ's Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCBs) <----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> Focus on Self (Self Protecting) Focus on Others Maslow's Needs Hierarchy: Physiological Safety Social Esteem Self Actualization Organ's Few Many ARC Model of Prosocial Attitudes: Cynicism -----------------------------------------------------------------------Altruism - Reciprocity - At the highest level, we can examine Maslow's comments about beauty and truth being most important. Having satisfied the need to reach a leve l of esteem and value in the eyes of others, the hierarchy suggests that we find our most enlight ened and fulfilling place within the universe through actualization. At this highest level Maslow suggest s we reach a system of thought \"which binds all humans together\" according to his words (above). At actualization we look outward, not justpage 66 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1inward, to see our fit within the organization and world. \"Like a religion\" he suggests, we will be purely Altruistic and noncynical. The relationship between the ARC Model and OCBs, is like the relationship between motivation and performance - the former precedes and helps explain the latter. Thus, the attitude of Altruism precedes and helps explain the acts of courtesy, civic virtue, good sport,conscientiousness, and other altruistic behaviors. The focus for all of these is that of others. Checking with others in the organization (Courte sy), doing one's own share of group maintenance activities (Civic Virtue), not complaining to others (\"Sportsmanship\" or Good Sport), working morecarefully than necessary for the benefit of othe rs or the \"organization\" (Conscientiousness), and unselfish acts of stepping forward to help some other person (Altruism), are all non protective acts focused upon the benefit of others. Since such pr osocial behaviors have become a focus for many organizations, employers should be equally interested in the predictors of such behavior, including the attitudes that precede or motivate the occurrences of prosocial behaviors. CONCLUSIONS It is helpful to examine the concepts found in the ARC Model of Prosocial Attitudes to stimulate discussion and thought about those acts th at must commonly happen for organizations and societies to thrive. We feel th at examination at the level of attitudes adds depth to discussions of Organizational Citizenship Behaviors and even motivational theories like Maslow's Hierarchy ofNeeds. The literature indicates that predictors other than attit udes and motivations might explain prosocial behavior. For instance, Rushton (1986) ha s suggested that 60% of altruistic behavior is a manifestation of inherited traits, while the remaining 40% results from a combination of culturalinfluence and state, or situational influence. Genome research may hold explanations. Carefulconsideration of other such variables would be helpful in understanding prosocial behavior. We have suggested related hypotheses in other papers that can be tested empirically (Turner and Valentine, 2001). Scales have been developed that might be helpful in that endeavor (Turner, 2000). We encourage both the conceptual and empirical examination of this model. We believeAltruism, Reciprocity, and especially Cynicism have great potential for explaining the prosocial behaviors of people in organizations. Finally, employers and leaders can develop strategies and tactics to maximize the attitude of Altruism and minimize the need for Cynicism within their organizations. To do so, they musthave a deep understanding of these attitudes and the role they play in promoting positive socialbehaviors. It would be helpful, therefore, if practitioners could be given suggestions for promoting Altruism specifically. Humanistic and other philosophies may have been offering implicitapproaches to such promotion.

Kamery, Christ ian Brothers University Sarah T. Pitts, Christian Brothers University Cayce R. Lawrence, Christ ian Brothers University ABSTRACT The paper reviews the history of ethics and so cial responsibility in the advertising industry in the light of free market economics. Possible incentives for proactive, socially responsibleadvertising are explored. Implications of the ban on tobacco advertising and proposed bans onalcohol advertising are discussed. Advertising in ot her industries, particul arly education, consumer goods, and gambling are discussed as well. The pape r concludes that advertising is protected by the First Amendment and contributes positively to th e proper functioning of the free market system. Hence, regulation should be minimized. INTRODUCTION The advertising industry suffers a poor reputation concerning ethics. Polling American consumers, the Wirthlia Worldwide Agency found th at 4% \"strongly disagree\" that advertisements deliberately stretch the truth about products; 18% \"strongly agree\" that advertisements deliberately stretchthe truth to sell their products (Dolleger, 1999). Several theories offer explanations why this industry is perceived as lacking in ethics a priori. Ferrell & Gardiner (1991) define an ethical actas one perceived as proper and acceptable accordi ng to a society's sta ndards. In addition, utilitarianism is an act that leads to the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people. Alsoincluded is ethical formalism, which is an act th at does not infringe on one's rights, such as life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, privacy, speech, a nd due process (Ferrell & Gardiner, 1991). Fisher & Phillips (1998) define ethics or deontology as the study of clashes in moral values. Ethical dilemmas exist because one has choice. For exampl e, one could choose to cheat on an income tax return and avoid paying taxes, or one could honestly fill out a tax return regardless of the taxes owed (Fisher & Phillips, 1998). Ethics are ultimate values , or a priori, meaning their assumed value is in their existence, with no need of justification (F isher & Phillips, 1998). Business ethics refer to the values used to make choices by a business in its da ily affairs. Businesses' values can be judged by their actions (Fisher & Phillips, 1998). Positive et hical values include making a profit, delivering the best products and services to consumers, providing workers with jobs, giving owners a good return on their investment, and being a good comm unity citizen (Fisher & Phillips, 1998). To make a profit, businesses must have the incentive to deliver quality products because they usually havecompetition. Using the above criteria, one can e xplore the reasons that the advertising industry appears to be bereft of ethics.page 68 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1ETHICS AND ADVERTISING Murphy (1998) has developed one theory. Questionnaires were sent to 785 Fortune 500 companies, which assessed the importance that each company placed on ethics. One hundredninety-eight, or 25%, of the companies had specifi c codes addressing ethics in advertising (Murphy, 1998). From this research, it may be inferred th at businesses are not placing much importance on ethics in their advertising departments. With increasing government regulation and consumerism, one would hope that the statistics would be bette r. Obviously, businesses listen less to government than they do their customers. Another theory developed by Murphy (1998) addresses the \"unholy trinity\" made up of advertisers, agencies, and the media. Advertiser s want to sell their product by portraying a favorable image, and to maintain current consumption of their product. Agencies want to maintain clients,express creativity, and place advertisements in a profitable and acceptable medium. The media relies on advertising for financial support and the education and entertainment of the audience(Murphy, 1998). These goals do not emphasize ethics as being a priority. Ethics also encompasses corporate social responsibility (CSR), especially in Europe. Balabanis, Phillips, & Lyall (1988) theorize ethics of CSR in advertising by personifying a firm'sneeds and comparing them to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. After a firm fulfills its psychologicalneeds (profit), safety needs (c ompetitive advantage), and affiliative needs (involvement in trade association), it will fulfill its internal and self-actualization needs by practicing corporate socialresponsibility. As in the former theory, ethics ar e held in abeyance until other needs and desires are fulfilled. One possible solution for the lack of motivation present in the business world to prioritize ethics is the implementation of self-regulation. The National Advertising Review Council imposedage-restricted regulations on alcohol and tobacco advertisements (Fox & Krugman, 1998). Theadvertising industry's largest organization dedicated to ethical issues is the National AdvertisingReview Board (NARB), which is a part of th e Council of the Better Business Bureau (Murphy, 1998). The NARB also has a Children's Advertisement Review Unit (Fox & Krugman, 1998).Managers of agencies volunteer to serve on thes e boards to investigate complaints. The review board does an effective job of regulating the a dvertising industry; coupled with limited government regulation and consumer awareness, review boards can be a powerful weapon in the fight againstunethical advertising (Murphy, 1998). Advertisers use many methods to intrigue cons umers to purchase their product. The use of the media is popular. Schudson ( 1984) states that when the media brings attention to a product, without regard to the actual advertisement, this influences consumers by enticing them to purchase a product or use a service out of curiosity. Such is the case with movies and artwork. Other times, consumers are turned off and will not purchase the product or use the service (Schudson, 1984).This type of boycott takes place when a group or organization is morally opposed to a product, such as the Southern Baptist Convention boycotting Disney World and Disney products. Schudson (1984) states that consumers use their personal experience to determine what they will purchase.Even if a product has proven to be of high quality, if one has an unsatisfactory personal experiencewith the specific product, it will not be purchased a second time (Schudson, 1984). For example,Allied Academies International Conference page 69 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002this could mean that if a car customer has a bad experience with a specific make of car, he or she would not purchase that type of car again. Adver tisers know this, and will work very hard for that good first impression. With this idea in mind, if a consumer's first impression of a product is formeddue to an advertisement, the producer will put in a great deal of time, effort, and money to reach the consumer through a quality advertisement. The power is in the consumer's hands. EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS Advertising in educational settings has become controversial. When firms donate products such as computers and toys to schools and display their logos, critics claim that they are attempting to influence children to buy their products. This does not allow competing products equal time.Often these products are desperately needed by fi nancially strapped school systems (Mullins, 1996). Corporations are giving away their products and providing for many children who would not normally have the opportunity or access to high-tech, educational products. Other types of educational advertising are criticized. Vocational schools and home study courses are typically known to be of lower quality than accredited institutions for those that are seeking serious career advancement. In the cas e FTC vs.Cinderella Career and Finishing Schools 404 F.2d 1308, (D.C. Cir. 1968), the FTC found that the school was guilty of fraudulent claims anddeception. The school was promising \"miracles after sundown,\" claiming the typist could betransformed into the glamorous airline stewardess, or the clerk into a fashion counselor; the school offered a broad curriculum including courses in fashion retail and courses related to airline stewardesses (Kintner, 1978). Many individuals w ho opt for vocational or home study courses are young and inexperienced. Students seeking this type of education are concerned with the qualityof training, number of jobs available in a certain field, expected income, and job placement (Kintner, 1978). Often schools exaggerate the ability of thei r program to fulfill the needs of their students. Some take issue with the fact that accredited co lleges and universities advertise their liberal arts programs with the unspoken promise that students w ill be able to obtain employment. Corporate recruiters are looking for graduates with liberal-arts degrees as long as they are computer literate andhave good communication skills. FOODS, DRUGS, AND COSMETICS In the late 19th century, quackery was prevalent in the marketing of medicines. Claims were outrageous, and the alcohol content was high in ma ny of the tonics. Ther e was no fear on the part of the peddler of being held responsible for th e advertising, because there were no laws governing their actions (Kintner, 1978). Today, the FTC and FDA regulate the claims of pharmaceutical advertisements and the drugs that are allowed on the market. They are concerned with protecting the public from overzealous claims of healing (Kintn er, 1978). If a product claims to have medicinal properties, it must be approved by the FDA (Foul ke, 1992). Even products such as deodorant and suntan lotion, since they affect the body's functi on and structure, are considered drugs and are regulated by the FDA (Kintner, 1978). In 1980, the FTC set the standard for an offending practice that causes injury to a consumer by stating that it must be substantial, not outweighed by anpage 70 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1offsetting consumer or competitive benefit the pr actice produces, and not be reasonably avoidable by consumers (Fisher & Phillips, 1998). Substantial harm, as defined by the FTC, includes amonetary loss or a health and safety risk to a consumer (Fisher & Phillips, 1998). The FTC has the power to order an advertiser to cease and desist from certain claims. It can also require an advertiser to correct future advertisements by disclosing certain information (Fisher & Phillips, 1998). TheFTC ordered Novaris Consumer Health to run eight million dollars worth of correctiveadvertisements for its Doan's Pills (Teinowitz, 1999) . This was the first time in 25 years that the FTC had taken this type of ac tion. The FTC determined that advertisements running from 1987 to 1996 falsely presented Doan's Pills as a better bra nd for back pain than other remedies (Teinowitz, 1999). Pharmaceutical companies have shifted much of their advertising budgets from medical journals and physicians to television and print adve rtisements directed to the general public. Drugs that fight obesity, such as Phen-Fen, and over-the-counter medications, such as Metabolife, aremarketed as safe and effective; Phen-Fen was taken off the market by the FDA after consumers suffered severe health problems, and Metabolife is considered an herbal supplement, so it is notunder federal guidelines. Consumer regulation of false and deceptive drug claims is difficult because a consumer cannot obtain all the informati on necessary to make an informed decision. The consumer must rely on a physician or other health care professional for guidance. This area is onewhere government regulation is important for the safety of consumers. CONCLUSION Schudson (1984) states that advertising represents values already present in society. Advertisers pick up on certain values and represen t them as commonly shared values between the consumer and seller. In a perfect world, adver tisers would be self-regulated. Unfortunately, it is not a perfect world. Government regulation, on a limited basis, is a necessary evil (Foley, 1998). The best way to eliminate unethical advertising is for moral and educational leaders to take a standagainst it (Murphy, 1998). Professors should teach their students about ethics in advertising, andencourage them to support ethical advertising and boycott unethical advertising. The FTC's greatest challenge is to balance economic and social inte rests, protecting the consumer, while allowing the free market to work properly. The FTC, state gove rnments, and consumer protection agencies can contribute to the safety of consumers. Ultimately, consumerism lies within the consumer.Advertisers are vying for consumers' attention, and the best way to send a message to an advertiser is to refuse to buy their product. The advertising industry has become a fundamental part of theAmerican way of life, of the economy, and of co rporate America. Advertising is considered protected free speech under the Constitution. A partnership between government regulation,industry regulation, consumer protection organizati ons, and the informed consumer will bring about ethical advertising that is beneficial to the consumer and the economy.Allied Academies International Conference page 71 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002REFERENCES Balabanis, Gorge, Phillips, Hugh C., & Lyall, Jona than (1998).

Ethical dilemmas can be defined as situations where moral certainty is compromised by rational cognition. In this paper, the autho rs assume that some people use a morality-first perspective and others a rationality-first perspective. Ethical scenarios were written and used to test hypotheses derived from this perspective. The instrument developed was shown to be in need of further refinement. Results are disc ussed in terms of relationships between participant-characteristics variables and overall and subscale responses to the ethical scenarios. INTRODUCTION Ethical views that only deal with abstract choices are often derided as too formal or unrealistic, but Louden, (1984) argued that virtue ethics should be included in any adequate justification of morality, along with deontologi cal (Kant) and teleological (Bentham, Mills) approaches. However, researchers in various disciplines tend to approach ethical research andconceptual development, from consistently different perspectives. Most business-related ethicalresearch has dealt with moral development (K ohlberg, 1976, Rest, 1979), having to do with how a person's views change across his or her lifetime; whereas, in criminology and sociology for example, research has often centered on rational choice. Ra tional choice theory says that people will assess the advantages and disadvantages of a given be havioral choice and then act in the way that maximizes their advantage (Nagin & Paternoster, 1993). A third line of research, using a subjective expected utility framework was proposed by Fudge (1999), but has received little attention. LITERATURE REVIEW Perhaps the most popular lines of research into ethical business behavior (indeed ethical behavior across many situations) have been the aforementioned Rational Choice Theory fromsociology (Coleman, 1990) and Cognitive Moral Development from psychology and religion (Kohlberg, 1976). Kohlberg (1984) says people de velop across time and experience, from complete selfishness to being influenced almost exclusively by principles derived from internalized societal and philosophical values. His Cognitive Moral Development Theory, a stage model, assumes peoplemigrate over time, due to experience and devel opment, from selfishness to a more principled judgment of choices. The assumption here is egoism transforming into altruism or at least a typeof \"moralism\" or sense of duty to one's deeply held values.page 74 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1At the preconventional level (stages 1 and 2), moral decisions are formulated on the basis of simple, immediate consequences to the indi vidual (i.e., punishments and rewards). Reasoning at the conventional level (stages 3 and 4) emphasizes adhering to the rules or norms of appropriatebehavior established by external groups, such as p eers, family, and society. At the principled level (stages 5 and 6), moral judgment criteria transce nd the authority of group norms as the individual develops an increasingly strong personal commitment to self-selected universal principles andbecomes decreasingly egocentric. Rational Choice Theory (Coleman, 1990), based on the economic man principle, assumes people make value-charged choices on the basis of how likely the alternative they choose is tomaximize their own interests. This view assumes an egoistic interpretation of choices (Rest, 1979). Another theory, closely related to Rational Choice Theory, addresses what is often called Subjective Expected Utility models, based on r easoning by the 18th-century mathematician, Daniel Bernoulli. The most popular of these models is Vroom's (1964) VIE theory. Expectancy theory, as it is often called, assumes people make rational choices, but that these choices are informed by variously reliable perceptions of expectancies, instrumentalities and valences. Expectancies aresubjective estimates of the probability (ranging from 0 to 1) of one's effort leading to a desired outcome. These outcomes are assumed to vary in attractiveness or valence. The valence can range from -1 to +1, meaning it can be highly unattractiv e or highly attractive, something to be avoided or something to be pursued. BUILDING THE MODEL Suppose we retain Kohlberg's assumption that people develop different types of moral or ethical reasoning over time and that this development causes them to be relatively simplistic in their interpretations of value-charged choices or rela tively complex. The simple st would be those who find themselves at the extremes of Kohlberg's framework, almost entirely egoistic (rationalists) oralmost totally principle driven (moralists). Indeed, those who are self ish are perhaps somewhat \"simpler\" or more easily predictable than thos e whose judgment is guided by principle, since principles or values can themselves be quite co mplex. Nonetheless, both of these groups, moralists and rationalists, may be said to be relatively simple in their response to situations compared to those who are in the middle. That is, those who are what we will call rational moralists or moral rationalists. Rational moralists are more likely to see situa tions through the lens of their values, however, they can be convinced of the merits of certain exceptions based on rational judgment. The rational moralist is more likely to focus on valences and e xpectancies, to bring in Vroom's VIE theory. That is, this person is not always a moralist, but some times based on the size of the outcome for himself versus others, whether good counterbalances bad, how much effort would be involved to overcome situational constraints or whether it makes good bus iness sense; this person may be persuaded away from a strict moral interpretation. The rational moralist (RM) compromises his principles sometimes based on certain perceived outcome possibilities and expectancy-to-performance probabilities. Allied Academies International Conference page 75 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002On the other hand, the moral rationalist (MR), the other relatively complex person in the middle, might focus first on how rational a given choice. His or her rational judgment may not be as likely to be compromised by a moral principl e as it is by outcome-to-outcome relationships or instrumentalities. This person will be interested in what other people will say (deed brought to light of day leads to defamation), that is whether they condone it or not, what p eers tend to do in similar circumstances (deed makes one look more or less \"competitively rational\"), whether there is anexplicit law or rule against it (others are on formal record as being opposed to the deed), whetherothers will find out about it (whether deed will reach light of day to be reviewed by others), and whether it is clearly a bad thing to do or not (deed is or is not in a category of those which have previously been considered ethically wrong). Y ou might say the MR will act in a moral fashion when it is rational to do so. The MR is trying to read the situational forces (instrumentalities) that require him or her to be ethical or moral. The MR is almost entirely consumed with his or her perception of the judgment others will bring to bear on his behavior. From this logic, we can assert that there are four possibilities: (1) some people (rational moralists) may tend to see morality through a rational lens, (2) others (moral rationalists) may tendto see rationality through a moral lens, and (3) some (moralists) may see choices only with respectto whether they are \"right or wrong\", and (4) (rati onalists) only see choices with respect to whether they are rational or not. The first (RM) group w ill tend to believe that sometimes the moral thing to do in the abstract, might not be practical gi ven certain rational or logical evidence from the situation usually having to do with one's self- or business-interest. The second group (MR) is likelyto assess what is logical or rational on the grounds of whether it meets certain ethical or moral standards, usually having to do with the opinions, va lues or interests of others. The third group (M) would be those people who tend to view choices onl y with respect to their morality implications or the effect on others. The fourth group (R ) are likely to see choices only with respect to their rationality in terms of the individual's self-interest. The basic purpose of this study then, is to see if these categories of people can be reliably discerned one from the other based on their responses across hypothetical ethical dilemmas. Theultimate product of this line of research would be an instrument to measure an individual's perceptual location on a continuum from essentially moral to essentially rational, although takenalone, this study does not achieve this goal entirel y, since to do so would require assessment of individuals on measures designed to assess moral development, rational choice and VIE. Participant-characteristic variable s, such as political inclinati on, religiosity, age, gender, and educational background will be measured to determine their relationship to these categories.Relationships between these variables might give insight into which, if any, \"types\" of people naturally differ with respect to these categories. Honeycutt, E.D., Jr., Glassman, M., Zugelder, M.T. & Karande, K. (2001), found that age and education moderates whether one sees a situation as ethical or not. Kohlberg (1976) and others have found religiosity to be positively related to one's ethical development. Political inclination (Mar nburg, 2001) and gender are included to explore the relationship they might have with any categories uncovered by the research.page 76 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1METHODS Participants. The participants were204 students across numerous disciplines from two southern Universities. They provided demographi c information and responded to a survey designed to assess their agreement with the actions taken by an actor in seven scenarios with ethical themes. The participants ranged in ages from 18 to 55 with an average age of 23.24 and a standard deviation of 6.049. The distribution of ages was positively skewed with over 72% of respondents being under the mean age. Procedure. Questionnaire Development. The authors constructed seven ethical scenarios from personal experience and stories gleaned from st udents, managers or colleagues. Each scenario was followed by response alternatives as to whether what the person did was \"right or not\". Aneffort was made to make the scenarios plausible and to keep response alternatives as concise andparallel as possible, with the participants being as ked to agree or disagree with the responses using a five item Likert-type scale. The alternatives were chosen based on the reasoning laid out in theintroduction. Sampling. The majority of the surveys were distributed and completed in classes, although some were completed outside of class and returned to the instructor electronically or as a hard copy. The responses were then entered into a spread sheet and the results analyzed using SPSS Verson 11. RESULTS Factor Analysis. We used principle component s factor analysis to determine the structure of the data matrix resulting from 204 participant re sponses to 56 alternatives (seven scenarios with eight response choices each) . The analysis revealed 10 factors with an eigen value above one. The \"built-in\" factors were essentially not f ound to be \"coherent\" in the factor analysis. However, a pattern of separation appeared to exist between moral-rational responses and rational-moral responses, as was predicted. Excluding the comprehensive factor one, the resultsshowed, for example, that factor two had three of four variables loading that were designated as rational moralist (RM). The upshot was that 32 of 44 loadings (where the fact or had more than two variables loading) showed a pattern of \"compara ble loadings\", more than would be expected by chance. Those who were politically \"liberal\" were mo re likely to respond rationalistic or higher on the total survey and those who were more religious were more likely to respond moralistic or lower on the total survey. The same results held fo r the items labeled Rational Moralist or Moral Rationalist. Additionally, though, those who had more work experience had a lower response total on Rational Moralist (valences and expectancies) items than those with less work experience and males were more likely to have a higher response total on those items labeled Moral Rationalist (instrumentalities) than females.Allied Academies International Conference page 77 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002DISCUSSION The survey instrument was not content valid enough to pick up subtle differences among responders. The most salient feature of the questionnaire was its overall internal consistency. Theprinciple component analysis demonstrated that it was basically measuring \"one thing\". This means the instrument as it currently ex ists would be more valuable to measure ethical responses across situations than to ascertain how different categories of respondents differ across the situations. During the next phase of development, the in strument must be analyzed by subject matter experts and items phrased in such a way that they clearly articulate the construct being measured. A content validity ratio (Lawshe, 1975) should be obtained for each item, to determine prior to administration, just what that item is measuring. A refined, reliable questionnaire, with distinct subscales for RM and MR, would allow future research to determine the extent to which people va ry in their tendency to be moral first and rational second or vice versa, if indeed, they vary in this way at all. As for the specific correlational findings, it seems clear that at least when the matter is kept at the level of speculation, those who are more relig ious are more likely to be moralistic in their reaction to situations and those who are more politi cally liberal a more likely to be rationalistic in their reaction to situations. It would be intere sting to see if these results held up when such individuals are required to make actual business d ecisions. Would the religious principles still hold firm and would those who are more liberal on pape r respond more conservatively in real life or not? Work experience was shown to be related to one 's tendency to be more morally conservative or moralistic. Roozen, de Pelsmacker and Bo styn, (2001) found less experienced workers tended to be \"more ethical\". It stands to reason that t hose with more work experience are likely to have a more nuanced or perspective on the matter of ethics, causing them to perhaps be more conservativein some cases and less so in others. Their judgment, in other words, may be more keyed into thedetails of the situation. Males were more likely to have higher response totals on items that pertained to instrumentalities or how the anticipated behavioral choice would be \"viewed by others\". This could be an interesting subject for future research. Are males more likely to be concerned with ethical appearances than females. Strong conclusions on that issue cannot be drawn from this study. In the end, this study leaves open the question as to whether some people are more likely to respond to situations \"morally first\" and others \"rationally first\". The fact that many the itemsloaded in valence/expectancy \"clusters\" or instru mentality \"clusters\", leaves hope that the idea is not invalid. Further research should follow to consider the validity of this approach to ethical reasoning. The extent to which the RM versus MR distinc tion is related to the work of Kohlberg (1984), Rest (1979) and Coleman (1990), c ould easily be ascertained by coll ecting a battery of information from the same participants and assessing both their anticipation and actual behavior acrosssituations.page 78 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1REFERENCES Coleman, James S.

Shawn Strother, University of Tennessee ABSTRACT This paper examines the issue of ethics in investment analysis and management. A survey instrument containing thirteen scenarios is admin istered to university business students at various levels. The scenarios are developed from the St andards of Professional Conduct of the Association for Investment Management and Research. The Standards are then used as an objective basis ofcomparison in evaluating student responses based on five demographic variables: environment,class rank, academic major, race, and gender. The results should be useful to faculty teaching a professional ethics course or wishing to incorporate the study of ethics into a finance, a ccounting or investments course at any level. The results overall indicate a moderate level of ethical congruence on the part of the students, butseveral particularly weak areas are identified. INTRODUCTION The issue of ethics in investment analysis and management is examined. A survey methodology is used and the surveys are administer ed to university students at various levels. Studies of the ethical business decision making on the part of university students have been conducted before, but generally focus on a broad ra nge of business topics. This study has a more specific focus and therefore provides more useful information for faculty teaching in the areas of professional ethics, finance and investments. Ethics in finance and investment management is receiving increasing attention from lawmakers as well as academic researchers. As financial engineering progresses and new and complex financial instruments are developed, the task of the investment manager and advisorbecomes more difficult and the opportunity for unethi cal behavior to occur is greater. Accrediting agencies for business schools such as the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business are also placing increased attention on the issue of ethics. It is difficult to define ethical behavior and unethical behavior in many situations. One person may see the actions as ethical and another person may see the same actions as unethical.Some authors have attempted to define ethical behavior but a widely accepted definition does not exist. As a result most professional organizations require their members to abide by a strict codeof ethics and standards of professional conduct wh ich govern specific ethical and professional issues in the discipline. This research utilizes the C ode of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct set forth by the Association for Investment Mana gement and Research (AIMR). The AIMR Codepage 80 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1and Standards is used to develop vignettes for the survey instrument and it also provides an objective basis for evaluating the survey results. LITERATURE REVIEW Most studies in the area of business ethics are general in scope rather than focusing on a particular functional area of business. Of those studies conducted, few are based on a publishedcode of conduct which helps to provide an objectiv e basis for evaluating the results. One exception is a study by Green and Weber (1997) which provide s some evidence about the ethical development of accounting students prior to, and immediately following ethics oriented versus non-ethics orientedaccounting courses. They found the ethical reasoni ng ability of accounting students to be improved when they took an auditing course which empha sized the AICPA Code versus those who had not taken the course. No difference was noted be tween accounting and non-accounting majors prior to an auditing course. They concluded that when an auditing course emphasizes the \"spirit\" of theCode, there is a positive impact on th e ethical reasoning ability of the students completing the course. Of those studies with a focus on general business ethics, the scenarios given to the respondent typically involve corporate actions, employment situations, advertising or sales. Respondents are typically asked to complete demographic profiles and then the responses arecorrelated with the demographic information to de termine if different demographic groups view a particular ethical situation as more or less ethical than another. Typical demographic variablesevaluated include gender, age, race, major, income and religious conviction. The following aresome of the findings from studies of this nature. Schminke and Ambrose (1997) evaluate ethical asymmetries in the way men and women approach ethical decision making in both busine ss and non-business settings. They conclude that the models employed by men and women appear to differ in both business and non-business settings and that women are better predictors of both genders' most likely ethical model. Ruegger and King (1992) and Dawson (1997) also evaluate gender as a differentiating factor in ethical decision making. Ruegger and King study the effect of age and gender upon student business ethics by evaluating students enrolled in business courses at the University of SouthernMississippi. They conclude from their sample that gender is a significant f actor in ethical decision making and that females are more ethical than ma les in their perception of ethical situations in business. With respect to the age of the responde nt, their results indicate that older students (40 years and older) are the most ethical in their business decision making. Dawson (1977) evaluated ethical differences between men and women in th e sales profession by surveying 209 subjects. Each subject responded to 20 ethical scenarios of which 10 were non-relational (situations essentiallyconfined to ones own conscience). He found significant differences between the sexes in situationsinvolving relational issues, but not in situations involving non-relational issues. Secondly, he found that ethical differences based on gender change with age and years of experience. McNichols and Zimmerer (1985) attempted to find differences in undergraduate student attitudes toward ethical situations based on gender and major and were unable to identify anysignificant differences with respect to either variable.Allied Academies International Conference page 81 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002Barnett, Brown and Bass (1994) evaluate the ethical judgements of college students and attempt to differentiate the responses based on academic major, gender, age and income. Theyfound no significant differences in the ethical re sponses based on academic major or age. With respect to gender, they found the ethical responses of males to be less harsh in all 24 of the scenarios presented. Males consistently evaluated the actions as less unethical than females. The authors suggest that this could mean that the moral devel opment of males is somewhat slower than that of females. With respect to the income variable, th e study found that in 23 of the 24 scenarios, students in the higher income group rated the situation as less unethical. Some studies have addressed possible cultura l differences in the way respondents evaluate an ethical business scenario. Allmon, Chen, Pritchett and Forrest (1997) evaluate culturaldifferences in the business ethics perceptions of students in Australia, Taiwan and the United States and concluded that \"although statistically significant differences do exist there is significantagreement with the way students perceive ethical/une thical practices in business.\" They suggest that there appears to be \"a universality of business ethical perceptions.\" Whipple and Swords (1992) conduct a cross-cultural comparison between students in the United States and the United Kingdom. They conclude that \"differences in the students'demographic profiles do not influence their ethics judgement.\" They do note consistently higherbusiness ethics of female students from both countries. METHODOLOGY Most survey research on the issue of ethics utilizes vignettes to present an ethical or unethical situation to the respond ent and then asks the respondent to rate the situation on a scale. Typically rating scales vary from 5 to 9 points. A 5 point rating scale is used in this study. The mean response score is evaluated in two ways. First, it is compared with the AIMR Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional C onduct to determine if the respondents' evaluation of the ethical dilemma is in agr eement with the spirit of the Code and Standards. Second, the mean response scores are computed for each demographic category of respondent to see if there is anysignificant difference in the respondents evaluation of the ethical dilemma by demographic category. The various demographic categories analyzed in clude the respondents environment, class ranking, major, race and gender. Past studies of ethics in a general business context have found some ofthese demographic variables to be significant and others to be insignificant. The survey instrument was administered to students at two medium sized state universities and one medium sized private university. Most of the students surveyed were business majors.Hypothesized relationships are that there shoul d be no significant differences in the ethical congruence of the respondent with respect to the demographic variables of environment, classranking, major, race or gender. The survey instrument contains 13 scenarios wh ich relate to various standards set forth by AIMR in their Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct. The respondents completed a profile containing the demographic variables. Each of the thirteen scenarios is then ranked by the respondent on a scale of 1 to 5 w ith 1 being fully ethical or appr opriate behavior and 5 being fully unethical or inappropriate behavior.page 82 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1RESULTS With respect to the characteristics of the respondents, 55.1 percent were male and 44.9 percent were female. All of the respondents were juniors, seniors or graduate students. Fifteen percent were juniors, 67 percent were seniors and 17 percent were graduate students. Nearly half (48 percent) of the respondents were finance majo rs and 18 percent were management majors. With respect to environment, 41 percent of the responde nts reported being raised in a rural environment, 37 percent reported being raised in a suburban environment and 22 percent reported being raised inan urban environment. The responses are analyzed with respect to th e five categories contained in the Standards of Professional Conduct of the Association for Inve stment Management and Research: fundamental responsibilities, relationships with and responsib ilities to the profession, relationships with and responsibilities to the employer, relationships with and responsibilities to clients and prospects, and relationships with and responsibilities to the investing public. Only one of the scenarios on the survey rela ted to fundamental responsibilities and involved a foreign based analyst employed by a U.S. comp any trading on inside information in a country where there were no insider trading laws. This s cenario received a mean response of 3.0 on the scale of 1 to 5 which indicates no strong opinion on the part of the respondents. Four of the scenarios concerned relationshi ps with and responsibilities to the profession. These involved such behaviors as misuse of a professional designation, repeated arrests for minor misdemeanors, and citation of references used in a report. Mean response scores for these four scenarios ranged from 2.373 to 3.576. Respondents' viewed individual scenarios in this category as generally ethical or unethical, but with an overall mean score of 2.936 no clear pattern emergedwithin the category. With respect to relationships with and respons ibilities to the employer, there were 5 scenarios posed to the respondents. Mean scores for these 5 scenarios ranged from 2.280 to 3.458. Each ofthe scenarios described a situation where the person in question was not acting in a mannerconsistent with the Standards of Professiona l Conduct. These scenarios involved informing employer of a duty to abide by a code of conduct, taking clients with you when leaving an employer, conflicts of interest, and disclosing confidential non-public information. When considering all respondents as a single group, the overall mean response score for this category of 2.923 does not indicate particular ly strong or weak ethical orientation. The fourth category examined was relationshi ps with and responsibilities to clients and prospects. There was only one scenario in this category and the mean response score was 3.288.The scenario described a situation where the anal yst had made some estimates based on information he believed to be reliable, but then presented th ese estimates as factual information in a report prepared for public dissemination, which is in vi olation of the Standard s of Professional Conduct. Respondents viewed these actions as only somewhat unethical overall and didn't seem to identify the significance of making a statement such as \"C ompany X will have earnings of two dollars per share next quarter\" when the earnings are actually only an estimate. The final category involves relationships with and responsibilities to the investing public. Two scenarios were presented in this section and they had mean response scores of 2.805 and 3.085Allied Academies International Conference page 83 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002which would indicate that respondents overall have no strong ethical orientation. Each of these scenarios involved the use of material non-public information to make a trading decision. Failure to clearly identify the unethical nature of the scen arios presented in this category likely results from two factors. First, the respondent may not rec ognize the information presented in the scenario as material and non-public. Second, even if the respondent does recognize the information as \"insider\"information, they may not see how any harm is done if the insider trades on the information. Further analysis evaluated ethical congr uence by respondent category. Significant differences in ethical congruence were iden tified for several scenarios by subdividing the respondents according to variables included in the respondent profile. Tables 1 through 5summarize the respondent categories in which signifi cant differences were identified with respect to several of the scenarios. With respect to fundamental responsibilities, no significant differences were identified with respect to any of the respondent categories. Ho wever, differences in all 5 respondent categories were identified for scenarios involving relationships with and responsibilities to the profession. The most significant source of differences in this categor y was related to the class of the respondent. For all four scenarios in the profession category, th e mean response score was higher for undergraduate students than for graduate students. In three of the four cases the difference was statistically significant. This is consistent with a hi gher degree of ethical congruence on the part of undergraduate students with regard to interacting with ones profession. At first this may seem to indicate that ethics with respect to ones profession are being \"un-l earned\" as the student progresses from undergraduate to graduate school. Since gr aduate students typically have worked or are currently working in a professional environment, they may see some marginally unethical behavioras \"accepted\" in the real world whereas, an underg raduate student is much more likely to not have professional experience and offer a much more idealistic response to the scenario. Ethical judgement differences regarding rela tionships with and responsibilities to employers were identified with respect to all categories ex cept gender. Two of the five scenarios in this category demonstrated significantly higher mean sc ores for urban respondents which is consistent with a higher degree of ethical congruence on th e part of urban respondents. One possible explanation here is that urban respondents would tend to work for, or be influenced by familymembers who work for, relatively large urban employers. Such employers would be more likelyto have adopted a code of ethics and/or sta ndards of professional conduct than relatively smaller employers in rural areas. This exposure could result in more ethically congruent responses on thepart of the urban respondents. Only the environment and class variables were found to have any significance in explaining ethical judgements relating to clients and prospects. Undergraduate and urban respondents hadhigher mean scores for scenarios involving relati onships with and responsibilities to clients and prospects. This is again consistent with a highe r degree of ethical congrue nce on the part of urban undergraduate respondents. The final category of scenarios involved re lationships with and responsibilities to the investing public. Both scenarios in this category had significantly different response scores withrespect to major and race. The mean response score was significantly higher for white respondents than black respondents and the mean response score for finance majors was higher than that ofpage 84 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1management majors. With respect to gender, the mean response scores were higher for female respondents than for male respondents which indicat es a higher degree of ethical congruence on the part of the female respondents. Overall, in the category of relationships with and responsibilitiesto the investing public, the respondent will likely eval uate the scenario from the perspective of the analyst or from the perspective of the investor. Although a scenario identifies the specific action to be judged, it does not identify a perspective fr om which the actions should be judged other than \"ethically\". These differences in perspective would likely help to explain some of the significantdifferences observed with respect to major, race and gender in relationships with and responsibilitiesto the investing public.Allied Academies International Conference page 85 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002SIGNS OF TROUBLE IN THE PROFESSION: A LOOK AT THE ETHICAL PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCES OF ACCOUNTING PRACTITIONERS (PRE-ENRON) Suzanne Pinac Ward, The University of Louisiana at Lafayette1 Ellen D. Cook, The University of Louisiana at Lafayette Dan R. Ward, The University of Louisiana at Lafayette ABSTRACT The Enron debacle is one in a string of headlines focusing on accounting firms and individual CPAs who have \"crossed the line\" by e ngaging in unethical, or at least what is widely perceived as highly questionable and ill-advised conduc t. The purpose of this study is to provide further insight into issues of ethical and prof essional conduct in accounting via an examination of the perceptions of practitioners regarding the extent of ethical misconduct in accounting, the likelihood of serious sanctions being imposed for selected misconducts, and their direct personalexperience with ethical issues. The data for this study was gathered prior to the disclosure of the events surrounding Enron. The results provide evidence that accounting practitioners are largely comfortable with the ethical environment of the profession with few perceiving ethical misconduct as pervasive and most having a high opinion of the profession's concern about ethics. Practitioners perceived that the frequency of selected unethical activities is low and that those guilty of such acts will face severe sanctions. Relatively few accountants reported having felt pressured to engage in unethical conduct. However the findings reported in this study also provide evidence in contrast to the general sense of ethical well-bei ng. Most of the misconducts liste d in the study were perceived as occurring relatively infrequently. Yet, for many of these misbehav iors, a majority or close to a majority of the respondents had direct evidence of such behaviors occurring in practice. Thus, it appears that the profession of a ccounting does not, in reality, subs cribe to a zero-tolerance policy regarding non-compliance with rules with the result being the recent major setbacks to accounting's professi onal reputation. 1 The authors acknowledge the assistance of Drs.

Coulter, Western New England College Melissa J. Dahlquist, Andersen, LLP Melissa S. Madden, Western New England College ABSTRACT Ensuring the relevance of curricular coverage is an important and ongoing challenge for accounting educators. As the amount of information that may potentially be included in theaccounting curriculum continues to increase, care must be taken with respect to decisions aboutwhat should be included in a stude nt's course of study. Recent research suggests that there may be important differences between educators and practiti oners with regard to such issues (Albrecht and Sack, 2000). One area of particular concern is that of ethics. Some schools teach ethics by integrating them into existing courses and others teach th em as a standalone course. Even if taught as a separate course, there is some disagreement over the 'ideal' nature and content of the course (e.g., should it be taught by a busine ss school faculty member or by a philosophy professor?). Additionally, evidence exists to suggest that practitioners consider ethics to be a more importanttopic than do accounting educators (Albrecht and Sack, 2000). The present study examines issues concerning both the format and potential content of ethics in the accounting curriculum. A survey instrume nt was distributed to accounting professors and public accounting professionals asking for indications of the perceived importance of over threedozen ethics topics, and the pedagogical format in wh ich these topics should be delivered. Potential topics were selected from accounting ethics t extbooks and journal articles. Responses to these items were provided on 7-point scales, and additional in formation was solicited regarding possible means by which ethical topics could be covered in the classroom. Demographic information was also collected. Responses of 176 accounting faculty membe rs (mean = 15.7 years teaching experience) and 60 Big 5 accountants (mean = 40.9 months' experience) indicate the existence of both significantareas of agreement and disagreement with regard to the absolute and relative importance of topics. There was generally consistent agreement with resp ect to the optimal delivery format of ethical coverage. Both groups agree that there should be some lecture and discussion but that primary emphasis should be placed on case analysis. The overall findings of the study are discussed and placed in contexts that should assi st educators in the consideration of ethical coverage in their own courses.page 88 Allied Academies International Conference Nashville, 2002 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1Allied Academies International Conference page 89 Proceedings of the Academy for Studies in Business Law, Volume 6, Number 1 Nashville, 2002Authors' Index A r s e n a u l t , S .
