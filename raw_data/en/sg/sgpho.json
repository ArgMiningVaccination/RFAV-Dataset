The treatment of chronic diseases puts an unsustainable pressure on the current health services in acute hospitals and primary care services and has many personal impacts on those suffering with chronic disease. These chronic diseases can be prevented through improved health and wellbeing, adopting healthy lifestyle behaviours and making healthy choices. The cross-governmental Healthy Ireland Framework underpins a movement that is bringing together people and organisations from across the country to address the social, economic and environmental factors that contribute to the development of chronic disease and to address health inequalities. To help achieve this commitment for the health sector, the HSE published its first Healthy Ireland in the Health Services National Implementation Plan in 2015. This Plan identifies three overarching strategic priorities - Health Service Reform/Improvement, Reducing the Burden of Chronic Disease and Improving Staff Health and Wellbeing, along with a series of specific actions to help deliver on these priority areas for the health service and those it serves, including the development of Hospital Group and Community Health Organisation specific implementation plans. We welcome this plan from the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, which identifies a number of clear and tangible actions for the Hospital Group and the population it serves which will over time address these three priority areas. The Plan reflects on the fact that our services and our healthcare teams have enormous potential to influence the health and wellbeing of the people for whom we provide care and support. As well as being focused day to day on the challenge of providing high quality safe services the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group through this plan is focusing on the future and the challenge we face in terms of unsustainable healthcare costs driven by rising levels of chronic disease. Focusing on prevention, on reducing admissions and length of stay in constituent hospitals and its intention to work collaboratively with community, academic and external partners to support a joined-up approach to improving the health and wellbeing of the population it serves, positions the Hospital Group, along with fellow Hospital Groups supporting the Healthy Ireland agenda, as an agent for profound change. We would like to acknowledge the leadership being shown by the Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Susan O'Reilly, and staff across all levels of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. In particular, we would like to acknowledge the excellent work of the Steering Group, which has worked with the Hospital Group senior management team and with each individual hospital's management team within the Group as part of this development process. We would also like to acknowledge the work of staff in the Health and Wellbeing Division in Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe National DirectorHealth & Wellbeing DivisionHealth Services ExecutiveMr. Liam Woods National DirectorAcute Hospitals DivisionHealth Services Executive2 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 supporting the planning process and in forging positive working relationships at national and local level thereby strengthening our capability for implementation and for sustaining long term impact of this work. Given the size and scale of the Hospital Group, which serves a population of over 800,000 and has a staff of approximately 10,000, and with the support of their academic partner, Trinity College Dublin, we envisage that it will play a very significant role in the implementation of Healthy Ireland in the Health Services. We will continue to support their efforts in this regard nationally. The leadership, energy, vision and commitment, which is already evident in the implementation of many of the actions in this plan already underway, demonstrates how vision can be transformed into demonstrable change on the ground. 3 Dublin Midlands Hospital Group We are delighted to publish our first Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan. As you are aware, the HSE published Healthy Ireland in the Health Services Implementation Plan 2015 - 2017 in July 2015. Under this plan, each Hospital Group and Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) has been charged with developing its own Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan, outlining key activities, actions and timelines that meet national framework goals. The implementation of Healthy Ireland is also a key priority for the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, as set out in our recently published Operational Plan 2017. Last October 2016, we established a Steering Group, as per the national plan, to provide oversight and direction for the development of the Implementation Plan, under the chairmanship of Sonia Shortt, Group Director of Human Resources. In November 2016, we marked the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group Healthy Ireland initiative at a Healthy Ireland Day at Farmleigh, where colleagues from each of our seven hospitals shared details of the wonderful initiatives that are already being undertaken at hospital level. Moreover, this event was an official acknowledgement of our intention to commence work on the Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan for our group. I am happy to publish this plan as a road map for each of our hospitals to embrace the Healthy Ireland framework and facilitate its implementation. The actions included in this plan provide us with a baseline to begin a united approach to improving the health of all. Given the importance of this initiative for our Group, we will begin to review progress of the Implementation Plan through regular Performance Management Team meetings. Healthy Ireland is a new and exciting opportunity for the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group and my team and I welcome the prospect of empowering patients to become more pro-active in their health and wellbeing. In addition we will strive to help staff to improve their own health and wellbeing. I look forward to your continued support of this very worthwhile initiative. Dr. Susan O'Reilly CEODublin Midlands Hospital Group 4 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 As the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group's Healthy Ireland Executive Lead, I have had the pleasure of chairing the Steering Group which has worked to produce this Implementation Plan. I would like to thank all of those involved; the members of the Steering Group; the representatives of the individual hospitals and the staff and management of the seven hospitals. I would especially like to thank Helen Stokes, Project Lead, and Kirsten Doherty, Project Manager, for their contribution and expertise. I would also like to thank Sarah McCormack, HSE Health and Wellbeing Division, for her ongoing support during this process. The Implementation Plan provides an exciting challenge to reform and improve the health and wellbeing of our patients and staff and to reduce the burden of chronic disease. It commits us to action over the next three years and I look forward to continuing to work with our Hospitals' management and staff to progress Healthy Ireland.

Trinity College and the School of Medicine, as Academic Partners to the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, fully support the Group's Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan. The School's research programmes in Ageing, Population Health and Community Care and Health Policy fit well with the plan and can help to inform its ongoing development. 6 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 Overview of Dublin Midlands Hospital Group Dublin Midlands Hospital Group (DMHG) comprises of 7 clinical sites: St. James's Hospital Tallaght Hospital Naas General Hospital Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore The Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network (SLRON) The Group serves a population of approximately 800,000 people, with over 10,000 staff. The Hospital Group annual gross spend is approximately \u20ac1bn. In 2016, hospitals in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group treated around 90,000 in-patients and over 209,000 patients on a day case basis. Some 199,000 patients attended Emergency Departments, of which 59,000 were emergency admissions to hospitals within the Group. The Group's Strategic Plan focuses on improving clinical performance in scheduled/unscheduled care, the development of clinical networks and delivery systems to improve access to excellent care in accordance with the HIQA National standards for Safer Better Healthcare 1. This plan will be implemented in alignment with the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee 2 and the National Cancer Control Programme Guidelines3. The Group has already implemented a new formal Clinical and Operational Governance Model across the Statutory Hospitals. The Group collaborates closely with the Voluntary Hospitals in accordance with their Service Level Agreements in the planning and performance management of their services. In 2016 new service developments focused primarily on further development of the Coombe Women and Infants Hospital and the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise Maternity Network. This new service development also focused on increased capacity at St Lukes Radiation network. The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group will continue to work with colleagues across the Group. Together with all other internal and external stakeholders we will deliver optimum services for our patients within the resources available whilst ensuring that quality and patient safety remains a key priority. Profile of Population Served by Dublin Midlands Hospital Group Geographical Area The Dublin Midlands Hospital group (DMHG) covers a wide geographical area taking in parts of the counties of Dublin, Kildare, Westmeath, Wicklow, Laois and Offaly. DMHG also provides local and national specialty hospital services to people from both the neighbouring counties and further afield. DMHG overlaps with the community health areas of CHO7 (Kildare/West Wicklow, Dublin West, Dublin South City, Dublin South West) and CHO8 (Laois/Offaly, Longford/Westmeath, Louth/Meath). Population DMHG serves a population of approximately 800,000. Provisional results from the Census 2016 show that population growth in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group (4.6%) is slightly above that nationally (3.8%).Dublin Midlands Hospital Group (DMHG) 7 Dublin Midlands Hospital Group Ethnicity The population of DMHG is similar ethnically to the national population, with people whose nationality was other than white Irish in Census 2016 being 14.6% in DMHG and 14.3% in Ireland overall. However, there is greater representation of people from Poland and other countries outside of the European Union and less from the UK in DMHG compared to the national picture. Deprivation Within the geographic area on DMHG there are socio - economic differences worthy of note from Census 2016. Unemployment rates are higher (6.2% v 5.6% nationally). There is a lower concentration of people with third level education (17.8% v 18.5%). A higher proportion of the population are classified as disadvantaged or extremely disadvantaged (24.8% v 22.2%) The link between deprivation and chronic illness is well recognised. There is a two to four fold greater prevalence of all chronic diseases between those in lower socioeconomic groups relative to those in higher socioeconomic groups. Self-Perceived Health Within the DMHG area, people's perceptions of their own general health, based on the Census 2016, are similar to the national average. Age Profile The age profile of the population within the DMHG shows many similarities to the national population. Two differences have been observed: DMHG has a higher proportion of young adults aged 25 to 39 years than nationally (24.5% v 22%). There is a lower proportion of the population aged 65 years and over (11.5% v 13.5%). However, analysis of demographic changes since Census 2011 shows that certain age groups have increased at a greater rate in the DMHG area - Notably the 35-49 year age group and 60-74 year age group. This ageing population is more likely to have a variety of chronic diseases and will benefit from shared care with the community. DMHG will be supporting the population we serve through the Healthy Ireland actions outlined in this plan, which include the areas of healthy ageing, self-management support of chronic diseases and the development of clinical care pathways with CHOs 7 and 8.8 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 Health Atlas Finder - Area Profile CSO Census 2016 (de facto, provisional) - Hospital group - local catchment - Population Total Dublin ML Health Atlas Finder 15 Sep 2017 10.10.23Page 1 of 1Hospital group - local catchment Dublin MLArea Area change (since 2011)Ireland Ireland change (since 2011) Relative proportions # % # % # % # % AGE GROUP 13,090 n/a n/a +1,406 +1.3 671,494 14.1 +14,031 -12,140 386,498 8.1 Area9 Dublin Midlands Hospital Group Overview of Healthy Ireland Healthy Ireland Framework Healthy Ireland, the government framework for action to improve the health and wellbeing of people living in Ireland was launched in March 2013. The Healthy Ireland Framework 2013 - 2025 4 sets out a wide framework of actions that will be undertaken by government departments, public sector organisations, businesses, communities and individuals to improve health and wellbeing and reduce the risks posed to future generations. The vision is: 'A Healthy Ireland, where everyone can enjoy physical and mental health and wellbeing to their full potential, where wellbeing is valued and supported at every level of society and is everyone's responsibility.' The Framework describes four high-level goals with 64 actions; all Government Departments are working together to achieve these goals: Healthy Ireland in the Health Services In 2015 the Health Services published its first Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan - Healthy Ireland in the Health Services Implementation Plan 2013 - 2015 5. This plan identifies three strategic priorities: Health Service Reform Reducing the burden of Chronic Disease Improving staff health and wellbeing. Increase the proportion of people who are healthy at all stages of lifeReduce health inequalities Protect the public from threats to health and wellbeingCreate an environment where every sector of society can play its part 40 Healthy IrelandEducation Leisure timeCommunityWork Home Healthy Ireland: A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 - 2025, p. 4010 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 A suite of actions is described for each of these priorities. These are far reaching, incorporating systemic and organisational changes as well as a range of programmes to address modifiable lifestyle risk factors, and programmes to improve staff health and wellbeing. Of the 126 actions, 66 of these actions are specifically identified to support Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) to reduce the burden of chronic disease within the population we serve. These actions are prioritised under the six health and wellbeing policy priority programmes: Tobacco Free Healthy Eating and Active Living Alcohol Wellbeing and Mental Health Healthy Childhood Positive Ageing The actions in this plan have been developed to support the implementation of these 66 actions, focusing on the key risk factors involved in chronic disease. The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group has created the following diagram to illustrate the three overarching strategic priorities.

They include diabetes, cancer, heart and lung diseases and mental health problems. The increasing rate of chronic diseases places significant demands on our health service, accounting for: 80% of GP consultations 40% of admissions 76% of all bed days 6 55% of hospital expenditure6 Chronic diseases and their risk factors are the main drivers of healthcare costs, and are predicted to increase by up to 40% by 2020 5. Much can be done to prevent chronic disease developing, if the incidence of key risk factors is reduced. Almost 35% of cancer-related deaths and almost 65% of cardiovascular disease deaths are attributable to several preventable risk factors. These key known risk factors are: Smoking Alcohol Poor diet Physical inactivity Tobacco exposure alone is responsible for 73% of Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease (COPD), while poor diet and inactivity can lead to people being overweight or obese, high blood pressure and high cholesterol - all of which are associated with an increased chance of developing cardiovascular disease. The economic cost to the health care system and to society, related to several risk factors, has been calculated: Alcohol-related illnesses: 10% of the cost of hospital care 7 Tobacco-related disease: 6 - 15% of the total health budget8 Overweight and obesity: approximately 2.7% of total health expenditure 9 Physical inactivity: estimated to cost up to \u20ac1.5 billion per year in Ireland for direct healthcare costs and indirect costs 10 The Integrated Care Programmes are providing the framework for the prevention and management of chronic disease. A National Self-Management Support Framework is also being developed to guide the integration of prevention 11 and intervention requirements into models of care, starting with the four demonstrator areas of Diabetes, Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease (COPD), Asthma and Heart Failure. Alongside this, National Policy Priority Programmes are in place for areas such as child health 12, tobacco, alcohol, healthy eating, active living, positive ageing, and staff health and wellbeing. These programmes have identified the actions which form the basis of the DMHG Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan. Self Management Support is the provision of education and supportive interventions to increase the person's knowledge, skills and confidence in managing their condition. The patient-health professional relationship changes from the traditional approach to a partnership where the patient is an active participant in their care 11. The Health Information and Quality Authority's National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare 1 includes two standards with particular relevance to Healthy Ireland: Standard 1.9 recommends supporting service users in maintaining and improving their own health and wellbeing; 12 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 Standard 4.1 recommends promoting, protecting and improving the health and wellbeing of service users. These standards illustrate the importance of the service user's involvement in managing their own health, and the necessity of ensuring that the health information we provide is clear to enable the user to participate fully in protecting their health. Health literacy affects the ability of people to make decisions for their health and is highlighted in the Healthy Ireland in the Health Services National Implementation Plan 2015 - 2017 as an area that requires training and audit 5. Several national strategies are associated with Healthy Ireland. The National Drugs Strategy 13 included actions on collaboration across health services, including hospitals, as well as on screening of people presenting with early indicators of drug and alcohol issues, using a uniform brief intervention tool and referral where appropriate. Prevention is the cornerstone of the National Cancer Strategy 2017 - 2026 14 as it offers the most cost-effective, long-term approach for cancer control. The strategy states that 'prevention measures will be integrated with the overall health and wellbeing initiatives under the Healthy Ireland programme' as approximately 30% to 40% of cancer incidence is attributable to modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors, of which smoking has the biggest impact. As the evidence on smoking cessation for cancer survivors is not disputed, the strategy states that those who smoke should be given appropriate smoking cessation support as part of their treatment regime. Diet, exercise and alcohol are also areas addressed, for prevention of cancer, reduction of recurrence rates for certain cancers and to counteract some of the long-term effects of cancer treatments.Making Every Contact Count 15 is a strategy which will capitalise on the daily opportunities experienced by health care professionals to support patients in changing behaviours which are having an impact on their current health, or which may influence their health in the future. It will help health professionals to use their routine consultations to empower people to make healthier choices, and will allow health professionals to move to a position where discussion of lifestyle behaviour is routine, non-judgemental and central to everyone's role. The Implementation of Making Every Contact Count is a key deliverable in the Healthy Ireland in the Health Services National Implementation Plan 2015 - 2017 5. The model for Making Every Contact Count in the Health Services is presented as a pyramid with different levels. Each level represents an intervention of increasing intensity with the low intensity interventions at the bottom of the pyramid and the specialised services at the top. Implementing this approach begins the process at the basic level of brief advice and brief intervention. In practice this means that all health professional and healthcare assistants will be trained to a level that enables them to conduct a brief intervention with their patients when appropriate. The training modules and the process for implementation, together with tools for the recording of risk factors and the interventions delivered are under development at national level. 13 Dublin Midlands Hospital Group The DMHG see the benefits of using the key opportunities we have in providing services for a population of over 800,000 to implement Making Every Contact Count. Staff Health and WellbeingThe HSE, the largest employer in the State, has a great opportunity to protect the health and wellbeing of its workforce, given the World Health Organisation (WHO) evidence that workplace health programmes provide benefits to both employers and employees 16. In addition, HSE staff can be positive role models in their interactions with patients and within their own communities. A number of initiatives are underway which will support us in achieving this objective. The national Healthy Workplace Framework currently under development by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation will provide us with guidance for the development and sustaining of healthy workplaces within our Hospital Group.The HSE National Healthy Workplace Policy together with the HSE National Worksite Health Score Card will provide a measurement tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the initiatives that we implement. To support our work underway in this area and to build our capacity for the future we are supporting three staff in this year to undertake the new Post Graduate Certificate in Workplace Wellness through the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG). We will continue to support staff to develop their skills and be champions for the development of Healthy Workplaces and improve staff health and wellbeing. These national initiatives will help to guide the implementation of the Staff Health and Wellbeing actions in the DMHG Healthy Ireland Plan.14 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 15 Dublin Midlands Hospital Group DMHG started working on the development of this Healthy Ireland Plan in the autumn of 2016, with a launch and allocation to all the hospitals of Healthy Ireland funding for staff health and wellbeing initiatives. The HSE Healthy Ireland Lead and the DMHG Healthy Ireland Project Manager organised communication sessions in all the hospitals to inform hospital staff of the strategy. Alongside this activity, each hospital completed a questionnaire on the infrastructure and activities which existed to support the rollout of Healthy Ireland. DMHG Healthy Ireland Current Activity - Patients The Healthy Ireland survey of DMHG hospitals established the level of Healthy Ireland activity currently taking place in the areas of prevention and management of chronic disease. These showed commonalities between hospitals in the services provided, but also areas which need building on, and where links need to be established to community services. DMHG will collaborate with Community Health Organisations 7 and 8 in the development of agreed clinical care pathways. DMHG is supportive of exploring ways of extending well-evaluated initiatives throughout the hospital group. Services for Patients Services and referral pathways exist for the following areas in some DMHG hospitals: \u00fcsmoking cessation \u00fcobesity \u00fcheart failure \u00fcrespiratory disease \u00fcpromotion of breast feeding and maternity education programmes (in the hospitals providing maternity services) \u00fcdementia care Healthy EnvironmentThe HSE Tobacco Free Campus, Calorie Posting and Healthier Vending Policies have been implemented in several of the hospitals and the completion of this work will contribute to providing a healthy environment for patients, staff and visitors. Some hospitals have used art work, music and gardens to create areas for patients, visitors and staff members to relax. Examples of Healthy Ireland Activity in DMHG hospitals are outlined in the following pages. Naas General Hospital 'Whisper Sanctuary' was funded by the 'Friends of Naas Hospital' Committee. Patients, family and hospital staff members can avail of a quiet space which engages the senses, provides a place of refuge from the hustle and bustle of the hospital, and promotes healing. Healthy Ireland in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group - Current Activity16 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 St. James's Hospital The Creative Life Centre for successful ageing in St James's Hospital promotes and highlights the creativity of older people to enhance psychological and emotional well-being. The centre focuses on enabling older people to express themselves through art, sculpture, poetry, literature, music and drama. The Creative Life Centre at the Mercer's Institute for Successful Ageing hosted a series of lunchtime talks on art in the summer of 2017 exploring a variety of art concepts. These informal lectures were attended by patients, their families, St James's Hospital staff and members of the local community. This experience led to an initiative to focus on and enhance creativity based learning, which in turn reflects the value of the person centred model of care. PhotoVoice is a participatory process which uses photography and digital story telling methods to provide an opportunity for engagement within groups as well as advocacy and research. The project offers a means of enabling participants to set their own agenda in terms of articulating their illness experience and to choose their target audience. At the same time, their photographs offer a powerful insight into the background and foreground of illness. Participants continue this journey utilising PhotoVoice for COPD advocacy. Engagement in the PhotoVoice project has been an enriching experience for the facilitators. It has created a space where patients and healthcare professionals meet as co-learners. 17 Dublin Midlands Hospital Group Naas General Hospital Naas General Hospital runs a six-week Memory Strategy Education Programme for patients and carers/family which focuses on individualised strategies to compensate for memory impairment. The physiotherapy and dietetic departments run a 'Health DIY Information Class' - a one-hour talk focussing on small sustainable changes to diet and daily activity levels to help patients manage joint pain. As well as advice, optional biometric measures are offered, e.g. BMI, percentage body fat and metabolic age. The benefit of offering a repeat \"drop-in\" re-measurement two months after the talk is also being monitored. Parkinson's and Pulmonary rehabilitation groups are also being run. An innovative aspect of Cardiac Rehabilitation is the Basic Life Support programme for the family and friends of patients. This is one part of their well-developed programme which supports patients initially in the hospital setting but also as they move into Phase IV care in the community. Speech and language therapists and dieticians in Naas are running a number of training sessions for nurses and Health Care Assistants centred on nutrition. These are aimed at improving patient care and mealtime experience with focus placed on thickening drinks, modified diets and how to feed patients correctly. The post of Clinical Nurse Specialist in Physical Health Monitoring was established as a quality initiative within Kildare West Wicklow Mental Health Services in 2017. One of the main purposes of this role is to guide and standardise the practice of physical health monitoring throughout this mental health service with the aim of earlier detection of physical health issues in persons with a serious mental illness. The target patient population is both hospital and community based. 18 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 Tallaght Hospital New methods of using technology to assist patients include the Tallaght Hospital Patient Connect app. This facilitates two-way communication between patients and their healthcare team members to get the right information to the patient at the right time, while also allowing patients to provide real-time feedback. Social prescribing is defined as \"a mechanism for linking patients with non - medical sources of support within the community\". This has been widely used as an intervention to reintegrate people who are feeling isolated and are in need of support to re-join society. The process also offers a structured pathway to supports in the community for patients from specialist interventions in hospitals. Tallaght hospital is a partner in the exploration of a social prescribing project with local community structures. 19 Dublin Midlands Hospital Group Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital The staff of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital (CWIUH) are committed to providing excellence in the care of women and infants. The National Maternity Strategy 2016-2026 Creating a Better Future Together has prioritised health and wellbeing during pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period as well as the health and wellbeing of babies to ensure they get the best start in life. The Master/CEO of the CWIUH, Dr Sharon Sheehan, a member of the Maternity Strategy Committee joins with all the staff of the CWIUH to continuously strive to improve the health and wellbeing of the women, infants and families who are cared for. While exempt from the National Patient Experience Survey 2017, the CWIUH were eager to assess the satisfaction of the women who use the hospital's services. Gynaecology patients were surveyed, and the results have been overwhelmingly positive in keeping with their current feedback from their own 'Compliments, Complaints and Suggestions' service. From a nutritional perspective, the CWIUH have been active in asking patients for feedback and making changes to the menu to suit their needs. This has resulted in long stay patients being reviewed by the Catering Liaison Officer to ensure they are getting enough variety in their diet. They have included a salad and hot option every evening for tea and reduced the number of mixed grill and fried food meals. The staff dining room and coffee shop, accessible to service users and their families have commenced calorie posting and the promotion of healthy options. The two vending machines are stocked by catering staff with healthy meals and snacks. Together, the Catering Department and the Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics Department undertook a full review including menu analysis, patient satisfaction surveys, and patient and staff evaluations. Inpatient meals now include appropriate healthy options and consider calorific intake requirements. A newly-appointed dietician will support the education and management of diabetes in pregnant women, women with obesity and other women with specific nutritional needs. The dietician manager continues to develop and improve patient resources and education and in addition, participates on a national level in clinical care programmes. Women with the support of their partners are encouraged to use birthing aids such as birthing balls, bean bags and mats. All midwives and support staff educate and support women in the use of these birthing aids. 20 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 A number of midwives have successfully completed a module in High Dependency Care to care for women with more complex needs. The Parent Education Department offers various antenatal class options for women and their partners to attend in close proximity to the hospital and in the community. Several midwives have trained in hypnobirthing and classes are provided in the antenatal period. The Neonatal Unit strives to practice Family Centred Developmental Care. Its staff have participated in Foundations in Family Centred Care (FINE) Level 1 and Level 2, which provide a comprehensive evidence based introduction to family centred developmental care for the multidisciplinary team which positively impacts on the experience of parents and their hospitalised infant. The CWIUH offers Perinatal Mental Health Services with a Consultant Perinatal Mental Health Psychiatrist and Perinatal Mental Health Clinical Midwife Specialist. The Physiotherapy Department provides antenatal education which is evaluated very well. The importance of exercise is stressed both generally and during pregnancy and women are encouraged to take part in appropriate exercise regimes. Most women are aware of the benefits of regular exercise but are unsure about what kind of exercise and they should do during pregnancy. Physiotherapy postnatal classes provide advice on pelvic floor muscle exercises, abdominal exercises, back care, techniques for bending, carrying and lifting and good feeding positions. Various studies are examining ways of improving care and services to patients. Water for comfort in labour has been provided since 2013 when a pool was installed in our birthing suite. To date, almost 350 women have used the pool for labour and of these over 100 have had a water birth. The pool is offered to healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies in a study which aims to compare labour and birth outcomes of women choosing to use the birthing pool with women opting for conventional care. A study looking at the effects of healthy living by pregnant women at high risk of developing gestational diabetes compared pregnancy outcomes in women who follow a medically-supervised exercise programme, with Facebook support, during their pregnancy and for six weeks afterwards, against standard antenatal care. Other studies are looking at breast milk and at smoking in pregnancy. 21 Dublin Midlands Hospital Group Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise The staff at Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise (MRHP) are committed to providing help and support for patients and colleagues to lead a healthy active lifestyle. The Hospital offers a wide range of services to patients that promote a healthy lifestyle. MRHP is a Tobacco-free campus with six members of staff trained in 'Brief intervention'. Smoking cessation support is available to all patients and this includes the prescribing and dispensing of nicotine patches. The Hospital recently took part in the National Patient Experience Survey 2017. Results of the survey have been very positive and have aided in continuing to provide the best care to patients and their families. The Catering Department in the hospital has achieved a Gold Healthy Heart Award from the Irish Heart Foundation. The canteen has implemented calorie posting for the last 12 months and provides a wide variety of balanced healthy meals to both patients and staff. MRHP works closely with the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics to provide specialised nutritional requirements for patients. The hospital also has on-site vending machines stocking 60% healthy eating options available for staff, patients and visitors, day or night. The National Programme for Older People (NCPOP), in collaboration with the Quality Improvement Division (QID) and the Irish Hospice Foundation (IHF), are partnering with MRHP to pilot the roll out of 'What Matters to Me'. 'What Matters to Me' is a person-centred approach to care for older people. Several staff members are involved in the pilot, which is currently being carried out in the A&E department as well as the Medical Ward. Feedback thus far has proven very positive from both the patients and their families. MRHP run mandatory training in Dementia awareness for staff, in order to improve their knowledge and help with caring for Dementia patients. The hospital also has a cardiac rehabilitation facility available on site which has a high attendance rate. 22 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 Within the maternity services, antenatal classes are offered to all mothers and their birth partners. Antenatal physiotherapy classes are also offered. A weekly breastfeeding workshop, facilitated by lactation consultants, is also available to all expectant mothers. Extra breastfeeding classes are also available for mothers with gestational diabetes. Each visit to the antenatal clinic provides midwives with the opportunity to \"Make Every Contact Count\". During these visits they discuss smoking cessation, healthy eating in pregnancy, breastfeeding and remaining active in pregnancy. Throughout the hospital, patients are supported and encouraged to engage with the healthcare team. 23 Dublin Midlands Hospital Group St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network (SLRON) SLRON has examples of health and wellbeing initiatives available to patients in various areas: Relaxation Sessions using Progressive Muscular Relaxation - weekly 30 minute sessions for patients and their family members to help with sleep, pain management, stressful emotions and an overall sense of well-being. Bibliotherapy service - this is the use of books for therapeutic purposes. Quality self-help books have been known to reduce emotional and psychological distress. The service is managed by our in-house Librarian and provides a wide selection of books from our Wellness Library which are made available to our in-patients and out-patients. The books were all carefully selected by the Psych-Oncology team in the St. Luke's Radiation Centre at St. Luke's Hospital. Cancer Thriving and Surviving - this is derived from the Standford University Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme. It is a 6 week programme available to patients across the Network to assist them in developing greater self-efficacy. The programme is based on group discussion and personalised action plans. CLIMB programme - this is a 6 week programme available at the St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Centre at Beaumont Hospital. CLIMB stands for 'Children's Lives Include Moments of Bravery'. The programme aims to assist children between the ages of 5-12, whose parents are undergoing Radiation Therapy treatment for cancer, to process their emotions and improve their coping skills. Each weekly session has a specific goal regarding a particular feeling and uses activities that are carefully focused around each goal. The programme is run in conjunction with the support of the Medical Social Work department in Beaumont Hospital. Smoking cessation clinics are held monthly for patients. The clinics include Carbon Monoxide monitoring which provides an instant result and is very beneficial in helping patients to track their progess towards a healthier lifestyle. Arts & crafts - a diverse range of art projects from acrylic and watercolour painting to felt making and pottery is offered. All sessions are held in the Activity Centre in the St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Centre at St. Luke's Hospital. The Activity Centre is registered with the HSE Arts Committee. Activities are structured to appeal to the total beginner as well as to patients with previous experience of arts and crafts. 24 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 Beauty therapy and complementary therapy - this is available across the Network and includes free-of-charge facials, pedicures, aromatherapy massage and reflexology. Chiropody services are also available. Sl\u00ed na Sl\u00e1inte have been created to promote physical activity. Development of an interactive herb garden at the St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Centre at St. Luke's Hospital is planned for 2018. This will be developed in conjunction with our on-site gardeners. The aim is to encourage in-patients to spend some time outdoors with our on-site gardeners to produce a range of aromatic herbs. 25 Dublin Midlands Hospital Group Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore A recent seminar held in Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore explored how specific art projects contribute to patient care. The seminar examined how the practice of art in medical and healthcare environments can humanise and enhance experiences for patients, staff and visitors. The arts are now a part of rehabilitation in care settings and the Anam Beo Arts, Health and Wellbeing programme is a developed, strong and viable method of practise in Offaly. In an attempt to reduce the feelings of claustrophobia often experienced by patients undergoing an MRI, MRHT placed LED skylight pictures on the ceilings of the scanner room, the recovery room and some long corridors which have no natural light. Their new toilets are all disability-friendly and they have used colours recommended for patients suffering from dementia. A healing garden including a variety of plants with healing properties such as lavender and thyme was introduced to the facility. The theme of statuettes included within this environment is \"Slow Release of Doves\" to symbolise the care received by the healing hands in the hospital. The 'Hello My Name Is' campaign is to remind healthcare staff about the importance of introductions in healthcare. It was launched in Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore in 2016 with more than 1,000 staff signing up to the initiative. #EndPJparalysis is a social movement which encourages patients to get up, dressed and moving while in hospital to reduce the risk of increasing dependence and other harms. This new initiative is commencing in October 2017. The hospital has set up a patient focus group to gather patient experiences regarding therapeutic diets within the hospital. This identifies trends in feedback and utilises this information to steer service provision. To date, the members of the focus group have identified areas where the hospital is doing well and areas for improvement. They have also been involved in the development and approval of patient education leaflets. One member now also sits as a patient representative on the hospital working group looking at modified consistency diets. 26 Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 DMHG Healthy Ireland Current Activity - Staff Our Staff ProfileThere are over 10,000 people working in the DMHG (Tables 2 and 3). Findings from the Health Sector National Staff Survey 2016 17 show the high levels of motivation (70%) and enthusiasm (68%) for their work that exist amongst staff. A large majority (86%) also felt that their role makes a difference to patients and service users. Twenty-nine percent agreed that the organisation is genuinely interested in the wellbeing of its staff, while 42% felt that the organisation encourages a healthy lifestyle. Future surveys will allow evaluation of aspects of the Staff Health and Wellbeing actions in this plan.

This involves creating a physical and supportive environment where staff, patients and visitors can make healthier choices, as well as organising activities for staff. Between 2016 and 2017 a total of \u20ac70,000 was provided by the HSE's National Health and Wellbeing Division for staff initiatives to be delivered in DMHG hospitals.Activities have included step challenges, choirs and art classes. Due to the stresses involved in emergency work, one hospital is trialling a mindfulness course for staff in its Emergency Department, with Trinity College Dublin, our academic partner. Other DMHG hospitals have also organised programmes relating to stress reduction and resilience. If successful, DMHG, will explore the possibility of extending successful programmes to other departments and hospitals.27Dublin Midlands Hospital Group Creating a healthy environment involves putting in place facilities such as bike parking, as well as implementing the policies mentioned previously in the area of healthy eating and smoking. Most of the DMHG hospitals have implemented the Irish Heart Foundation Active@work programme and the majority have become National Transport Authority Smarter Travel Partners, thus availing of the support these organisations provide in promoting physical activity. These initiatives benefit all users of DMHG hospitals. DMHG will build on the expertise gained by the staff studying for the NUIG Post-Graduate Certificate in Workplace Wellness and use it to evaluate current activities and identify best practice for the future. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

While our employee assistance programme has been in existence for some time, we were becoming more aware of the research regarding the benefits of health and wellbeing for staff. In recent times, we have supported the funding and facilitation of Mindfulness Workshops for staff and a very successful Operation Transformation Programme. We have also facilitated a Wellbeing at Work Day and a Mental Health Awareness Week in line with national programmes. Our Baked by the Coombe brought together the best amateur chefs and bakers within the hospital with the ensuing recipe book raising funds for charity. Staff have also established the CWIUH Workplace Choir, singing at events for both staff and the women and babies we care for. In the summer of 2016, to support Healthy Ireland and the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group's strategic priority 'Improving Staff Health and Wellbeing', the CWIUH Health and Wellbeing Group was formally established. This group comprises of champions from various departments within the hospital who are committed to enhancing the health and wellbeing of their colleagues. To date, the group has been instrumental in running some very successful wellbeing initiatives for staff, as well as providing on-going support for established programmes as noted above. Our motto is 'Caring for health and wellbeing together', as we recognise the importance of working together to make the CWIUH a healthy and happy place to work. Caring Together Working within a busy and often stressful environment, we are very aware of the impact that traumatic events can have on a person. Thanks to the funding we have received from Healthy Ireland, we are now The Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital 29Dublin Midlands Hospital Group in the final stages of planning our Critical Incident Stress Management programme for staff. Stepping Out TogetherIn the autumn of 2016, 120 employees took part in the first CWIUH Step Challenge. 12 teams of 10 people walked 30,846,815 steps. This initiative got people moving and also enhanced colleague relationships. Transforming TogetherOur second Operation Transformation had over 150 registrants in 2017. Weekly weigh-ins, Sunday morning walks and a special offer for gym membership at a local gym for the duration of the programme was facilitated. Our staff canteen offered delicious, healthy meals inspired by the Operation Transformation programme. During this time, we also celebrated the 'Love Life, Love Walking' campaign on St Valentine's Day with a stairs challenge and walks in the local area. Calorie Counting TogetherThe Health and Wellbeing Group supported and promoted the successful introduction of calorie posting in the staff canteen. This has made employees more aware of the calories we eat and encouraged healthier options. These endeavours have recently been rewarded with an Irish Heart Foundation Happy Heart Silver Award.Working Together We celebrated National Wellbeing at Work Day by promoting mental and physical health. On the day, events included a Climb the Stairs challenge, a nutrition talk, a Wii Hula Hoop Challenge and a chill out zone. We garnered the support of local businesses for the day: a neighbouring hairdresser gave styling tips, a local gym sponsored and facilitated a plank challenge, and a local bicycle shop helped us to promote the Cycle to Work Scheme. The success of the health and wellbeing events in the CWIUH is attributed to the commitment of the Health and Wellbeing Group, the support of senior management, and the participation of all employees of the CWIUH. Our upcoming projects include the CISM programme and Mental Health Awareness Week. We also aim to promote how healthy living is not always just about doing, sometimes it is simply taking time \"to be\" and in quiet times we get to reflect and see how we can improve our situation. It is only by 'caring for health and wellbeing together' that we can work towards the vision of wellbeing being valued and supported at every level and reap the benefits of doing so both for ourselves and our organisation.30Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 Introduction We have held four Healthy Ireland information sessions for Staff at Naas General Hospital to support the Healthy Ireland initiative and participated in positive campaigns to promote health and wellbeing as outlined below. Caring Together The Little Things Campaign was promoted at the hospital alongside a volunteer music programme and participation in Poetry Ireland day. We promoted the alcohol awareness week in partnership with South Western Regional Drug & Alcohol Task Force that was well received by our staff at the hospital.Naas General Hospital is a tobacco free campus. We support the continued roll out of the Tobacco Free Campus Policy in Naas General Hospital and we held two brief intervention training days held for Community Healthcare Organisation 7 and Hospital staff. We have implemented smoking cessation clinics and developed a referral pathway for staff to stop smoking alongside promoting the new QUIT campaign. Naas General Hospital participated fully in the National Dementia Awareness Week. Naas General Hospital promoted the new Food Pyramid and expanded the Sl\u00ed Na Sl\u00e1inte route at the hospital for all the staff to enjoy and keep fit at the workplace.Working Together Workplace Health Initiatives aimed at improving an overall sense of positive health and wellbeing included a January staff research and education forum with a health and wellbeing theme. There was also the launch of calorie posting in the staff canteen. The hospital participated in a 4-week Operation Transformation programme which included a pre-and post-body composition analyser review, blood pressure check and a step challenge for 10,000 steps per day with the distribution of pedometers to staff. Emphasis was put on providing dietary information to those who do shift work as this was highlighted as an issue previously. This was achieved by circulating information to staff via email with hard copies provided to those without access to email. New bike parking was installed at Naas General Hospital to facilitate cycling, while the staff breastfeeding room was refurbished and painted. Stepping Out TogetherFor the 3rd year in a row \"Take a Hike\" hill walks were organised and staff participation was enthusiastic. In February 2017, our staff joined with their colleagues in Community Healthcare Organisation 7 to participate in \"Love Life, Love Walking\" day and participated in the 'Steps to Health' step challenge in May to June 2017. The hospital also provided reduced rate yoga classes and reflexology services.Naas General Hospital 31Dublin Midlands Hospital Group Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise Introduction Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise (MRHP) is a keen participant in Healthy Ireland and we have developed a number of activities for staff to take part in to promote health and wellbeing at the workplace. A number of these activities are listed below. Transforming Together5-a-side soccer for staff commenced on Monday nights in the Leisure Centre, Portlaoise. This was widely promoted in the hospital and all interested staff are encouraged to join. In February 2017 we developed a weight- loss programme over a 12-week period for staff. This programme provided staff with regular weight checks and specific detailed dietary information. Each week we covered new topics and welcomed input from staff as well. The programme took place every Thursday morning at the Cardiac Rehab Gym from 7-8am. Stepping Out TogetherMRHP established a step challenge amongst staff. Winners were the team with the most number of steps. We encourage teams to contact each other using WhatsApp groups and to help motivate their team. Team leaders are included in the weekly Healthy Ireland email issued every Sunday. A leader board is published outside the canteen so teams can see how they are doing.The Walking Group goes for a walk every Tuesday and Thursday at 1pm from the main doors of the Hospital. Fifteen minutes/1,850 steps bring staff through the grounds of St Fintans and back. We encourage staff to take the longer 45-minute walk via Colliers Lane and the Borris Road which is 5,700 steps. We hope to develop a family friendly hill walking group for Sunday afternoons in the future. Working Together MRHP's choir meets every Tuesday in the Chapel of Rest. Choir members find it to be a great way to de-stress and also good for their posture and mental health. Earlier in the year the choir were preparing for a competition in May 2017. We also encourage smoking cessation and remind staff that MRHP is a non-smoking campus. 32Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 Introduction Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore(MRHT) is an active participant in the Healthy Ireland Programme and we have a wide variety of initiatives to promote health and wellbeing at our work place. Our commitment is evident in the work of the MRHT Health and Wellbeing group along with the support from Hospital management. Stepping Out Together Since January 2017 we have developed an indoor and outdoor Sl\u00ed na Sl\u00e1inte that is very popular with staff. We successfully launched our first five week MRHT Steps to Health Challenge in May 2017, with over 100 staff members registering to get involved. We have also successfully developed an annual \"MRHT Fittest Department Challenge\" which started in September 2016. Working TogetherWe work closely with other groups within the hospital e.g. dieticians, to organise MRHT Operation Transformation. This includes; weekly weigh-ins for staff, before and after body mass index (BMI) sessions, and weekly meal plans along with the canteen providing daily Operation Transformation meal options. In addition, staff now have access to weighing scales for weight monitoring which is located in the main foyer of the hospital. The Health and Wellbeing group have organised lunchtime walking groups, evening running groups, pilates and exercise classes for staff. We also support national initiatives such as the \"Love Life Love Walking\" campaign. Caring TogetherIn 2016, the hospital was successful in receiving funding from Healthy Ireland which was used to train willing staff as mindfulness instructors in order to roll out mindfulness to staff. We regularly organise lunchtime mindfulness sessions for staff and encourage participation. We are also involved in promoting the \"Little Things Campaign\" which focuses on positive mental health. Transforming TogetherThe hospital has and will continue to support annual Smoking Cessation Awareness Days, which is led by our Smoking Cessation Nurses, along with a self-referral pathway programme for patients and staff to quit smoking. Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore 33Dublin Midlands Hospital Group The hospital also supported the Health and Wellbeing group in organising a number of National Health Months including cervical cancer, led by our Oncology ANP, which provided lunchtime education talks for staff. We also successfully organised our first \"MRHT Staff Health and Wellbeing Day\" in June of 2016.The hospital continues to support the Health and Wellbeing Group in organising and developing initiatives, which embrace the vision of Healthy Ireland where \"wellbeing is valued and supported at every level of management and is everyone's responsibility\" (HIA Framework for improved health and wellbeing 2013-2025).34Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 Introduction The SLRON Healthy Ireland Committee was formed in February 2017and launched our Healthy Ireland programme in May 2017. Our initial aim is to focus on health & wellbeing in the workforce by promoting staff wellness and resilience across the Network. This will be achieved through a combination of Healthy Ireland initiatives, on-going improvements to staff facilities and improved access to support services. We have an interactive section on our Intranet which is updated on a regular basis and provides a range of links to HSE health & wellbeing initiatives, support services and HSE health campaigns. Transforming Together SLRON offers weekly on-site Yoga and Pilates classes to staff across the Network. The Catering Department in the St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Centre at St. Luke's Hospital (SLROC SLH) runs initiatives like 'guess the calories' competitions. Full Calorie Posting was introduced in August 2017. Calories were calculated (where applicable) from our chefs' in-house recipes. During the Calorie Posting launch we ran daily 'menu calorie hunt' competitions to increase awareness among staff and visitors alike, in order to encourage more health conscious food choices. Feedback has been extremely positive and the Catering Department will continue to implement even healthier nutritional, seasonal recipes.SLRON's Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics (CND) produces a Nutrition Tip of the Month which is emailed to all SLRON staff and published on the Intranet every month. They also run regular campaigns like 'Know your Numbers' where staff are informed of their BMI, body composition and waist circumference and educated about healthy portion sizes. Our 'Wellness Library' was established in 2016, offering staff, patients and their relatives a wide range of quality self-help books. Resources were carefully selected by the SLRON Psycho-Oncology team and the librarian in SLROC SLH to cover a range of topics including depression, anxiety, grief, body image etc. SLRON holds smoking cessation clinics once a month in SLROC SLH. Clinics are open to staff and patients and also provide carbon monoxide monitoring. Stepping Out TogetherSLRON joined the HSE 'Steps to Health Challenge' in 2017, with 30 teams from across the Network participating. We walked 23 million steps during the 5 week challenge. SLRON won the best overall name in the competition with the very original \"St. Luke's Skywalkers\". This challenge was one of the initiatives St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network (SLRON)35Dublin Midlands Hospital Group highlighted at our Healthy Ireland launch, with a 'boost your steps' treadmill in place for five minute boost slots on the day. SLROC SLH developed indoor and outdoor 'Sl\u00ed na Sl\u00e1inte' pathways in 2008 incorporating our woodland walk. This is well used by staff, patients and visitors. The St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Centre at Beaumont Hospital (SLROC BH) is working with our host hospital to develop a 'Sl\u00ed' on the Beaumont Hospital Campus. SLRON staff also participated in the HSE's \"Love Life, Love Walking\" campaign in February 2017, with staff members walking as groups or individuals during their breaks. As part of a 15 member team, seven SLRON staff successfully completed the 'Hell and Back' 7km obstacle challenge held in Kilruddery Demesne, Co. Wicklow in September 2017. The event was a wonderful team building experience and no man (or woman) was left behind. Working Together In January each year the hospital runs a multi-disciplinary programme in line with RTE's Operation Transformation. This includes a programme of weekly weigh-ins, nutritional advice, organised walks, physical activity events and information stands. Catering offer healthy and delicious meals inspired by the Operation Transformation programme. The Physiotherapy Department also circulates a monthly \"Physio Matters\" bulletin providing physical activity and exercise tips for staff. Additional bike racks are being provided due to the increase over the last year in the number of staff cycling to work. Staff in the St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Centre at St. James's Hospital (SLROC SJH) have access to the free fortnightly 'Cycle Clinic' which is located on the host hospital campus. In conjunction with Occupational Health, Psycho-Oncology, Nursing, Physiotherapy, Catering and CND, we provided a range of information stands at our Healthy Ireland launch. Areas covered included nutrition, exercise, sleep, mindfulness, managing boundaries, blood pressure, smoking cessation and carbon monoxide monitoring. Our Healthy Ireland Committee continue to plan and run events for staff to tie in with HSE and WHO campaigns, for example 'Healthy Food Day' etc. A full range of art activities is available to patients in SLROC SLH. We aim to extend this to staff by introducing photography classes and a range of art related activities and events. 36Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 Introduction The hospital recognises that the wellbeing of employees is central in the delivery of the highest quality services and is committed to creating and maintaining a work environment that both attracts and retains employees, where employees feel valued and motivated to reach their full potential. The Centre for Learning & Development (CLD) is a hub for staff wellbeing within the hospital. The Staff Wellness Committee was established in 2015, with the overall purpose to develop, implement and continuously evaluate a comprehensive Staff Wellness Programme, which entails sharing of best practice and a consistent approach to the promotion of wellbeing in the workplace. CLD offers a range of mindfulness courses, resilience training, and exercise programmes. Stepping Out Together Hospital Staff are encouraged to take part in the Women's Mini Marathon and the St. James's Hospital Foundation and organise the annual Liberties Fun Run in the local area. Over 1,000 entrants participated in the Fun Run in 2016, many of them staff members. The St. James's Fitness King and Queen Programme was run in co-ordination with Clinical Nutrition, Physiotherapy and Clinical Psychology in 2015, to support staff who wished to participate in achieving weight loss in a healthy way - similar to the concept of the 'Operation Transformation' programme run by RT\u00c9. The fitness drive consisted of 8 weeks of education, weekly weigh-ins and opt-in supervised exercise classes. At the weekly weigh-in participants were encouraged to share tips, recipes and discuss how they found the process. Transforming TogetherThe Clinical Nutrition Department developed healthy heart recipes for the staff canteen in conjunction with the Catering Department. Dieticians manned an information stand at the canteen to educate staff about salt and heart health and the simple changes you can make to your diet. In May 2016, the inaugural St. James's Hospital Cycle started and finished in the stunning grounds of Russborough House, Co. Wicklow. Cyclists had the choice of doing a 40km or 80km cycle. We will once again be taking to the saddle for the 2017 Wicklow Mountains Cycle Challenge. On 14th February 2017, the Physiotherapy department organised a workplace walk with staff to mark this Healthy Ireland initiative. St. James's Hospital 37Dublin Midlands Hospital Group Working Together The Staff Wellness Committee organised a two-day staff wellness event on 17th and 18th of January 2017. Over 200 staff members dropped in throughout the day and visited information stands and sessions about sleep, nutrition, exercise, mindfulness, managing boundaries, burnout and self-care, blood pressure, staff assistance program, retirement and pensions and smart travel. A new 'Central Change' facility for use by cyclists, walkers, runners, was opened. This facility includes approximately 800 lockers, shower and changing facilities and a drying room. There has been a significant increase in bike parking and enhanced security at cycling facilities throughout the Hospital Campus, as well as improvements to the ease of Campus navigation for pedestrians and cyclists. April 2016 saw the launch of SJH Times , a hospital magazine for staff. The magazine is produced quarterly and is available in both print and online. The magazine keeps staff up to date with all activities taking place on the campus whilst keeping staff in touch with the work of their colleagues. It features a dedicated wellbeing section with articles from mindfulness to healthy eating recipes and other helpful tips from our expert staff on site. At the stands were local gym representatives to provide staff and visitors with information on local physical activity amenities. We have been running free exercise classes throughout the year on Wednesdays in the Physiotherapy Department. The classes are run over lunch time and vary from a mix of aerobic, strengthening, pilates and circuit training that are suitable for all levels. 38Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 Introduction Tallaght Hospital has embraced the challenge of providing health and wellbeing initiatives for staff in an environment with limited resources. In 2016 the Hospital achieved a silver award in the Irish Health Foundation Active at Work Awards. This was achieved at a local level from the support received from hospital management to form a Health & Wellbeing Committee and the hard work of the committee which comprises of staff from all disciplines.To support staff health and wellbeing the hospital provides a full time, occupational health service and an employee assistance programme supporting staff and providing help to balance work, family and personal life. Working Together At Tallaght Hospital, we have introduced a large number of programmes to improve physical wellbeing. These include participation in the Operation Transformation programme and step and walking challenges for our staff. Tallaght Hospital has also developed workplace, wellbeing day events, while also promoting calorie counts and encouraging staff to participate in the women's mini marathon. The Hospital has also introduced a bike rack to encourage staff to cycle to work.Caring Together Monthly employee workplace wellbeing programmes are held which cover topics such as building resilience and developing emotional wellbeing, mindfulness, money skills for life, nutrition and health balance diet, cyber bullying, and addiction. Transforming TogetherTallaght hospital is acutely aware about the need for a healthy work environment and we have a smoke free campus and a cr\u00e8che for our staff's children. We also provide breastfeeding facilities at the hospital for our staff. We have an active hospital choir and arts and crafts classes, as well as a hospital library. The hospital holds social events for staff throughout the year including Christmas lunch. Tallaght Hospital 39 Dublin Midlands Hospital Group DMHG Healthy Ireland Priorities This plan is a road map for each of our hospitals, aimed to embrace the Healthy Ireland framework and facilitate its implementation. The goals of the DMHG'S Strategic plan coupled with the knowledge and understanding of the strategic priorities within the Healthy Ireland in the Health Services Implementation Plan 2015-2017 5 have guided the development of this DMHG Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018-2020. Supporting staff , including developing their capacity to implement the Healthy Ireland actions for themselves, their patients, their families and communities, is particularly important for the DMHG. Priority areas include: Delivering excellent standards of quality in all the Healthy Ireland action areas Developing integrated care between DMHG hospitals and their communities to ensure Healthy Ireland actions are integrated in patient care pathways Strengthening Healthy Ireland co- operation and communication between DMHG hospitals There are gaps in the resources available for interventions in chronic disease prevention, such as smoking and alcohol, as well as a need to develop clear referral pathways for these risk factors and for chronic disease management. Given these resource implications, the full implementation of this plan will take several years and the completion dates for each action will reflect this situation. While the DMHG Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan will reflect national policy priorities, the Group is also conscious of the importance of local ownership of the plan. The advantage of this combined approach is that the implementation of the plan will benefit from existing initiatives and allow for creativity in piloting initiatives with potential for use in other hospitals. Continued regular meetings of the DMHG Healthy Ireland Steering Group will ensure sharing of individual hospital's experiences in implementation. Governance and Monitoring of Implementation Plan The DMHG has assigned a Healthy Ireland Executive Lead, with support from a Project Lead and a part-time Project Manager. A Steering Group has been established to provide oversight and direction for the development of this Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan for the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. It is chaired by Sonia Shortt, Group HR Director, Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. The Chair of the Steering Group will report on progress to the CEO, Dublin Midlands Hospital Group and will provide progress updates to the National Health and Wellbeing Division. The purpose of the Steering Group is to oversee, guide and monitor the implementation of the actions set out in this plan. Key priorities in this plan will be included in the hospital group estimates process. The DMHG Healthy Ireland Steering Group will monitor the implementation of the actions and the Executive Lead will report on these at the DMHG Executive Management Team monthly meetings. DMHG hospitals collect data on several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the area of breast-feeding and tobacco control. Healthy Ireland has also been added as an agenda item to the Healthy Ireland in Dublin Midlands Hospital Group - Implementation Plan40Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan 2018 - 2020 Hospital Group HR/Finance Management monthly meetings and to the individual hospital monthly performance meetings with the DMHG. Each hospital is represented on the Steering Group. Several of the hospitals within our Group have already set up Healthy Ireland implementation committees and all have commenced work on Healthy Ireland activity. Already Healthy Ireland is bringing staff together across the Group and is resulting in integration and co-operation between hospitals.41 Dublin Midlands Hospital Group The staff were excellent. The hospital was clean and tidy. It was very relaxing and felt very safe after having an awful incident.

Tobacco Free Ireland Tobacco use is responsible for almost 6,000 deaths each year in Ireland and is the leading cause of chronic disease burden and health inequalities. Tobacco Free Ireland (2013) is Ireland's national policy on tobacco control and has set a target for Ireland to be smoke free (i.e. a smoking prevalence of <5%) by 2025. The actions outlined below are focused on supporting Tobacco Free Ireland, including Tobacco Free Campus Policy, delivery of Smoking Cessation Services and relevant training for staff. Staff who smoke, or who are affected by tobacco related chronic disease, will be supported within the actions through the provision of a smoke free environment and access to smoking cessation services and pharmacotherapy.

Healthy Eating and Active Living The HSE Healthy Eating and Active Living (HEAL) programme has been established to address diet and physical activity within the HI Framework and in the context of Ireland's high rates of overweight and obesity and sedentary lifestyles. Two national documents guide the HEAL programme: 'A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016 - 2025' and 'Get Ireland Active - the National Physical Activity Plan'. The actions outlined below are focused on supporting the HEAL programme and national policies to ensure risk factors are measured and documented and evidence-based interventions are provided. Staff and patients will be supported within these actions through dedicated initiatives such as the implementation of the Healthier Vending and Calorie Posting Policies, Brief Intervention Training, and physical activity initiatives such as Smarter Travel (National Transport Authority), Sl\u00ed na Sl\u00e1inte (Irish Heart Foundation) and Operation Transformation (RT\u00c9).

Wellbeing and Positive Mental Health The vision for Mental Health Services is to support the population to achieve their optimum mental health. Promoting positive mental health and wellbeing forms an important strand of this plan. The statistics of our patient populations are stark, with 1 in 5 of us likely to experience a mental health problem in our lifetime.

Positive Ageing This section outlines the actions required by the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group to promote positive ageing for the patients in our care. As the life expectancy in Ireland continues to increase, there is an onus on health care providers to ensure that older citizens can live these extra years with a high quality of life which is as independent and fulfilled as possible. The DMHG has prioritised actions which aim to ensure that the dignity and independence of older persons are protected through the implementation of national strategies such as the National Positive Ageing Strategy, the National Carers' Strategy and the National Dementia Strategy.

Staff Health & Wellbeing There are approximately 10,000 staff working across the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group and they are our greatest asset. This section outlines how the DMHG will demonstrate its commitment to staff through supporting them to improve and enhance their own health and wellbeing. This will ensure they have the ability and resilience to continue to provide a high-quality patient-centred service in challenging times. The DMHG and its hospitals have undertaken a review of staff health and wellbeing initiatives. The findings have identified the priorities and resources required to positively impact on staff health and wellbeing at work. The implementation will also benefit from the knowledge gained from the NUIG Post- Graduate Certificate in Workplace Wellness by the sponsored DMHG staff members. Further Health Sector National Staff Surveys will assist in evaluating these actions.

Making Every Contact Count Making Every Contact Count is about health professionals using their routine consultations to empower and support people to make healthier choices to achieve positive long-term behaviour change. To do this, the health service needs to build a culture and operating environment that supports continuous health improvement through the contacts that it has with individuals. This approach will allow health professionals to move to a position where discussion of lifestyle behaviour is routine, non-judgemental and central to everyone's role. To implement Making Every Contact Count within all sectors of the health service, actions need to happen in four key areas: At organisational level - systems are required to embed Making Every Contact Count in all services; Through staff engagement and skills development; Through patient empowerment to allow engagement with health professionals; Through partnership with external affiliates such as higher educational institutes, professional associations and health professionals not employed within the HSE. The DMHG will support staff to avail of the training modules which will become available in 2018.

Self-Management Supports A National Self-Management Support Framework for chronic conditions COPD, Asthma, Diabetes and Cardiac Vascular Disease is being developed. The increasing number of people living with chronic conditions in Ireland has promoted the need to develop a framework which supports our patients to self-manage their conditions to the extent that they are able to live with the best possible quality of life. This approach is crucial to both patient centred care and sustainability of health services. All hospitals within the DMHG will support the implementation of the forthcoming National Self-Management Support Framework in collaboration with other areas of the HSE.
