Benson : An agency receives deference when determining the ir own jurisdiction FDA Origins & Functions 1962: Amendments to strengthen and broaden existing laws (FDCA) Commerce Clause - the jurisdiction of the FDA Art. I \u00a7 8 (powers delegated to Congress): \"the Con gress shall have power to regulate Commerce with foreign nations, among the several states and with the Indian Tribes\" Gibbons v. Ogden (1824): The NY State Legislature granted Ogden* ex clusive navigation of the waters within the State. Gibbons, who was operating a competing service had been licensed by Congress. The Court found that federal licensing po wer preempted the state monopoly. However, the inspection of ships remained within th e state police power //If they hadn't left this up to the states, slaver y could have been stopped by the federal gov't Brown v. Maryland (1827) \"The original package doctrine\" : merchandise brought into the state in the original form or package in which it was imp orted was under federal jurisdiction. It had not \"arrived\" until they were delivered into the hands of the consignee and the package was broken. E.C.Knight (1895): \"the Sugar Trust Case\" - the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act attempted to curb concentrations to economic power - could the SAA su ppress a monopoly in manufacturing, not merely its distribution. The Court held that it was not within the power of Congress to regulate. Champion v. Ames (1903): Statute made it illegal to sell lottery ti ckets in interstate commerce (regardless of their legality within the state from whence they came). The Court upheld the conviction, and stated that it was within the plenary power of Congress to create the regulation. The dissent argued that this infringed on the state s' police power 1906: The Pure Food & Drug Act //upheld by the Supreme Court Addressed issues of drug purity, passed in response to the The Jungle To prevent within the constitutional power...the manu facture/sale/transportation of goods/drugs that are so adulterated, or are poisono us, or are misbranded o Was limited to the District of Columbia or any territory o Could only seize products within the original, unbr oken package The typical police power of the state (that was cur tailed by the Positive Commerce Clause): to regulate \"health, safety, morals & general welfare\" Hammer v. Dagenhart (1918): Statute prohibited the shipment of goods t hat were made in a plant that used child labor, which the Court struck down as unconstitutional. Overruled in Darby . But how can the decision in Champion be squared with this decision? Before the new act was written: there was an issue with a sulfonamide drug, which was very effective and was difficult to formulate. It used ethylene gl ycol (antifreeze) which caused many deaths The only part of the 1906 Act that it violated was that the \"elixir\" must contain alcohol This set the stage for expanding FDA authority Food & Drug Act of 1938: Gave three powers: 1. On the record rulemaking: \u00a7 701(e) gives this power \u00a7 701(a) gives FDA authority to issue rules for \"ef ficient enforcement of the Act\" 2. Notice and comment rulemaking, also \u00a7 706 of the AP A: expanded the preambles a. The preambles of Acts are binding advisory opinions on the FDA 3. Interpretive rule //before the FDA used seizure/enforcement actions w hich were not very effective: A. No predictability FDA Law | 3 B. Not efficient: the same company can keep shipping d ifferent batches of the same product The regulation of drugs is dependent on the constit utional framework: the statute itself actually changes less than the underlying Constitutional Int erpretation 1. With a liberal construction of FDA power there is t ension between the Federal and State concurrent jurisdiction 2. There is a presumption in favor of expanded regulat ory authority Views of regulation Ex post : warranty - you know that whatever comes out is safe (regulate outputs) Ex ante : You cannot have a regulation that only regulates inputs The FDA regulates more than just outputs: hiring pr actices, etc. Is this useful? Adulterated & Misbranded: US v. 40 Cases, More or Le ss (2d Cir. 1961): The cans of oil sold were labeled \"25 % olive oil\" but actually containe d little or no olive oil - therefore, the oil was adulterated ( \u00a7 402(b)(2)) and misbranded (\u00a7 403(a) ) Can you regulate the vegetable oils mixed entirely in New York State? The Court held yes : it was originally carried across state lines and there should be a broad reading of the statute The remedy here was through the seizure system //Prof. Epstein thinks that this was an incorrect i nterpretation There were the same issues with the Civil Rights Ac t ( argued that the nonmedical grade silicone shipped from Dow Chemical was not an adulterated de vice when shipped interstate, and therefore, no contact with interstate commerce. Does not need to be adulterated when it leaves send er's hand nor intent on sender's part Sufficient if the device is held for sale after interstate commerce and then was adulterated o Different if physicians are using approved drugs for unapproved uses (rather than unapproved drugs for unapproved uses) 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments : Added clinical trials and PMA Before that, FDA had 60 days to challenge and 180 d ays to make decision re: new product Prompted by Thalidomide disaster 1976 Medical Device Amendments \u00a7 360k Preempted state requirements Dormant Commerce Clause : limiting state power by national concerns, this d octrine comes up with Congress has been silent Original concern was about the race to the bottom f rom competition among the states But as seen in the Washington Apple case: there is really a race to the top Gibbons II : Finds that there is no concurrent power with the Commerce Clause 1937 (Jones v. Laughlin ; Wickard ) /barb2right 1938 : Allows the FDA to regulate everything: this is re pudiation of the E.C. Knight Case FDA Law | 4 II. CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT 1. The FDA has a lot of fear of Congress 2. FDA has difficulty correcting its own judgments 3. There are issues with who ends up on advisory commi ttees Non-Delegation Doctrine In favor of the broad interpretation : Hutt : Congress chose to express the mandate in broad an d general terms. Therefore, the Act should be regarded as a c onstitution - it establishes fundamental obj. If we interpreted it specifically, we would need to change the law when necessary The Congress in 1938 did not want the FDA to be bou nd to one way of doing things for many industries and wrote the statute broadly Everything that is not expressly forbidden is permi tted Against : Austern : Argues that Hutt's paper should have been titled \"How to rewrite an act of Congress without really trying\" An agency should only enforce what Congress delegat es to it Schechter Poultry /J. Cardozo: This is delegation running riot There should be more limitations of FDA power becau se there can be criminal sanctions There are restrictions - GMPs are more than is perm itted by delegation: You must have statutory authority Policy Issues: An Ideal System of Delegation Whatever balance was struck, you should keep the sa me balance in the administrative agency But there is often drift within the agency: does th is make them lawless? 1935: the Court struck down statutes under non(dele gation, but since then, has been treated as a political matter rather than a judicial matter Good Manufacturing Practices Nat'l Association of Pharma Mfrs v. FDA (2d Cir, 1981): In the amendments, there was a sec tion that a drug was adulterated if its packaging/proces sing/holding fail to conform to current \"good manufacturing practice\". The court found that \u00a7 701 (a) of the act and \u00a7 4 under the Administrative Procedure Act allowed rulemaking under provisi rulemaking provisions to save time \u00a7 701(e) required a hearing as part of the binding regulatory procedure Can the FDA regulate good manufacturing practices ? Where do they get the power to regulate? \u00a7 701says that there is \"enforcement\" - strictly sp eaking, GMPs are not enforcement But the Hutt view prevails: the FDA can displace cu stom US v. Bioclinical Systems (D.Md. 1987): The FDA inspected the facility and f ound 29 violations of the GMPs, and brought an action to enjoin violat ions by Bioclinical The court found that the FDA had bypassed proper pr ocedural requirements and had been imposing the SAL as a de facto requirement: you cannot enforce a draft guidance The FDA had not gone through the proper process to enact the regulation: The process required was expensive And there was different custom followed in the indu stry without problems: what do you do when this happens? o You can use consumer testimony (not helpful) o Experts on safety: you would want to call people wh o used to work at the FDA FDA Law | 5 Likely: the cost of the change on the industry is m uch more than the benefit o Typically, you are interested in balancing the marg inal safety and the marginal cost Policy Issues The judicial system is very deferential to the FDA. But the FDA lives in fear of Congress - Congress often criticizes the FDA for causing injuries, but not for failing to approve drugs See Frances Kelsey: who kept Thalidomide of the market But AIDS changed everything o Cancer is a similar dynamic: there is a first in li ne treatment that often fails and as treatments go on, they become more toxic Before the B(S valve, most people used pig valves, which lasted for 10 years, 5% deaths/year. B(S valves have ~ 1% survival rate Epstein: did more people die from the breakages tha n from the removal from market? Likely not. o But if you make this kind of cost(benefit analysis you have the Pinto case (punitive) Bjork Shiley Valve : this is a mechanical heart valve that is used to replace aortic or mitral valves Consists of a design that had a tendency to develop fractures that resulted in valve failure o There were also class actions from anxiety re: futu re valve breakage Taken off the market in 1986 o FDA refused to let them on the market even after th e valve was fixed No heart valves are risk free (and it is difficult to test them) 1. The valves may collapse 2. There is a risk of insufficient blood getting throu gh 3. Poisons from the valve may leech into the system Policy Issues Businesses don't like being subject to 50 different safety regulations (if there are different ones for each state) /barb2right this supports the creation of federal regulations o Uniform state law movement - e.g. creation of the U .C.C. o Federal floor + additional regulations by states? \" Race to the top\"? Costs of Regulatory Framework : 1. Limits freedom of choice because citizens cannot ob tain products not approved by the FDA 2. Impacts small businesses who cannot afford PMA - le ading to in-licensing 3. No mechanism for public accountability: (i) no citi zen participation and (ii) Court cannto compel drug approval 4. Deters manufacturers from seeking judicial remedies for fear of retaliation a. There are no real judicial remedies: the FDA can al ways delay b. Exposes company to seizure, threat of lost sales an d protracted litigation c. Concern of pending/new applications Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine : If you can approve or disapprove, you can affect how the deal ends up procedurally - once you have monopoly power, the situation transforms A regulation requires a nexus between the state int erest and the condition Nature and extent of the condition are roughly prop ortional to the extent of the harm o FDA is like requiring resolution of all divorces in MA in exchange for driving FDA Law | 6 III. DOMAIN: Inside the Agency Chevron : (1) Has Congess spoken on the issue? (2) If not, is the agency action a permissible interpretation of the statute? FDA Conflict of Interest regulations - these are gu idances. You want to have the best experts within the FDA o The FDA, Merck, Lilly etc all want the same people o There aren't many \"best\" experts in the field We don't want anyone to use the second class experts You handle conflicts through disclosure/management The extensive disclosure requirements with the FDA may end up causing the best people to avoid consulting with the FDA - can use waiver (\u00a7 712(c)( 2)) What can the FDA regulate? Can depend on how you make claims: The FDA looks at objective intent : what do the materials show o A manufacturer could determine classification of it s product by choosing claims o But certain products have only a drug purpose: look at the active ingredient o Did not regulate Wonderbread (despite claims), but did try to regulate cosmetics 1. Drugs: typically covered under composition of matte r patents 2. Devices 3. Combination Products: based on primary mode of action \u00a7 353(g); comparable products must be classified in similar ways, Bracco Diagnostics 4. Dietary Supplements 5. Food 6. Cosmetics: have sustained FDA enforcement actions h ere when accompanied by claims that they affect the structure of function of the body Why can't you get FDA approval for marijuana ? Each product is a little bit different - processing is how you create uniformity There are too many chemicals inside and they don't have the ability to approve all of them Biologics: much more difficult to regulate Why are there more regulations for drugs than for food ? There are informational problems: (1) Does it work?; (2) Does it make you sick? DRUGS \u00a7 201(g)(1): the term \"drug\" means articles recogni zes in the official US Pharmacopeia etc, (B) Articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease in man or other animals... A chemically inert substance can qualify depending on the claims: a bottle of water that is a cure for cancer (drug), as a sterilizing agent for tools (device), Bradley v. United States Intention can be inferred from the totality of the circumstances surrou nding the sale Cholestin (red yeast rice case): The dietary supplement had the same active ingredient as a drug The brand name reported them to the FDA ( Pharmanex v. Shalala ) Could the brand name have sued them? While you probably do have standing - competitive harm, probably don't have a private cause of action for a statutory duty (C) Articles, other than food, intended to affect t he structure or any function of the body of man or other animals (targeted at weight loss drugs, American Health Prods. v. Hayes ) Squibb v. Bowen : the structure of function definition is relativel y narrow and not intended to encompass all articles that might have some remote physical effect on the body FDA Law | 7 Bacto-Unidisk (1969): Case arose in an in rem seizure proceeding against interstate shipments Argued that they were misbranded under \u00a7 502 At the time, no premarket clearance requirements fo r devices, regulated as a drug Main question : is the sensitivity disk (for use of antibiotics) a drug or a device? The court held that it was a drug because the definition of drug was in tended to have broad coverage - because of the ambiguity, gives deference because of the mission t o protect public health Because the disc helps select the correct drug: the FDA can regulate the discs as drugs Ova II (D.N.J. 1975): This is a pregnancy test. Similarly , there was an in rem seizure action. Since pregnancy is not a disease, this is not for t he \"diagnosis of disease\" - later amended to include \"conditions\" (pregnancy is a condition) The court found that the FDA could not regulate the se pregnancy test New Drugs What kind of evidence is needed for a New Drug Appl ication? OTC monographs: not marketed under NDA (Tylenol, et c) Safety & effectiveness: not a scientific judgment b ut a political judgment o In real like, these cannot have absolute meanings ( Ova II ) Old drugs: drugs/devices that were introduced befor e May 28, 1976 (or are SE) Are there papers available from investigators compe tent in the field? New drugs: any drug that is not GRASE (generally re cognized as safe and effective): historically safe and effective, substantial evidence is not construe d as it is elsewhere ( Universal Camera ) GRASE exception has been construed narrowly (\u00a7 321( p)(1)) Not designed to allow generic copies of previously approved drugs to enter market Claimant bears the burden of proving that drug is GRASE o Unless you have a old clinical trial running around , not useful A new drug that is not properly approved: is adulte rated or misbranded, see Baxter Healthcare (does new packaging make something a new drug?) 50 Boxes (1st Cir. 1990): the government has seized fifty b oxes of a prescription drug Cafergot, which contains four ingredients: (a) two stop heada ches; (b) the others stop side effects from the first ingredients. These ingredients had already be en used in old drugs. The district court concluded that this was a new dr ug and \"substantial evidence\" has not been presented for its approval: the First Circuit affirmed. Evidence of \"well(controlled\" investigations: not r eally an exception at all The fixed proportions here have several effects: 1. Limits medical judgments a. The art of medicine is about choosing this correct dosage b. But the FDA doesn't take this into account 2. Standard formulation: likely helps most people and has easier use 3. Rigid: might be less responsive for others: but you already had the option of taking four different pills FDA Law | 8 DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS There is no premarket clearance for food - you can only regulate post(market Concerns with Dietary Supplements: (1) Claims were not tested; (2) Serious adverse effects \"A product (other than tobacco) intended to supplem ent the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients (A) a vitamin; (B) a mineral; (C) an herb or other botanical; (D) an amino acid; (E) a dietary substance..., (F) a conc entrate...of any of the above\" \u00a7 321(ff)(1) 1994 DSHEA Act provides that a dietary supplement is adulterated if it presents a \"significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury\" under the c onditions of use recommended in the label Regulated them more stringently than food, but less stringently than drugs If you make no claims: like a food - see, e.g. Green Tea Concerns that don't occur with naturally occurring substances: o Adulteration o High concentration (dosage): you must dosage limita tions on dietary supplements Health claims (\u00a7\u00a7 321(g)(1)(D), 343(r)) - DSHEA provides a safe harbor, dietary supplements are deemed to be a food, Whitaker 1. Statements asserting a benefit related to a classic al nutrient deficiency disease 2. Statements known as structure/function claims: desc ribe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure/functio n and characterize a documented mechanism for which the nutrient acts to maintain s uch structure or function 3. Declarations of general well(being Must contain an accompanying disclaimer \"This produ ct is not intended to diagnose...\" Police Power : to regulate health, safety, morals, & general wel fare Whitaker v. Thompson (D.C. Cir. 2004): Whitaker sought instruction that saw palmetto may improve voiding urgency associated with mild prosta tic hyperplasia. The FDA denied the petition. 1. Health Claims: are those that pertain to the prevention of disease 2. Drug Claims: regarding the treatment of disease - thought this was a disease claim a. Greater regulation is needed for the treatment of d iseased populations Lane Labs (D.N.J. 2004): Lane Labs sells products directly t o consumers - \"Benefin\" A doctor who is on the Lane Labs payroll promotes t hese products: therefore, anything that he says can be imputed to Lane Labs Intended use: judged by the objective intent of the persons legally responsible for labeling Commercial Speech : If it is connected to the company - only protecte d when (1) product is legal and (2) ad is true. If the guy is not connected to the company , much more protected. Here, there is a countervailing governmental right: health and safety ( Lochner ) Since the manufacturer (1) knows the most and (2) h as the most bias, they have the most regulation. But promotions matter a great deal for drug companies (25(30% spending). Torts : if you cannot do it with an employee, you cannot get an independent contractor to do it DSHEA: \u00a7 342(f)(1)(A) \"significant\" : means high risk (no benefit analysis here) //thre shold Risk significance doesn't affect something like \"sa fe and effective\" - e.g. cancer drugs In Nutraceutical : Is there really \"significant risk\" at 9 mg? \"unreasonable\" : this is a relative risk - government almost alway s prevails under this framework Nutracuetical v. Crawford (D. Utah 2005): FDA made a final rule in 2004 that determined that EDS (ephedrine) is adulterated and not legally mark etable in the United States; that the benefits of ephedrine do not improve long(term health and incre ases risks of heart attacks, etc. Plaintiffs brought Declaratory judgment action to s ay that this rule violates DSHEA FDA Law | 9 The court agreed with plaintiffs: the requirement t hat EDS demonstrate a benefit - the FDA's risk(benefit analysis places a burden on EDS manufacturer against Congressional intent (and the burden of proof is placed on the go vernment to show adulteration ) Nutraceutical v. Von Eschenbach (10th Cir. 2006): Found that FDA correctly followe d the congressional directive to analyze the risks and be nefits of EDS The burden is on the agency to show that risks asso ciated outweigh benefits and are therefore unreasonable ( after marketing), does not undermine congressional inten t //Kuhlik: judges cannot really operate in this area without some degree of deference MEDICAL DEVICES Two purposes: 1. To regulate products that actually prevent disease - \"intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions...\" 2. To regulate products that falsely claim to prevent disease \u00a7 321(h): an instrument, apparatus, implement, mach ine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article: 1. Recognized in National Formulary/Pharmacopeia 2. Intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, o r in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, in man or other animals 3. Intended to affect the structure or any function of the body o f man or other animals Is it a drug or a device? What is the difference between drugs and devices? D rugs work via chemical reaction and devices work via a mechanical action - but does this distin ction only matter inside the body? Alabama Tissue (7th Cir. 1992): Heart valve processors filed a pe tition for review contesting the final rule by the FDA stating that replacement hear t valve allografts are \"devices\" Generally: once you process something, it becomes \" New\" - you are no longer in the practice of medicine, you are within the FDA jurisd iction The FDA regulates the processing of blood: it doesn 't matter if it is \"organic\" [36] The court held that the FDA was able to regulate th e heart valve allografts as implants. But another court found procedural issues with this : and the FDA withdrew notice US v. Bowen (9th Cir. 1999): Defendant repairs the Sterisafe h and sterilizer and manufactures the SteriDot High Purity Ampule, which is used with the Sterisafe. Defendant argues that these are not devices. The FDA concluded that this falls within \" an instrument which is intended for use in the mitigation or prevention of disease in man\" Inspection issue rather than effectiveness issue: h ere, the only thing that you need is that it is sterile: could use (1) ex post standards of inspection; (2) good manufacturing st andards US v. Undetermined Number of Cases (10th Cir. 1994): CRL tests containers for HIV ant ibodies CRL contends that the specimen containers do not qu alify as devices o FDA contends that AIDS tests that do not use blood products or serum violate the Act, and the specimen containers themselves must ob tain premarket approval o There must be a standard protocol: chain of control is very important Reusable bottles: can lead to false positive Diagnosis includes inconclusive diagnosis: incentiv es of accuracy Classification within devices 1. Class I: general controls, labeling requirements, g ood manufacturing practices: bandaids 2. Class II: 510(k) - substantially equivalent to prev iously approved drugs FDA Law | 10 a. Reasonable assurance that it is safe and effective b. Heart valves? 3. Class III: PMA - \"safe and effective\", many go thro ugh 510(k) (substantially equivalent) If something has no safety risks and is not effecti ve at all: most probably people will not buy General Exceptions : (a) those products that are grandfathered in - yo u don't want to take off all the devices from the market (but do you only grandf ather in the '76 version?) (b) Substantial Equivalence Lake v. FDA (E.D. Pa. 1989): Lake invented a nose clip, and tr ied to get FDA approval to market the \"Investigational New Drug\" (IND) - FDA refused to approve it for colds/allergies and initially classified it as a Class III device (no effectivene ss, no risk) The safety hazard is not from the device, but from the fact that you won't get real treatment o Here, the FDA is really concerned with economic iss ues rather than therapeutic uses 1. Fraud claims 2. Consumer protection statutes Snoring Relief (9th Cir. 2000): Sold a self(fitting, anti(snoring mouthpiece without prescription FDA found that it violated the FDCA without filing a PMA or 510(k) o Denied request to market SnorBan over the counter Dangers: could block the passage or change mouth co nfigurations Cannot use substantial equivalence analysis and the n avoid any regulation at all No credible non(therapeutic uses : different from the dietary supplements cases wher e you can make health claims, like the Squibb case with the fungicide Contact Lens (D.C. Cir. 1985): Hard contact (PMMA) lenses block s air from your eyes and dries them out. You must use eyedrops/cannot sleep with t hem. Compare, RGP lenses which have the superior visual acuity from the hard lens, and the direct transmission of oxygen FDA wanted to regulate them as a Class III product CL petitioned FDA to reclassify them from Class III to Class II o Class II has a lower cost of entry, Class III compa nies don't want generics to piggy( back on their PMA data Court gave deference to the FDA decision to not rec lassify the lens Ethicon (D.D.C. 1991): Ethicon manufactures absorbable sutures US Surgical Corporation petitioned FDA to reclassif y the generic class of sutures to Class II (from Class III), the FDA agreed Court gave deference to the FDA decision to reclass ify the sutures. ADULTERATION & MISBRANDING in whole/part of any filthy, putrid, decomposed substance or may have been prepared in unsanitary c onditions \u00a7 502: an item is misbranded if the labeling is fal se or misleading (if it doesn't work, misbranded) If something is contaminated with bacteria - this i s adulterated, if the product is also labeled as sterile, it is therefore also misbranded \u00a7 301(k) is the actual misbranding provision Acu-Dot (N.D. Ohio, 1980): An acu(dot is a magnet attached to an adhesive patch and claims temporary relief of occasional minor aches. FDA cla ims that the item is \"misbranded\". S Here, there has been a double(blind study showing that it works, a nd it is popular in Japan But Acu(Dot manufacturers suggested that it was a p lacebo effect: o Since the drug doesn't actually work: it is misbran ded and subject to seizure FDA Law | 11 Evers (5th Cir. 1981): Evers is owner and operator of th e Ra(Mar Clinic which uses chelation therapy to treat clogged arteries. The government c harged Dr. Evers with the misbranding of the chelating drug (Calcium EDTA) District court found that no misbranding could come from doctor's prescription of a lawful drug to his own patients: if Evers had owned a pate nt or owned the company - more like Lane Labs case, there would be no independence 1. Dr. Evers never held Calcium EDTA for sale after sh ipment in interstate commerce \u00a7 502(f)(1): in order to qualify for the prescripti on exception, must meet full disclosure requirement s \u00a7 503(b)(2): also has many exceptions - the purpose of this scheme is to ensure that adequate information is provided to a licensed physician Evers' booklets do not contain sufficient information: but they are not f or physicians - they are for patients who obtained the drug from him. Di strict court is affirmed. Policy Issues 1. A criminal prosecution is not the best way for the FDA to make new regulations - if the FDA wanted deference here, unlikely, because fairne ss issues are in favor of the defendant 2. Why not use a seizure action: probably because the US marshalls would co me in with guns to seize the EDTA 3. Could use a civil injunction acton Baxter Healthcare (7th Cir. 1990): Baxter created freeze(dried form of drugs - most hospitals prepare their own drugs, but the Baxter program all ows them to use larger scales The district court granted the FDA's preliminary in junction prohibiting Baxter from producing ready(to(use antibiotics products FDA claims that Baxter must apply for separate appr oval: Court upheld - only the medical establishments can do large scale compounding //In 1997, as part of FDAMA, Congress codified the regulatory exemption by removing \u00a7 507 TOBACCO Brown & Williamson (2000): FDA asserted jurisdiction (under Kessler) over tobacco products on the grounds that tobacco is a drug and cigarettes/s mokeless tobacco are drug delivery devices: regulated them as a combination product The Court found that because Congress had already s truck a balance, the FDA could not regulate. AND if the FDA had jurisdiction, would ha ve required banning since beginning. This is clearly within the literal definition of \"d rugs\" - tobacco has no therapeutic value Here Kessler read \"structure and function\" broadly The Tobacco Act of 2009 : \u00a7 321(rr)(1)\"any product made or derived from tob acco that is intended for human consumption, including any component, par t, or accessory of a tobacco product\" 1. Regulates Advertising 2. Cannot ban the drug (but can ban use/sales to minor s) 3. Gave FDA authority to regulate tobacco products (ev en without therapeutic claims) Sottera (D.C. 2010): This is a customs seizure case - saw the e(cigarettes at the border and thought that they were FDA regulated: FDA inspector came in and seized product: plenary power at border To get them back, Sottera had to sue the FDA Found that the Tobacco Act covers regulation of thi s product: not just the FDCA drug/device provisions: therefore, can regulate (1) advertising; (2) manufacture; (3) access o But cannot have the same kinds of restrictions that the FDA in Brown Garland Concurrence : The FDA should not get Chevron deference for a litigation position The Tobacco Act means that Congress wanted them reg ulated under that Act, not FDCA FDA Law | 12 IV. DRUG APPROVAL PROCESS 1962: requirement that the FDA review an NDA within 6 mon ths: this was never met CLINICAL TRIALS 1. How much information do you need to gather? What ri sk are you willing to accept? 2. How can you correlate improved performance with ext ent of pre(market review? There is a lot of (1) decentralized knowledge and ( 2) with clinical trials, you deal with everything before the application as nothing, although the FDA is slowly moving towards Bayesian statistics Before you approve a drug: what do you do? o You give a low dose of the drug - incremental incre ases, but there might be nonlinearities in the dose response curve o Then you might give them something else to deal wit h the side effects The delivery mechanisms for drugs are crucial: the information sharing between doctors update treatments But as a gatekeeper, there is no redundancy Investigational New Drug : exception to interstate shipment of unapproved dr ugs Phase I : introduction into human subjects (20(80 subjects) - looking for freak accidents Phase II : controlled clinical trials for several hundred su bjects Phase III : controlled trials for several hundred(several tho usand subjects Double(blind trial removes people who have known co nfounding factors: o Co(morbidities o Stage to which the disease has progressed o Less women than men: women get pregnant But a positive clinical trial doesn't tell you anything - a negat ive trial tells you a lot o Insurance company data is actually the most useful Durability is a good metric of safety/effectiveness : every drug that is on the market, when it is successful, expands in use (shark(fin) US v. Garfinkel (8th Cir. 1994): Garfinkel was the principal inves tigator for an Anafranil. Under \u00a7 355(i), the recordkeeping obliga tions are put on the manufacturers/producers, rather than the PI Garfinkel was charged with violation of FDA regulat ions: the circuit court reversed the district court's order dismissing the two counts: t he FDA interpretation does not conflict with Congressional intent Pre-market Approval Edison Pharm (D.C. Cir. 1979): Israel developed Cothyrobal, an injectable drug to treat hypercholesterolemia/hyperthyroidism. (Not GRASE ei ther) The B12 in the drug was designed to reduce the toxi city of the active drug The Commissioner rejected the application because t here were no double blind trials o But would it be ethical to require them? You should really compare this drug to levothyroxine (to see if it really reduces side eff ects) o But if that drug had too many adverse effects: what do you do? Should have used historical data, like with venom a ntidotes: Court deferred to the FDA Smithkline v. FDA (Dexamyl) (D.C. Cir. 1978): A combination drug had Dexedrine (an appetite suppressant) and amobarbital (to limit side effects of Dexedrine) Commissioner refused to look at the data: (1) prior drug use - how to use normalized population and (2) classifications: anxiety FDA Law | 13 Court upheld the summary judgment procedure because the applicant had failed to submit substantial evidence of efficacy Squibb (D.C. Cir. 1989): In 1950s, Squibb received FDA ap proval for 4 oral combination drugs, each of which contained the antibiotic tetracycline and one of two anti(fungal agents The FDA found that candidal overgrowth is not a dis ease - withdrew approval (upheld) o Squibb could have made an argument for (1) mitigati on or (2) prevention Unlike in Brown & Williamson , the FDA reads \"structure and function\" broadly he re PDUFA : Prescription Drug User Fee Act Began in 1992, reauthorized every five years, $1M f or the full application (2008) Kessler was a very reform(minded commissioner and i nterested in money 1. Make the turnaround time for approvals shorter a. You want to make sure that the money allocated for drug approvals is not diverted elsewhere: must guarantee that funds stay up b. But it is difficult to lockdown the government from diversion of funds: would Congress simply decrease the appropriations to the FDA because of user fees? c. But PDUFA did not affect the actual substantive app roval criteria 2. The Act states that drug companies won't pay user f ees without commensurate Congressional appropriations 3. But there is still partial diversion: the fee also covers FDA enforcement actions The FDA states that they will review 90% of applica tions within 10 months But more recently, there have been public hearings, which makes negotiation more difficult What about using drug approvals from Europe or Japa n? Or splitting the burden? Once something is on the market: the FDA has no pow er - gatekeeper What are the differences after PDUFA? 1. Approval rate 2. Drug Recall 3. Time: this has improved Early Access Early Access available : if - 1. Intended to treat a serious or immediately life(thr eatening disease 2. No comparable or satisfactory alternative 3. The drug is being studied in a controlled clinical trial or clinical trials have been completed 4. The drug's sponsor is actively pursuing market appr oval The FDA can deny treatment from IND if: 1. The agency believes there is \"no reasonable basis\" to conclude effectiveness 2. Granting the request would expose the patient to an unreasonable amount of risk Abigail Alliance (D.C. Cir. 2006): Alliance submitted a proposal fo r new regulations that make post(Phase I drugs available to terminally ill pati ents who were not admitted the clinical trials Came from a patient who was terminally ill with can cer and died BUT: (1) can sabotage clinical trials (compound dis orders) and (2) possible liability for companies But Physicians are more capable of giving individua lized advice to patients than the trial results - can evaluate your risk factors (the FDA c annot do this) Tort of Intentional Interference with Advantageous Rel ationships (schoolteacher shooting pupils scenario): The prima facie case is in favor of Abigail Has stayed the same FDA Law | 14 But the justifications make the interference legal: (1) you want enough people in the eventual clinical trials; (2) do you trust doctors enough an d (3) do you want drug companies to be able to sell their drugs earlier The panel found for Abigail Alliance: that the drug s must be made available earlier: fundamental right from Cruzan - right to refuse treatment /barb2right right to take medical treatment available Abigail Alliance II (D.C. Cir. 2007) (en banc): Concluded that there was a no fundamental right \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history\" of access to experimental drugs for the terminally ill We have historically had experimental drugs The intentional interference tort doesn't apply her e - plus these drugs have immense risk o Because there is no fundamental right: the claim is subject only to rational basis scrutiny ( Lee Optical ) and the government does have a rational relation to a legitimate state interest If we recognize it here, to where does the right ex tend? //Epstein thinks that we should have this for oncol ogy drugs: here, there is a pressure from the family to live - not coercive as with Glucksberg , but Kuhlik points out that if manufacturers receive payment for the drugs, there are still coercion con cerns Cruzan : individuals have the right to refuse medical trea tment, incompetent persons cannot Here, the pressure from the family is to take the t reatment Glucksberg : doctors who aid with assisted suicide are subject to prosecution: you don't want elderly people coerced into suicide Here, unlike Cruzan , the pressure from the family is to die rather tha n live OFF -LABEL USE An off(label use is use of drug/device in a manner not approved by the FDA Medical practice exception does not apply to physic ian compounding of unapproved substances. In guidances, the FDA contends that there is improp er labeling of medical products There are huge fines (~$600 million) for off(label uses o These judgments are not contested because drug comp anies are repeat players Most cases are brought by the Department of Justice - the FDA first works on the case and then refers it to the DOJ (typically, Boston/Philadelphi a USAO) Washington Legal v. Kessler (D.D.C. 1995): Physicians prepare materials in med ical journals, articles and textbooks that discuss off(label uses (\"enduring materials\") Using guidances is more useful for the FDA than usi ng notice and comment because the latter is riskier for the FDA The Washington Legal Foundation has brought a citiz en's petition against the FDA o It is advantageous for the drug companies to have W LF bring the suit o Drug companies are repeat players with the FDA: the y don't want delays in approval The court found that the sum of FDA's guidances cre ated a de facto policy, although most courts have dismissed similar actions for lack of ripeness /failure to exhaust administrative remedies Why doesn't the FDA subject doctors who prescribe off-la bel uses to criminal prosecution? The FDA cannot regulate the practice of medicine Can the drug company hand out materials prepared by others? With regulation of existing approved products there is pushback: foreclosure is not a useful option Tort : you have an obligation to warn even for an off(la bel use, but there is an implied representation that applies to that off(label use FDA Law | 15 Femrite v. Abbott NW Hospital (Minn Ct. App. 1997): Appellants underwent spinal fusion surgery, and they were implemented with an experime ntal device. They were not informed that it was an IDE nor part of the clinical trial, but the device had already been approved. The court held that you can have simultaneous off(label use and an investigational study. Alleged that the hospital allowing this type of sur gery was medical malpractice o This would destroy all off(label use It does not matter whether you knew that it was una pproved if you knew all the risks o Courts are split over whether informed consent means you know experimental status (you do need this for clinical trials) GENERIC DRUGS Pre(1962: public notice of efficacy, later generic drugs could refer to these findings After 1962: the NDA was a private license to the in novator company (hard for generics) Therefore, generic drugs needed to do their own eff ectiveness studies Technically, they could do these during the patent term - but the research exemption was effectively eliminated Generix (1983): A generic drug product using the same activ e ingredients still needs to get an NDA Hatch-Waxman created a compromise: 1. Facilitated approval of generic drugs: allowed gene ric companies to get approval without doing its own studies a. Set up a system called the Orange book: every appro ved drug with an appendix of every patent that claims that drug b. The ANDA filed by the generic would seek one of two certifications: \u00b6 III: we wait until the patent expires to seek app roval \u00b6 IV: we won't wait - the patent is either (1) inva lid or (2) we don't infringe This creates a Title 35 act of infringement (case o r controversy) If you sue within 45 days, you can get a 30 month s tay of the approval: during which the patent case may be resolved c. The first generic gets 180 days exclusivity, but br and names can make agreements with the generic companies Typically, the generic will try to show equivalence for FDA purposes or (1) show invalidity or (2) say that because equivalence is different in patent law , say that it does not infringe 2. Extended patent term for innovator drugs a. Title II: can get up to 5 years added (\u00bd of the tim e required for the IND review) b. One approval out of 10 pays for itself Serono (D.C. Cir. 1998): Same as means clinical identity - bioavailability/bioequivalence If you are the innovator company and you change the structure of the active ingredients: you will need to run clinical trials: here, the generic was using a different isoform o But the generic does not: their ANDA can be approved Because of mandatory/permissive substitution laws: you want the generic to be as close as possible - pharmacists make more from generics o The pharmacy will substitute the generic without an y kind of medical knowledge Hatch(Waxman does not allow new labels: \u00a7 355 allow s new labels only for (a) formulation differences and (b) differences required to comply with FDA sulfite warning restriction o BMS v. Shalala (D.D.C. 1996) can approve a generic without all of the indications in the brand name label FDA Law | 16 Zeneca (4th Cir. 2000): In general, the FDA regulations r equire that the inactive ingredients in the generic are the same as the pioneer drug. Zeneca fo rmulated propofol with EDTA to prevent microbial contamination (that was leading to high f evers) Gensia submitted an ANDA with propofol, but used so dium metabisulfite not EDTA o This required the creation of new labels for drug The court still upheld the FDA judgment that the ge neric did not need to do new trials Kuhlik : this is decided wrongly: (a) too much FDA deferen ce - possibly because (b) this is a drug that is typically administered in a hospital No real post(market review for generics EXCLUSIVITY A kind of payment(in(kind system Doesn't apply to full NDA and paper NDAs, just ANDA s Most drugs aren't studied on children: difficult to know if they will be safe/effective Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity 5 year data exclusivity : the FDA cannot approve a generic - applies when y ou get a new active moiety (a new active ingredient) - different salts of the same compound are the same active moiety 3 year data exclusivity : Applies for OTC switch - for a new label or a new indication and you were required to do clinical studies: 3 exclusivity But remember: suppose you got an approval for a onc e(a(day pill in lieu of two days: this you can't substitute the 2 a day generic. But suppo se you get a new use - you could easily substitute the generic and get the new use off(labe l o The generic just can't use the new label - i.e. in Mensing Burroughs Wellcome (E.D.N.C. 1986): Two different companies had an ND A approved Burroughs (the first to be approved) could not get exclusivity over the other company because they did not need Burroughs's data. This is not absolute exclusivity . o Both companies used a paper NDA - some previously publi shed literature Mead Johnson (D.C. Cir. 1988): There was a transitional period for Hatch(Waxman - some companies got ten years of approval. The FDA (before PDUFA) often gave preliminary appro vals...but you must still do X o This is one such case: but the FDA's approval date is the one that sticks Purepac (D.C. Cir. 1998): There is no need to have a \"succ essful defense\" to get the 180 day exclusivity provision - Mora removed that requirement Mylan (D.D.C. 2000) vacated (D.C. Cir. 2002): Barr brought a \u00b6 IV on Imperial' s drug Barr won in court, and there was a \"pay(for(delay\" settlement where Barr was paid to stay off the market o The other generics were prevented from entering by Barr's \u00b6 IV even though they had settled with Imperial and had amended to a \u00b6 II I. This action found that Barr was no longer entitled to the 180 exclusivity: forfeiture if the generic does not enter the market at the earliest p ossible time \u00a7 1: Division of markets: collusive settlement - everyone knows that the patent is bad, and this is a patent extension via different means \u00a7 2: Monopolization - where you tie one product to another, more succe ssful one Orphan Drug Exclusivity : these are drugs with a very small market - you ca n get full market exclusivity for seven years (even if someone else h as an NDA ) FDA Law | 17 Specifically targeted at the biotech system Issues: creates race to approval in a parallel deve lopment system (now the FDA fudges the approval dates) Active moieties: you do not want to deprive patient s of superior drugs (there is a provision) However, this system has led to very expensive orph an drugs, not least because they are very difficult to make o But if you don't have the system, you don't get any drugs Baker Norton (D.D.C. 2001): Baker developed Paxene and BMS deve loped Taxol, and Taxol was approved first. Baker could not get approval until after the exclusivity period for Taxol had ended The definition for drugs (during the approval proce ss) is narrow - when you change the colors, the shape of the pill etc, you have to get approval But for the exclusivity, it is a broad definition: or it would not mean anything - you could change the pill shape and get around the exclusivit y provision: Court upheld Pediatric Exclusivity : Here, you get 6 month market/data exclusivity (no t a patent extension) Nat'l Pharm. Alliance (D.D.C. 1999): Court upheld the draft pediatric li st of approved drugs that might produce health benefits: the FDA can grant ad ditional exclusivity for drug product lines V. POST-APPROVAL POST -MARKET SURVEILLANCE 1. Detect previously unknown adverse reactions a. If you studied the drug in 10000 patients, you are not likely to catch a 1/10000 event 2. Evaluate in greater detail known risks 3. Uncover adverse reactions from interactions 4. Uncover adverse reactions from particular sections of the population Lowest level: adverse event reporting (AER) The main way that they find out is from physician r eporting o Estimated that < 10% of adverse events are reported o Once these are reported: minimized from changes in labeling Seldane : however, doctors rarely change their practices - (1) don't read the warnings; (2) have more than one doctor; (3) patients fill out in take forms The FDA does not have mandatory drug recall authority Labels are categorized by severity Vioxx : sometimes the drug company will take something of f the market without FDA pressure 16000 people die each year from stomach bleeds \"Vigor\": study that compares Vioxx with naproxen (A leve, Midol) o Allows the label: \"causes fewer stomach bleeds\" o But more Vioxx users had heart problems, but naprox en may well reduce the rate of heart attacks \"Approve\" study compared Vioxx to a placebo: showed that cardiac risk definitely increased 2004: Merck took Vioxx off the market Henley (2d Cir. 1996): FDA regulates the labeling of oral contraceptives on package inserts. Henley requested that the FDA amend the warning label requ irements - cited thirteen studies that established links between long term use and breast cancer Under the APA \u00a7 706(2)(A): a district court may set aside agency findings only if they are \"arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion\" FDA Law | 18 The court upheld the FDA's decision: this is not an abuse of discretion and the FDA's determination best reflects the current scientific information regarding the risks/benefits Label Requirements : FDA plans to change this and add \"highlights\" sec tion, \u00a7 501(f)(1) 1. Clinical pharmacology 2. Indications and Usage: prescriptions are exempt fro m these requirements ( Evers ), but if the using party is not a physician, then it is misbrand ed ( Rayford ) 3. Contraindications (where the risk > benefits) 4. Warnings: risks that are more serious than adverse reactions (but risks benefits), includes black(box warnings (most serious) 5. Precautions: animal studies, pregnancy (category X where risks > benefits) 6. Adverse reactions (rare) - \"reasonable association with use\" Tort Liability Custom is not always a defense to Tort liability : entire industries can lag behind in manufacturing requirements, see TJ Hooper : Blood industry (American Red Cross) - scrutiny af ter HIV. The FDA ended up putting the entire industry u nder injunctions/consent decrees. Product Liability Considerations : Upstream : uniform warnings for all patients Websites for the patients to understand Downstream : Physician's Desk Reference etc. Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors (1960): Cannot disclaim products liability Epstein: should take out regulation and have a volu ntary market like surgery Kuhlik: Would be very difficult to have a market li ke surgery - different incentives/smaller market Typically, you would not have manufacturing defects : the batch is recalled o Traynor concurrence in Escola Design defects: unlikely - although see Rest. 2d of Products: \u00a7 402(a) o Misuse of the product? Mostly warning defect cases: 1. Adequacy of the warning 2. Must show that the product is the causal agent AND 3. A new warning would have changed behavior (effect o f the heeding presumption) Nelson (W.D. Mo. 2000): Nelson lost his eyesight when tak ing Cordarone (prescription heart medication) and sued the defendants. Defendants mov ed for summary judgment. Adverse Event Reports are not admissible: there is no causation requirement o Doctor's identities are kept confidential: you want to be able to collect information without fear of tort liability (plaintiffs' bar) o Even if they are probative, would likely be prejudi cial o Includes things like: while patient was taking Zoco r, was hit by a truck o Even if they were admissible: not enough to get to jury (B(C range) Institutional framework trumps state discovery rule s ( see Tarasoff ) Laerdal (D. Or. 1994): A manufacturer of a medical device who received information about death/serious injury must submit report within 5 da ys and a written report within 15 days Laerdal did not submit the report about the defibri llator because the FDA investigator concluded that the information regarding the death was \"indefinite\" Even if you check the device later and it works: th is is insufficient: FDA wants more info Was this because of a bad battery in the defibrilla tor? Did the EMT check the battery? FDA Law | 19 Doctrine of Private Necessity: Forsham v. Califano : Plaintiffs are physicians who orally administer phenformin. The Sec'y of HEW suspended t he NDA for phenformin under \"Imminent Hazard\" doctrine. The court upheld the Secretary's decision. No subsequent case invoked imminent hazard authorit y The only person who can use is the Secretary: this is not delegable authority Post(market surveillance serves as a background for (a) enforcement and for (b) withdrawal PREEMPTION Concurrent Jurisdiction/Administrative Preemption State Regulation: a qualified sonogr apher, who purchased an ultrasound machine from GE and went in to business as \"Baby Images\" Non(diagnostic use of the product is largely the sa me as the diagnostic use There would very little difference in the use of th e product under doctor supervision o Seems like this is being used as a an anti(competit ive mechanism Typically: use is defined by the manufacturer and n ot the user Not adulterated, but was misbranded FDA was aware of the nonmedical use and didn't do a nything: but this was not any kind of clear action (similar to Wyeth type situation) A.P.A. v. Weinberger (D.D.C. 1976): FDA action prohibited all licensed pharmacies from dispensing methadone - regulating the dispensation of a drug The court determined that Congress created two comp lementary institutions: the FDA - which new drugs can enter the flow of commerce The DEA (Justice Department) has control over permi ssible distribution of a cleared drug o Here, the FDA overstepped the boundaries of its aut hority Here, the issues are similar as with dietary supple ments - \"safety\" includes possibility of misuse Proposition 65 (1986): regulation passed in California that requi red a warning on all substances that cause cancer or birth defects - \"no person in the c ourse of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical k nown to cause reproductive toxicity...\" FDAMA: states cannot impose additional warning (pre emption) except Prop 65 Prop 65 was enforced either by the state OR by priv ate action o Included nicotine as a chemical known to cause repr oductive toxicity Dowhal (Cal 2004): FDA granted permission to nicotine pat ches with warning \"Nicotine can increase your baby's heart rate: seek advice of a h ealth professional\" Dowhal alleged that defendants violated Prop 65 bec ause they didn't follow warning FDA did not let them change the warning to \"harm yo ur baby\" language: too strong This is an example of conflict preemption: the state law is preempted Dental Amalgam (9th Cir. 1996): the MDA (unlike the drug law) has an express preemption provision - what is the scope of that preemption? Anytime that there is a federal requirement for a d evice, there is preemption Because the FDA did not require any regulation (no PMA) the state regulation is not preempted Statutory Preemption Comes from the Supremacy Clause to (1) achieve unif ormity and (2) not allow one state to legislate for all others (race to the top) FDA Law | 20 Policy Issues: Other methods for safe harbor A. Contract Liability a. But you can't have unconscionable contracts B. Fund (like the vaccines) C. Defense of Federal Compliance (Regulatory Complianc e Defense) D. Tort Reform (Class Action law in 1966, failure to w arn requirements) E. Preemption 1. Congress can expressly preempt state law 2. Implied Preemption : a. When state law actually conflicts with federal law b. When state law frustrates the purposes of a comprehensive federal law The DEA establishes a schedule of narcotics o But see: Thalidomid, Accutane: in cases where the D EA is not pushing back against FDA, they are more able to control distribution - D EA usually beats FDA Oxycontin : Purdue Pharms was prosecuted by United States be cause too much of the drug was diverted (and they had told doctors that their drug was less likely to be diverted) o Park Doctrine : can hold CEOs responsible for the crimes of their underlings, even if they had no specific knowledge of their actions Administrative preemption only works against state regulations, not torts Riegel v. Medtronic (2008): The Balloon Catheter is a Class III device that was approved in 1994 and its label underwent supplemental approval in 19 95/96. /barb2right express preemption The doctor inflated it to 10 atm (above the burst p ressure label) and it burst the artery Plaintiff brought suit that the catheter was neglig ently designed \u00a7 360k bars common(law claims challenging the safet y and effectiveness of a medical device given pre(market approval by the FDA In Lohr, the Court found that common(law claims do constit ute requirements and are therefore preempted: Lohr - 510(k) pathway is not a specific requirement for safety The specific labels from the PMA process means that the this device receives preemption Ginsburg dissent: Believed that the MDA was to preempt stat e statutes, not tort claims Wyeth v. Levine (2009): Physician directly injected the drug Phener gan into patient's vein via IV( push method (rather than IV(drip method) and gangre ne developed, arm was amputated Plaintiff brought suit because the label was defect ive o The Vermont jury found that the petitioner had fail ed to provide adequate warning The Court held that the FDA approvals did not provi de a complete defense to Levine's tort claims: here, the approval was a general approval, rather than the specific approval in Riegel When Congress has legislated in a field that States have traditionally occupied: we assumed that the state's powers are not suspended (and no express pr eemption clause, like in Riegel ) This is a pretty crazy case: clear negligence by th e doctor - intervening cause o Sometimes the physician colludes with the plaintiff to say they followed warnings Brusewitz (2011): Because of tort(suits against vaccine manu facturers that were leading to short supplies in the vaccine market (very compelling pla intiffs) as well as inconsistent vaccinations by parents, Congress created a no(fault vaccine compen sation scheme. /barb2right express preemption \"No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages for damages arising from a vaccine(related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side eff ects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied b y proper directions and warnings.\" FDA Law | 21 1. If you fall into several cases: you need not show c ausation and you can recover a. The special master has the burden to rebut causatio n (5% of cases) 2. If you fall outside, you have the burden of showing causation (5% of cases) Here, the plaintiff did not recover from the specia l master/no(fault scheme. Therefore, they sued in state court. It was held that the no(fault scheme p reempted her design(defect claim. Rest. \u00a7402A comment k: there is an exception to strict liability for una voidably dangerous things: specifically addresses pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines Breyer : the FDA should be regulating this - this is what we want and they support preemption Sotomayor (dissent) : thinks that this should be regulated by the state s - how can we have innovation without tort suits: but torts are a comp ensation system Simple, unregulated products might be addressed pro perly by the tort system, but innovation and design of complex products cannot Colaccico (3d Cir. 2008): Do SSRIs cause suicide? There is no express preemption for drugs ( Wyeth - ergo, a presumption against preemption) as there is for medical devices ( Riegel ) and for vaccines ( Brusewitz ) Here, unlike in Wyeth , the FDA had actually considered the stronger warn ing for SSRIs and had rejected it: therefore - preempted Generics: Mensing (8th Cir. 2009), cert granted : Mensing's doctor prescribed Reglan and the pharmacist filled prescription with generic bioequi valent. Patient developed tardive dyskinesia Court dismissed claims against brand name because s he hadn't taken their products //not a market(share liability case as with Sindell (DES) - we know which products she took Retained claims against the generics: manufacturer could have changed the label and Hatch( Waxman does not preempt against generics Could have also written a letter to the doctor: gen eric companies are not really equipped for patient testing Policy Issues: Informed Consent What about patterns of user error? Warning to Physicians: likely more specific and descriptive Some people think that all information should come through the doctor: doctor can tailor the identifications for the patient Warnings to Patients: but what about the internet More specific warnings are not necessarily more use ful: less information can be more valuable Some doctors may not like informed consent: you mig ht scare the patient (and they won't take necessary medicine) - on the other hand, you want patient autornomy Preemption Why might some FDA officials oppose preemption? It takes some pressure off the FDA to always get it right. Remember: you cannot have claims agai nst the FDA ( see Berkowitz ) Routine bench(scientists like preemption Kessler & Vladeck : they are concerned that the FDA is underfunded an d often gets it wrong - therefore, the tort system works as a good suppleme nt Sharkey : puts more reliance on the FDA, but is still conce rned about error Wants a \"searching review of the administrative rec ord\" Kuhlik: technically this makes sense, but actually creates perverse incentives - the record is rarely very clear, and the FDA and the manufacturers speak the same language Epstein : There are two errors - not letting drugs in and l etting too many in (( should have blanket FDA Law | 22 preemption The CBE idea suggested by Kessler and in Mensing is crazy: you really have to discuss with the FDA before changing the label Opponents of preemption are concerned about data no t shared with the FDA: but this would be the object of a fraud action (Park Doctrin e) Currently: there is not that much deference to the FDA "}
