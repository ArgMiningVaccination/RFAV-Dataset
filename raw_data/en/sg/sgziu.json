According to a Travel Post in USA Today on March 25, 2011, Canc\u00fan welcomed 5.9 million international visitors last year, up more than 400,000 from 2009. The M\u00e9xico Tourist Board's data shows that among the international visitors who visited M\u00e9xico in 2010, 67% came from north America, 14% from e urope, 9% from latin America and the Caribbean and 2% from Asia. Canc\u00fan, saw a 15.8% increase in tourist arrivals by air travel in 2010 compared to the previous year. TRAVeL TO CANC \u00faN The country's top tourism destinations, including Canc\u00fan, remain safe places to visit. The U.s. d epartment of state does not discourage U.s. citizens and visitors from traveling to Canc\u00fan. The city is located many hundreds of miles away from the M\u00e9xico-U.s. border. For example, Canc\u00fan is at least a two-hour flight away from the main areas identified as problematic. The distance from Canc\u00fan to Ciudad Juarez is 1,312 miles - approximately the same distance between new york and Miami (1,290 miles), Chicago and laredo, Texas (1,395 miles), or l os Angeles and oklahoma City (1,328 miles). As M\u00e9xico's top tourist city, the national, state and Municipal governments put high priority to its safety because Canc\u00fan helps represent 50% of the country's income from tourism. PRACT iCAL TiPS FOR iNTeRNAT iONAL TRAVeL Common sense is the key to safety wherever you travel, whether at home or abroad. May we suggest that you take certain precautions, just as you would if you were going to a new city in your own country. Be aware of your surroundings and stay alert, stick to reputable restaurants, bars and other establishments and take care when visiting unfamiliar areas. JOiN US 4-8 De CeMBeR iN CANC \u00faN!
