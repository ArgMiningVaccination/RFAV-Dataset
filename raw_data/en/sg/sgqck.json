So you can enjoy your life to the fullest. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been helping people heal for thousands of years. TCM includes several different modalities, the most famous being acupuncture. Acupuncture is a safe, painless, effective, chemical-free way to promote the body's remarkable self-healing abilities. [The Safety of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine](http://www.nccaom.org/uncategorized/the-safety-of-acupuncture-and-oriental-medicine) In our practice, we combine the modalities of acupuncture, neuro-acupuncture, Chinese herbal formulas, Asian bodywork, nutritional supplements, and dietary and lifestyle recommendations, Functional Medicine, as well as stone medicine, Aroma Acupoint Therapy with essential oils, and infrared heat and light therapies - to assist your body's natural healing ability and help you recover your health. Prevention of disease is the main and most important principle of our practice. Unfortunately, this isn't something people are typically taught in modern society. In the U.S., the typical modern thought pattern is to try to fix an illness or injury that has already taken hold: wait until the problem has been a problem for a while, one or several visits to an M.D. or a few M.D.s, one or several medications to control the symptoms, then either \"just deal with it\" or look for an alternative practitioner when the medications just don't help enough. By that time, there can be a lot to \"undo\". TCM is excellent for prevention of disease and for helping to reverse most diseases and disorders that have already started. People who discover the benefits of this amazing natural medicine learn to notice when an illness is in the beginning stage and come in for treatment right away. That way they never get to the point of having to try to chase down an illness or pain and try one or more medications prescribed to control the symptoms. In our office, we have helped people with an extensive variety of health issues, including headaches, migraines, muscle/spine/joint pain, allergies, anxiety, asthma, depression, digestive issues, loss of smell and taste, menopause, menstrual issues. neuropathy, post-stroke symptoms, paralysis, Bell's palsy, neurological issues, stress, anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, high blood pressure, heart palpitations, weight gain, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, the common cold, dizziness and vertigo, psoriasis and other skin issues, and many more. Just as you heal from a cut on your hand, the amazing healing capacity of your body is always working to stay in balance and heal from anything that is not perfect health. If you developed an ailment some time during your life, your body can heal from it, and our goal is to help you do that. Further, we believe that, even though someone may have been born with an ailment, TCM can help them live a more comfortable and productive life. The body has an amazing capacity to heal. It's just waiting for the right type of help. Since TCM helps the body to heal itself by correcting underlying patterns of imbalance, unlike in Western allopathic medicine, a single TCM practitioner can treat many different ailments.
