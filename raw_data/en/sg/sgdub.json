The objective of the report was to review the evidence on the impact of health information technology (IT) on all phases of the medication management process (prescribing and ordering, order communication, dispensing, administration and monitoring as well as education and reconciliat ion), to identify the gaps in the literature and to make recommendations for future research. Data sources. We searched peer -reviewed electronic databases, grey literature, and performed included MEDLINE,\u00ae EMBASE ,\u00ae CINAHL\u00ae (Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts ,\u00a9 Compendex,\u00a9 INSPEC\u00a9 (which includes IEEE\u00ae), Library and Information Science ,\u00ae E-Prints in Library and Information Science,\u00ae PsycINFO ,\u00ae Sociological Abstracts ,\u00a9 and Business Source\u00ae Complete . Grey literature searching involved I nternet searching, reviewing relevant Web sites , and searching electronic databases of grey literatures. AHRQ also provided all refe rences in their e- Prescribing , bar coding, and CPOE knowledge libraries. Methods . Paired reviewers looked at citations to identify studies on a range of health IT used to assist in the medication management process (MMIT) during multiple levels of screening (titles and abstracts , full text and final review for assignment of questions and data abstrction). Randomized controlled trials and cohort , case-control, and case series studies were independently assessed for quality. All data were abstracted by one reviewer and examin ed by one of two different reviewers with content and methods expertise. Results . 40,582 articles were retrieved. After duplicates were removed, 32,785 articles were screened at the title and abstract phase. 4, 578 full text articles wer e assessed and 789 articles were included in the final report. Of these, 361 met only content criteria and were listed without further abstraction. The final report included data from 428 articles across the seven key questions. Study quality varied according to phase of medication management. Substantially more s tudies, and studies with stronger comparative methods, evaluated prescribing and monitoring. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems were studi ed more than any other application of MMIT. Physicians were more often the subject of evaluation than other participants. Other health care professionals, patients, and families are important but not studied as thoroughly as physicians. These nonphysicians groups often value different aspects of MMIT, have diverse needs, and use systems differently. Hospitals and ambulatory clinics were well- represented in the literature with less emphasis placed on long- term care facilities, co mmunities, homes , and nonhospital pharmacies. Most studies evaluated changes in process and outcomes of use, usability, and knowledge, skills , and attitudes. Most showed moderate to substantial improvement with implementation of MMIT. Economics studies and those with clinical outcomes were less frequent ly studied. Those articles that did address economics and clinical outcomes often showed equivocal findings on the effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of MMIT systems. Qualitative studies provided evidence of iv strong perceptions, both positive and negative, of the effects of MMIT and unintended consequences. We found little data on the effects of forms of medications, conformity, standards, and open source status. Much descriptive literature discusses implementation issues but little strong evidence exists. Interest i s strong in MMIT and more groups and institutions will implement systems in the next decades, especially with the Federal Government's push toward more health IT to support better and more cost-effective health care. Conclus ions. MMIT is well -studied, although on closer examination of the literature the evidence is not uniform across phases of medication management, groups of people involved, or types of MMIT. MMIT holds the promise of improved processes; clinical and economi cs studies and the understanding of sustainability issues are lacking. v Contents Executive Summary ..................................................................................................................

Glossary of Terms xi Executive Summary Background Medication management is a continuum that covers all aspects of prescription medications. Medication management includes prescribing and ordering, order communication (or order transmission) between prescribers and pharmacists, dispensing, administering, and monitoring, as well as reconciliation, adherence, and education.1 Medication management is complex and costly and enhances the health and well -being of more than half of the population in the developing world. Health information technology ( health IT) holds great promise to improve the quality of health care and reduce potential and real errors in medication management while at the same time providin g cost-effective care. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is committed to summarizing and providing the evidence base for health IT. It has produced evidence summaries on health IT related to costs and benefits; 2 barriers and drivers of health IT for the elderly, chronically ill , and underserved;3 the impact of consumer informatics applications;4 and telemedicine.5 AHRQ also has contracted for evidence summaries on the use of health IT in decisionmaking,6 patient -centered care,7 and decision support for health care decisionmaking.8 The contracted reports will be available through www.healthit.AHRQ.gov in mid-2011. Although these reports often mention medication management, the body of published evidence on all aspects of the medication man agement process and how it is affected by multiple health IT systems has not been consolidated. A single document is needed to summarize the evidence evaluating the effects of health IT on the medication management process across providers, settings, patients, and research methods. The objectives of this report are to: 1. Review the literature on the effects of health IT on medication management. 2. Synthesize available evidence regarding the effectiveness and effects of health IT in all phases of medication management as well as reconciliation and education. 3. Identify gaps in the literature. 4. Make recommendations for future research. For the purposes of this review, medication management includes the processes that encompass the five phases of the medication pr ocess ( i.e., prescribing and ordering, order communication, dispensing, administering, and monitoring) across groups of health professionals, patients, and their informal caregivers, and two aspects of quality with respect to medication management across the five phases of medication management (medication reconciliation and education, both postprofessional education of training and patient education related to medication management). Medication management can also include procurement, storage, and reportin g from the first assessment of patients to determine their need for drugs through to optimal care and monitoring after the drugs are prescribed. The organization of the information in this report is based on the Bell framework of the five phases across the continuum of medication management and reconciliation and education. 1 To address the goals of this report, we further define medication management health IT (MMIT) applications as electronic systems that ( 1) collect, process , or exchange health information about patients; ( 2) are integrated with existing health IT systems such as electronic health records or electronic medical record (EMR) systems ; and (3) provide advice or suggestions to either the health care provider or the patients and their families on issues or ES-1 decisions related to medication management. We recognize that functional elements of the MMIT will vary across particular implementation approaches within a given phase of medication management. Many of the MMIT applications we found were designed to encompass more than one phase of medication management. The sophistication of the systems, degree of integration of the health IT into workflow systems, and the broad range of settings in which a particular health IT is implemented and used are als o complex and varied. Many health professionals, support staff, patients , and patients ' families were involved in medication management in the studies assessed. The evidence assessing MMIT is large, diffuse, and published across many disciplines. People wh o can benefit from the knowledge in this report include health professionals, researchers, administrators , and other decisionmakers and those who develop and implement health IT applications. This report is timely because of the Federal emphasis on the use of health IT to improve health care while at the same time making health and wellness care more cost effective and safer. Seven questions structure this evidence report. Within reporting related to the questions, sections are based on phases of medication management. Reporting is done to address the multiple settings where medication management is important, the range of health care providers who deliver and support care using medications, and classes of medications, specific drugs, or a broad spectrum of medications. Key Questions (KQs) KQ1. Effectiveness Within all phases of the medication management continuum, what evidence exists that health IT applications are effective in improving: a. Health care processes, b. Other intermediate outcomes (e.g., satisfactio n with system, usability, knowledge, skills, and attitude), c. Costs and economic outcomes, d. Clinical outcomes for patients, e. Population level outcomes, and f. Composite outcomes. g. To what extent does the impact of health IT on improving health care process es, othe r outcomes, costs and economics, and clinical outcomes vary depending on the type of medication (controlled or noncontrolled substance) or the form of the medication (e.g., oral, injection, intravenous)? KQ2. Gaps in Knowledge or Evidence What knowledge o r evidence deficits exist to support estimates of cost, benefit, impact, and net value with regard to health IT applications in all phases of medication management? KQ3. Value Proposition for Implementers and Users What critical information regarding the impact of health IT applications implemented to support the phases of medication management is needed to give clinicians, health care facility administrators, patients, and their families a clear understanding of the value proposition particular to them? ES-2 KQ4. System Characteristics What evidence supports or refutes the impact of any of: open source, homegrown, proprietary, local configuration ability, system configuration ability, conformity with standards being Certification Commission for Healthcare Inf ormation Technology (CCHIT) certified, system architecture, or feature set on the decision to purchase, implement, or use health IT in medication management systems? KQ5. Sustainability What factors influence sustainability of health IT applications that support a phase of the medication management continuum? a. What evidence exists to demonstrate that health care settings (ambulatory, long -term care, etc.) influence implementation, use, and effectiveness of such health IT applications? b. What is the impact (c hallenges, merits, costs, and benefits) of having electronic access to patient data on the quality and safety of care provided by health IT applications that support at least one phase of the continuum of medication management? KQ6. Two-Way Prescription Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) In a two -way electronic data interchange (EDI) between the prescribers and pharmacists: a. What evidence exists demonstrating the barriers and drivers of implementation of complete EDI that can support the prescription, transmittal and receipt, and perfection process of e-Prescriptions? b. How do barriers, facilitators, and economic incentives vary across pharmacists, physicians , and other relevant stakeholders with respect to adoption and use of complete EDI (e -Prescribing/order ing with e -Transmission)? KQ7. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) What evidence exists regarding the extent of integration of electronic clinical decision support in a health IT system for the prescribing, dispensing, and administering of medications, and to what extent does the use of clinical decision support systems impact the various outcomes (e.g., health care process, intermediate, cost and economics, and clinical) of interest? Methods We anticipated fin ding few RCTs across all phases of medication management and MMIT applications. Studies that employ other research methods can also provide valuable evidence for understanding MMIT applications. We therefore included studies employing a range of research methodologies. We restricted our analysis to hypothesis-driven studies with group comparisons and appropriate statistical analysis in addition to qualitative studies with explicit methods for KQ1: Effectiveness . The only methodological limit was for assessment of the effect of CDSSs on prescribing, for which sufficient RCTs were available to provide evidence for synthesis. Through consultation with our internal team and AHRQ, we determined that the answers to KQ2: Gaps in Knowledge or Evidence and KQ3: Value Proposition for Implementers and Users would become evident from our review of the evidence in KQ1: Effectiveness. We supplemented these articles with other studies addressing values propositions by stakeholders. KQ4: System ES-3 Characteristics addresses the impact of MMIT application features on the likelihood that the systems will be purchased, implemented , and used. The evidence for this question comes from studies of all designs that measure implementation, use, and purchasing decisions. KQ5: Sustainability addresses the factors influencing the sustainability of MMIT applications, specifically the impact of the setting and access to other electronic data within integrated systems on health care quality and safety. To identify articles that addressed this question , the team, in consultation with AHRQ, used the definition of sustainability by Humphreys et al., 9 which restricted our choice of articles to only a few. Their definition of sustainability was the ability of a health service to provide ongoing access to appropriate quality care in a cost- and health - effective manner. KQ6: Two-Way Prescription EDI relates to the barriers and facilitators to complete EDI between prescribers and pharmacies during the time between prescription writing and dispensing and how these vary across stakeholders. The best evidence available for KQ6 is found in articles studying EDI between prescribers and pharmacies that include original data (qualitative or quantitative). Because insufficient evidence was found on two- way EDI , we included one-way EDI as well. KQ7: RCTs of CDSS addresses the extent to which CDSS systems are integrated into health IT systems for medication management and the impact on outcomes as described in KQ1: Effectiveness. As a team we felt that adequate evidence was available to address this issue so that we could limit our scope to RCTs. Given the broad range of questions and outcomes addressed, we searched peer- reviewed electronic databases by first using textwords relating to the various types of health IT applied to medication management (Appendix A of the full report ). These searches were then combined with a search using subject headings related to the five medication management phases plus reconciliation and education as well as specific health IT application terms (e.g., CDSS). We combined these medication management terms with computer and technology terms. When possible, we excluded letters, editorials, commentaries , and animal studies. Because our interest was in all study designs, we did not limit b ased on methodology. We also put no limits on language or time to capture the global literature and early studies. Databases searched included MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Cochrane Database of Systemat ic Reviews, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts , Compendex, Inspec (which includes IEEE Xplore ), Library and Information Science Abstracts , E-Prints in Library and Information Science, PsycINFO , Sociological Abstracts , and Business Source Complete. We also looked for eligible studies by reviewing grey literature sites, performing hand searches of pertinent reviews, querying our experts , and by reviewing the AHRQ National Resource Center for Health IT Knowledge Library resources ( available at: http://healthit.ahrq.gov/portal/server.pt/community/knowledge_library/653 ) . The search results were downloaded into Reference Manager version 10 (ISI ResearchSoft) and uploaded into a customized systematic review management system (Health Information Research Unit, McMaster University). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they used health IT in any aspect of the medication management process. We included articles on MMIT only if the system was integrated with at least one existing health IT system and if they proc essed patient -specific information and provided advice or suggestions. A critical inclusion requirement was the integration of information. Personal digital assistants (PDAs), which integrated patient-specific information provided by either the clinicians or the patients, were analyzed to assist in medication management decisions ES-4 (by request of AHRQ). This exception is made because PDAs and hand -held devices are considered an important, and perhaps unique, means of improving health care quality in relation to medications. The use of PDAs to manage medications is especially important for clinicians and patients who are in settings that do not have large, sophisticated, and integrated information systems. Other stand -alone devices with no integration of information with another health IT were excluded. Articles on all five phases of the management process plus med ication reconciliation and postprofessional education related to MMIT were included. Once we tagged the articles for content, we assessed whether those that passed our inclusion criteria were pertinent to specific key questions. Many articles were analyzed in several phases of medication management and sections of the report. Studies were classified as being observational, case-control, cohort, or RCTs. The quality of included studies was assessed using the same criteria employed by Jimison et al. in their AHRQ report. 3 RCT scoring was based on the Delphi consensus work done by Verhagan and colleagues.10 This scale is referred to in this report as the Verhagen/AHRQ RCT quality scale. Observational studies with before- after, time series, surveys , or qualitative methods were not assessed for quality because few well -validated instruments exist. Bibliographies of systematic and narrative reviews were exami ned to identify studies, and select reviews were integrated into sections of the report. Data were abstracted from relevant articles and tagged for applicability to the various key questions. Given the range of questions addressed, data abstraction was per formed by a core group of staff and entered into online data abstraction forms. One reviewer did the a bstraction , and a second, senior reviewer checked its accuracy. The authors of this report performed a final check on the abstracted data. The reviewers w ere not blinded to the identity of the article authors, institutions , or journal . Data abstraction was difficult in many instances because of the lack of accepted definitions and absence of important features of the study or MMIT application. For example, we identified problems with the differences between computerized provider order entry (CPOE ) for ordering and e -Prescribing systems. Definitions for medication errors and related terms were often inconsistently used. To make data abstraction easier , we est ablished working definitions, which can be found in Appendix F of the full report. Meta-analysis was not performed on any data because of the heterogeneity of the studies in terms of interventions, populations, technologies used, and outcomes measured, as well as the presence of mostly descriptive and observational studies. Throughout the project, the core team sought feedback from the internal advisors, our Task Officer from AHRQ, and the T echnical Expert Panel. Results Our literature search retrieved 40 ,582 articles. After duplicates were removed, 32,785 articles were screened at title and abstract stage. From a full -text screen of 4, 578 articles, we identified 789 articles that were eligible for inclusion in this report. Of these articles, 361 met only our inclusion criteria for content and did not have group comparisons, hypothesis testing, or appropriate analysis. These are listed in the bibliography of the report. Across the seven key questions, we synthesized the information from 428 articles. KQ1. Effectiveness All outcomes. KQ1 : Effectiveness contains 379 studies assessing changes in process, intermediate outcomes, clinical outcomes , and economic and cost outcomes. The majority of ES-5 studies were observational, with a fair number of RCTs for prescribing and monitoring phases (Table A). Fifty -three qualitative studies are included in this total. Prescribing and monitoring were the most frequently studied phases of medication management (Table A), with hospital and ambulatory care settings well- represented to the near exclusion of long- term care, home, and community (Table B). Though dealing with prescriptions and medications, pharmacists were poorly represented in studies, most focused on physicians (Table C). CDSS and CPOE systems were the most often studied MMIT technologies (Table D). Table A.

The evidence is strongest specifically during the prescribing and monitoring phases. Few studies evaluated clinical outcomes associated with the use of MMIT. Those that did often did not show statistically significant improvements in clinical outcomes. Most of the studies with statistically ES-7 significant differences in clinical outcomes found small differences. The small number of articles with data on clinical outcomes is probably due, at least in part, to the difficulty in evaluating and establishing a direct association between the use of MMIT and clinical outcomes. This difficulty arises because of the distant nature of the outcome compared with the application of the health IT. Other contributing factors could also be considered. Much of the rel atively new research is addressing the type of research needed to come to a realist ic and useful assessment of MMIT: pilot and demonstration projects and quantitative studies. Limited evidence suggests that MMIT can likely be cost effective, although most of the economic data come from cost analyses, which were often incomplete and seldom from head -to\u00ad head cost -effectiveness, cost utility or cost -benefit trials. A substantial body of qualitative literature indicates support for the use of health IT in the various phases of medication management by a number of health care providers and patient groups. Survey studies of satisfaction and use reflect similar findings of acceptance and satisfaction, although most indicated room for improvement. Issues relating t o changing care practices and workflow are frequently mentioned. The studies also provide useful summaries of unintended consequences of MMIT applications, which are discussed in detail in the full report. Process changes. Most of the studies evaluating M MIT applications provided data on changes in process (225 of 378). Distribution in the number of studies across the five phases, plus reconciliation and education, was not equal. Prescribing was studied in 174 studies, order communication in 16 studies, dispensing in 9 studies, administering in 19 studies, and monitoring in 47 studies. Four studies evaluated reconciliation and one studied patient education. Studies often evaluated more than one phase. Prescribing. The prescribing phase is well studied (174 studies), especially in hospital (61 percent of studies) and ambulatory care settings (39 percent). Long- term care centers (one study) and community and home settings (no studies) are not well studied . Physicians are by far the most studied group of health professionals. More studies are needed that evaluate nonphysician use of MMIT, specifically pharmacists, mental health professionals, nurses, and other nonphysician prescribers, as well as patients and their caregivers. Many of the studies of health care providers who were not physicians were purely descriptive of the people involved with them, and the systems themselves. Based on the studies of process changes, CDSS and CPOE systems can play an important role in making prescribing and ordering more accurate, improving record keeping, and speeding up and improving communication. Both systems, either alone or, more often, integrated, are well studied (multiple studies with strong methods). Other MMIT applications lack evidence, especially those that involv e nurses, pharmacists, and patients and their families. MMIT in prescribing is associated with improvements in patient safety -related processes of the prescribing process, especially in hospital-based studies (87 percent, 52 of 60 studies), and somewhat le ss in ambulatory-based studies (68 percent, 28 of 41 studies). Errors related to prescribing and ordering were reduced in hospital-based studies (68 percent, 15 of 22 studies), but prescribing errors were not studied as often in ambulatory settings (two of two studies were positive). Reductions in time were related to the time taken to order or prescribe or the speed of the prescribing -to-administering processes. Most reductions in time were not seen as often in hospital-based studies (four of seven studies positive), but were positive more often in ambulatory settings (four of five studies). Adherence to treatment guidelines, reminders, and ES-8 recommended practice was improved in hospital studies (83 percent, 19 of 23) and to a lesser but still significant extent in ambulatory studies (64 percent, nine of 14 studies). Workflow was not evaluated in these studies of changes in process, although issues of workflow are addressed in qualitative studies in other sections of this report. Order communication. Order co mmunication, like dispensing, is one of the two medication management phases with the least number of studies\u2014only 16 were identified. Two- way EDI holds promise to increasing the effectiveness of perfecting the prescription/order interactions between clini cian prescribers and pharmacists. Currently, evidence on one-way communication predominates. The changes in process were also varied (two studies of errors, two of prescribing changes, five on time considerations , and three on workflow). Most studies were done using quantitative observational methods and all showed positive results. Dispensing. Nine studies (three RCTs) assessed process improvements in dispensing. All process changes that were evaluated were found to be positive: four on modifications of the drugs that the pharmacists dispensed, three on errors, two on workflow, and one on adherence to good practice. With these few studies and multiple outcomes, evidence is limited on the role of MMIT in improving dispensing. This supports the findings of a Canadian health technology assessment report on MMIT that evaluated hospital dispensing and administering medications in hospitals. 11 Administering. Many articles dealing with administering medications were not included in this report because they were d escriptive and did not include comparative data. Nineteen studies, 1 RCT, 1 cohort study, and 17 quantitative observational studies, were included. All studies were set in hospitals and included nurses. The MMIT systems were well integrated into multiple hospital IT systems. Error -reduction goals were common in the studies and almost always found to be improved (8 of 13 studies of errors). Errors were mixed , as some related to transcription and some to timing of administration, while some identified more se rious errors. Four studies showed no improvement in errors while one study showed increases in errors, mostly related to timing of administration. 12 Four of five studies showed reductions in time from ordering to administering medication. Two studies evalu ated the allocation of nursing time: one showed change and one did not in the proportion of time spent on various nursing tasks, including direct patient care, with the introduction of integrated MMIT for medication administering. Monitoring. In our analysis, 70 percent (33 of 47 studies) of the included studies were associated with a 50 percent improvement in half or more process measures. Of these studies, most targeted physicians exclusively (34 studies), were conducted in academic institutions (33 studies), were developed for use in the ambulatory care setting (28 studies), focused on the adult population (36 studies), and provided CDSS with alerts or reminders to support chronic disease management (12 studies). Studies that involved laboratory- based medication monitoring were most likely (76 percent of the time) to be associated with a greater than 50 percent improvement in a process outcome(s) than sign - or symptom- based medication monitoring. The most successful types of studies focused on changing prescriber behavior, improving response time to generated alerts, and improving the diagnosis and management of chronic diseases. ES-9 Reconciliation . Two systematic reviews and four studies provided evidence for improved reconciliation of medications with he alth IT. Reconciliation is the matching of medication lists over time, from different health care systems or from different prescribers. The evidence on reconciliation of medication lists is sparse, especially for systems that are fully integrated and capable of providing electronic comparisons of historical and current medications for individual patients at hospital discharge or on transfer to other facilities. All four studies showed improvements in agreement among lists of medications and two extended the evaluation to show improved prescribing 13 and reduced errors.14 Unintended consequences. Eighteen studies provided data on adverse effects or unintended consequences. Two qualitative studies identified classes or categories of unintended consequences of health IT, many of which apply to MMIT applications. Some unintended consequences are minor, and some are major. In addition, some are seen to be positive and helpful. Some consequences are serious. For example, a small but statistically significant increase in mortality was seen in a children 's hospital that installed a CPOE system that did not match workflow needs. 15 A similar study showed another children's hospital that did not see the same increase in mortality in admitted children after their careful planning and implementation of health IT. 16 Several authors contend that all health IT has unintended consequences. Formal evaluations of health IT installations should seek these unintended consequences and report them in their publications related to the evaluation. The importance of unintended consequences of MMIT also depends on the severity of the event, the degree of invasiveness of the MMIT, and the extent to which the use of the MMIT system disrupts existing workflow and processes. Consideration of formal reporting of serious unintended consequences might benefit all involved in development and implementation of MMIT systems. The qualitative studies in this report supplied a richer understanding of the adverse effects of MMIT, and they can form a s trong base for more qualitative and quantitative studies of unintended consequences. Education. Education related to MMIT centers on three aspects : formal informatics training during professional education or after graduation, training to use the MMIT systems, and improved outcomes based on knowledge and skills because of the use of the MMIT systems for health care providers, patients, and their families. This report does not include preprofessional or professional education related to the use and understa nding of MMIT systems or certification in informatics or eHealth, all important aspects of MMIT application development and integration. Although we sought articles assessing postprofessional education related to changes in process associated with MMIT sys tems , we did not identify any articles that met our criteria. Training in the use of systems was often mentioned in articles but was not evaluated. Only one article was related to the educational component of MMIT systems for patient and family use, and it was associated with improved clinical outcomes. More information on health care professional and patient education is included in the sections of this report dealing with intermediate outcomes. Intermediate outcomes. Intermediate outcomes deal with use, usability, education, knowledge, skills , and attitudes. Most studies with intermediate main endpoints focused on measuring use, correlates of use, perceptions , and satisfaction in the prescribing phase (26 of 42 studies). As for changes in process, clinici ans and prescribing were well-studied. Use, perceptions, and satisfaction were reported to be improved. Factors such as ease of use, perceived usefulness, and improved quality of care predominated. Satisfaction and attitudes varied depending on the role of ES-10 the health care provider. Variation in needs and roles of health professionals with respect to use of health IT are real and should be considered when choosing or implementing any new IT system. Usability studies with comparison groups are sparse but can provide useful suggestions to improve systems. Usability studies are often difficult to generalize or transfer across settings, in part because MMIT effectiveness is linked strongly to the culture, institutional leadership, and other situation specific fac tors. Therefore, applicability of findings related to usability is problematic in MMIT applications. Economic outcomes. Five of 31 articles dealing with costs conducted comprehensive economic evaluations (costs and consequences). Two evaluated a CPOE syst em and three evaluated CDSS. Most of the studies that included monetary data (22 of 31 studies) were partial economic evaluations in the form of cost analyses (assessing costs of alternatives without analysis of effectiveness or efficacy). Most of these partial economic analyses assessed costs of prescribed medications with the MMIT system compared with not having the MMIT system. Several studies found that health IT interventions may offer cost advantages despite their increased acquisition costs. These s tudies showed that over time, a net benefit accrued based on cost reductions resulting from the MMIT (such as lower adverse drug events (ADEs), drug costs, and laboratory test usage). However, given the uncertainty that surrounds the cost and outcomes data, and limited study designs available in the literature, it is difficult to reach any definitive conclusion as to whether the additional costs and benefits represent value for money. Clinical outcomes. A total of 76 studies sought to measure improvement in clinical outcomes or reduction in ADEs, of which 26 (34 percent) reported significant benefits of health IT. One reported harm \u2014a small but clinically important increase in mortality when an inflexible CPOE was implemented in a children 's hospital. 15 Because of the seriousness of the implications of this study, many people reviewed this article and its methods.17 A later and similar study showed that with careful planning another children' s hospital did not see the same increase in mortality in admitted children after the implementation of a health IT.16 An additional two studies implemented CDSSs to reduce costs and assessed whether reductions in drug use increased mortality15 and length of stay.18 Both studies lacked sufficient power to conduct a valid as sessment. Studies that used laboratory- , sign - and symptom-based monitoring approaches were mostly clinician based . If the MMIT monitoring was used to identify and intervene with patients with actual problems (e.g., excess blood pressure) or needed care (e. g., hemoglobin A1c monitoring), this appear s to be more effective than CDSS approaches that identified theoretical problems (potential for ADEs), particularly if patients are also sent reminders and decision support recommendations. Highly targeted interve ntions, which focused on specific problems that provide problem- related specific interventions, appear to be more effective than more diffusely focused systems such as CDSS and CPOE. Some of these highly targeted interventions involved CDSS tools for impro ving the effectiveness of anticoagulants (proportion of days with blood clotting parameters within the therapeutic range), improving the choice, route, and duration of antibiotics, and reducing ADEs related to antibiotic use, and most were successful. Studies that have been successful in improving patient outcomes target high risk and vulnerable populations who have poor disease control, lack sufficient access to health care providers to manage their condition or subpopulations with sufficient economic resources to ES-11 respond to the CDSS intervention. The effect of similar CPOE systems on mortality can vary substantially as a function of the extent to which implementation strategies disrupt or delay critical activities in the clinical setting and demand additio nal time for order entry from clinical staff. Critically ill patients (i.e., those who are most vulnerable) are most likely to be affected by dysfunctional technology and implementation strategies. Qualitative studies. Qualitative studies seek to understand phenomena and answer questions of why and how as well as to gain insights into real life situations. They often study the more human or \" soft\" side of health and health care. The preceding sections concentrated on studies with quantitative outcomes. Fi fty-three qualitative studies are included in this section. Patient safety was the main health aspect evaluated in qualitative studies. Before MMIT implementation most studies found that clinicians expected that MMIT would improve patient safety and once implemented most clinicians felt that MMIT had improved safety. The qualitative studies focused on system design including workflow changes, challenges with the system interface , and new communication processes\u2014 all of which can generate new kinds of medica l errors, which in some cases were detrimental to patient safety. Early implementers associated MMIT with a lot of self -reported \"hard work\" by those who were expected to use the new systems. These people, most often health professionals, struggled, often independently, with limited guidance with respect to planning and implementation tactics during preparation for and implementation of the MMIT applications. During planning and early implementation , the users often experienced unanticipated effects. Frequently , the initial stage was disruptive and, consequently, clinicians found provision of care to be more challenging with the MMIT system than without. However, after the initial stage was over , the attitudes of the care providers changed , and the potential benefits of the system become clearer to most. Of special note is that the implementation of MMIT systems generated emotional responses in a broad range of health professionals, both positive and negative. For example, strong feelings were associated with reminders and alerts 19 and CPOE.20 MMIT implementation did not just mean that a clinician needed to learn a new IT system, but the implementation also affected most of the other parts of the delivery of care processes , including how the interdisciplinary care team worked together. KQ2. Knowledge and Evidence Gaps We identified gaps in the report, some that we expected and some that we did not. We address the question of knowledge deficits across phases and outcomes, settings and participants, grouping sim ilar gaps together. Phases of m edication management. Because of the preponderance of publications on the prescribing and monitoring phases, they are less in need of more study than the other phases of order communication, dispensing and administering, and medication reconciliation. In addition, the educational or training requirements for effective use of MMIT applications by health professionals need to be studied as well as education related to patients as new MMIT applications are developed for their use. Research methods. MMIT applications are complex interventions and need to be studied in pragmatic (i.e., does it work in real settings ?) evaluation projects and using complex interventions methods. The applications also should ideally be studied by te ams of researchers ES-12 with, or teams that seek consultation from, those who have experience in clinical practice, research methods, statistical analysis, and informatics training and experience. Qualitative studies are also vital to understand the complex nature of how systems are used and valued, especially across groups of health professionals who often have different needs and expectations. Health care p roviders. Physicians are well studied . Nurses, midlevel practitioners (nurse practitioners, physician assistants, midwives), pharmacists, other prescribers such as dentists and mental health practitioners, and hospital administrators need studies directed at their needs, practice patterns, and health IT tools. Patients. Many studies included data related to patients, usually in the measurement and reporting of process changes and other outcomes. Few studies, however, concentrated on how the MMIT systems directly affected patients and clinical outcomes important to them. Traditionally , MMIT systems were devel oped as clinician and administrator tools. Patient and family use of MMIT systems is becoming more important, and this gap in our understanding needs to be addressed. Settings. Hospitals and ambulatory care settings are well studied . Gaps exist in our knowledge of the effectiveness of MMIT in long-term care facilities, the community, and homes. Long- term care facilities most need strong qualitative and quantitative studies because the y rely heavily on medication. Homes, schools, and other community setting s will also become more important with shifting care to more self -reliance in relation to wellness care and chronic disease management. Health IT. Much research has gone into evaluating CDSS and CPOE systems, either alone or integrated. For example, 77 of 88 RCTs evaluated some aspect of CDSSs. Other MMIT applications, especially those that are used by nonphysicians or outside the prescribing and monitoring phases, lack evidence. Examples with little evidence on effectiveness are bar coding for administer ing and dispensing, pharmacy information systems, electronic medication administration record systems , and fully integrated comprehensive information systems. Process changes. Patient safety processes such as error reductions and improvement in prescribin g have a strong evidence base. Issues related to workflow, communication changes, and unintended consequences are understudied. More study of laboratory-based monitoring of medications, especially in facilities that have highly integrated information systems , is important. More qualitative and controlled studies are needed as well as multicenter studies and those that use methods developed by groups focusing on health technology assessment (HTA). These HTA methods include integrated reports that bring toget her research syntheses, modeling of processes and full economic reports, and cost studies. Often these HTA reports do not, but can, involve additional collection of evidence. Intermediate outcomes. More study is needed on the importance of usability testi ng in all stages of development and use. This must be done with all users and not just segments of those involved in using MMIT. Usability studies have not traditionally been generalizable or transferrable but more limited to a specific setting. AHRQ might consider a research program in how to make these usability studies more applicable to multiple institutions, training in usability ES-13 methods, collection of usability tools and completed studies, and research into the need for standards of usability testing for new or modified systems. Usability studies must also include all users of systems. For example, systems that have been optimized only for physician users are usually systems that nurses and other health professionals have difficulty using. Workarounds have often been unofficially implemented by users instead of system modifications and improvements. Clinical outcomes. Findings associated with improvement in clinical outcomes are still equivocal. These studies are difficult to do well, expensive, and time consuming, but they must be done. Multicentered trials planned by strong teams of experienced people from multiple backgrounds are vital. Cost and e conomic outcomes. Although many studies exist that list costs and outcomes, few comprehensive and definitive studies of the economic value of MMIT applications exist. Both the potential for improvement and the costs of implementing and maintaining these systems are huge. Again, well -planned studies with broad input from many stakeholders are necessary for understanding the true worth of MMIT applications. HTA or other studies that integrate costs and consequences of MMIT systems would be ideal. Qualitative. Qualitative studies have provided much valuable information about MMIT. Gaps in qualitative knowledge center on the lack of qualitative studies that address the effects of MMIT on health outcomes. In addition, very few qualitative studies examined the effects of MMIT from the perspective of the patient. KQ3. Value Proposition for Implementers and Users Value proposition is determined from a balance of financial, clinical, and organizational benefits. A clear assessment of each of these from the viewpoint of each stakeholder is needed to make a clear value judgment. For each stakeholder \u2014and many are involved with MMIT implementation \u2014the relative importance of these three elements is different. Values will also vary depending on the setting and the type of technology employed. Multiple stakeholders, some of whom may be distant from the MMIT, need to be considered in any value proposition study. Based on the evidence in KQ1: Effectiveness, knowledge about the three elements needed to make value judgments is slowly accumulating. We cite only 31 papers in this section, although some of our assessments come from sections of this report that have included more studies. Gains in productivity and process of care outcomes have been shown, but good evidence of improvement in patient outcomes with MMIT is weak or lacking. The body of economic literature is still sparse an d lacks vigorous study. We found little theoretical work or actual studies that were done to determine what each stakeholder takes into account to reach value proposition judgments related to MMIT. KQ4. System Characteristics Few studies (n = 21) demonstr ated evidence of the impact of the characteristics of MMIT applications on the likelihood to purchase, implement, and use such IT applications. No studies assessed open -source health IT applications, with only one study each on conformity with standards an d CCHIT -certified systems. Twenty of the articles related to the prescribing and ordering phase. Almost all of the articles suggest that feature sets of health IT applications have ES-14 been instrumental in reaching decisions to adopt MMIT applications. Certain features of systems improve the likelihood of purchase, implementation, and use of MMIT. The literature, however, is sparse and observational in nature. Most often authors described barriers and concerns toward implementation and acceptance rather than ch aracteristics of MMIT that could facilitate implementation, purchase, and use of such systems. Authors seldom provided enough details about the technology to form conclusions about the value of feature sets and system characteristics. Head -to-head comparisons of systems differing in their features were not found. KQ5. Sustainability Our literature review revealed three important findings: sustainability is frequently mentioned in the core biomedical informatics literature, it is poorly defined, and none of the articles included in this evidence report explicitly studied sustainability. These findings are not entirely surprising. A previous AHRQ-sponsored evidence report that assessed the costs and benefits of health IT in pediatrics found only one article t hat explicitly discussed sustainability. 21 Future research would be beneficial for many if a study or group would develop an operational definition of sustainability that could be used to study its determinants. Moreover, it is likely that the Health Infor mation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 will lead to improvements and sustainability of health IT applications that specifically support the medication management continuum through meaningful use. We have summarized a body o f literature that uses surveys to detect patterns in the characteristics of people and organizations that are more likely to implement various technologies. These surveys are often the basis for further study into barriers and facilitators to increasing up take and adoption. Integration of MMIT with other systems was an inclusion criterion for our report (except for PDAs that analyzed patient -specific data). Some technologies were integrated with a greater number of components than others. Frequently, the descriptions of the systems were inadequate to fully determine how the systems were connected. Access to various other information sources, most notably laboratory reports, enhanced the performance and acceptance of the MMIT applications. KQ6. Complete Two -Way Electronic D ata Interchang e No reports documenting the use of complete two-way EDI systems were found. Evidence from the limited set of one -way, e-Prescribing studies was extrapolated to identify possible key facilitators and barriers to completely ele ctronic, two- way, e -Prescribing systems. Possible facilitators include monetary or other incentives to providers, a permissive regulatory environment, and the existence of an established standard for prescription EDI. Barriers included the low rate of EMR adoption in the United States, regulatory and legal uncertainties, and inadequate consideration of the effects of e-Prescriptions on pharmacists and pharmacies and their processes. While answering this question, we found that the Bell model does not repres ent the two -way communication between pharmacists and prescribers\u2014it shows only a one- way linear movement of information. KQ7. Effectiveness of CDSS Seventy -seven RCTs were designated as primarily studying CDSS related to medication management and integrated with other health IT. These studies involved 4,709 providers and 828,441 patients in total. All studies assisted with at least the prescribing or monitoring phases of ES-15 medication management. Overall, we found a lack of RCTs addressing electronic decision support integrated with other types of health IT. Statistically significant process changes were often shown in these RCTs. Only a small minority of these focus on clinical outcomes, however. Studies with clinical outcomes are those that are most importan t to guide decisionmaking of patients ' providers and policymakers about the usefulness and need for MMIT interventions. A very small number of studies reported improvement in clinical outcomes. Discussion The literature of MMIT presents challenges. It is diffused across multiple disciplines , and much of it is descriptive in nature. We also found that although studies with strong methods exist, they are not uniformly dispersed across phases of medication management, people, settings, or health IT applicatio ns. The literature would be stronger if standardized definitions of issues like medic ation errors, adverse effects, MMIT applications, and sustainability were implemented. The evidence of effectiveness can be made stronger with directed evaluation funding. With direction the evaluations could be encouragement for studies to be done appropriately and not just on small budgets or by the system developers. Training in research skills as part of informatics training may also enhance the evidence on the effecti veness of MMIT. We noted problems in study methods and often found studies that lacked sufficient numbers for valid statistical analyses and assessment of implications. Despite the challenges in the evidentiary base for MMIT, it is a vital, vibrant, and a proven component of health and health informatics\u2014at least for improving the processes of care that include patient safety. Qualitative studies have provided data on expectations, hopes, changes in how care is delivered, and the need for deep understanding of the effects of MMIT applications in planning for and implementing them. We are much wiser for bringing this literature together into one resource. Moving forward and with the advent of new systems, greater emphasis on eHealth to improve health care an d health care delivery, and the move to more patient- centered care, it is an exciting time for development and integration of MMIT applications .

ES-18 Introduction Scope and Purpose of the Systematic Review The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has considerable interest in health information technology (health IT). They have contracted several reports that are published or will soon be published. These evidence summaries on health information technology (IT) are related to costs and benefits;2 barriers and drivers of health IT for the elderly, chronically ill and underserved;3 the impact of consumer informatics applications;4 and telemedicine.5 Currently AHRQ has also contracted for the use of health IT in decisionmaking,6 in patient centered care7 and decision support for health care decisionmaking.8 These latter reports will be available early 2011. AHRQ asked the McMaster University Evidence- based Practice Center to generate an evidence report outlining the impact of health IT on the medication management process. Medication m anagement is a major component of the health care system. Currently, approximately 10 percent of the health care budget in the United States is spent on prescription medications. 22 To structure this evidence report we use the framework of medication management as presented by Bell and colleagues.1 They model the medication management continuum into the five phases of this evidence report; Figure 1 is a pictorial representation of the medication management phases. 1 The first phase of the continuum is presc ribing medications by clinicians who have assessed the patients ' conditions and needs. The second phase is to transmit the prescription to the pharmacists who work with the prescriber to clarify and verify the order (referred to as 'order communication ' in this report to capture the complexity of the communication that occurs between prescriber and pharmacy). The next step is dispensing the medication in its required form and dose, followed by administering the medications to the patient. Monitoring is the final phase where ongoing oversight occurs to address the changing medication needs and situation of the individual. Reconciliation of the medications taken by individuals and postprofessional education or training related to medication management IT (MMIT ) are additional aspects (as opposed to phases) of the medication management cycle covered by this report. Reconciliation is a process whereby a patient has their medication lists verified for completeness and accuracy when the patient moves from hospital to home or to a nursing home, or is involved with multiple care providers. Reconciliation can improve care by using health IT to ensure accuracy of medication lists, identification of gaps and conflicts in prescription, and provide timely and efficient tra nsfer of patients and their medication data. Education is also important in MMIT systems for both improving knowledge and skills of patients and care providers and to enable timely implementation and optimal use of MMIT systems. Therefore, AHRQ requested inclusion of both reconciliation and education in this report in addition to the five medication management phases. This report includes clinicians, patients, informal caregivers, and administrators. All care settings are also covered: home, community, prim ary care and specialty clinics, all levels of hospitals, long-term care facilities, and pharmacies of all types. This report does not focus on the health insurance or pharmacy industries. 1 Figure 1. A functional model of the medication management continuum created by Bell et al.1 Includes the major activities involved in medication management and forming the basis of our medication management phases. We refer to the transmission of the order/prescription and the bi -directional communication between prescri ber and pharmacy staff as \" order communication.\" Used with permission BMJ Publishing Group. Health IT holds great potential to improve the quality of health care and reduce potential and real errors while at the same time providing cost effective care. The coverage of this report is broad, reflecting the scope and breadth of health IT and the processes of medication management. This report centers on health IT applications that focus on medication management such as e-Prescribing applications, computerized provider order entry (CPOE), bar-coded medication administration (BCMA), pharmacy -based health IT, electronic medication administration record systems (eMAR), and other MMIT tools. Smaller health IT applications such as hand- held devices that provide calcu lations for dosing, as well as MMIT applications integrated with other health IT systems, such as electronic health or medical records systems (EHRs and EMRs), health information systems, hospital information systems, and personal health records (PHRs), an d others as identified, are included. For inclusion, the MMIT had to be integrated into the health care system electronically and process patient -specific information that then provided direction for that patient' s care. This integration requirement meant that stand \u00ad alone devices such as smart infusion pumps and glucose monitors were not included unless they were integrated with other health IT. This requirement allowed the report to concentrate on MMIT systems and separate out these medical devices with so me computing capabilities. Because health IT is a new discipline that crosses many domains, definitions are not always standard. Therefore we have defined terms related to health IT and other issues in this report in a glossary, labeled as Appendix F. Key Questions (KQs) KQ1. Effectiveness . Within and across the phases of the medication management continuum (prescribing, order communication, dispensing, administering, and monitoring, plus reconciliation and education aspects) what evidence exists that heal th IT applications are effective in improving: a. Health care process changes (e.g., adherence to guidelines, changes in prescribing behavior, changes in patient monitoring activities, errors, efficiency), b. Other intermediate outcomes (e.g., use, measures corr elated with use, satisfaction with system, usability, knowledge, skills, and attitudes), c. Costs and economic outcomes, 2 d. Clinical outcomes for patients (e.g., physiological measures, adverse drug events, length of stay, mortality, quality of life, other patie nt events), e. Population level outcomes, and f. Composite outcomes. g. To what extent does the impact of health IT on improvement of the health care process, other outcomes, costs and economics, and clinical outcomes vary depending on the type of medication (e.g., controlled or noncontrolled substance) or the form of the medication (e.g., oral, injection, intravenous)? KQ2. Gaps in Knowledge or Evidence . What knowledge or evidence deficits exist regarding needed information to support estimates of cost, benefit, impact, and net value with regard to enabling health IT applications in terms of prescribing, order transmission, dispensing, administering and monitoring, and adherence? Discuss gaps in research, including specific areas that should be addressed, and suggest possible public and private organizational types to perform the research, analysis , or both. KQ3. Value Proposition . What critical information regarding the impact of health IT applications implemented to support the phases of medication management is needed to give clinicians (e.g., physicians, nurses, psychologists, dentists, and pharmacists), health care facilit y administrators, patients, and their families a clear understanding of the value proposition particular to them? KQ4. System Characteristics . What evidence supports or refutes the impact of any of: open source, home grown, proprietary, local configuration ability, system configuration ability, conformity with U.S. Federal or other interoperability standards, conformity with other standards from other jurisdictions, being Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT) certified, system architecture, or feature set on the decision to purchase, implement, or use health IT in medication management systems? KQ5. Sustainability . What factors influence sustainability (use and periodic updates) of health IT applications that support a phase of medication management continuum: prescribing, order communication, dispensing, administering and monitoring, plus reconciliation and education? a. To what extent does the evidence demonstrate that health care settings (e.g., inpatient, ambulatory, long- term care) influence implementation, use , and effectiveness of such health IT applications? b. What is the impact (e.g., challenges, merits, c osts, and benefits) of having electronic access to patients ' computerized medication records (current and past), EHRs and PHRs, formulary information (inpatient and outpatient issues), billing information, laboratory records, and other electronic patient d ata in the quality and safety of care provided by health IT applications that support at least one phase of the continuum of medication management ( i.e., prescribing and ordering, transmission and verification, dispensing, administering and monitoring and adherence)? KQ6. Two -way EDI for Order Communication . It has been recognized that implementation and use of a complete, two- way electronic data interchange (EDI) (e-prescribing with e- transmission) between the prescribers ' electronic medical records (EMRs ), including CPOE and 3 other health IT within EMR, and other similar systems or stand -alone e -prescribing systems, retail, and mail-order pharmacy prescribing systems have been limited. In many instances, health IT systems that facilitate prescribing are us ed at the point-of-care and are combined with nonelectronic modalities for transmission of prescriptions, such as paper, facsimile, voice, and telephone. On the pharmacy side, prescriptions being received may not automatically populate the pharmacy prescri bing system, instead appearing in the fax printer or in a different computer program than the one the pharmacist regularly uses to fill prescriptions, requiring the pharmacist to manually retype the prescription information into the pharmacy' s electronic s ystem. This e - Prescribing with e -transmission also includes order clarification with electronic communication between the prescribers and pharmacists. a. What evidences exists demonstrating the barriers and drivers of implementation of complete EDI that can support the prescription, transmittal, receipt, and order clarification process of e-Prescriptions? b. How do barriers, facilitators, and economic incentives vary across pharmacists, physicians , and other relevant stakeholders with respect to adoption and us e of complete EDI (e -Prescribing/ordering with e -Transmission)? KQ7. RCTS of CDSS . What evidence exists regarding the extent of integration of electronic clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in a health IT system for the prescribing, dispensing, and administering of medications? To what extent does the use of the CDSS for prescribing/ordering, order communication, and dispensing of medications impact the various outcomes of interest, including health care process, intermediate, costs and economics, an d clinical endpoints ? CDSSs are broadly defined to include medical and pharmacy systems, reminders, and monitoring. Background Medication management is a complex and expensive process with high potential for both benefit and harm. Ninety percent of American seniors and 58 percent of nonelderly adults rely on medications daily. The average cost of prescription drugs per clinic visit in the United States in 1996 was $79. By 2006, this had doubled to $161. Nationally, all prescription drugs costs are projected to be $246.3 billion for 2010. Substantial increases in medication costs are expected until at least 2019 based on the aging population 23 and increased demand for medications (72 percent increase from 1997-2007).24 The introduction of newer, high cost, nongeneric, and specialty drugs also adds to the projected increases. The amount of new more complex medications also places a substantial cognitive burden on health professionals who prescribe and oversee these medications. Genomics research and its role i n medication choices for individualized health care are also going to become more important in the next decades. Health IT can play a strong information support role to help deal with this increased cognitive load and provide efficiencies for provision of prescription medications, control, and recording of use. In addition to increasing costs, medications can cause substantial health problems. Incorrect choice of medications and over or under use leads to less than optimal care. The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) 25 report on medication errors estimates that errors occur in all levels and locations of care. Estimates for hospitalized patients show 1.5 to 10 errors per 100 opportunities for errors for prescribing and 2.4 to 11 errors per 100 opportunities per dose for dispensing. This translates to approximately one error per patient per hospital day. Error rates in long- term care 4 prescribing are calculated to be from 6 to 20 errors per 100 opportunities per dose. Ambulatory care studies show that up to 21 percent of prescriptions have errors. Pediatric patients present special challenges in that doses must often be adjusted for body weight and age. As an example, one study showed that errors in acetaminophen use in the emergency department for children were 22 per 100 doses ordered. 26 Elderly patients also have special prescribing and drug monitoring needs based on issues related to aging, multiple conditions, the need for several medications, and often, decreased kidney function. Pharmacist errors in order communication and dispensing also occur. Cheung and colleagues 27 reviewed the literature of dispensing errors and found that overall errors occurred in the range of 0.2 to 0.8 percent, although the number varied depending on how the errors were detected and reported. The task of medication administering by nurses, other health care providers, as well as patients and families, have also been shown to have associated errors. Many of the errors in medication management described above are preventable. The IOM report shows that preventable errors often constitute 20 to 50 percent of all errors. In addition to mortality, errors and inappropriate use are costly, often cause a huge drain on health care resources, and contribute to substantial morbidity and challen ges to well-being. Historically, the first MMIT application was published in 1979 as a decision support system to help in prescribing appropriate antibiotics. 28 The first RCT was done 5 years later.29 Health IT has tremendous potential to improve care ass ociated with medication management. For example, the Center for Information Technology Leadership (CITL), in their Value of Computerized Provider Order Entry in Ambulatory Care 30 report that potential savings from implementation of CPOE in ambulatory care prescribing and its ability to detect errors would provide savings in the U.S. of $28 billion annually. Other MMIT applications are projected to have similar cost savings and improved care. However, the promises of health IT have not always been obtained a fter installation. For example, Mollen and colleagues 31 reviewed CDSSs for prescribing and found 37 reports that successfully showed changed health care provider behavior. Only five of these studies noted improvements in patient outcomes. Similarly, Eslami and colleagues 32 reviewed studies of CPOE applications in outpatient medication ordering. Of 67 studies, only 21 dealt with safety. Most of the evidence they identified used observational study methods. They showed that although CPOE and other information systems are often costly, some evidence supports medication safety benefits. However, they also note that some studies have data that support increased error rates and adverse drug events (ADEs) with CPOE implementation. Kaushal and colleagues 33 show that e-Prescribing with CDSS reduced errors from 52.5 to 6.6 per 100 prescriptions in ambulatory care. Paoletti and colleagues34 reduced errors from 2.9 percent to 1.6 percent in a U.S. general hospital with the implementation of BCMA and eMAR. Many groups have studied various components of the medication management process and the effects of multiple health IT systems and programs across settings and populations. However, the body of evidence that evaluates the actual, and not projected, effect of a broad range of MMIT applications and the medication management process is not available in one document or Web site. This evidence report is designed to be that summary. 5 Methods The objective of this report is to review and synthesize the available evidence regardi ng the effectiveness and effects of health IT on all phases of medication management , as well as reconciliation and education. The report considers a broad range of health ITs and medication management processes and concentrates on those people involved in direct clinical care: physicians, pharmacists, dentists, nurses, and other health professionals; patients and their informal caregivers; and health care administrators across all health care settings and levels of care. Recruitment of Technical Experts and Peer Reviewers The Medication Management through Health Information Technology (MMIT) team was made up of experts from McMaster University, the University of Pittsburgh, and McGill University. Expertise of the group included medical informatics, primary care, geriatrics, internal medicine, pharmacy, conduct of clinical trials , and systematic literature reviews. Our Technical Expert Panel (TEP) was comprised of 12 external experts from diverse professional backgrounds including medication safety, health information technology in medication management, consumer informatics, and pharmacy. Their clinical expertise included specialization in pharmacy, geriatrics, reproductive health, pediatrics, and primary care. The TEP was involved in the development of the project by helping to refine the questions, focus the scope, solidify and streamline definitions, and approve modified plans and project direction. The members of the TEP and the external reviewers are listed in Appendix E. We also sought advice from other AHRQ Evidence Based Practice Centers who had completed health IT evidence summaries. Key Questions The core team worked with the external advisors, the TEP , and representatives of the AHRQ to refine the key questions (KQ) presented in the \"Scope and Purpose of the Systematic Review \" section of Chapter 1. Before searching for the relevant literature, the content of the questions was clarified, the concepts were defined , and the types of evidence that would be included in the review were ascertained. KQ1. Effectiveness addresses the evidence that health IT applications improve a broad range of outcomes when health IT is applied to medication management (five phases plus the impact of postprofessional and patient education and reconciliation among those phases). Studies that reported changes in process, cost and economics, intermediate, qualitative, and clinical patient outcomes are included. Much literature addresses the use of health IT in medication management. To address the MMIT question using the best available research findings, two limitations were placed on the included articles. First, only hypothesis- driven articles were included. For quantitative articles this meant that those with comparison groups and appropriate statistical analysis were analyze d in this report. Qualitative studies were included if they reported use of recognized qualitative methods. Many other articles met our inclusion criteria for content and measured an outcome of interest but they were not hypothesis- driven; the report lists these citations in the KQ1: Effectiveness section of Chapter 3: Results . 6 KQ2. Gaps in Knowledge or Evidence addresses knowledge and evidence deficits regarding needed information to support estimation of costs, benefits, impact, and net value regarding MMIT applications. KQ3. Value Proposition requires the identification of information about the MMIT applications needed for each stakeholder to have a clear understanding of the value proposition particular to them. It was determined that the answers to KQ2: Gaps and KQ3: Value Proposition would become evident from the review of the evidence in KQ1: Effectiveness, although studies addressing values propositions by stakeholders are also included. KQ4. System Characteristics addresses the impact of MMIT application features on the likelihood that the systems will be purchased, implemented, and used. This evidence comes from studies measuring implementation, use, and purchasing decisions. Studies of all designs are included. KQ5. Sustainability addresses the factors influencing the sustainability of MMIT applications, specifically: (a) the impact of the type of setting, and (b) the impact of access to other electronic data on health care quality and safety. Sustainability is not well-defined. The definition of sustainability provided by Humphreys et al., 9 \"the ability of a health service to provide ongoing access to appropriate quality care in a cost effective and health- effective manner \" was incorporated. This definition restricted the number of articles that were included in this review. The topic of sustainability is one that needs further research in defining and further analyses of existing systems. KQ6. Two -way EDI relates to the barriers and facilitators to complete two -way electronic data interchange (EDI) between prescribers and pharmacists and how these factors vary across stakeholder groups. Through discussions with experts and the MMIT writing group we determined that the evidence would be sparse in this category. Any article studying EDI communication (one- and two -way) that includes original data (qualitative or quantitative) is included in the report. KQ7. RCTs of CDSS addresses the extent to which clinical decision support is integrated into health IT systems for medication management and the impact of CDSS on process and health outcomes. Because of the size of the literature and the improved level of evaluation rigor and generalizability or applicability of RCTs, only RCTs are included. This question included changes in process as well as the b road range of outcomes included in KQ 1: Effectiveness (clinical outcomes, behavior change, and costs and economics) across the phases of medication management as well as reconciliation and education. Analytic Framework To provide a focus and structure for this review, an analytical model that incorporated the key component for seven key questions was developed. This provided direction for the literature search and guidance for the data abstraction and reporting (Figure 2). 7 Figure 2. Conceptual model addres sing the seven key questions: enabling m edication management through health IT CDSS = computer decision support system, EMR = electronic medical records system , e-RX = e-prescribing , BCMA = bar code medication administration , CPOE = computer provider order entry , PIS = pharmacy information system , PDAs = personal digital assistant devices , eMAR = electronic medication administration records Literature Search Methods In the course of searching the literature, reference sources were identified; a search str ategy for each source was formulated, executed, and documented (see Appendix A, Exact Search Strings). For the searching of electronic databases, database -appropriate subject headings and text-words were used. Given the broad range of questions and outcomes that the report addresses, searches were performed by first using text -words relating to the various types of health IT applied to medication management. These searches were combined with both medication management terms and computer and technology terms. No limits based on methodological terms were used as all study designs were considered. A number of grey literature resources and AHRQ resources were also searched (see Appendix A, Exact Search Strings). The search strategies were peer reviewed by a librarian following the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) checklist process for systematic review searches. 35 The TEP and internal team provided references from their personal files. The reference lists of review articles were screened for el igibility. 8 Sources The ,\u00ae Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts ,\u00a9 Compendex,\u00a9 INSPEC\u00a9 (which includes IEEE\u00ae), Library and Information Science ,\u00ae E-Prints in Library and Information Science,\u00ae PsycINFO ,\u00ae Sociological Abstracts ,\u00a9 and Business Source\u00ae Complete. The search terms used are presented in Appendix A. Supplemental searches targeting grey literature sources were conducted and included New York Academy of Medicine, SIGLE, U.S. HHS Health Information Technology, Health Technology Assessment reports from the U.K. Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, ProQuest Dissertations, National Libra ry for Health United Kingdom (includes Bandolier), ProceedingsFirst, PapersFirst, National Technical Information Service , and Google. As part of the grey literature search, AHRQ made all references in their e- Prescribing, bar coding , and CPOE knowledge libraries available. Search Terms and Strategies Terms related to specific MMIT applications and in combination with both medication management terms and more general computer and technology terms, were prepared. The MEDLINE\u00ae search formed the basis for all other databases, but searches were edited as needed depending on the features of the database being used. When possible, letters, editorials or commentaries, and animal studies were excluded electronically. No limits were placed on language or time to captu re the global literature and early studies. Organization and Tracking of the Literature Search Searching was done in the fall of 2009 and updated in early summer 2010. The results of the searches were downloaded into Reference Manager\u00ae version 10 (ISI ResearchSoft) and uploaded into our customized systematic review management system (Health Information Research Unit, McMaster University). The system is Web -based. It allows management of the systematic review process with improved auditing and control capa bilities including automatic production of tables and tabulations. The system stores the full text of articles in portable document format (PDF) and tracks duplicates, results of title and abstract review, which articles were included or excluded with reas ons, and data abstraction levels. Title and Abstract Review The study team reviewed titles and abstracts of all articles retrieved using prepared data abstraction forms (Appendix B, Sample Screening and Data Abstraction Forms). Two blinded, independent reviewers from a team of reviewers conducted title and abstract reviews in parallel. Both reviewers had to indicate that the article was to be excluded for it to be removed. Both reviewers also had to agree on inclusion for the article to be promoted to the next level. In the case of disagreements, a third reviewer determined if the article was to be promoted to the next level of screening. This first review level was designed to detect all articles that reported on medication management with health IT assisting in the medication management process. Reviewers were instructed to consider applications as health IT if they were integrated with other information systems (rather than stand -alone applications or devices), with the systems being more than 9 passive vehi cles for data transfer. We defined health IT as electronic systems that collect, process, or exchange health information about patients and formal caregivers. We included articles only if the MMIT was integrated with at least one health IT system, such as EHR or EMR systems, and that it processed patient -specific information and provided advice or suggestions to either the health care provider or the patients and their families on issues related to health or wellness care. We excluded stand -alone devices (n o integration) with the exception of personal digital assistants (PDAs) or handheld devices into which clinicians or patients entered patient -specific information to assist in medication management. PDAs are an important focus for AHRQ. All articles about transmission or order communication between pharmacist and clinical prescriber were also included and tagged as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). Review articles were passed through to the second level of screening. Once identified, the bibliographies of the reviews were screened for articles with potential for inclusion and their citations were put through the screening process starting at the title and abstract level if they had not already been captured by the original search. The systematic reviews wer e also included in the answers to the seven key questions where appropriate. Defining Medication Management Health IT To be clear on what kinds of applications were included in MMIT, the following outline for MMIT applications was devised and used by scre eners. MMIT systems or programs were included if: The computer or technology processed patient- specific information, The information provided by the system was relevant to one of the five phases of medication management or two ancillary aspects (educatio n and reconciliation): Prescribing or ordering medications, Order communication (transmission, clarification, verification), Dispensing, Administering (by health care provider, patient, or caregiver), Monitoring (signs, symptoms, or laboratory data to ascertain patient adherence, adverse events, or the need for medication adjustment), Education (of patients or care providers, but not preprofessional education), Reconciliation of medication lists, Someone (e.g., patient, caregiver, family, health care professional) received information in return that was, or could be, linked to patient-specific information used in decisionmaking, The technology was part of, or linked to, another electronic information system, The article contained outcome data related to one of the areas of interest set out in the key questions. Articles were to be excluded if they were health IT systems or programs and: The IT component was only Web or local browsing of general health information databases or information resources (e.g., online textbooks), The system acted as a conduit of information only (except order communication of prescriptions between health care providers and pharmacists), Systems where no feedback was provided for patient care (e.g., surveys), 10 The system did not help with medication management decisionmaking or provide information about any of the medication management phases (prescribing, order communication, dispensing, administering, and monitoring), or education and reconciliation, Systems that made measurements but did not process the information, Stand -alone devices that do not integrate with information systems (except PDAs using patient specificinformation), The health IT application was used only to extract data (e.g., pill bottles that track opening and closing, smart infusion pumps not tied to other systems, studies using EMRs for data collection if the data were for quality improvement or other related tasks but not direct patient care). Data Abstraction Given the range of questions addressed, data abstraction was performed by a core group of staff for KQ1 and KQ7 . Abstraction was done by one reviewer, and the accuracy was checked by a second reviewer. The authors of the report performed a final check on the abstracted data. The reviews were not blinded in terms of the article authors, institutions, or journal. For all articles, reviewers abstracted information on general study characteristics: study design, the intervention, study population, setting, disease, drugs of interest, and description of the MMIT application (see Appendix B). Outcomes data were abstracted from the articles that were applicable to KQ1: Effectiveness and KQ7: RCTs of CDSS regarding the MMI T application impact on a health, health care process, or other intermediate outcomes. We abstr acted only the main endpoints (major endpoints) that authors indicated as such. If no main endpoint measures were indicated, we abstracted data on outcomes related to medication management and clinical outcomes and relied on the order that those outcomes were presented in the results section, methods description, or abstract. We saw great variation in the way outcomes and statistical methods were reported by article authors, even when using similar systems. As a result, for this report it was recorded whet her the main endpoint was positively changed by the intervention (noted as + in Appendix C, Evidence Tables). The main endpoint could also be unchanged (noted as = in Appendix C, Evidence Tables). Some studies reported a negative effect where the predefined outcome was found to be in the opposite direction sought (noted as - in Appendix C, Evidence Tables). For example, measuring an increased time to prescribe when the MMIT system was developed to reduce prescriber time. In addition, those studies that iden tified unintended consequences (adverse effects) of the MMIT systems are summarized in their own section. If more than one main endpoint was reported, the positive and negative referred to the direction of the majority of outcomes. Articles addressing KQ4: System Characteristics, KQ5: Sustainability and KQ6: two -way prescription EDI were abstracted separately to capture relevant outcome data. Assessment of Study Quality The included studies were assessed on the basis of the quality of their reporting of re levant data. Quantitative studies were assessed using the same criteria employed by Jimison et al.,3 in a 11 previous AHRQ report. RCT scoring was based on Delphi consensus work by Verhagan and colleagues,10 and is referred to in this report as the ' Verhagen/AHRQ RCT quality scale. ' Quality assessments of applicable articles were performed by more experienced reviewers to maintain consistency and accuracy. Studies with before- after, time series, surveys , and qualitative methods were not assessed for quality be cause few well -validated instruments exist and the study design itself is considered lower on the hierarchy of evidence. Method assessments used for articles of the relevant design: Verhagen/AHRQ RCT quality scale (scored out of nine) 1. Was the assignment to the treatment groups really random? 2. Was the treatment allocation concealed? 3. Were the groups similar at baseline in terms of prognostic factors? 4. Were the eligibility criteria specified? 5. Were outcome assessors blinded to the treatment allocation? 6. Was the care provider blinded? 7. Was the patient blinded? 8. Were the point estimates and measure of variability presented for the main endpoint measure? 9. Did the analyses include an intention to treat analysis Cohort studies (scored out of ten) 1. Was there sufficient description of the groups and the distribution of prognostic factors? 2. Are the groups assembled at a similar point in their disease progression? 3. Is the intervention/treatment reliably ascertained? 4. Were the groups comparable on all important confounding factor s? 5. Was there adequate adjustment for the effects of these confounding variables? 6. Was a dose response relationship between intervention and outcome demonstrated? 7. Was outcome assessment blind to exposure status? 8. Was followup long enough for the outcomes to occur? 9. What proportion of the cohort was followed-up? 10. Were drop out rates and reasons for drop out similar across intervention and unexposed groups? Case -control studies (scored out of nine) 1. Is the case definition explicit? 2. Has the disease state of the cases been reliably assessed and validated? 3. Were the controls randomly selected from the source of population of the cases? 4. How comparable are the cases and controls with respect to potential confounding factors? 5. Were interventions and other exposures assessed in the same way for cases and controls? 6. How was the response rate defined? 7. Were the nonresponse rates and reasons for nonresponse the same in both groups? 8. Is it possible that over- matching has occurred in that cases and controls were matched on factors related to exposure? 9. Was an appropriate statistical analysis used (matched or unmatched)? 12 Case series (scored out of six) 1. Is the study based on a representative sample selected from a relevant population? 2. Are the criteria for inclusion explicit? 3. Did all individuals enter the survey at a similar point in their disease progression? 4. Was followup long enough for important events to occur? 5. Were outcomes assessed using objective criteria or was blinding used? 6. If comparisons of subseries are being made, was there sufficient description of the series and the distribution of prognostic factors? Data Synthesis Evidence tables with article details were created and ordered by key question, subquestion, and medication management phase as applicable (Appendix C). This offered another opportunity to check abstracted elements with the original articles; any errors were brought to the attention of the abstractors of the specific section for correction. Meta- analyses were not performed on any data because of the heterogeneity of the studies, as well as the nature of the observational studies in most sections. Data Entry and Quality Control General study data for each article was abstracted by one staff member and entered into the online data abstraction forms (Appendix B). Se cond reviewers were generally more experienced members of the research team, and one of their main priorities was to check the quality and consistency of the first reviewers' answers and to perform the quality assessment where required. Grading the Evidence Because so much of the material was derived from observational studies, we did not provide grades for the evidence beyond quality scoring of the RCTs, cohort, case-control, and case series studies. Peer Review Throughout the project, the core team sought feedback from internal advisors and technical experts. These technical experts were members of the TEP and other content and methodology experts as needed. The report was reviewed in several stages, comments considered and incorporated into this final report. Members of the TEP and the peer reviewers are listed in Appendix E. Many of the TEP members also reviewed the initial version of the document. Both the members of the TEP and the review panel provided valuable comments and have made the final document stronger. 13 Results Results of the Literature Search The literature search retrieved 40,582 articles for screening for inclusion; this includes 93 from hand searches and 408 from the grey literature (Figure 3). We excluded 7,797 duplicates and screened 32,785 titles and abstracts. A total of 4,578 articles were screened at full- text. Reasons for exclusion at this stage included inaccessible copies of full- text, articles in foreign languages that were not translated, unretrievable theses, studies not using integrated technologies or technologies that did not impact on medication management ( \"not MMIT\" ), studies that were not a primary study with first hand observations (often review articles), or studies not measuring an outcome of interest to our key questi ons. We found 361 articles which met our content criteria for Key Question (KQ) 1: Effectiveness but did not use formal qualitative methods or have comparison groups with hypothesis testing or appropriate statistical analyses (quantitative studies). These articles are not included in the synthesis but they are integrated into the report bibliography with the other articles that were synthesized. This left 428 articles that are synthesized in the evidence report. A total of 377 articles are quantitatively s ynthesized in KQ1: Effectiveness. One article was included as evidence for KQ3: Value Proposition although 30 articles were cited directly and many more were used in some of the summaries described in this section; 21 articles were synthesized for KQ 4: System Characteristics, 24 for KQ5: Sustainability, 33 for KQ6: Two-way Prescription EDI and 77 for KQ7: RCTs of CDSS. A number of articles were included in more than one key question response as they addressed more than one aspect of medication management. 14 Included Eligibility IdentificationElectronic Sociological Abstracts 742 LISTA 276 93 From Reviews 408 Articles from Grey Literature 40,582 articles 32,785 articles screened at title and abstract 28,207 records excluded 7,797 Duplicates removed Screening 4,578 full-text articles assessed for eligibility 789 of studies included in narrative synthesis 3,789 full -text articles excluded Unable to Retrieve and/or Foreign Language 150 Theses 1,332 Not MMIT 1,1856 Not a Primary Study 2,181 No Outcomes of Interest 260 428 studies included in synthesis Key Questions 1- 7 361 Key Question 1 \u00ad Bibliography only Figure 3. Literature f low of medication m anagement studies To address the various outcomes measures or interest in the seven k ey questions, 428 articles were synthesized. An additional 361 articles met content criteria for integrated technology enabling medication management, but these did not meet methodological criteria of either formal qualitative methods or those with comparison groups and appropriate statistical analysis; these studies are included in the bibliography. 15 KQ1. Within and across the phases of medication management continuum, what evidence exists that health IT applications are effective? Effectiveness Studies Overall KQ1: Effectiveness includes the largest number of articles for any of the seven key questio ns. Our searching for KQ1 concentrated on content with no limits on methods. The articles were divided into two groups: (1) all qualitative studies were included in the analysis that forms the basis of this report; and (2) all quantitative studies were inc luded in the analysis section if they included a comparison group and data on each group and if they contained statistical methods defined by statistical testing, a statement of hypotheses -based research defined a priori, or both. Articles that met these criteria for qualitative or quantitative studies were analyzed in this report (n = 377). An additional 51 studies that did not meet the above methods criteria were included in KQs 3 to 6; the literature on these topics was sparse. Articles that met content criteria but that did not meet these methodological criteria are included in our bibliography (n = 361) but not in any of the tables nor a re they analyzed in the report . 36-396 The final analysis for addressing KQ1 included 379 articles. Substantial variati on exists in the concentration of evidence and content across issues related to MMIT. Table 1 shows the numbers of studies within each of the five phases plus reconciliation and education by study design. By far, more studies are done in the prescribing phase (n = 263) with a substantial number done in monitoring (n = 77). Dispensing is the phase that is least studied and little evidence exists on education and reconciliation. Figure 4 depicts the trends in publication frequency of articles included for ana lysis in the report. We saw a dramatic increase in publication of MMIT studies after 2000, most notably in studies dealing with prescribing. Table 1.

A substantial numbers of RCTs and qualitative studies were included. The large number of observational studies is reflective of the nature of the domain in that many of the articles retrieved were more often directed at the observational description or evaluation of existing systems rather than based on classical research methods of hypothesis-driven projects. Settings . Settings where studies were performed also show variation. Table 2 includes the settings for studies across the medication management phases plus education and reconciliation. Studies often reported multiple settings. Most studies were set in hospitals and ambulatory care. Few studies were done in the community (n = 1), home (n = 5), or long- term care (n = 8). The lack of comparative, hypothesis-driven studies set in pharmacies is offset by a larger group of pharmacy studies that were descriptive in nature. Despite the lack of studies set in pharmacies, many studies relied on pharmacies and pharmacists. 17 Table 2.

See Appendix C, Evidence Table 17 for references to the included articles in each cell. Column Headings: P = Prescribing , OC = Order Communication, D = Dispensing, A = Administering, M = Monitoring, E = Education, R = Reconciliation Clinicians . Physicians were the most represented clinicians studied (Table 3). Many of the health professionals functioned in primary care and other ambulatory settings. Often studies did not differentiate among specialties or included many specialties in a single study. Nurses were most often studied in the administering phase and pharmacists were involved in order communication. We did not identify any studies that evaluated dentists and found few studies of mental health professionals or midlevel practitioners (e.g., nurse practitioners, midwives, and physician assistants).

Patients studied represented those who were most likely to need medication: adults, middle aged people, and those over the age of 65 years. Infants, children, and 18 adolescents were also studied but to a lesser exten t (Table 4). Monitoring and reconciliation concentrated on older persons. Table 4.

Tables 5 and 6 list the MMIT applications studied. Table 5 includes those MMIT applications that were the main focus of the study while Table 6 includes the MMIT that were integrated with the MMIT studied. The CDSS and reminder systems were most common in prescribing and monitoring. CPOE and e-Prescribing were also commonly used. Systems associated with pharmacy use were less commonly studied. Considering integration, the health IT in medication management is well- integrated with comprehensive systems su ch as EMRs and hospital information systems as well as other components of the broader health IT domain, remembering that integration with a health IT system was a requirement for inclusion in our review. Although prescribing again is the major phase studi ed, the other phases are represented. 19 Table 5.

In summary, prescribing is the major medication mana gement phase studied. Studies were often evaluative rather than research centered in nature, as reflected in the number of 20 observational studies. Substantial numbers of RCTs and qualitative studies exist. Most often studies were set in hospitals and in ambulatory care facilities. Few studies were set in pharmacies, although most of the articles showed interactions with pharmacists and pharmacies. Long -term care, community settings , and homes were not often studied. CDSS systems were the most common MMIT application studied. CPOEs were also studied substantially. The MMIT applications studied were very often embedded within a larger EMR, hospital, or pharmacy information system and integrated with other health IT applications. Many different MMIT systems were studied although again few were done outside the prescribing and monitoring phases and variation existed in the number of studies of each kind of health IT. Physicians were the health professionals most often studied. Few patients were evaluated. Process Changes\u2014Prescribing Summary of the Findings for Process Changes Of the 378 articles that have outcomes associated with MMIT, 174 (46 percent) are reports of the evaluation of processes in the prescribing phase of medication management (Appendix C, Evidence Table 1). Because prescribing and ordering are substantially different in the hospitals and ambulatory settings, the remainder of this section will provide analyses with the articles divided into hospital-based studies (n = 107) and ambulatory care- based studies (n = 67). The community- and home-based studies are included with ambulatory care. Only one study in this section was done in a long- term care facility. 397 General Study Characteristics Strengths and Limitation of the Evidence . The studies of proc ess changes in MMIT based in hospital settings have a lower proportion of RCTs than ambulatory care studies. The 107 hospital-based studies are comprised of 19 RCTs (18 percent of hospital studies), 398-416 84 observational studies,18,417- 499 3 cohort studi es,500-502 and 1 mixed methods study.503 The 67 articles set in primary care, communities, and home (ambulatory care) were studied using 40 RCTs (61 percent of nonhospital studies ),504-543 2 cohort studies,544,545 1 case control study,546 1 mixed methods s tudy,547 and 22 observational studies.431,548 -568 The long- term care study was an RCT.397 Table 7.

Not all studies included descriptive data on patients. Of those that did, the patient populations reflected the pattern of medication use with more studies including 21 participants who were, on average, over the age of 44 years. All age groups were studied in both hospital and ambulatory settings. Thirty -seven studies set in hospitals provided descriptive data on participants. Four studies included infants (birth to 2 years),418,463,467,491 five studies included children (2 to 11 years),411,418,437,467,569 six studies included adolescents (12 to 18 years),411,418,437,446,467,490 eight studies eval uated adults (19 to 44 years),408,411,418,437,446,467,490,492 22 studies included middle age participants (45 to 64 years),399,401 -403,406,414,425,428,430,431,433,445,448,449,454,467,475,481,485,489,490,493 and 27 studies included geriatric participants (6 5 years and up).399,401 \u00ad 403,406,407,413,414,416,425,428,430,431,433,440,445,448,449,453,467,481,483,485,486,489,490,493 Thirty -six of the 67 studies done in ambulatory settings included descriptive data on the patient population studied. Many studies included participants in a wide range of ages. Of the 36 studies that included patient information, one studied infants (up to 2 years of age), 559 two evaluated medication management in children (2 to 11 years),539,559 three evaluated adolescents (12 to 18 year s),504,537,539 15 were of adult population (19 to 44 years),504,505,508,512,515,522,527,528,530,531,537,541,543,545 ,565 24 studied patients in the middle age range (45-64 years),504,505,508,510,513,515,518 -520,522,526 -528,530,531,537,538,541 -543,545,557,56 5,568 and (65 years and up).505,507,510,513,515,519,522,524,528,530,531,533,541 \u00ad 543,545,552,565,566,568 The single long- term care study did not describe its patients.397 Clinicians studied . Only 11 of the hospital studies included descriptive information on clinicians. Several of these included multiple groups of health professionals: hospitalists 398,405,407,452,454,486 other physicians,407,415,487,488,502 other health professionals,452 and nurses.439 Many of the other studies evaluated clinicians but did not provide sufficient demographic information for analysis or discussion. Few of the studies set in ambulatory care provided substantial information on clinicians. Those clinicians who were specifically described were primary care clinicians , 506,510,514,529,532,534,535,552,563,566 other physicians,514,525,535,544,547,553,554 nurses and midlevel practitioners (physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, advanced practice nurses, and midwives ), 535,561 and pharmacists.518 Technology. Technology associated with studies set in hospital settings often evaluated several integrated MMIT systems, although some studies included only one MMIT. Individual drug dispensing system,465 e-prescribing,434,436,439 medication safety reporting system,456 an internet electronic diary for patients ,408 and eMAR systems.439,456 Studies set in ambulatory care also studied a range of MMIT applications with the majority of the MMIT applications based on CDSS systems. system.507 These MMIT systems that were the focus of study were also integrated with a range of other MMIT applications, most of which were some form of EHR or EMR systems. The hospital- based studies included integration with bar-coding CDSS,417,429,432,442,448,461,462,479 s,400,403,406,412,414,415,424,425,428,438,442,443,450,451,453,456,461,465,467 -468,470,475,483 laboratory systems,18,401,405,407,409,415,418,420,437,442,444,446,452,453,456,461,466,470,473,475,477,483,4 ,406,442,443 and an integrated pharmacy system.401,404,415,417,420,434,436,439,441 \u00ad 443,463,473,477,479,485,493 ,502 Systems integrated within ambulatory studies were also mostly EMR and EHR systems .

Sixty -one studies evaluated changes in prescribing in hospital settings. Fifty -three (87 percent) showed statistica lly significant improvements in at least half of its main endpoints. Categorizing these 53 articles into groups based on study methods, 11 were RCTs,398,399,402 -405,408 -410,413,416 two were -460,462,464,466 -473,475,478,482,486,489,490,492,496 \u00ad 499,547,571 Eight (1 3 percent) of the 61 did not show statistically significant changes.

Twenty-three were RCTs.504,506 study.546 Seven were observational.549,553,554,562,565,566,568 Eleven studies set in ambulatory care settings sought to determine if prescribing was improved with the introduction of MMIT and they did not demonstrate differences. Of these, five were RCTs , 510,520,523,524,538 two were cohort studies,544,545 and four were observational.557,560,564,572 Errors. Twenty -two articles studied prescribing errors in hospital settings. Fifteen showed statistically significant improvement in at least half of the main endpoints. Two were RCTs400,405 and 13 were observational.421,434,438,439,450,453,454,457,465,474,479,491,493 Seven did not show statistically significant improvements: a mixed methods study503 and six observational reports.419,432,436,444 ,455,495 Two studies reported errors related to ambulatory care studies and both were positive, one using CPOE,558 and one using CDSS,559 both in observational studies. Time considerations. Seven studies evaluated time considerations in hospital settings. Two observational studies showed statistically significant improvements in considerations of time. 439,488 One study found a statistically significant increase in time to prescribe.487 One study evaluated mean time on antimicrobial management but did not do statistical testing.401 Three observational studies did not show any differences in time.419,441,481 Five studies assessed time savings in the ambulatory care settings. Four were positive: an RCT of CPOE and CDSS that reduced time to respond to alert situations, 527 a cohort study on time spent on asthma management,545 and two observational studies, one on e- Prescribing561 on time spent on 23 computer and paper tasks and one on time spent on ordering laboratory testing for monitoring.550 One RCT showed that time spent on patient care did not decrease with the introduction of a CPOE system.532 Adherence to guidelines, reminders, and r ecommended practice. Twenty -four studies measured improvements in compliance with guidelines, reminders, and recommended pract ices in hospital based studies. Nineteen identified statistically significant improvements in compliance: four RCTs, 407,412,521,573 one cohort study,500 and 14 observational studies.424,425,427,429,435,437,438,447,461,470,476,483,484,4 94 Four did not find any differences in compliance: one RCT415 and three observational studies.442,448,480 One observational study422 showed a decrease in adherence after the introduction of a CDSS system into a hospital EHR. Thirteen studies that took place in nonhospital settings (primary care, community, and homes) considered compliance with guidelines, reminders, or recommended practice. Seven were RCTS of which five showed positive results for at least half of the main endpoints. 505,509,534,542,543 Two RCTs518,519 did not identify a difference for measured compliance. One cohort study544 did not show a difference in compliance with the formulary using e- Prescribing and one mixed methods study547 reported no change in physician compliance with drug alert overrides. Four of four observational studies reported improvements in compliance with guidelines, reminders, or recommended practices. 548,556,563,566 Workflow. No studies set in hospitals studied workflow as one of their main endpoints that were changes in process. Two stu dies set in ambulatory care studied workflow. One study using CDSS reminders showed a significant reduction in missed followup appointments that had been scheduled by nurses. 555 An RCT of CDSS and e- Prescribing did not affect the rate of callbacks generated between physicians and pharmacists.540 Table 8.

The citations to the studies listed above are in the text preceding this table. Ambulatory studies included those that were done outside hospitals including homes and communities. Summary Much research has been done to evaluate changes in process related to prescribing in hospital settings and ambulatory care situations. The research is varied in methods although many RCTs exist. A higher proportion of RCTs are done in the ambulatory care studies than in hospitals. Clinicians are the most stud ied. Pharmacists are often included in studies but are less frequently the major thrust of analyses. Many MMIT applications are studied in the prescribing phase. These prescribing MMIT applications are also frequently supported or integrated with EMR, EHR and hospital information systems. CDSS systems are often studied and frequently integrated with CPOE or e -Prescribing systems. Pharmacy -based MMIT applications generally lack evidence. With respect to the process changes measured in the prescribing studies, changes in prescribing and compliance with reminders, guidelines, and standard practice are the most common outcomes for hospital- and ambulatory- based studies (Table 8). The RCTs were concentrated on evaluating changes in prescribing with some of them assessing compliance. The RCTs were positive 80 percent of the time while the observational studies were positive 77 percent of the time. Studies done in ambulatory care settings have not evaluated errors as outcome measures. Quantitative workflow studies a re generally absent across all settings. MMIT in prescribing is associated strongly with improvements in prescribing and also associated, but to a lesser extent, with reducing errors and improving compliance with guidelines, reminders, and recommended practice. Time reductions or changes are not as often improved and workflow improvement assessments are lacking evidence. Systems that provide information support, such as CDSS and CPOE systems, are combinations of technical capabilities and a knowledge base. The content of this knowledge base is probably more important than the technical aspects. Research findings and scientific evidence (i.e., evidence-based content) are difficult to compile and even more difficult to keep current. We did not find evaluations of the knowledge base of the systems or comments on updating, although some of the systems depended on clinical practice guidelines for their evidence base. Similarly, outcomes that were associated with correct knowledge such as adherence to best practice guidelines were also not often evaluated to show that they were accurate and current. Future research must address how this need for strong evidence to support the knowledge base of 25 CDSSs, provide evidence backing for order sets for CPOE systems, and clinical practice guidelines on which to base best practice can be best met. Order Communication Summary of the Findings for Process Changes Order communication is less well-studied than prescribing with only 16 studies: two RCTs,540,574 and 14 observational studies.438,552,567,575 -585 (Appendix C, Evidence Table 2) Order communication involves clinicians and pharmacists. The oldest study in this group was published in 1999,574 reflecting the recent advances in communication applications related to MMIT. Streng ths and Limitations of the Evidence The evidence in this section is predominantly observational with two RCTs. The studies were mainly based on large sample sizes, from 39 clinicians578 to almost one million prescriptions.577 The outcomes, most often measures of efficiency and changing work patterns, were usually reported as being positive. General Study Characteristics Participants. All studies included physicians, other prescribers, and pharmacists. The main unit of analysis in 12 of the 16 studies was prescriptions, orders, and medications. The main unit of analysis for the other four studies were patients, 552,578 pharmacists ,580 and clinicians.574 The patients were of geriatric age (65 years or greater) or adults (45 to 64 years),578 or geriatric alone.552 Except for these two articles, all others included undifferentiated patients. Location. All studies included a pharmacy. Most studies were hospital-based but one study was of three mail order pharmacies, 575 two were HMO pharmacies only,552,574 and thr ee were in community pharmacies.579,585,586 Nine studies were set in hospitals,438,574,576,578,580 -584 and four in primary care.540,577,585,587 Drugs and diseases. Thirteen studies did not concentrate on one disease or disorder. One study each evaluated v enous thromboembolism, 578 cancer,584 and HIV/AIDS.585 Technology. The MMIT in the order communication phase is six CDSS, one e-transmission,575 and two pharmacy information systems.438,574 Several studies included more than one MMIT as the major focus of the study. The ordering systems (CPOE and e -Prescribing), however, predominate. The following MMIT applications were integrate d in 15 of the 16 studies: one CDSS, 567 nine EMRs,438,540,574,576 -578,580,581,585 three hospital information systems,438,576,582 two imaging systems,574,581 three laboratory systems,574,578,581 six pharmacy systems ,552,577,579,583 -585 and one eMAR system.580 The nine EMRs and three hospital information systems reflect maturing of the MMIT systems with respect to order communication. 26 Outcomes No process changes were presented for adherence with guidelines, monitoring, or preventive care. One article describe d decreases in prescribing of contraindicated drug-drug combinations in ambulatory settings.577 Another looked at the agreement between pharmacists and family physicians (need for clarification of prescriptions) with and without e-Transmission of prescript ions, again in the ambulatory setting.575 All other process changes that were the main focus of the order communication articles dealt with errors and efficiencies. Errors. Two hospital studies addressed errors (Table 9). Mahoney et al.438 showed a decrea se in drug-allergy violations, excessive dose, incomplete or unclear orders, and therapeutic duplication with the introduction of a CPOE and CDSS system into a pediatric standalone and another general hospital. Varkey et al. 567 found an increase in the frequency of intercepted prescription errors after the introduction of another CPOE and CDSS system into the Mayo Clinic ambulatory practices. Prescribing. Two studies showed improvements in prescribing with increased interaction between pharmacists and physicians (Table 9). 552,577 Efficiency and workflow . Five hospital-based studies sought to change response times (Table 9). Four showed decreased times for processing and validating orders.576,578,581,584 One found increased time with the introduction of a CPOE and a CDSS system.582 Another found an increased time to checking the prescription with an e- Prescribing system compared with a paper based system (11 vs. 6 minutes, p < 0.01).575 Some changes were substantial. For example, a decrease from 115 minutes to 5 minutes for verification of a prescription in a study by Wielthrolter and colleagues.584 Three hospital studies found changes in work flows and processes with the introduction of a pharmacy information system574 and a CPOE and CDSS system with eMAR i ntegration.580 Fewer callbacks occurred with the introduction of a CPOE and CDSS system integrated into a hospital EMR.540 Pearce et al.585 completed an ambulatory care based setting (three HIV clinics and two private pharmacies) and found decreased time to respond to a refill request and changes in communication patterns with MMIT involved in order communication. Mitchell and colleagues 583 found that an eMAR system was associated with more accurate and complete recording of information. Ekeldahl and colleagues showed that the rate of picking up prescriptions did not change with the introduction of an e- Prescribing system. 579 Summary The evidence for the effects of MMIT on order communication comes from a limited number of studies, many of which were observational. The studies often include large numbers of participants or prescribing events. Most of the process evaluations show improvements, often in efficiency related to times and changing work patterns (Table 9). 27 Table 9.

RCT = Randomized Controlled Trial Dispensing Summary of the Findings for Process Changes Some overlap and duplication of studies occurs between the dispensing phase of medication management and the phases of order communication and administering. Nine studies were identified as evaluating dispensing (Appendix C, Evidence Table 3).438,507,552,574,585,586,588 -590 Much diversity was seen across these studies. In addition to these articles, a health technology assessment (HTA) repor t from the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) produced a systematic review on errors in dispensing and administering in hospitals in 2009. 11 It sought to assess the effectiveness and economic impact of MMIT applications designed to improve medication dispensing and administering in hospitals. Strengths and Limitations of the Evidence Study methods included three RCTs,507,574,588 one cohort study,586 and five observational studies.438,552,585,589,590 The HTA report found 30 studies on dispensing, administering, or both, most of which were done using observational methods. In addition, many of these studies evaluated technologies that were older, no longer available, or only available in Europe. Overall the authors of the report stated that the evidence on the effectiveness of MMIT for improving medication dispensing is lacking, of poor quality, and has limited applicability. 11 The year of publication of the nine papers in this AHRQ document were more recent: 1997,589 1999,574 2001,552 Raebel and colleagues507 and Halkin and colleagues552 reported data based on patients as the unit of study. Both studies included patients older than 65 years. Two reports studied pharmacists.574,588 All others reported data on medications or prescribing events as their unit of analysis. Location. Four studies were set in community pharmacies552,585,586,588 and one in an HMO pharmacy.507 The other study locations were pharmacies and clinics in hospitals.438,574,589,590 Drugs and diseases. Aspirin for patients with diabetes was studied,588 and two others targeted groups of medications with high potential for interactions.507,552 One study included e- Prescribing in thre e HIV clinics and two private pharmacies.585 One article concentrated on drugs that are used heavily by seniors.507 All others studied the range of prescriptions available in the pharmacies. Technology. The technology described in these dispensing studies varied considerably. Four studies evaluated pharmacy information systems, 438,507,574,588 three looked at eMAR systems,585,589,590 and CDSS,438,507,552 one at an e- Prescribing system,586 and one evaluated a CPOE application.438 These systems were integrat ed with an EHR or EMR system,438,507,574,585 hospital information system,438,589 a pharmacy system,552,585,590 a laboratory system,574 a formulary,589 or a CPOE system.590 The HTA report includes a good description of their evaluation of MMIT that provides additional background information on administering and dispensing MMIT applications. 591 Outcomes Each of the main endpoints for the trials was found to be positive. Efficiency, monitoring, and preventive care outcomes were not reported in the nine studi es. Errors. Three of the four hospital based studies assessed errors and all showed improvements with eMAR,589 CPOE, CDSS and a pharmacy information system,438 and a pharmacy information system with CPOE.590 None of the ambulatory care studies assessed er rors. The HTA report provided some evidence that BCMA is associated with reduced errors for dispensing (pharmacists) and administering (nursing), with the BCMA either as a stand -alone system or integrated with other health IT applications. Evidence on other outcomes or technologies in dispensing was found to be lacking or inconclusive. 11 Adherence to guidelines. For pharmacists who were prompted electronically to suggest aspirin to patients with diabetes when they were filling other prescriptions, the use of aspirin increased. 588 Changes in medications to be administered. Four of the four ambulatory studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements in what drugs were dispensed. Alerts to pharmacists improved dispensing of medications with high potential for interactions in an HMO pharmacy, 552 while the use of contraindicated medications decreased with most of the decrease associated with amitripyline in another study. 507 Refill utilization was improved585 and aspirin use increased 29 while pharmacis ts were being prompted to include aspirin use when dispensing medications for patients with diabetes.588 Other process changes. Murray and colleagues574 showed changes in workflow for pharmacists (more time interacting and problem solving) and who they interacted with (more time interacting with peers and physicians). Workflow was also changed in another study using a pharmacy information system. 574 A commercial EMR system reduced the time to process and fill a refill request for HIV medication.585 Nilsson and colleagues586 showed that acute prescriptions were picked up more often for an e- Prescribing system compared with a paper -based system (91 percent vs. 85 percent, p < 0.01). Summary Few reports studied dispensing. Three of these nine studies were RC Ts. All studies showed statistically significant improvements in process. External evidence suggests that the existing studies dealing with dispensing are weak and dated, with reports of currently used MMIT applications not being readily available. Admini stering Summary of the Findings for Process Changes Nineteen studies measured changes in process associated with the administering phase of medication management (Appendix C, Evidence Table 4). All deal with nurses and either pharmacists or physicians. The technology is complex, integrated and often part of a complete package of a hospital information system or an EMR or EHR system. All studies but two12,592 were done using observational methods. As noted in the dispensing section, CADTH produced a systematic review in 2009 on errors in dispensing and administering in hospitals.11 This HTA report assessed the effectiveness and economic impact of MMIT applications designed to improve medication dispensing and administering. They found that the evidence on me dication administering with MMIT was based on observational studies and that many of the studies were done on systems that have been updated or are no longer available. Many studies and descriptive papers that reported on medication administering and health IT, including Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA ) were reviewed for this report and were rejected. Most of the rejection decisions were because the medication administration system was stand -alone and not integrated with other MMIT applications. This nonintegration was especially true for older studies\u2014most of the more recent studies show medication administering systems that are integrated. One good example of this integration is by Helmons and colleagues. 593 Nonintegrated systems are not included in this report, as integration with other MMIT applications was an inclusion criterion. Strengths and Limitations of the Evidence One document was an RCT592 and one was a cohort study.12 All of the others were observational studies.34,438,439,581,583,589, 593-602 Two were published in the late 1990s and 12 of the 19 were published since 2004. 30 General Study Characteristics Participants. All but one study included nurses. Three studies included pharmacists,439,589,598 and four discussed physicians.465,592,593,596 The main focus of the study was medications or prescriptions,34,438,439,465,581,589,592 -595,598,599,601,602 nurses597,600 and patients: infants12 and those whose ages were unspecified.596 Medications were not limited to a specific drug or class of dr ugs except for one study of the need for antibiotics596 and one study of aspirin use.592 Location. All of the studies but one were set in hospitals: acute care or tertiary,439,465,581,596,598,600 \u00ad 602 critical care units,12,593 -595 pediatric standalone hos pitals,438,465 general hospitals,34,438 other specialty hospitals,465,581 and the emergency department.597 Pediatric hospitals or wards were often studied: neonatal ward and adult ICU,595 general pediatrics,438 and pediatric nephrology.465 One of the studies was done in an ambulatory setting,592 and none were done in long- term care, community, or home settings. Technology. The MMIT applications that were the focus of the administering phase of medication management were varied: automated drug dispensing system,599 BCMA systems,12,34,593,594,598,600,601 e-Prescribing,439,602 and a pharmacy information system.438 The MMIT systems that are integrated with these systems above are most likely to be hospital wide or pharmacy systems: a CPOE system,593 EHR and EMR systems,438,581,592,593,596,601 hospital imaging systems,581,597 laboratory systems,581,59 7 eMAR,594 a formulary,589 and pharmacy information systems.12,34,439,583,595,597,599,601 Outcomes Errors. Thirteen studies evaluated administering errors. The issue of errors in administering drugs using MMIT is complex as many errors identified in MMIT systems are related to transcription and timing. These easily measured errors may be masking other more substantial errors. Eight studies had major endpoints that were found to be positive in reporting decreased errors . 438,439,465,581,589,594,601,602 Another measured variances (differences between the order and administered medications) and found significant reductions after the introduction of a CPOE system integrated with the pharmacy and eMAR systems in a hospital. 595 The relative risk reduction in many of the studies was high and often approximately 40 to 50 percent. Four studies had endpoints that were not found to show statistically significant improvements. 34,583,593,598 Another hospital-based study showed increased errors, mostly related to a BCMA sy stem ,12 because t he BCMA system recorded issues such as timing of medication administering more accurately. The HTA report from CADTH also provided evidence that BCMA reduced errors in administering medications in hospitals. 11 Efficiency. Efficiency is also important in medication administering. Four of five studies that measured efficiencies showed improvements. One study showed that time from ordering to administering in a hospital setting decreased from 90 minutes before implementation of comprehensive MMIT systems to 11 minutes. 438 Another article that measured time efficiencies had similar reductions (79 percent vs. 89 percent of medications were administered within 1 hour of ordering). 439 An eMAR system reduced time from ordering to administering from 325 to 88 31 minutes .581 Shirley and colleagues599 did not find a change in time to administering after implementation of an eMAR. No changes in time allocation were seen for direct patient care and medication administration after a BCMA system integration for hospital nurses.600 In contrast, Banet and colleagues described a system that integrated CPOE and eMAR and showed that nurses spent less time on paper documentation and searching for charts and more time on working with computers and charting in patient rooms with no changes in documentation time overall or time spent on direct patient care. 597 Adherence to guidelines. One study with an anesthesia medication system had improvements in adherence to administering antibiotics during surgery.596 Shirley a nd colleagues599 found improved adherence to scheduled dosing. Persell and colleagues592 identified no difference in self-reported aspirin use. Other changes in process. Helmons and colleagues593 found no changes in error rates (they had few errors at ba seline) but measured improved charting and labeling. Summary. Although few studies evaluated administering with the use of MMIT, most of the 19 showed improvements, mostly in the realm of errors and efficiencies. Results were mixed with respect to whether the MMIT systems for drug administering altered the time nurses spent on various tasks. Monitoring Summary of the Findings for Process Changes Medication monitoring can been defined as the process of assessing a patient's response to a medication and documenting its outcomes.603 Suboptimal medication monitoring describes a common pathway of systems failures that underlie monitoring errors and can be categorized as over, under, or inappropriate monitoring. Medication monitoring errors generally refer to one of three situations: inadequate laboratory evaluation of drug therapies, or a delayed or failed response by the clinician to symptoms (patient reported aspects of their disease or disorder), or to clinician observed or measured signs of the condition or of drug toxicity, or laboratory evidence of toxicity. 604 Therefore, for the purposes of this report, we divided the health IT interventions designed to improve medication monitoring into studies that enhance laboratory- , sign- , or symptom -based medicatio n monitoring. In the clinician and patient encounter the patient reports symptoms they are experiencing (e.g., fatigue, sudden weight gain, or dizziness) and the clinician observes or measures signs of the disease or disorder (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, fever). Clinicians integrate information gained from assessments of symptoms, signs, and results of laboratory tests to determine disease status, often putting varying weights on the three aspects. Previous systematic reviews provided information on the impact of health IT on medication monitoring. 605-607 However, these systematic reviews are limited to a specific type of medication monitoring system (e.g., clinical event monitors), a single practice setting (e.g., ambulatory or acute care), or are more than 5 years old. This evidence report yielded a total of 47 articles describing health IT intervention designed to improve one or more change in process related to the medication monitoring phase in the acute, ambulatory, or long- term care settings (Appendix 32 C, Evidence Table 5) .397,401,402,407,412,437,442,446,461,472,473,477,481,505,511,515,516,518 -520,526 \u00ad 528,534,537,541,543,553 -555,608 -624 For consistency, author-reported changes in process were selected. By definition, a study which showed statistically significant changes in at least half of its main endpoints was considered a positive study. Overall, 70 percent (33 of 47 studies) of the articles were rated as positive studies.397,401,402,407,412,437,461,472,473,477,505,515,516,527,528,537,541,554,555,608,610,612 -623 Study methods included 30 23 Monitoring, along with CDSS, a re the two areas that include the highest proportion of RCTs. General Study Characteristics Intervention targets. Nearly three -quarters (72 percent; 34 of 47) of the health IT medication monitoring interventions targeted physicians exclusively. 397,401,402,407,412,437,442,446,461,472,481,505,511,515,520,527,528,534,543,553,554,609 -611,613,615 -620,622- 624 Eight of these studies targeted physicians along with other health care professionals,518,519,526,537,541,555,612,621 four targeted pharmacists,473,477,516, 614 and one targeted 608 nurses. Location. The overwhelming majority of health IT medication monitoring interventions studies (70 percent; 33 of 47) were conducted in an academic setting. 397,401,402,407,412,437,442,446,461,472,473,477,481,505,515,518 -520,527,534,554,608 -611,614 -619,621,622 Of those that were conducted in an academic setting, 19 of these studies402,407,437,446,477,505,515,518,519,527,554,609 \u00ad 611,614 -616,618,619 came from the following benchmark institutions: (1) Brigham and Women' s Hospital/Partners Health Care, (2) LDS Hospital/Intermountain Health Care, ( 3) the Department of Veterans Affairs, and (4) the Regenstrief Institute. The preponderance of studies (59 percent; 28 of 47) took place in the ambulatory care setting.472,505,511,515,516,518 -520,526 -528,534,537,541,543,553 -555,609 -613,616,617,619,620,624 Eighteen of the studies took place in the acute care,401,402,407,412,437,442,446,461,473,477,481,608,614,615,618,621 -623 and one in the nursing home setting.397 Patient populations s tudie d. The vast majority (n = 36) of the health IT interventions targeted the adult population.397,401,402,407,412,461,472,481,505,511,515,516,518 -520,526 -528,534,537,541,543,554,609 -612,614 -617,619 \u00ad 622,624 Only four of the 44 articles were conducted in the pediatric population,437,442,446,553 and two targeted both adult and pediatric patients.477,613 Five studies did not explicitly mention the study patient population studied.473,555,608,618,623 Type of medication monitoring. The majority (n = 29) of the heal th IT interventions focused on laboratory-based medication 397,401,402,407,412,442,461,472,473,477,481,511,515,516,527,528,534,537,541,543,555,609,611,612,614,615,619,620,623 monitoring. Five studies505,518,526,613,624 targeted sign-based (clinician observe d or measured aspects of the disease process) medication monitoring. While three interventions focused on symptom -based monitoring (patient reported symptoms),520,608,621 ten studies437,446,519,553,554,610,616 -618,622 provided a combination of laboratory- , sign- , or symptom -based medication monitoring. A significant degree of overlap (n = 36) of health IT interventions that involved laboratory- , sign- , or symptom -based monitoring along with the prescribing phase of the medication use process existed.397,40 2,412,437,446,461,472,473,477,481,505,515,518,519,526 -528,534,537,541,543,553 -555,610,613 -620,622 -624 33 Prescribing was laboratory-based medication monitoring (n = 30),397,402,412,446,461,472,473,477,481,515,519,527,528,534,537,541,543,553 -555,610,614 -620,622,623 followed by sign- based medication monitoring ( n = 15),437,446,505,518,519,526,553,554,610,613,616 -618,622,624 and symptom - based medication monitoring.437,553 This overlap was most often a result of the evaluation of clinical practice guidelines, order sets, or both that contain prescribing and monitoring elements. Drugs and diseases. Twenty -four of the health IT medication monitoring interventions studies dealt with chronic disease management such as asthma,446,553 asthm a and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,518,613 congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease,519 deep venous hypertension,505,526,624 and multiple common chronic conditions.617,620,623 Sixteen studies addressed potentially nephrotoxic,397,615 hepatotoxic,241 or cardiotoxic473 medications with a narrow therapeutic index,442,461,555,618 and certain laborat ory and medication combinations.407,412,481,511,516,609,611,612 Four provided guidance about potentially inappropriate antibiotic management,401,477,614,622 and three provided information about pain management.437,608,621 Technology. Almost all of the inc luded studies regarding MMIT interventions (91 percent; 43 of 47)397,401,402,407,412,442,461,472,473,477,481,505,511,515,516,518 -528,534,537,541,543,553,555,608,609,611 -624 used a CDSS with alerts or reminders. Three studies use d a CPOE system without alerts437,442,446 and one study involved the use of a personal health record ( PHR ).610 Twelve of the studies used interruptive alerts to display and prompt the clinician for an immediate response while providing patient care.397,407,412,472,481,505,543,608,609,611,613,624 Outcomes As noted above, more than two-thirds (33 of 47) of the interventions were associated with a positive process outcome. A number of themes emerged from the variety of interventions that were conducted in various health care sett ings, using varying degrees of technological sophistication, and providing information to a number of health care professionals, as well as directly to patients. By type of m edication monitoring. The majority of the health IT interventions focused on laboratory-based medication 397,401,402,407,412,442,461,472,473,477,481,511,515,516,527,528,534,537,541,543,555,609,611,612,614,615,619,620,623 monitoring. Of these 29 studies, 22397,401,402,407,412,461,472,473,477,515,516,527,528,537,541,555,612,614,615,619,62 0,623 or 76 percent of these interventions showed statistically significant changes in at least half of these main endpoints . Two 505,613 of the five505,518,526,613,624 studies (40 percent) that targeted sign-based medication monitoring showed that greater than 50 percent of the process endpoints improved. 520,608,621 two608,621 resulted Of the three interventions that focused on symptom-based monitoring, in statistically significant changes in at least half of their main process endpoints . Ten studies 437,446,519,553,554,610,616 -618,622 provided a combination of laboratory- , sign- , or symptom - based monitoring, and seven437,554,610,616 -618,622 or 70 percent showed statistically significant changes in at least half of their main process endpoints . By type of i ntervention. One of the most frequently reported types of intervention (n = 12) provided decision support to improve chronic disease management (i.e., prescribing, monitoring, 34 and clinical endpoints).505,520,526,528,537,541,543,554,555,610,616,624 The type of chronic diseases varied based on patient population, but included the management of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Overall, 67 percent of these interventions resulted in a statistically significant change in at least half of its major endpoints. Another common intervention (n = 10) assessed the adherence to guideline recommendations for a variety of acute and chronic medical conditions including asthma, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, diabetes, glucose regulation in the ICU, pain management, and peripheral vascular disease. 402,412,446,518,519,553,617,620,621,623 Overall, 60 percent of these interventions resulted in statistically significant change in at least half of its main endpoints. Other common interventions (n = 8) included providing alerts and reminders to obtain laboratory testing for newly prescribed or chronic ally used medications. 407,442,472,511,516,609,611, 612 Overall, 50 percent of these interventions showed a statistically significant change in at least half of their main endpoints. Seven studies targeted changing prescribing behavior by providing laboratory -, sign- , or symptom -based monitoring information for potentially nephrotoxic medications, medications for asthma and COPD, and hyperlipidemia. 473,505,515,534,613,614,622 Overall, 86 percent of these interventions resulted in improvements in at least half of the major process changes reported as endpoints. Another metric commonly assessed was the response time to a variety of alerts (n = 7) including the management of narrow therapeutic index and potentially nephrotoxic medications, initiation of primary and secondary prevention, and time to pain assessment and management. 461,477,481,527,615,618,619 Overall, 71 percent of these interventions showed statistically significant improvements in at least half of its main endpoints. Finally, two interventions as sessed pain management including error reassessment rate and patient controlled analgesia order set use.437,608 Overall, both of these interventions showed statistically significant changes in at least half of its main endpoints. In our analysis, 70 percent (33 of 47 studies) of the included studies showed statistically significant changes in at least half of their main endpoints. Of these studies, the majority targeted physicians exclusively (n = 34), were conducted in academic institutions ( n = 33), were developed for use in the ambulatory care setting ( n = 28), focused on the adult population ( n = 36), and provided CDSS with alerts or reminders to support chronic disease management ( n = 12). When compared with sign- or symptom -based medication monitoring, laboratory-based medication monitoring studies were most likely (76 percent of the time) to be associated with a statistically significant change in at least half of its main endpoints . Moreover, these laboratory- based medication monitoring studies were conducted in a variety of health care settings including ambulatory, acute, and long-term care. The most successful types of studies focused on changing prescriber behavior, improving response time to generated alerts, and improving the diagnosis and management of chronic diseases. Reconciliation, Discharge Summaries, and Education Summary of the Findings for Process Changes Reconciliation. Reconciliation of medications using MMIT is a complex process. Some of this stems from the complexity of medication management itself. Another issue is the challenge of interoperability of health IT across health care systems. The problem of medication 35 reconciliation is especially acute for patients who receive care across settings: from hospitals, specialists, and prima ry care \u2014most often the elderly and those with multiple health challenges. Two review articles provide documentation of the difficulties of effective medication reconciliation using health IT and the lack of published evidence to support its value. 625,626 Four studies on medication reconciliation are included (Appendix C, Evidence Table 6).13,14,627,628 One was a cohort study628 and the others are quantitative observational. All were set in hospitals with the reconciliation done at discharge or transfer to another facility. One hospital was a State psychiatric hospital 13 and the others were general hospitals. One study was PDA- based,13 one was based on an e- MAR system,14 and the others were based on integrated systems: CDSS and COPE within an EMR,627 and an e- Prescribing system integrated with a pharmacy information system.628 All studies showed substantial improvement in agreement among records of medications provided by various clinicians involved in the care of the patients (Appendix C, Evidence Table 6). For example, one Dutch study showed improvements in agreement on prescriptions between the pharmacists and general practitioners with e- Prescribing compared with paper systems at discharge (31 percent vs. 49 percent) and at 10 days after discharge (33 percent vs. 53 percent). 628 Grasso and colleagues13 showed a decrease in errors in the psychiatric hospital with the use of PDAs for reconciliation compared with paper summaries (rate of errors before PDAs was 22 percent compared with 8 percent after). Poole and colleagues 14 also showed improvements in prescribing (more therapeutic drug duplications were identified and resolved with an automated discharge medication worksheet for physicians). In summary, although few studies exist on MMIT for medication reconciliation, the four included showed substantial improvements in the ability to electronically reconcile medication lists and make the necessary adjustments resulting in reduced errors and better prescribing. Education. Only one article targeted the education associated with MMIT systems and measured change in processes as their main endpoint (see Appendix C, Evidence Table 6). 537 This RCT showed that combining patient education with submission of blood glucose levels to ambulatory care clinicians showed impro vements in prescribing as well as improved hemoglobin A 1c levels. Most of the articles targeting educational aspects of medication management that measured changes in knowledge are covered in the section with intermediate outcomes. Combined Phases of Medication Management Summary of the Findings for Process Changes Although some studies in this report assessed systems that covered the whole medication management process (five phases plus reconciliation and education), only one provided cross- phase study w ith changes in process . This observational study by Mahoney and colleagues438 took place in a U.S. pediatric hospital and an affiliated acute care hospital. The study started in 2002 and was completed in 2006 with publication in 2007. The hospitals included a full EMR system that incorporated CPOE, CDSS, and the pharmacy information system into one clinical information technology (hospital information system). All aspects of the medication management system were addressed electronically. An analysis of 1.4 million orders after implementation as compared with a similar number before implementation showed reductions in drug allergy violations, excessive doses, incomplete or unclear orders, and therapeutic duplication. 36 PDAs Summary of the Findings for PDAs We included 13 studies using PDAs.13,514,534,553,563,593,629 -635 The studies often covered multiple medication management phases, such as prescribing (n = 7), order communication (n = 1), administering (n = 3), and monitoring phases (n = 6), as well as reconciliation (n = 1). Outcome measures focused on process and other intermediate measures, only two measured patient outcomes (blood glucose levels in both cases). 630,631 Eight of the studies included a CDSS component.514,534,553,563,593,630,631,634 Two applications were tied to handheld BCMA units,593,635 and two were used for e- Prescribing.639,632 Most interventions targeted specific diseases such as diabetes,630,631 asthma,553,634 cancer,633 high blood pressure,534 psychiatric patients ,13 or the use of certain classes of medications such as nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs514 and antibiotics.563 Two studies were qualitative,629,632 two mixed methods,633,635 five observational,13,553,563,593,631 and four were RCTs.514,630,633,634 Of the quantitative studie s, five reported significant improvements as a result of the intervention13,563,630,631,634 and four reported no significant effects.514,534,553,593 An RCT of adherence to nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug prescribing guidelines in an ambulatory clinic s howed stable levels of safe prescribing in the intervention group and a deterioration in the control group given PDAs without the guidelines.514 Similarly, a PDA which provided physicians with Framingham scores and recommendations for patients at risk of h igh blood pressure, found no difference in levels of screening of patients and no effect on lipid management. 534 A PDA-based CDSS for international asthma guidelines improved quality-of- life scores for patients and cost reductions.634 A crossover RCT of di abetic patient use of an insulin regimen dosage optimizer showed improvement in blood glucose levels during the phase when the advice was switched on. 630 Intermediate Outcomes Summary of the Findings Articles measuring intermediate outcomes as their main endpoint were selected. We focused on the intermediate outcomes of: use; measures which were correlated with use (such as ease of use of the system, perceptions of users of the system, computer experience, etc.); knowledge, skills , and attitudes of the users; satisfaction; and usability (Table 10). Few hypothesis-driven studies with comparison groups assessed such intermediate outcomes as their main measure; 42 studies published in 44 articles were retrieved (Appendix C, Evidence Table 7). Only six studies were RCTs with quality scores from two to seven out of nine. The study results tended to show positive levels of satisfaction and use and measured a number of correlates of both to determine driving factors barriers, or both. Some negative impacts of syst ems on work processes were found. 37 Table 10.

Column Headings: P = Prescribing , OC = Order Communication, D = Dispensing, A = Administering, M = Monitoring, E = Education, R = Reconciliation RCT = Randomized controlled trial General Study Cha racteristics Study participants tended to be practicing clinicians (Table 12). Most of the studies were conducted in hospitals (n = 27) or primary care (n = 17), one in long-term care, and four in pharmacies, and assessed intermediate outcomes for health care staff. Twenty -two of the studies were performed in academic settings. Prescribing was the most commonly studied phase of medication management, but each other phase was represented. Three systems used hand- held devices. CDSS, e-Prescribing, and CPOE systems were most commonly studied. Most studies did not report on the proprietary nature of their systems, 17 studied commercial systems and seven were home grown. Many studies looked to correlate use of medication management systems with other factors. Onl y nine studies assessed intermediate outcomes for patients (Table 13). 633,637,639,641,642,648 -651 38 Table 12.

Column Headings: P = Prescribing , OC = Order Communication, D = Dispensing, A = Administering, M = Monitoring, E = Education, R = Reconciliation Prescribing and ordering . Twenty -six studies looked at intermediate outcomes for interventions aimed at the prescribing phase (see Appendix C, Evidence Table 22). CDSS (n = 12), CPOE ( n = 11), and e- Prescribing systems ( n = 6) formed the bulk of the primary systems studied. Three studies assessed usability issues related to CPOE or CDSS.638,647,652 One study focused on the use of standards for medical history, formulary, and benefits.653 Satisfaction and correlates of satisfaction were measured in ten studies;636,637,644,645,654 -659 use and measures correlated with use were studied in 11 studies.534,643,649,650,653,660 -665 Pirnejad and colleagues666 used mixed methods to determine the impact of CPOE on the collaboration of nurses and physicians in hospitals. Glassman and colleagues 667 looked at the impact of drug-drug interaction alerts on physician knowledge over time. Two studies assessed perceptions of technology on work. 656,658 Participants were generally health care providers, located in either hospitals (16 studies), primary care (ten studies), or both, and one pharmacy.540 The majority were performed in the United States. Order communication. Four studies looked at the order communication phase;540,645,668,669 three focus sed on e-transfer of prescriptions,540,645,668 and all stud ied the perceptions of pharmacy staff as well as other stakeholders. Rupp and Warholak645 administered a survey and followed up with interview s of American chain community pharmacy staff to assess their attitudes towards e- Prescribing and recruited a sample of 1094 pharmacists, technicians, and interns from 276 pharmacies. Porteous and colleagues668 surveyed 494 patients, 145 general practitioners, and 148 pharmacists, and held interviews and focus groups to assess peoples' views regarding the upcoming implementation of e -Transfer of prescription information in the United Kingdom. On 39 the other hand, Kirking and Thomas669 performed a survey lookin g at pharmacists ' attitudes towards computer technology used to detect and prevent adverse drug interactions, and correlated their findings with pharmacist computer use. Their sample included 218 pharmacists in Michigan using one of two pharmacy computer systems and a group of nonusers. Johnson and colleagues 540 assessed the perceived usefulness of alerts and override comments appended to e- Prescriptions. Dispensing. Two studies looked at dispensing. Chan646 looked at factors associated with the use of dru g dispensing and eMAR systems in nursing homes by analyzing surveys of long- term care facilities. Rupp and Warholak645 assessed pharmacist personnel staff views of e- Prescribing. Administering. Eight studies assessed technologies used at the administering phase. O'Morrow,670 Hurley,671 Holden,672,673 Topps,674 and their colleagues assessed American nurses ' attitudes and satisfaction toward bedside point-of-care BCMA technologies to verify drug administering. The usage patterns of BCMA verification in five medical departments of a Dutch hospital were tracked.675 The perceptions of the effects of a newly implemented CPOE in two groups of 211 Dutch nurses previously using different paper prescription systems were assessed by Niazkhani et al. 644 Chan646 assessed factors associated with medication administration records use in nursing homes. Monitoring. Four of the five monitoring studies focused on patient self-monitoring. Weingart and colleagues641 measured the use of PatientSite, a patient internet portal, b y 416 patients in three primary care practices to facilitate communication between physicians and patients regarding medication adherence and adverse effect rates. In an RCT involving 117 patients, Ross and colleagues 639 provided patient online records for heart failure patients and assessed self - efficacy. McCann and colleagues633 performed an RCT on 112 cancer patients with a mobile phone application to monitor their chemotherapy toxicity symptoms compared with standard care and measured perceived benefits . Schmidt and colleagues642 tested patient adherence using a telemonitoring intervention which included a beeping medication box integrated with the patient 's EHR data. The final study assessed the usability of a CDSS Antibiotic Wizard in an ICU using an ergonomic survey tool to detect deficiencies in the system as viewed by 40 physicians. 647 Reconciliation. One study evaluated patient and physician satisfaction and perceptions of a discharge reconciliation application. 651 Education. The study by Liu and colleagues648 is the only study focusing on the education aspect of medication management.Their study provides hospitalized patients in a Taiwanese hospital with a system that integrates their pharmacy, EMR, and CPOE information into an education tool to increase their knowledge of their medication regimens. Knowledge was assessed in pre -post surveys of 154 patients and they reported perceived knowledge gains. Outcomes Prescribing. Many studies measured use descriptively (e.g. , presenting the percentage o f time e - Prescribing was used for writing prescriptions), but did not meet our criteria for having comparison groups and being hypothesis-driven. From our included studies, use and measures 40 that were correlated with use were frequently measured. Rogers and colleagues660 found that usage rates increased following iterative changes made to a CDSS system based on feedback from users. Shannon and colleagues643 reported a significantly higher rate of e- Prescribing after emergency department physicians were allocated hand- held PDAs with e -Prescribing software. Access to medication history was more frequently used for patients with low socioeconomic status and a greater number of medications. 650 Some studies found that ease of use and perceived usefulness relating to improved care and care processes of the MMIT applications were positively correlated with level of use.653,661 -664 Kralewski and colleagues665 found that use of e- Prescribing systems was correlated with such cultural factors in primary care practices as trust, adaptability , and business orientation. Wang and colleagues653 found that a positive performance measure based on ease, efficiency , and care was correlated with nonuse of an e-Prescribing system incorporating standards for medication history, benefits, and formulary. Use of a CDSS in an Australian hospital was positively correlated with computer sophistication and access to laboratory data and negatively with years of experience. 661 Musser and Tcheng640 measured preference and use of a graphic inte rface compared with a text -based interface for an anesthetic CPOE; clinicians used the graphic interface more often, but both interfaces had their proponents. A study assessing the frequency of use of three common pediatric order sets found differential us e rates, with asthma order sets used significantly more often than both appendectomy and community-acquired pneumonia order sets. 649 Usability. Three studies looked at usability and also included data on comparison groups. 638,647,652 Rosenbloom and collea gues638 found that highly visible hyperlinks significantly increased the use of educational material and patient information. Rohrig647 and Li and colleagues652 used usability testing to identify issues in a CDSS and CPOE system respectively. Their results were used to inform new iterations of their existing systems. Satisfaction. Ten studies measured satisfaction as a main outcome. Satisfaction with various systems used by various health care providers tended to be positive.644,645,656 -658 Satisfaction was lower in an intervention group of residents provided with CDSS within an e- Prescribing system in a small RCT, but they only used the system for 2.8 percent of their prescriptions.636 No difference in satisfaction levels were detected for patients or phys icians using a discharge CPOE application compared with usual care.637,659 Differences in satisfaction and perceptions of the systems were found between nurses and physicians;656,657 medical and surgical staff;654,657 and residents compared with physicians.654 Perceptions of the system impact on work were also found to be different among health care providers.656,658 Other factors correlated with satisfaction included computer sophistication, experience, training, system characteristics , and perceived improvements in care.654-657 Knowledge. Glassman and colleagues667 found no change in physician knowledge of selected drug-drug interactions over 2 years of using a CDSS with alerts in 97 American primary care physicians, although most preferred having the sy stem. Attitudes. Pirnejad and colleagues666,676 studied nurses' and physicians' attitudes to the impact of CPOE on the nurse-physician collaboration in the medication process. They found that the original paper -based system and the new CPOE system supported their work and collaboration 41 differently. The new system led to problems in the synchronization and feedback aspects of the joint medication care, leading to the recognition that new systems do not always directly replace the work entailed in old syste ms and that care processes can be negatively impacted. 666 Attitudes toward MMIT often varied by groups of users. Junior students were more positive about CPOE than interns and residents.677 Similarly, using a diffusion of innovations model, Rahimi and col leagues678 found that a CPOE was perceived to work better for nurses than physicians (57 percent vs. 13 percent); further, more physicians felt that the system was not adapted to their practice and more would have liked a return to the old system, compared with the nurses. Johnson and colleagues 540 measured perceptions of pharmacists to appended alerts and override comments on e-prescriptions; they found some information ( e.g., allergy alerts) more useful than others (e.g., insurance status). Order commun ication . Of the four studies assessing the communication phase, outcomes assessed included only satisfaction645 and attitudes.540,668,669 Rupp and Warholak645 found that chain community pharmacy personnel who dispensed e- Prescriptions were generally satisf ied with e -Prescribing and rated e-Prescriptions more favorably than paper prescriptions on seven criteria related to safety, efficiency, effectiveness, communication , and relationships with patient and prescriber. They further produced 11 best practice re commendations to improve e-Prescribing in a community pharmacy setting. In the United Kingdom, before e-Transfer of prescription information being implemented, Porteous and colleagues 668 found that various stakeholders viewed e- Transfer as a good idea (68 percent of patients [95 percent confidence interval (CI), 64 percent to 72 percent], 83 percent of general practitioners [95 percent CI, 77 percent to 89 percent], and 87 percent of community pharmacists [95 percent CI, 82 percent to 92 percent]). Concerns were expressed about security and sharing of confidential information. Benefits revolved around improved repeat prescription processes, convenience, and a greater role for pharmacists in medication management. The potential for pharmacy systems to assist pharmacists in detecting adverse drug interactions by having greater access to patient information in the form of patient medication profiles was assessed by Kirking 669 in a survey study asking pharmacists using two systems and a third group using no system how often they detected potential drug interactions and how often they contacted prescribers. Computer users reported an average of twice as many detected interactions per week (16.1 vs. 8.7, ns) and had significantly more contacts with prescribers per week (21.5 vs. 16, p <0.05). The majority of the differences were the result of users of one of the unnamed computer systems, while the other groups had use rates similar to the noncomputer group. Dispensing. One study suggests that drug dispensing and eMAR technologies were used more in nursing homes with higher occupancy rates; fewer metropolitan than rural homes using systems. 646 Rupp and Warholak645 presented best practice recommendations for community pharmacies using e -Prescribing based on surveys showing satisfaction with e -Prescribing in community chain pharmacies. Administering. Administering phase articles focused on nurses using BCMA systems670-675 or eMAR systems.646 O'Morrow670 found no differences in the attitudes of 17 nurses regarding patie nt care, charting, computer benefits, computer capability, computer characteristics, legal 42 issues, or management tools before and after implementation of a BCMA system. Hurley and colleagues,671 on the other hand, found significant improvements on a satisfaction scale of 1,087 nurses after implementation of a similar system for efficacy, safety, care, and access factors. Holden et al. 672,673 assessed nurses' perceptions and acceptance of BCMA; perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness; predicted satisf action with the process before and after BCMA.673 In their second study, nurses' perceptions of the medication administering process changed with the implementation of BCMA compared with a control group; while perceived safety, accuracy and consistency in checking patient identification improved, ease of use, usefulness, and efficiency were perceived to decrease. 672 Topps and colleagues674 looked at nurse, pharmacist, and respiratory technicians ' perceptions of BCMA before and after implementation; surveys after implementation showed that the staff felt that fewer medication errors occurred with a smoother administering of medication; they did, however, perceive that more time was spent administering medications, which took time away for other patient care. Overall, satisfaction and perceived benefits were improved in the study, by Niazkhani and colleagues, 644 of nurses who went from two paper-based prescribing systems to a CPOE system. Perception of effects did depend on which previous paper system they were used to, and workflow support was perceived as worse by both groups. Van Onzenoort and colleagues 675 measured usage of bar code point-of- care systems by nurses and found that only 55 percent of 23,492 drug administrations were verified using the system; u se depended on department, drug route, nurses available, nurse age, and timing of administering. Monitoring. Most monitoring phase interventions were geared toward patients and showed positive effects on the intermediate outcomes of use, knowledge (self- efficacy), and satisfaction. PatientSite patient internet portal had a 48 percent response rate to index messages and a higher rate of ADE reporting via site (13 percent vs. 3 percent nonresponders, p = 0.01). 641 Ross and colleagues639 found that online records for heart failure patients improved self- efficacy (91 percent vs. 85 percent p = 0.08) and satisfaction. Chemotherapy patients using a mobile phone symptom system reported a number of benefits: better communication, better symptom management, and reassurance of physician access. 633 Finally, patients who telemonitored their congestive heart failure issues consistently used a beeping medication box integrated with their EHR to increase adherence to their regimen. 642 One study assessed usability; the Rohrig647 usability study of Antibiotic Wizard showed good usability. Physicians did report some weaknesses in the design of health IT which were to be used to inform future versions. Reconciliation. A study of satisfaction with a reconciliation system foun d that patients reported satisfaction for self -reported perceptions of clear instructions on what medications to take, how much and how often the medications were to be taken, other instructions on taking the medication, potential side effects , and general understanding of the medications. Health care provider perceptions of satisfaction with reconciliation and instructions did not differ for five factors except for three factors reported by physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Physician assistants and nurse practitioners reported that patients had clearer instructions on discharge (p = 0.01); how much, how often, and when to take their medications at home ( p = 0.05); and the medication discharge process was viewed as being sufficient for them as ca regivers (p = 0.0003). 651 43 Education. Use of an integrated pharmaceutical system to provide information to patients to understand the pharmacological properties of their medications resulted in significantly improved patient knowledge after use of the sys tem. 648 Economic Outcomes The introduction of health IT in the medication management process holds the promise of increasing efficiencies, improving quality of care, and reducing costs. However, even if these technologies are effective, they are expensive to implement and maintain and thus a review of the economic literature to determine cost -effectiveness and value for money for such interventions is warranted. All studies passing the inclusion criteria that were considered to be cost or economics studies were reviewed and categorized into two groups based on the type of economic evaluation used in the analysis: (1) full economic evaluations; and (2) partial economic evaluations. A full economic evaluation is the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both costs and consequences. Therefore, the economic evaluations which identify, measure, value, and compare the costs and consequences of the alternative being considered were further classified into one of the three categories: ( 1) cost -effectiveness analysis; (2) cost -utility analysis; and 3) cost- benefit analysis. 679 The label, partial economic evaluation, indicates that the studies do not entirely fulfill both of the necessary conditions for a full economic evaluation (i.e., costs and consequences). However, cost analyses can provide useful information on 'upfront' costs compared with 'downstream' cost avoidance. 679 For this reason, both full economic evaluations and cost analyses were included in this review. In each of these classifications, articles were further categorized by setting (i.e., hospital or community). Descriptive information on the populations, interventions evaluated, the study year, perspective, and country of study were abstracted for each study. Data specific to the costs and effectiveness of each comparison were also abstracted and summarized in Appendix C, Evidence Tables 8a and 8b. Full Economic Evaluations Only five of the 31 (16 percent) economic articles reviewed conducted economic evaluations that provided information on the incremental costs and the incremental effects of an MMIT application. The following section reports the findings of five economic evaluations dealing with the use of CPOE ( n = 2) and CDSS systems ( n = 3) for improving prescribing practi ces for various conditions (Appendix C, Evidence Tables 8a). Hospital . The potential economic consequences of implementing an eMAR system were estimated in a study using data from various literature sources. 680 In a tertiary care hospital setting, the projected incremental effectiveness of the eMAR was 261 ADEs averted over the 10 \u00ad year time horizon compared with the standard paper ordering approach. Given that the incremental cost of the new electronic medication ordering system was USD$3.3 million during that same period, the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio was USD$12,700 per ADE averted. A 1-year RCT in a hospital family medicine center evaluated the effect of three reminder systems on compliance with tetanus vaccination. 530 A computer- generated phys ician reminder system was found to cost $0.43 per additional vaccination recorded compared with usual care. 44 The telephone reminders to the patients cost $5.43 per additional vaccination, while the mailed letter reminder to the patients to recommend tetanus vaccination was $6.05 versus standard care. Community. A group of Norwegian researchers510 conducted a cost- effectiveness analysis alongside an RCT involving 146 general practices from two separate geographical areas . The objective of the evaluation was to compare the costs and effects of a multifaceted intervention, including computerized reminders to physicians, aimed at improving prescribing of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs compared with the passive dissemination of guidelines. The co st per additional patient started on a thiazide rather than another antihypertensive agent in the intervention group was compared with usual care. Over the 1- year study period, the authors calculated that the incremental cost- effectiveness ratio of the intervention was USD$454 per additional patient started on thiazides. It was found that reduced drug expenditures based on increased use of thiazides did not outweigh the costs of the intervention. The authors commented that if the effect was sustained for a second year, the intervention would have been expected to lead to savings. A Spanish study published in 2005 634 evaluated the cost -effectiveness of a CDSS designed to promote guidelines for the treatment of asthma. Over the 1-year study period, the authors found that from a societal perspective, the intervention dominated standard care (i.e. , less costly and more effective). From the health care payer perspective, the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio was \u20ac61 per percentage point reduction in the St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire. Setting not stated. Using information obtained from a systematic review of the literature, Karnon et al. 681 developed a decision tree model to estimate the net benefits of three interventions aimed at reducing medication er rors (i.e., CPOE, ward pharmacists, and bar coding), either through prevention or detection. Based on estimated quality of life utility decrements associated with experiencing a preventable ADE, it was concluded that the CPOE had a mean net benefit of GBP \u00a331.5 million, ward pharmacists of GBP \u00a327.25 million, and bar- coding of GBP \u00a313.1 million over a 5-year time horizon with the intervention and maintenance costs included in their model. It was noted that the monetary value of lost health needed to be included for the interventions to have a high probability of producing positive net benefits. Partial Economic Evaluations Most of the economic literature reported the results of partial evaluations (26 of 31 studies, 84 percent). All of these evaluations took the form of cost analyses. In other words, the costs of the alternatives were examined separately and the effectiveness, efficacy, or both measures were not used in the analyses, which results in an inability to answer efficiency questions about an interv ention. Hospital. A computerized ADE surveillance system was used to help identify and prevent specific types of ADEs in patients in hospitals. 682 The authors compared the length of stay in hospital of patients incurring an ADE with a historical control g roup of inpatients who did not have ADEs, and showed that the average length of stay for patients with severe ADEs was 20 days, 13 days for patients with moderate ADEs, and five days for those with no ADEs. This translated into a cost of USD$38,007 for pat ients with severe ADEs compared with USD$22,474 for patients with moderate and USD$6,320 for patients with no ADEs. Given this significant difference in the length and cost of hospitalization between patients with severe and moderate 45 ADEs, the authors concluded that this suggests that the prevention and reduction of ADEs could reduce the length and cost of hospitalization for certain patients. However, it is important to acknowledge that the cases were not matched for disease severity and that no direct cost analysis was made of the ADEs prevented by the system compared with before the implementation of the system. The same author measured the effect of a CDSS aimed at improving the use of and reducing the cost of antibiotics in four separate studies. The fi rst was conducted in an academic, tertiary, private hospital and the average cost for 24 hours of antibiotic therapy recommended by the CDSS was USD$10.85 less per patient than what was actually prescribed by physicians. 409 The same CDSS was evaluated in t wo studies that took place in a 12-bed shock/trauma/respiratory ICU. The 7-month pilot study revealed a mean reduction in the cost of antibiotics of USD$87.03 per patient compared with the preintervention period.683 The other ICU study was 12 months in duration and the mean cost of antibiotics for the computer regimen followed, regimen overridden, and no CDSS, respectively was USD$102 compared with USD$340 and $427, while the cost of hospitalization was USD$26,315 compared with USD$35,283 and USD$44,865. 475 Finally, an antibiotic -dose monitor was incorporated into the CDSS to check the renal function of patients to identify those who were potentially receiving excessive dosages of antibiotics.614 The patients in the intervention group received fewer mean dos es of study antibiotics at a lower average cost (USD$80.62) than patients during the preintervention period (USD$92.96) of this 12-month study. If this reduction of USD$12.34 per patient is summed for all 4,483 patients in the intervention period, this would result in a total decrease in cost of more than USD$55,000 a year. Another CDSS by Barrenfanger and colleagues, 684 designed to improve antibiotic prescribing by electronically notifying the pharmacist of potential problems with a patient' s antimicrobial therapy, was introduced in a 450-bed community teaching hospital and evaluated over a 5-month time period. The study compared patients whose microbiologic data were processed in the normal manual manner in the pharmacy to patients whose microbiological data were processed using the computer software. The study patients were matched by diagnosis related groups to patients in the control group. Additionally, the control group patients were adjusted for severity to make the groups more comparable. The study group had an average total standard cost of USD$13,294 per patient; the severity adjusted control group had an average total standard cost of USD$16,106 per patient, a decrease of USD$2,812 per patient in the study group. By using these severity adjusted d ata, the estimated variable cost savings annually from the improvement of interventions is USD$2,932,000 (2,000 inpatients for whom susceptibility testing is done multiplied by $1,466). If the list price of the CDSS (USD$44,500) was subtracted from the expected annual cost savings from the use of the program to improve interventions (USD$2,932,000), the resulting savings (USD$2,887,500) was still substantial in the first year. A 3-month RCT was designed to evaluate the effect of a CDSS for the management of antimicrobial utilization in a 648 -bed tertiary care academic hospital. 401 Antimicrobial utilization was managed by an existing antimicrobial management team using the system in the intervention arm and without the system in the control arm. The Web -based system was developed to alert the AMT of potentially inadequate antimicrobial therapy (a \" back -end\"` or postprescription review). Expenditures for antimicrobial drugs were USD$285,812 for the intervention group and USD$370,006 in the control arm, for a savings of USD$84,194 (23 percent) overall or $37.64 per patient . 46 An antiinfective decision support tool, designed specifically for a pediatric population, was introduced in a 26- bed ICU in an academic hospital.469 During the 6-month period before CDSS installation, all patient care orders from the physicians were handwritten. The study found no difference in hospital costs in the period before CDSS installation (USD$28,257.67) compared with the time after CDSS installation (USD$25,032.11) or in antiinfective costs per patient (USD$274.79 in the control group compared with USD$289.60 in the intervention group). An evaluation of a CDSS on appropriate antibiotic treatment used a cohort study followed by a multicentre, cluster RCT. 399 The cohort study compared t he advice of the CDSS with physician performance with respect to appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment and costs. The RCT compared hospital wards using the CDSS compared with antibiotic monitoring without the CDSS . In the cohort study, all cost compon ents, except those related to expected adverse events, were significantly lower for the treatments suggested by the CDSS compared with those used by physicians . Total antibiotic costs were \u20ac289 lower per patient for CDSS, a relative decrease of 48 percent . In the RCT, the use of the CDSS resulted in significantly lower antibiotic costs in intervention versus control wards, the difference originating from lower ecological costs in intervention wards in Israel and Italy. Direct antibiotic costs, as well as co sts incurred by observed adverse events, were similar. A Canadian study in an orthopedic institution assessed the safety and potential cost savings of a computerized, laboratory-based program (i.e., CPOE and CDSS) to manage inpatient warfarin therapy after major joint arthroplasty. 685 The authors estimated that the potential savings per patient of CAD$5.50 per day was due to a reduction in nursing time, for a total annual figure of CAD$55,836. It is important to note that the cost estimates and potential cost savings are speculative and are meant to be illustrative and not conclusive in nature. A computerized order set within an CPOE was designed to manage pediatric inpatients with asthma. 446 A before -after study of the system found no significant difference in the total inpatient costs among the groups before and after intervention. The hospital charges were USD$3,567 and USD$3,759, while the pharmacy charges were USD$373 and USD$429 in the groups before and after intervention, respectively. The costs associ ated with the implementation of a CPOE and CDSS system over 10 years (1993 to 2002) were measured in a 720- adult bed, tertiary care academic hospital. 686 Using data on the reductions in items such as ADEs, drug costs, and laboratory test usage, it was esti mated that the system saved the hospital USD$28.5 million over the 10- year period, even after including the capital and operational costs of USD$11.8 million. The authors stated that it took over 5 years to realize a net benefit and over 7 years to realize an operating budget benefit. Chertow et al. 468 studied the effect of adding a CDSS to an existing CPOE for prescribing drugs to patients with renal insufficiency in a hospital setting. The authors measured the difference between the intervention and contr ol groups in hospital and pharmacy costs and found no differences between the groups (USD$4,881 compared with USD$4,968 in total costs for the intervention and the control groups, respectively). An evaluation of the introduction of a CPOE and eMAR system on the delivery of health care in an academic health system was done using a before- after design. 581 Based on total costs per admission, no significant difference was seen in any of the U.S. hospitals in the system. A cost analysis of the implementation of an expensive CPOE ( i.e., total capital cost of implementation was USD$2.9 million and operating costs were USD$2.3 million) in the management of surgical patients in an academic, multispecialty hospital was done by Stone et al. 419 Based on the data from 6 months before and 6 months after the intervention, a 47 redistribution of workload was found. The personnel changes resulted in a savings of USD$445,500. The authors also noted that because of considerable gains in efficiencies (e.g., time necessary to have o rders accessible to nursing, radiology, and laboratory), this implementation would likely result in long -term cost savings and improved quality of care. An RCT done in 1993 assessed the effects of a network of microcomputer workstations for writing all inp atient orders (i.e., CPOE) on health care resource utilization. 687 The overall aim of the CPOE was to encourage cost -effective ordering and to reduce costs. Using the costs associated with inpatient charges (i.e., bed, tests, and drugs), it was determined that total charges per admission were significantly less (USD$887) for the intervention teams than for the control teams, with similar differences in all types of charges. The authors claim that if these effects were extrapolated to all medicine service ad missions at that hospital, the projected savings in charges per year would be $3 million in 1993 U.S. dollars. It was noted that the workstation network hardware costs were approximately USD$20,000 per ward, with additional costs for installation and maintenance. In two separate RCTs, Tierney et al. evaluated the effect of a CDSS that provided guidelines for the treatment of patients with ischemic heart disease or chronic heart failure 519 and patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.518 In both studies, care recommendations were displayed electronically to either physicians, pharmacists, or both physicians and pharmacists , compared with no care recommendations. In the heart disease study, the patients in the group receiving only the phys ician intervention had significantly elevated total health care charges (physician only: USD$6,302, compared with pharmacist only: USD$7,387, pharmacist: USD$7,639, compared with control: USD$7,025). In the asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease study, the authors found no difference in total costs (i.e., total inpatient and outpatient charges) across groups (physician only: USD$8,006, compared with pharmacist only: USD$5,333, pharmacist: USD$5,652, compared with control: USD$5,800). A recent publication by Pointek and colleagues 688 measured the impact of an ADE alert system on cost and quality outcomes in seven community hospitals within a health network. The ADE alerts were triggered in real time , which enabled immediate pharmacy intervention. The results showed a statistically significant decrease in average pharmacy department costs per patient ( USD$867 versus USD$826, p < 0.001) from before to after implementation. In contrast, the external con trol group had a significant increase in pharmacy department costs ( USD$734 versus USD$797, p = 0.029). Drug costs decreased significantly from baseline ( USD$360 versus USD$337, p < 0.001) in the study group. Conversely, there were significant increases in drug costs in the external control group ( USD$401 versus USD$429, p = 0.029). The authors applied the observed percentage of cost decrease from baseline exhibited by the study group to both the internal and external control groups' results and found that this yielded a combined pharmacy department cost savings estimate in excess of USD$11 million. It was noted that these savings coincided with only modest quality improvements in projected mortality rates and length of stay. An important limitation in this study is that it did not compare ADE rates before and after implementation of the system. Community. McMullin and colleagues 689,690 published two papers that evaluated the impact of a CDSS on prescription costs on a range of medications used in primary ca re. The first study was a retrospective cohort study using pharmacy claims data, which found that the average cost per new and refilled prescriptions was USD$4.99 lower in the intervention group, with the 6-month 48 savings being USD$3,450 per clinician. A 6-month extension of this study showed a 12-month savings on new prescriptions of USD$109,897. A cluster, unblinded, pragmatic (i.e., real world) RCT was conducted in a routine clinical setting, to assess the cost and effectiveness of a CDSS based on recomm endations of the European Society of Cardiology and other societies for hypercholesterolemia management in comparison with usual care for patients with hypercholesterolaemia. 528 The total direct costs of hypercholesterolaemia management (i.e. , physician visits, laboratory analyses, and the lipid- lowering drugs prescribed) for the intervention and control groups were calculated. The impa ct on total costs was markedly different in the two groups: \u20ac264,658 in the usual care group and \u20ac170,061 in the intervention group. Ornstein et al. 691 set out to measure the impact of displaying prescription cost information in a computer -based patient record system at the time of prescribing on reducing drug costs by family physicians. When compared with a 6-month period where cost information was not displayed, it was concluded that no impact was found on overall drug costs to patients that could be related to the intervention. The mean cost per prescription in the control period was USD$21.83, and in the intervention period was USD$22.03. Weingart et al. 692 designed an empirical study to understand the potential benefits of medication safety alerts gener ated by an e -Prescribing system in ambulatory care. Using a modified Delphi technique and data on 1.8 million prescriptions, the authors estimated that e-Prescribing alerts possibly averted 133 to 846 ADEs. These alerts could have avoided health care resource utilization in a number of areas (e.g. , hospitalizations, emergency room visits), for a total savings to the system of USD$141,012 to USD$1,012,386. An expert panel reviewed a sample of common drug interaction alerts, estimating the likelihood and seve rity of ADEs associated with each alert, the likely injury to the patient and the health care resource utilization required to address each ADE. The analysis estimated that the cost savings due to the e-Prescribing by using third -party -payer and publically available information was USD$402,619 (inter quartile range [IQR] $141,012-$1,012,386) with an average cost savings per clinician of USD$173 (IQR $61-$436). Community and hospital. One group of researchers developed a CDSS that used the clinical informat ion contained in administration claims data from physicians, hospitals, pharmacies, and laboratories to identify common errors in care and departures from widely accepted clinical guidelines. 620 This differs from the other CDSSs discussed in this section, in that the CDSS was not deployed within a hospital setting or within an integrated delivery system in which EHR systems provided the backbone of clinical information. The authors conducted a 12-month RCT to test the hypothesis that the claims -driven CDSS could increase compliance with evidence- based practices and effect improvements in patient outcomes as measured by decreased hospitalization and attendant cost. The sentinel system was designed as a rule- based artificial intelligence engine combined with a n automatic message generator that conveys clinical recommendations and supporting literature to treating physicians. Nine hundred and eight clinical recommendations were issued to the intervention group. Among those in both groups who triggered recommendations, there were 19 percent fewer hospital admissions in the intervention group compared with the control group (p < 0.001). Charges among those whose recommendations were communicated were USD $77.91 per member per month lower and paid claims were USD$68.08 per member per month lower than among controls compared with the baseline values ( p = 0.003 for both). According to the paper, the intervention cost USD$1.00 per 49 member per month to deploy and was associated with lower paid claims of USD$8.07 per member per month in the intervention group compared with controls, suggesting an eightfold return on investment from the payer perspective. However, it is important to note that this study was not intended as a formal cost- effectiveness analysis or cost savings analysis in that they did not directly measure costs at the patient or caregiver level, nor did they consider noneconomic costs or benefits. An extension of this analysis was published 3 years later. 504 This study used data from two additional years to analyze the effect of the intervention on resource utilization. This evaluation showed that the intervention reduced the average total charges (i.e., billing, pharmacy, and laboratory data) in the study group by USD$24.77 per member per month compared with the group without the CDSS. Economics Summary Most of the studies (84 percent) reviewed that evaluated the economics of MMIT would not be considered full economic evaluations. Full economic evaluation studies measure the cost per successful patient outcome over time, whereas cost analyses measure only the costs of the alternatives examined. Cost analyses can provide useful information on 'upfront' costs compared with 'downstream' cost avoidance but an ideal economic evaluation would explicitly measure all direct health care costs (e.g., capital costs, health professional 's time) and direct nonhealth care costs (e.g. , home care services, transportation), as well as indirect costs (e.g., productivity gains or losses related to illness or death by the patients an d caregivers) that could be affected by the intervention of interest. It is important to be aware that the greatest costs of these health ITs are associated with the purchase of new software (capital outlay) to add to preexisting EMR systems, as well as im plementation costs (e.g., management, clinical team involvement, training costs, maintenance costs), which were not included in the cost side of the economic evaluation in most studies. Additionally, the full enumeration of the total costs needs to be synthesized with the consequences or outcomes of the intervention (i.e., cost- effectiveness analysis, cost -utility analysis, and cost-benefit analysis). The effectiveness of any given system is dependent on the system 's design, implementation, the users of the system, and the setting into which the system is being introduced. Adoption of newer technologies needs to be based on formal evaluation of whether the additional health benefit (effectiveness) is worth the additional cost. Given the tension between the clinical benefits of integrated CPOE and CDSS systems and the high upfront costs, decisionmakers deciding whether to implement them need to better understand how and when financial benefits of such systems accrue (e.g., short-term compared with long- term benefits). These types of analyses are important for well -informed decisionmaking. In summary, a few of the studies reviewed found that health IT interventions may offer cost advantages despite their increased acquisition costs compared with care provided wi thout the health IT . However, given the uncertainty that surrounds the cost and outcomes data, and limited study designs available in the literature, it is difficult to reach any definitive conclusion as to whether the additional costs and benefits represent value for money. It is necessary that sophisticated concurrent prospective economic evaluations be conducted in the real world to address whether health IT interventions in the medication management process are actually cost - effective. 50 Clinical Outcomes Summary of the Findings Among the clinical outcomes assessed in 76 articles (Table 14), 54 percent reported significant benefits (Table 15). Studies that used monitoring approaches to identify and intervene with patients with actual problems (e.g., exces sive blood pressure, increase in creatinine after being placed on a nephrotoxic drug) or needed care (e.g., hemoglobin A 1c monitoring) appear to be more effective than CDSS approaches that identify theoretical problems (potential for adverse drug events). The effectiveness of monitoring interventions in ambulatory care is enhanced (or only effective) if patients are also sent reminders and decision support recommendations. Highly targeted interventions, focused on specific problems that provide problem- related specific interventions appear to be more effective than a more diffusely focused CDSS integrated with a CPOE system (e.g., nonpatient-specific guidelines for cardiovascular risk reduction). Many studies have evaluated CDSS tools for improving the effectiveness of anticoagulants (proportion of days in therapeutic anticoagulant range) and improving the choice, route, duration of antibiotics, and reducing ADEs related to antibiotic use and most are successful. Studies that have been successful in improving patient outcomes target high risk and vulnerable populations who have poor disease control, 515,610,624,693 lack sufficient access to health care providers to manage their condition,408 or subpopulations with sufficient economic resources to respond to the CDSS intervention.694 While high risk groups have the potential to show the greatest benefits of IT, one study, which implemented a CPOE (prescribing, dispensing, and order communication system) in a children 's hospital, reported substantial harm\u2014a 270 pe rcent relative increase in mortality after CPOE was implemented (2.8 percent vs. 6.6 percent unadjusted, adjusted OR 3.81, 95 percent CI 1.94 to 5.55). 15 This before -after study and its methods have been debated17 and its conclusions contested. However, the increase in mortality they found provides important lessons about CPOE implementation , particularly in settings which include high -risk patients. Critically ill patients are most likely to benefit from IT but also most likely to be affected by dysfunctio nal technology and implementation strategies because delays in definitive treatment can increase the risk of mortality. As other groups have shown that CPOE systems either have no effect or a nonsignificant reduction in mortality in children' s hospitals, 16 the disparity in findings likely relates to the extent to which both the technologies and implementation strategies have disrupted or delayed critical activities in the clinical setting, and demanded additional time for order -entry from clinical staff. Two studies that implemented computerized decision support CDSS drug use increased mortality , 15 and length of stay.18 Both studies lacked sufficient power to conduct a valid assessment. 51 Table 14.

RCT Randomized controlled trial Strengths and Limitations of the Evidence Overall, 28 of 76 (37 percent) studies assessing clinical endpoints were RCTs, and the mean quality rating was 4.4 out of 9 (range two to seven).401-403,407,408,515,518-520,524,526\u00ad 528,537,541,543,610,620,624,630,634,637,695-700 Low ratings are because most RCTs of health IT cannot be blinded, and the majority are cluster RCTs, where equivalence in the distribution of measured and unmeasured confounders (clinician and patient characteristics) cannot be assured. Sta tistical 52 adjustment for differences in the intervention and control groups has not been conventionally advocated even though it is likely required for unbiased comparisons. The remaining studies were cohort, case control or observational; the majority were before- after studies or variants of this approach. Typically, in the before-after variant design, three time periods were assessed. P reintervention outcomes were compared with outcomes evaluated at two time periods of after implementation intervention . These comparisons sought to assess changes in care and the care processes associated with the interventions that were subsequently introduced. Only one study was a true time- series. 482 In most of the before-after studies, no adjustment was done for differen ces in patient mix or cointerventions in the time periods with and without the intervention. Unless a systematic trend for changes in the patient population mix was shown, this problem may have minimal effect on the reported results. The only exception is with length of stay, where well-documented trends in reductions in length of stay due to many factors unrelated to IT interventions are shown. For these outcomes, the positive benefits in reductions of length of stay shown in nine of 15 studies that measur ed this outcome are likely overestimated. While the absence of a contemporaneous comparable control group is a problem with all before -after studies, the creation of control groups by comparing intervention patients to those that do not participate, or do not have a problem, to those that do is fundamentally far more likely to introduce major bias in the comparison (e.g., comparing patients with alerts to no alerts, 18 pharmacists volunteering to provide the intervention compared with those that do not volunteer,694 and other similar problems642,701). The direction of the bias will depend on the study. Volunteers in any study tend to have better outcomes than nonvolunteers, and selecting patients with problems compared with those that do not will ensure that at least both will regress to the mean \u2014people with problems get better and those with no problems get worse, resulting in an overestimation of the effect of most interventions. Many of the observational studies suffered from selecting an outcome that was distantly or only marginally related to the intervention. Almost all of the studies that measured quality -of\u00ad life, length of stay, and all cause ADEs were examples of this problem. Gurwitz and colleagues 697 were able to show that only one-third of ADEs could have been prevented by the CDSS alerts that were provided. Moreover, in a substantial proportion of negative studies, minimal adoption was evident. The clinicians failed to adjust therapy or treatment to match the recommendations, and thus it was not surprising to find that the interventions had no effect on outcomes. Finally, the rate of some outcomes such as readmission, mortality, and nosocomial infections were too low to detect clinically meaningful differences if they had existed . General Study Cha racteristics A total of 76 studies assessed improvements in clinical endpoints or reduction in adverse events (Appendix the phases that were well-studied with respect to clinical outcomes (95 percent of all studies). Forty included the monitoring phase, only two evaluated clinical outcomes associated with order communication,15,581 three studied drug administering581,630,693 and one each looked at dispensing,15 reconciliation,695 and a cell phone- based diabetes management program for educational purposes.537 A total of 85 different endpoints were assessed for different aspects of MMIT (Table 14). 53 Outcomes Prescribing . Clinical outcomes have always been the most important and the most difficult to measure and study in health IT applications. The studies must be done in clinical settings which are complex and nonstandard. The health IT must be held constant to fit the traditional model of clinical trials and this does not reflect the reality of clinical practice and technology use. It is also difficult to ascertain if a technology can affect clinical outcomes \u2014drugs, surgeries, and other similar interventions are easier to tie to outcomes. The health IT is a \"long distance \" from actual clinical care with many steps and factors involved and the latency between expo sure to the health IT and outcome. Many studies have been done on the effect of health IT on prescribing. Consequently, many systematic reviews have addressed the effects of these applications on clinical outcomes. Two Cochrane reviews have been done. One addresses onscreen point- of-care computer reminders on outcomes of clinical importance. The review by Shojania and colleagues 715 found some clinical improvements across studies with blood pressure ( being reduced by a mean of 1.0 mmHg). Durieux and colleagues716 showed small improvements in time to therapeutic stabilization, risk of toxic drug levels and length of hospital stay (mean decrease of 0.4 days). Another eight reviews show similar findings for clinical outcomes: more changes in process and some lim ited and rather small improvements in clinical outcomes: alerts and prompts to improve prescribing behaviors (five studies, three showed statistically significant improvements), 717 CDSSs to improve prescribing in older adults (two studies, mixed outcomes),718 CDSSs on medication safety (five CPOE and seven CDSS of which three did not show improvements),719 e-Prescribing in hospitals (23 of 25 studies showed medication error reduction and four of seven with reduced ADEs of 35 percent to 98 percent), 720 CPOE in pediatric and ICUs (12 studies of proven error reduction but no effect on clinical outcomes),721 CPOE in neonatal ICUs (reductions in errors but little if any effect on clinical outcomes),722 outpatient CPOE (five studies of medication safety of which one showed reductions),723 and CPOE with CDSS to reduce ADEs in hospitals and ambulatory settings (10 studies: five showed improvements, four showed trends and one was not significant). 724 Prescribing\u2014Strengths and Limitations of the Evidence The evidence in this section is weak although many RCTs exist (Table 14). Numbers of participants in the trials are often small, studies are short term, and are often done by those who have developed and implemented systems. To support the potential for bias in assess ment of a health IT by its developers, Garg and colleagues 725 completed a large and well -done systematic review of CDSSs. Their review evaluated RCTs of CDSSs for improving practitioner performance and patient outcomes. Using the data on practitioner performance, they found that if the trialists evaluated their own CDSS the trials were successful in 51 of 69 studies (74 percent). If the trialists were independent of the system being evaluated (i.e., not the developers), only five of 18 trials were positive (28 percent). The odds ratio (OR) adjusted for trial quality for a successful trial designed to improve practitioner performances if the evaluator was the developer was 6.6 (95 percent CI 1.7 to 26.7). The only other predictor of success besides the evalua tor being the developer, in improving provider performance was if the users of the CDSSs were prompted to use the system automatically (adjusted OR 2.8, CI 1.2 to 7.1). It is difficult, however, to separate out developer bias from system effectiveness as t hey are confounded. 54 Commercial systems often do not have the resources to show changes in clinical outcomes and therefore this proof of clinical effectiveness is not completed. Twenty -one RCTs studied the prescribing phase.401-403,407,408,515,518 cohort or case-control studies,501,545,701,702,709,710,712 and 27 observational studies 16,18,423,425,430,437,446,452,453,455,459,467,468,475,482,489,550,555,631,683,688,693,703,704,706,708,714 also looked at the prescribing phase and reported clinical outcomes. Only the RCTs will be discussed below because of their strength of evidence. Four studies were done in the late 1990s.407,527,630,699 All of the rest were done after 2000. Prescribing\u2014General Study Characteristics Participants . Because these studies evaluated clinical outcomes, all assessed patients and their caregivers. All RCTs used cluster randomization (clinicians or care units) to avoid problems of contamination (where the same caregiver is as ked to use decision-support for a random half of patients but not the remainder). Location. One study was done in a long- term care center, 697 one was set in homes,630 and five were set in hospitals .401-403,407,637 All of the others were done in ambulator y care settings. Drugs and diseases. Most studies evaluated specific diseases or conditions: asthma,519 high cholesterol levels,515,528,699 hospitalized patients at risk of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism,519 depression,520 infections in hospitalize d patients,403 high blood pressure,526,699 and HIV.527 Technology. All studies involved CDSS. Six also included CPOE.402,407,519,527,697,699 A PDA was also featured in the home- based article.630 Prescribing\u2014Clinical Outcomes Please also see the section on CDSS ( KQ7: RCTs of CDSS) for additional description of clinical outcomes. As seen in the systematic reviews, fewer articles address clinical outcomes than address process or other outcomes such as satisfaction and attitudes. Many of the studies that did evaluate clinical outcomes also did not find the expected improvements. Adverse drug events. Gurwitz and colleagues 697 found that the rate of ADEs and preventable ADEs were not decreased with implementation of a CDSS and CPOE system in a long- term care setting. Disease related outcomes. A number of studies looked at disease outcomes. Kucher and colleagues 402 found that fewer patients at risk for venous thromboembolism were diagnosed with either deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism at 90 days with the introduction of CDSS and CPOE in an academic hospital. Zanetti and colleagues403 studied prophylactic antibiotics in prolonged cardiac surgery. This RCT found similar rates of infection in both study groups. Of note, both control and intervention groups reduced their rates of infection. Rollman and colleagues 520 addressed identification of depression in adult ambulatory care and found that the CDSS did not affect the rates of depression in the control or intervention groups in an RCT. Both g roups improved their depression scores over time to the same extent. 55 Hospital stay. Three RCTs on prescribing looked at hospital length of stays. One RCT did not find differences in quality- of-life scores, hospitalizations, emergency department visits , or heart failure exacerbations.519 Safran and colleagues,527 in another RCT of CPOE and CDSS for clinic patients in an academic setting, did find a lower hospitalization rate for intervention (reminders) group (44 percent vs. 35 percent, RRR 26 percent, p = 0.04). Hospital length of stay was not different in the RCT by Overhage and colleagues 407 of CDSS and CPOE (eight days for both groups), nor in the study by McGregor and colleagues.401 Physiological measures. Eleven RCT studies of the prescribing phase addressed physiological outcomes: hypertension in two articles and both showed no difference,526,699 high cholesterol with some positive findings in one541 but not the other four515,524,528,543 and two with reductions in blood glucose levels.537,630 A study on depression found no change in patient depression rating scores.520 One study with asthma patients found improved lung function and airway hyperresponsiveness.408 Order c ommunication. Order communication issues seemed to be at the heart of this before- after study of a children 's hospital by Han and colleagues15 which showed increases in mortality after introduction of CPOE and CDSS integrated within a hospital information system. This is an important study and has garnered much discussion in the literature of its methods and findings with respect to the increase in mortality (2.8 percent vs. 6.6 percent unadjusted, adjusted OR 3.81, 95 percent CI 1.94 to 5.55). Length of stay showed improvement in one hospital, but not another in a study of CPOE implement ation by Mekjjan and colleagues. 581 Dispensing and administering. The study by Han and colleagues15 evaluated dispensing; while three studies addressed administering.581,630,693 One study was an integrated system in the Ohio State University Health System (James Cancer Center and three other tertiary care hospitals). The hospital information system included laboratory, imaging, dietary, eMAR , and CPOE as well as all EMR capabilities. They found a reduced length of stay for patients with heart disease (14 percent) and transplant patients (15 percent) but not for those with cardiothoracic surgery or those in the cancer center. 581 Holdsworth et al.693 found significant reductions in ADEs following the implementation of a CPOE system in a pediatric population. The third administration study was a cross -over RCT of diabetic patients using a hand- held insulin regimen optimizer, which showed improvements in blood glucose levels when patients received advice through the device. 630 Monitoring. Most of the prescribi ng interventions were integrated with hospital clinical information systems or EMR systems. This provided the opportunity to use existing structured electronic information to assist clinicians in identifying patients who needed a change in their treatment plan. The system made recommendations that suited the particular patient profile. Starting with monitoring of treatment choices for antimicrobial therapy in relation to antibiotic choice, a wide range of clinically useful monitoring and prescription and tr eatment recommendation options have been studied including those aimed at improving chronic disease management (e.g., Asthma -Critic), providing early detection of adverse events (e.g., creatinine monitoring for nephrotoxic effects), and glycemic and coagulation monitoring to predict and recommend optimal dose changes. Of the 21 RCTs that included the monitoring phases, 15 were 56 set in the prescribing phase. The issues related to RCTs and observational studies have been addressed in the general overview of studies in this area. Reconciliation. One RCT at two academic hospitals studied a computerized reconciliation program that was integrated into a CPOE system and that required a process redesign.695 They found a reduction in unintentional discrepancies between preadmission medication and admission or discharge medication that had potential for harm (1.44 vs. 1.05 potential ADEs per patient, absolute risk reduction 0.72, 95 percent CI 0.52 to 0.99). Education. In another RCT, Grant and colleagues 610 studied a PHR system for patients with diabetes that was integrated into a fully functioning EMR (laboratory, imaging, CDSS, and pharmacy). Patient education was a major, but not the only, component of the PHR. No change was noted for hemoglobin A 1c levels, although it is important to note that the patients were fairly well-controlled at baseline (7.1 percent vs. 7.2 percent, p = 0.45). Qualitative Studies Summary of Findings Fifty -three articles that were complete or partially qualitative studies were identified that dealt broadly with MMIT (Appendix C, Evidence Table 10).20,439,503,540,547,597,629,632,633,635,652,666,671,674,726 -764 No qualitative studies were identified that directly addressed the effect of an MMIT system on intermediate health care outcomes for any phase of the medication management continuum (prescribing, order communication, dispensing, administering and monitoring, as well as reconciliation, education, and adherence). Strengths and Limitations of Evidence The primary limitation of synthesizing qualitative studies to gain a deeper insight into the effect of MMIT applications in improving other intermediate health care outcomes within and across the medication management continuum is that no qualitative studies are available that directly addres s this question. Most of the qualitative studies identified examine the expectations or experiences of implementing an MMIT system on the process (but not the outcomes) of medication prescribing. These studies identify a large number of benefits to the hea lth care delivery processes as well as a large number of barriers to uptake and use of the various systems studied. The strengths of the amalgam of evidence are that similar themes were identified across studies, health care settings were assessed by more than one study, studies were carried out in settings across the care continuum, study participants included physicians, pharmacists, nurses, other health care providers as well as some administrative management personnel, and multiple different types of qu alitative data collection approaches including interviews, focus groups, observations, and document reviews were used across the set of studies evaluated. A small number of qualitative studies were available that examined MMIT systems on the processes of care for other phases of the medication management continuum. MMIT is tremendously complicated and at the same time undeniably valuable. Strong and varied evaluations are vital and we have many evaluations of MMIT already. These evaluations show important changes to process. Clinical outcomes are more often mixed or nonexistent. We also see, in our evaluation studies, unintended consequences of MMIT and surprising results 57 such as the increased mortality in a children 's hospital after a poor implementation o f a set of MMIT applications.15 Because of these challenges in our results of quantitative studies, we include a fuller discussion of some of the qualitative studies in MMIT. These qualitative studies hold the promise of understanding more richly how MMIT is and should be used. The following paragraphs provide descriptions of some of the more important qualitative studies and their findings. Prescribing and ordering. No qualitative studies were identified that directly addressed the effect of an MMIT system on intermediate health care outcomes . However, many qualitative studies provided evidence and examined positive and negative expectations and experiences of how an MMIT system designed to improve prescribing of medications could affect medication errors and medication safety, 20,439,503,547,629,632,652,666,676,726,727,729 -731,733 -736,738 -740,742,745,746,748,749,751 \u00ad 753,755,759,761 -767 which could be considered as precursors to intermediate health care outcomes. Before system implementation. Positive and negative expectations of an MMIT system designed to improve prescribing and ordering of medications were identified by physicians and other health care providers or staff in hospital or ambulatory clinic staff prior to system implementation. Some positive expectations were that an MMIT would reduce medication errors, 727,733 increase pharmacological knowledge available,740 provide educational benefits,726,727 improve patient confidentiality,727 be flexible (e.g., prescribing from any location),666,729 allow for customization or tailoring to the individual prescriber or the patient (e.g., patient reminders), allow switching the system on and off, 729,733 be concise,729,733 provide access to other areas of a medical chart,740 save time,740 and incorporate valuable allergy, dosing, and interaction alerts.745,746 Pharmacists felt that MMIT would facilitate new collaborations among physicians, pharmacists, and nurses.746 One group of physician study participants had a positive attitude towards implementation of a CDSS, provided that they had some control over the system.729 Many groups studied could be described as hopeful but cautious727,729,733,740,748 while others, mainly physicians (although they were who was studied most often), were skeptical.726,735,761,765 Hospital pharmacists felt that MMIT would allow them to spend more time with patients and improve collaborative working relationships with physicians and nurses. 746 Only one study was identified that used qualitative methods to solicit patient views before implementation of an MMIT system focused on improving prescribing.748 Patients on a general surgery ward were interviewed before implementation of an e-Prescribing and an eMAR system. Their attitudes about the current paper- based system were generally positive and many had a mistrust of computer systems in general. However, they anticipated advantages of the e-Prescribing and eMAR system in terms of time, improving accuracy and efficiency, and decreasing mistakes. Patients identified that an electronic system may be an advantage for staff when the first language is not English. Despite the willingness of many of the participants to use a new MMIT system designed to improve prescribing of medications including CPOE, some negative expectations were that the MMIT system would impair existing interactions and relationships among health care providers and between physicians and patients (e.g., diminishing patient contact because they need to leave the consulting room to enter the prescriptions), 726,727,729,740,762 the ability to cope with the new system,726 implementation would be onerous,726 the costs of the system,727 especially to the health profession including the time efficiency and workload redistribution,735 the technical 58 challenges such as data entry time, software compatibility and updating,727,729 problems with availability or level of technical support,727,735 social and cultural barriers,727 deskilling of staff (people becoming dependent on the system for routine decisionmaking without understanding the background, reasons, or consequences of the decision made by the MMIT),726 need for more security,726 errors in prescribing such as decisionmaking errors,727 transcription errors,727 or overconfidence errors,727 that the system would not remove medication errors but could even create new errors,735 obscured responsibilities,729 loss of own reasoning and clinical autonomy,729 ensuring that the patient and not the computer would have the leading role in the encounter,729 difficulty with knowledge management (e.g., too much information or erroneous information\u2014 'garbage in- garbage out '), 729,740 including prescribing alerts that were redundant or repetitive, of low priority, or difficult to interpret,739 resistance towards change,729 computer shortages,740 and altering workflow routines.740 Some underlying key needs for an MMIT system designed to improve prescribing of medications would be that the system would not diminish the patient provider relationship, 726,727,729,740 be easy to use,733 flexible, concise, a nd customizable,729,733 clinically and technically trustworthy, reliable, and fast,729,733 integrated into other relevant systems,740 workflow needs to be maximized including development of new workflows726,727,739,735,740 and there be enough time and reso urces available to support implementation.726,727,735,740 A Delphi survey was done in the United Kingdom to identify and reach consensus on the key clinical issues involving patient safety for which general practitioners in primary care might benefit from MMIT support, particularly in relation to medicines management. The key themes that emerged were importance of computerized alerts, need to minimize spurious alerts making it difficult to override critically important alerts, having audit trails of such ov errides, support for safe repeat prescribing, effective computer -user interface, importance of call and recall, and need for safety reports. User interface, repeat prescribing, need to be able to run safety reports, and other safety issues were also agreed upon. 738 After system implementation. The reporting of how MMIT systems designed to improve prescribing of medications improved intermediate health outcomes were also sparse among the qualitative studies . Drug alerts, including drug interaction alerts, were stated to be beneficial to improve patient safety. 547,632,666,767 E-Prescribing triggered a variety of clinician behaviors (other than terminating or changing a prescription) that may improve patient safety.632 One study identified 22 previously unexplored medication error sources users reported to be facilitated by CPOE which would likely have a detrimental effect on health outcomes. 752 These were grouped as (1) information errors generated by fragmentation of data and failure to integrate the hospital' s several computer and information systems, and (2) human- machine interface flaws reflecting machine rules that do not correspond to work organization or usual behaviors such as selecting the wrong patient because a list is alphabetical versus by team or floor, or unclear log on and log off procedures or processes so that the next person does work using the previous person' s permissions. During or after system implementation, physicians, nurses, and other health care providers or staff in hospital or amb ulatory clinic found that health IT improved safety alerts, 666 provided useful drug alerts including drug interaction alerts, which appeared even if a different prescriber had ordered some of the drugs, 547 allowed physicians to prescribe electronically fro m everywhere in the hospital, improved on features of a previous paper- based system,666 were user 59 friendly and allowed benefits when the system was integrated,751 and was designed to take into account diverse cultures.751 Physicians in one study felt that an electronic CPOE system improved the quality of care for patients because they got faster access to information and more up- to-date information, they received automatic reminders , and they could speed up care because knowing what had already been done would allow them to reduce the number of duplicate procedures carried out.761 The multiple checks within the system also could lead to improved patient safety.761 Better communication among physicians and structured reports for patients (e.g., discharge sum maries) were also felt to improve quality of care.761 In another study, physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners felt that a computerized patient record system-based pain CDSS played a very positive role in assisting them with patient car e. They reported that this was because data were more legible, could be accessed remotely, and reminders provided helpful decision support. However, they also reported that at the same time as being helpful, the reminder system was considered time consuming, redundant, and the speed of the system slow. 763 Medical trainees also reported that an MMIT system provided valuable educational content such as geriatrics pharmacology review and nonpharmacologic treatment options. 731 MMIT systems designed to improve prescribing of medications also generated some challenges that could be categorized as challenges: (1) with the computer system and software, (2) of the interaction between the MMIT system and the health care provider working with the system, (3) of the effects of the system on the collaborative working relationships of the health care team, and (4) of the MMIT working within the local context and environment. Computer system and software challenges include difficulties with user rights, inflexibilities, an d displacements with the use of CPOE, 734,764 CPOE design failures, especially a faulty computer interface, lack of connection with other parallel systems, inadequacy of decision-support, and human errors occurring in interactions with the computer, 503,727, 759,761,767 difficulties with the text presentation (e.g., too much information presented, data density), too many decisions that needed to be made at one time, unappealing color scheme and lack of notation, caution or problems with a prescription, 652,761,767 interface problems,750,755 content problems,755 and increased data entry time.727 Challenges generated from the interaction of the MMIT system and the health care provider working within the system included the need to take up new tasks and increased demands on the clinicians with the CPOE system), 734,764 maintaining complete lists of patients and their medications,632,736 poor recording of data within the record such as allergy information,632 propagation of errors if information was cut and pasted compared with creating new information and other mistakes, 755,761 transcription errors,727 getting patient- specific formulary data,736 encouragement to ignore interactions alerts as many were viewed as too trivial or unnecessary, which indicated that sensitivity and specificity required improvements, 547,632,753 initial difficulties with the technical components of the system,439,767 awkward prescription writing leading to workarounds,632 unfamiliarity with the disease codes in the system,751 difficulties with finding information in the chart because of multiple places where the information was stored,761 reducing clinical situation awareness,759 overconfidence,727 and increased workload.750 Challenges generated by the MMIT system that affected collaborative wor king relationships of the health care team included damaging the workflow, synchronization and feedback mechanisms between nurses and physicians, 666,676,750 altering the pace, sequencing, and dynamics 60 of clinical activities,750,759 and providing only partial support for the work activities of all types of clinical personnel.759 Challenges related to the MMIT working within the local context and environment included external implementation challenges (e.g., communication with pharmacists and vendor support),736 lack of computer resources,751 the need to keep their EHR systems up to date,751 poorly reflecting organizational policy and procedure,759,766 doctors' concerns that their views and opinions about the design and implementation of the new system had not been adequately addressed,764 high cost,727 social and cultural barriers,727 and problems with technical support.727 A number of studies related that participants felt it took longer to prepare a prescription using the MMIT system compared with conventional pen and paper.761,764,767 One study identified that physicians and nurses in an acute care setting found that CPOE did not meet naive and early expectations. 734 Some adverse effects of the CPOE system were noted. Attitudes towards MMIT systems in the early stages were mixed.768 Over time, and with experience of making the system work for them, attitudes changed to become more balanced and the potential benefits of the system become clearer to most. 439,676,761 Some physician participants felt the MMIT w as more efficient during consultation and led to better quality, while others were felt it took longer and took away from patient focus.751 Physician users tended to provide comments related to the culture of professional quality (feeling that the computer facilitated quality). Alternately, those physicians that chose not to use the system tended to provide comments that focused on human relations. For example, they reported on their relationships with their patients that they felt were detrimentally affected by computer use. 751 Some physicians felt that MMIT helped physicians become more cost conscious by suggesting therapies that were less costly. This cost savings however, only directly benefited insurers and not the clinicians, patients, or health care f acility. 751 Some physicians felt the MMIT systems improved their personal performance by allowing them to log on to the system from anywhere including home, while others felt this was an intrusion into their home life. 761,767 Basic formatting and organization of information such as information that was legible, could improve order accuracy, or all in one place was seen as a benefit to MMIT. 761 MMIT applications were also felt to improve interdisciplinary work by improving communication with colleagues,761 and having everyone reading from the same page.767 Alerts and reminders are important components of MMIT for prescribing. Important themes of these alerts or reminders in EMR systems included themes of efficiency, usefulness, information content, user interface, workflow, and training. 742,745 Effectiveness focused on the positive effect of alerts on allergy awareness and patient education.745 Efficiency related to ensuring that the alerts and reminders were efficient, useful, and did not waste time.742,745 Usefulness concerned whether the alerts were helpful and appropriate.742 Information content was concerned with accurate, comprehensive, timely, rich, and accessible information.742,745 The user interface was felt to be important for smooth and efficient work and provision of valuable information that was accurate and provided quick ly. 742,745 The value of e- Prescribing alerts was diminished by the quantity of irrelevant and inappropriate alerts.632 Workflow issues related to the information being available when and only when needed.742 The need for training to improve the use of alert was noted.745 Attitudes to evidence -based guidelines were also seen as an important factor as to how alerts would be taken up, with physicians preferring that alerts be severity-rated, that only substantial ones should appear, and that user interface design be enhanced. 745 The biggest surprise from a set of focus groups (reported in 2002) with a group of clinicians (physicians, physician assistants, and nurse 61 practitioners) was the considerable negative emotion associated with alerts and reminders (feelings of being criticized, embarrassment, guilt, frustration, annoyance, and anger).742 One study of a set of three successful and three unsuccessful CPOE implementations across six hospitals identified 14 facilitating factors and 14 barriers comparing successful and unsuccessful implementation. 20 More people from the successful hospitals group reported supportive administering and heads of medical sections, direct involvement of physicians, mandatory implementation, adequate training, and sufficient hardware facilitated success. In terms of barriers, only inadequate hardware and lack of ability to easily complete patient transfer and advance admission orders (medical records package) differentiated the successful compared with unsuccessful groups . Changes involved in instituting a physician CPOE system are system wide and involve individual as well as organizational factors. 20 One study was identified that determined how clinicians use information management strategies during adaptation to an established CPOE system. 749 User created strategies identified that information overload must be carefully managed and communication is vital and is often negatively affected by new systems. Only o ne study using qualitative methods to solicit patient views after implementation of an MMIT system that focused on improving prescribing was identified.748 Patients on a general survey ward were interviewed after implementation of an e- Prescribing and admi nistering system. Concerns were identified including loss of personal touch, not understanding the system, and perceived extra time needed if nursing staff had to check the drugs prescribed on the computer. 748 Despite the concerns raised, on balance the feedback provided by patients was that generally they did not have a strong opinion (assessment) either positively or negatively as to whether MMIT would impact the quality of medication prescribing compared with paper -based 748 process. MMIT also impacted t he professionalization of pharmacy. The effects of a health IT system that generated an e -Prescription on the professionalization of community pharmacists were improving the analytical capacity of the pharmacists and physicians, greater dissemination of therapeutics and professional knowledge, better integration of process tasks, increased process automation, elimination of intermediaries, facilitation of the interpretation of prescriptions, increased tracking capability, and greater informational capability improves relevance and meaningfulness of interaction and improves quality of information transmitted. 730 E-Prescribing has tremendous capacity to change and improve pharmacists ' professional work and interactions.730 One study showed that overly ambitious expectations sometime s lead to failed implementation.629 Order c ommunication . Seven qualitative studies specifically addressed the implementation of an MMIT system to affect the order communication and verification of prescriptions. 540,597,671,732,736, 746,752 None of these studies focused specifically on how MMIT affected intermediate health care outcomes. All of the studies addressed implementation issues. Nursing perspectives based on implementation of a BCMA system within the hospital setting found t hat an MMIT system was more time consuming but the nurses acknowledged that it produced a positive benefit because the extra time available was wisely spent to assure verification, generating an increased sense of safety for the patients, 671 or made improvements in the clarify of orders, organization of time their tasks, improved efficiency and standardization of documentation provided by templates, general improvement in emergency department processes, and decreased number of verbal orders and time searchi ng for charts. 597 One study identified 22 previously unexplored medication error sources that users reported to be facilitated by CPOE 62 including errors related to order communication and verification such as information errors generated by fragmentation of data and failure to integrate the hospital 's several computer and information systems.752 These findings were consistent with another study carried out in a long- term care setting where numerous workarounds associated with the implementation of an eMAR and medication safety practices in nursing homes, were identified related to the technology itself creating unintentional blocks including slow wireless speed and the need to print each order on a separate page. 732 Organizational processes such as the limite d resource of fax machines were also identified.732 In the ambulatory setting limited electronic connectivity of e -Prescribing systems to pharmacies or pharmaceutical benefits managers (who administrate pharmacy prescriptions) meant that despite one- way el ectronic (non-fax) communication of prescription information from the practice there was still conventional communication (e.g., fax) back from pharmacies for clarifications and renewals. 736 Pharmacist perspectives about a commercial e- Prescribing system revealed barriers to that systems ' ability to maintain complete lists of patients and their medications, use of CDSS, and getting patient- specific formulary data.736 Factors associated with these issues related to product limitations, external implementatio n challenges (e.g., communication with pharmacists and vendor support), and physician preferences on specific product features. 736 A system that appended alerts and comments to the bottom of e-Prescriptions and was designed to reduce pharmacy callbacks did not reduce the number of callbacks but did change the nature of the callbacks.540 Hospital pharmacy leaders with and without CPOE entry system experience all believed CPOE would improve patient safety through the allergy, dosing, and interaction alerts which they saw as valuable to medication management processes. 746 Some expressed concern that poor design or implementation could lead to increased errors.746 Most believed the system would lead to improved efficiencies facilitating more time spent with patients. 746 Most felt CPOE would improve working relationships with physicians and nurses by facilitating new collaborations.746 Medication dispensing and administering . Ten qualitative studies focused on evaluating health IT applications to improve medication dispensing and administering including studies of BCMA, 635,671,674,728,743,754,756 PDA,769 eMAR,732,754 CPOE,597 and automated medication dispensing.744 All of these studies focused on evaluation of the process of care delivery before or after implemen tation of the systems. Before implementation of a bar -code point- of-care eMAR system a group of pediatric nurses working in an American pediatric hospital provided qualitative responses to questions as part of a survey. 674 Themes derived from the survey done before implementation indicated that the nurses felt that medications would be given in a timely manner with less error, but may result in an increase in time with this increase in safety, along with more reported errors, but fewer errors in administering actual meds (near misses). The surveys collected after implementation indicated that the staff felt there were fewer medication errors with a smoother administering of medication. 674 Implementation of MMIT applications for medication dispensing and administering generated substantial number of nonIT workarounds.728,732 In one study done in a hospital setting, these workarounds were categorized into omission of process steps (seven workarounds), steps performed out of sequence (one workaround), and unauthorized process steps (seven workarounds). 728 Probable causes for these workarounds included technology, task, organizational, patient, and environmental related causes.728 A further study examined how nurses integrated BCMA and an eMAR system into everyda y clinical practice and found that the 63 implementation of new IT in the clinical setting can be disruptive to existing patterns of articulation work, or work that coordinates the activities of people across time and space.754 Another study of a system put in place in a long term care institution identified workarounds related to the technology itself and organizational processes.732 The workarounds occurred at new medication order entry, communication with the pharmacy, and administering.732 The technology introduced intentional blocks (safety features such as excessive dose blocking, dual documentation, and ADE monitoring) that led to workarounds related to the technology itself and organizational processes. 732 Organization process blocks leading to workarounds included the double checking of preparation and administration documents.732 Integrating BCMA systems within real- world clinical workflows requires critical attention to ensure that technology safety features are used as intended and that nonIT system s are designed to support this use.728,732 Nursing perspectives about a BCMA, eMAR system integrated with pharmacy, CPOE, and electronic charting in a hospital after implementation found that in terms of access, the nurses appreciated greater access to med ications and information (e.g., policies, guidelines, drug resources, patient files), but identified some delays in getting medications from the pharmacy. 671 Another study carried out in a hospital and long-term care setting found that nurses were surprise d that BCMA generated unanticipated side effects such as confusion created by automated removal of medications by BCMA, degraded coordination between nurses and physicians, and dropping activities such as not scanning wristbands or medications to reduce workload during busy periods. 743 One study conducted interviews with nurses before and after the implementation of a BCMA. Before implementation most nurses expected the system to improve patient safety and after BCMA implementation most of the nurses report ed that they felt BCMA improved safety although a number of concerns remained about the cumbersome and technical aspects of the system itself. 756 After an automated medication dispensing system was installed interviews with all workers and managers who were affected (nurses, pharmacy managers, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, hospital administrators, and patient care managers) resulted in themes of distrust, resistance, miscommunication, unrealistic expectations (skepticism that it reduced medication errors), speed and scale of implementation, concurrent changes, inadequate support, and social factors. 744 Nursing perspectives were mostly positive on the use of a mobile PDA with a bar\u00ad code reader used to obtain medication profiles of patients and then uses as a decision support to identify drug therapy problems (e.g., drug interactions) for elderly home care patients, despite some system usability issues with the machine . 635 Furthermore, some patients showed an interest when they saw the results from the electronic assessment.635 One ethnographic case study identified that the physician -nurse communications, mechanisms to ensure cooperation, and the procedures for preparing and administering the medications are the key process areas to address before implementing a system to augment the nursing administering of medications. 762 Monitoring . Four qualitative studies assessed the clinician737,747 and patient633,760 perspective on the use of MMIT for medication monitoring. None addressed the effect of the systems on intermediate health care outcomes. The use of MMIT systems both facilitated and generated barriers to the process of patient monitoring by clinicians. 737,747 One mobile phone- based system study showe d that the MMIT system was well- accepted by patients as a mechanism to monitor symptoms for chemotherapy related toxicity .633 64 Adherence. No qualitative studies examined the effect of MMIT systems on medication adherence. MMIT systems facilitated patient monitoring737 by clinicians, however, barriers were reported to using health IT systems for patient monitoring.747 EMR with e -Prescribing facilitated monitoring and communication between physicians and patients with respect to the process of care that included checking active and inactive prescriptions and new and refill prescriptions, names of medication, and other medication themes (ordering and refilling prescriptions, mail-order issues, adherence, self regulation, alternate over the counter medication use issues). 737 Clinicians caring for patients with HIV/AIDS using a CPOE and CDSS system integrated with the hospital, pharmacy, and laboratory systems identified six barriers to using reminders, including workload, time to document, reminders not applying, inapplicability to the situation, training shortcomings, quality of provider- patient interaction , and use of paper forms. 747 Patients ' perceptions and experiences were studied based on their use of a mobile phone- based advanced symptom management system (ASyMS\u00a9) for chemotherapy -related toxicity monitoring and management.633 Patients with lung, breast, or colorectal cancer who used the system generally felt that, with training, the handset was straightforward and easy to use, entering data twice a day for 14 days was acceptable, the system did not impact on patients' daily routines, and the set of six symptoms that were recorded on the handset were adequate (although some patients did indicate that they would have liked the opportunity to report other symptoms). They were very happy with the alerting facil ity of the system often reporting that they felt 'secure' in the knowledge that someone was being alerted about their symptoms, the real time, quick response rate of the data collection and alerting facility was viewed positively. 633 However, one patient viewed the alerting system negatively, as she felt this part of the system was not sufficiently individually tailored. 633 Another study focused on the patient perceptions of MMIT by studying a home telemonitoring device for ulcerative colitis that included their list of medications and questions designed to gather medication side effects.760 Patients felt that the system improved safety, feeling that the program 'would catch something I might not recognize' or help them 'respond quickly to a threat' to thei r health. 760 Other studies with qualitative findings were also found.757,758,770 Population Level Outcomes Only one study met our inclusion criteria that assessed population level outcomes as a primary endpoint (Appendix C, Evidence Table 11). Yu and coll eagues712 in 2009 conducted a case- control study using actual reportable ADEs from a relatively large number of pediatric hospitals, comparing the rates of ADEs between cases and controls in hospitals with various degrees of CPOE implementation. The study found that patients from hospitals without CPOE were 42 percent more likely to experience a reportable ADE after adjusting for comorbidities; thus a significant benefit is associated with CPOE implementation. Composite Outcomes Only one included study assessed a composite outcome as their primary endpoint (Appendix C, Evidence Table 11). Holbrook and colleagues771 performed an RCT of 511 adult patients with type 2 diabetes receiving either usual care or an intervention involving shared access by patient and primary care provider to a Web -based diabetes tracker. The tracker interfaced with the providers' EMR and a phone reminder system, which sent monthly reminders for medications, laboratory reports, or physician visits. The main endpoint of process composi te score for checks 65 of glycated hemoglobin, blood pressure, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, albuminuria, body mass index, foot surveillance, exercise, and smoking improved significantly more in the intervention group than in the control group (1.33 vs . 0.06 composite score scale; difference 1.27, 95 percent CI 0.79 to 1.75, p <0.001) . Variation in Impact Depending on Medication Type or Form Summary of the Findings Although most studies looked at medication management in general, regardless of drug families, types or forms, 135 articles dealt with one or a few drugs or phases were again most often studied, with few studies looking at order communication, dispensing, or administering, and none on education (Table 16). No included studies addressed the issue of sound-alike or look-alike drugs, and four dealt with altering prescribing of generic drugs over name brand . 414,458,510,535 Specifically, 30 articles focused on antibiotics,18,399,401,403,405,409,418,423,426,428,451,452,458,460,464,469,475,477,482,506,523,525,562,563,596,614,647,661,683684 seven on vaccinations,404,410,411,424,478,530,566 two on respiratory medications,446,613 three on psychotropics,476,502,520 two on nonnarcotic pain relievers,514,773 three on lipid- lowering agents,515,517,706 two on corticosteroids,462,553 12 on cardiovascular drugs,414,448,449,505,509,510,521,522,534,588,592, 624 and four on insulin.466,630,631,703 Narrow therapeutic index drugs were considered in 20 studies,421,425,427,447,461,463,470 \u00ad 472,481,507,512,555,577,612,618,633,685,701,702 and controlled substances in seven.437,445,486,501,535,564, 731 The form of medications was rarel y mentioned, and was detected in only 18 studies.405,433,456,460,464,470,496,530,538,545,548,559,578,630,675,701,713,772 Prescribing changes from one drug form to another was the focus of two of these.460,464 We focused here on narrow therapeutic index, controlled drugs, and the forms of drugs. The 20 studies reporting on narrow therapeutic index drugs overwhelmingly measured process ( n = 15) and clinical outcomes ( n = 5), only two measured costs,612,685 and one study was a qualitative assessment of patients on chemotherapy.633 The effect of the MMIT systems was generally positive on the main outcomes of process change measures of prescribing or laboratory monitoring changes. Clinical outcomes frequently were better with the use of the MMIT, but in some instances no change was observed. 425,702 Systems used to assist monitoring or prescribing of narrow therapeutic index drugs were all either CDSS or CPOE systems. Six of the seven studies on controlled substances measured changes in process, four of which showed a positive impact.437,486,501,535 Only two measured clinical outcomes with mixed results.437,501 The controlled substance interventions were some form of reminders, alerts, or CDSS in all cases but one, which dealt with order sets for opioids in CPOE.437 The evidence in this small selection of articles indicates that health IT interventions designed to influence the management of patients taking narrow therapeutic index or controlled drugs have positive impacts in terms of changes in process; results are less clear for clinical outcomes with a number of studies showing no change. 66 Only two studies targeted changing the form of a drug,460,464 both of which employed a CDSS and had positive results. Due to a lack of reporting of the form of medication being studied, we can make no conclusions about the variation in effectiveness of MMIT by drug form. Strengths and Limitations of the Evidence Narrow therapeutic index drugs. Of the 20 narrow therapeutic index drug studies, three are RCTs507,612,618 with quality scores eight, seven, and seven out of nine respectively. Three cohort studies are included685,701,702 with low quality scores of three, two, and three out of 10 respectively. The remaining studies were observational421,425,427,447,461,463,470 -472,481,512, 555,577 or mixed methods.633 Controlled substances. The evidence for managing controlled substances rests on seven studies. The quality scores for the one RCT,535 one nonrandomized controlled trial,445 and one cohort study501 were generally low. The other four studies included a qualitative study,731 and three observational studies.437,486,564 General Study Characteristics Narrow therapeutic index drugs. The narrow therapeutic index drug studies took place in hospitals ( n = 14), ambulatory care ( n = 6), and one at home. The drugs included digoxin,461,618 chemotherapy,421,447,633 anticoagulants,425,427,470,471,481,512,555,685,701,702 and others463,472,612 (Table 16). Three studies included CPOE interventions to assist with inpatient dosing,421,447,701 one on side effect monitoring by patients,633 and the remainder were CDSS alerts or reminder systems. Studies on anticoagulents measured adherence to prescribing and monitoring guidelines facilitated by some form of computer decision support. 425,463,470,471,481,685 Two studies were of alerts sent to pharmacists for prescriptions written in primary care; one for prescriptions of drugs determined to be inappropriate for elderly patients 507 and one for drug-drug interactions.577 One study implemented order sets with in a CPOE for dosing of gentamicin and caffeine in the neonatal ICU, and assessed errors and drug turn-around times.463 Niiranen555 studied a computer- based warfarin followup system used by nurses to ease the burden on clinic physicians. Otherwise, prescri bing physicians were most often the target of the alerts, reminders , or dosing support. 67 Table 16.

No studies looked at education for a specific drug or drug class. Controlled substances. Two studies of controlled substances occurred in primary care settings. In an RCT, Fortuna and colleagues535 assessed the effect of computerized prescribing alerts on the prescription rates of heavily marketed hypnotics and benzodiazepines compared with their generic counterparts in 257 physicians. Smith and colleagues564 implemented a CDSS module to reduce prescribing on nonpreferred drugs in elderly patients in 15 primary care clinics. The other five studies were performed in hospital settings and used CDSS interventions445,486,501,731 and order sets in a CPOE437 geared towards prescribing physicians. Outcomes Narrow therapeutic index drugs. The interventions aimed at pharmacists both resulted in significant reductions in inappropriate prescribing. Raebel and colleagues507 reported a relative risk reduction of 16 percent inappropriate prescribing for elderly patients, and Humphries et al. 577 reported a 31 percent relative risk reduction in drug-drug interaction prescribing. The studies of CDSS dealing with narrow therapeutic or narrow therapeutic index drugs frequent ly resulted in better laboratory monitoring of patients,461,472,612,618 prescribing adherence,427,470 -472 dosing,447,555,618 or avoidance of errors.421,463,512 Cordero and colleagues463 found reduced errors and quicker medication turnaround times with the use of CPOE ordering and dosing in the neonatal ICU. Negative results were found by Riggio 481 with longer times to stop heparin treatment in patients experiencing heparin induced thrombocytopenia following implementation of an alert for 100 patients. Time from alert to laboratory test and start of direct thrombin inhibitor treatment did not vary before and after the implementation. 68 Clinical outcomes were measured in six studies. We considered positive studies to have at least 50 percent of the outcomes as being significantly impacted by the technology. Under this measure, four of the studies did not show significant impact of the technologies on patient outcomes425,555,685,702 though they tended towards being positive. Balcezak and colleagues701 found better prescribing of heparin when a computerized nomogram was used by prescribers, but the nomogram was only used for 10 percent of prescriptions written. The highest quality evidence comes from Raebel, 507 White,618 and Feldstein612 and their colleagues who al l showed positive, significant impacts of the technologies on narrow therapeutic index drug management. Controlled drugs. The primary care RCT by Fortuna and colleagues535 found a significant decrease in the prescribing rates of heavily marketed drugs wit h the implementation of an alert plus education intervention, with a relative risk reduction of 74 percent. The observational study by Smith and colleagues564 in 15 primary care clinics to reduce prescribing on nonpreferred drugs in elderly patients showed a significant decrease in exposure of elderly patients to nonpreferred drugs, but no change in nonelderly patients, and a nonsignificant positive trend of preferred drugs in elderly patients. The hospital-based quantitative studies showed generally posit ive process measures, 437,486,501 with improved adherence to dosing in two,486,501 and better monitoring of patient pain levels.437 Morrison and colleagues445 found no change in prescription rates for laxatives to patients on opioids. Clinical outcomes were only measured by Peterson501 and Wrona437 and their colleagues. Peterson and colleagues found no change in length of stay or rate of altered status, but a significant reduction in falls (p = 0.001). Wrona and colleagues found improved respiratory rate in patients on morphine and hydromorphone with order sets outlining monitoring and documentation requirements. Unintended Consequences of MMIT Applications Summary of the Findings The unintended consequences of health IT are important and often not well-studied . (Note that this section is not about drug- related ADEs.) These unintended consequences associated with an MMIT are often identified after a system is implemented, despite careful planning and installation. Unintended consequences can be minor or major and they can be viewed as being helpful to the installation or detrimental. Eighteen studies were identified that reported unintended consequences of MMIT installations (Appendix C, Evidence Table12). 15,16,450,457,480,503,508,732,734,743,752,759,774 -779 Because we report only those outcomes that the authors reported as the primary or main findings of the study, this listing of articles on unintended consequences is likely not comprehensive. Strengths and Limitations of the Evidence One study is a large obs ervational study of medication errors reported to MEDMARX facilities that covers all the phases of medication management.774 As in previous sections of this report most of the studies evaluated prescribing. All of the remaining 17 studies (one RCT,508 eight quantitative observational studies,15,16,450,457,480,732,775,777 six qualitative studies,734,759,776,778 \u00ad 780 and two mixed methods studies503,752) evaluated prescribing. Several of these studies also evaluated other phases. The order communication phase was evaluated in two studies, one 69 observational15 and one qualitative study.732 Dispensing was studied in one observational study.15 Administering has one observational study15 and two qualitative studies.732,743 No studies of unintended consequences evaluated the monitoring phase or education and reconciliation. General Study Characteristics Participants. Most of the studies were done at an institution level rather than a patient or provider level. Raebel and colleagues508 studied medications with potential for harm to pregnant women and Han and colleagues15 studied admissions to a children' s hospital after implementation of a CPOE system. Nurses were evaluated in two studies,732,743 and the rest of the studies included a range of clinicians. Location. All studies were done in single hospitals or groups of hospitals. One study was done in a long- term care center.732 Drugs and diseases. Raebel and colleagues508 studied drugs with potential for harm to the fetus in pregnant women (category D and X medicatio ns). All other studies included all medications. Technology. All of studies but two involved CDSS and CPOE systems integrated with EMR systems, dispensing systems or pharmacy information systems. The two studies that did not include CDSS and CPOE systems involved BCMA 743 and eMAR systems.732 They were both integrated within a hospital-based information system. Outcomes Ash and colleagues list a number of unintended consequences of MMIT and other health IT systems.778 These unintended consequences were cat egorized into direct compared with indirect, desirable compared with undesirable, and anticipated compared with unanticipated occurrences . Ash and colleagues contend that most unintended consequences center on errors, security concerns, and issues related to alerts, workflow, ergonomics, interpersonal relations, and reimplementation (e.g., updates). They also assert that all health IT systems will have unintended consequences. Mortality. The University of Pittsburgh study of increased mortality with the introduction of an inflexible CPOE system is an example of a very serious unintended consequence. 15 Because of the seriousness of the implications of this study, many people reviewed this article. Much attention has been given to this article and its methods. 17 Another similar study shows that with careful planning, another children' s hospital did not see the same increase in mortality in admitted children after careful implementation of health IT.16 Errors. New and different types of errors were identified as unintended consequences in three studies.450,457,503 Although most MMIT systems are associated with decreased errors, not all of the systems sought to determine new or different types of errors \u2014they most often studied existing types and classes of med ication errors. One study felt that problems with communication would probably lead to errors in medication management,775 and another study postulated the same increase in errors based on challenges to existing and changing roles.734 The study of use of inappropriate medications during pregnancy was stopped early because the system was not 70 accurate enough, causing the system to \"miss\" notification of drugs that should have been alerted and to give alerts that were not needed.508 Prescribing. Prescribing w as not addressed specifically, although alert fatigue was a common theme in the studies of unintended consequences of MMIT.480,752 Efficiency. Ash and colleagues776 list 47 types of unintended consequences and Kopppel and colleagues752 list 22. Ash and colleagues go on to verify that the types of unintended consequences they found were common in institutions outside those that she and her colleagues studied.777 Unintended consequences were related to roles,734,743,752,776,781 communication,775,779 workflo w alterations or automation of poor existing workflows,752,759,779 inflexibility of the new system,743,752,759 poor content or poor display of content,752,759,776 alert fatigue,480,776,779 and overdependence on the system.779 Rather than fix the system, mo st often workarounds were instituted by clinical staff.732,743 Summary. Seventeen of the 18 studies listed above report serious unintended consequences of MMIT in multiple categories. From these studies we see that unintended consequences exist for many health IT projects regardless of the quality of the implementation or the amount of planning that went into the project. Although consequences were viewed as being positive or negative, both provided useful information for those interested in MMIT implementation. KQ2. What knowledge or evidence deficits exist regarding needed information to support estimates of cost, benefit, impact, and net value with regard to enabling health IT applications in terms of prescribing, order transmission, dispensing, administering, and monitoring, as well as reconciliation, education, and adherence? Discuss gaps in research, including specific areas that should be addressed and suggest possible public and private organizational types to perform the research and/or analysis. Introduction We identified gaps in the report\u2014some that we expected and some not. We address gaps by the key questions (Table 17). In this section, some overlap exists with Chapter 5 (Future Research). Most of the gaps cross multiple phases of medication management. Where an issue is more strongly associated with a phase we mention the phase or other aspect (e.g., reconciliation). 71 Table 17.

The literature places a great emphasis on studying the prescribing phase of medication management, with 263 of our included studies falling in that phase (Table 18). We feel that more study should be done on the phases of order communication, dispensing, and administering . In addition, the educational requirements for effective use of MMIT applications by health professionals needs to be studied. The evidence on the need to train patients and their families o n how best to use MMIT systems as well as incorporating disease- specific information and management education into patient- based MMIT applications is needed. Reconciliation of medications is vital, especially at the time of transfer to another health car e setting, including transfer to and from home and community. Little evidence is available that MMIT systems are capable of and effective at doing this medication reconciliation and making adjustments to regimens. Challenges with system interoperability an d standardized 73 representation of medication data make effective reconciliation using MMIT applications difficult. Order communication is ripe for more research and development, especially in two- way communication to improve and speed up \" perfection \" of orders and prescriptions. Table 18. Frequency of m edication management phases studies plus r econciliation and education Phase Frequency Prescribing 263 Order communication 26 Dispensing 17 Administering 39 Monitoring 77 Education 3 Reconciliation/Ot her 6 Research methods . This same pattern of disparity for the number of studies in the medication management phases exists for the distribution of study methods. Most included studies are quantitative observational studies (Table 19). Although these studies provide good evidence for understanding and evaluating MMIT applications, more studies with control groups are needed to provide stronger methods where appropriate. MMIT applications are \" complex \" interventions and can be considered to be programmatic and pragmatic in their evaluation. Future research using methods appropriate for these complex interventions are needed. Studies of full MMIT systems and components of MMIT systems are needed. Many studies were not powered to find the differences sought. We also identified other issues in study methods including inappropriate analyses, labeling of methods, and adjusting data sets in some of the observational studies. For example, studies seeking to identify such factors as barriers or facilitators of use of health IT systems did not report adjustment for multiple comparisons (e.g., Bonferroni corrections, bootstrapping, or Monte Carlo simulations). Some studies addressing feature preferences tested for 40 or more associations without adjustment. The authors of sections of this report also have commented on incorrect choice of statistical analysis techniques in some studies that could have led to positive findings that are not justified. Studies need strong statistical and methodological advice. We also agree with Bernstam and other informatics researchers and educators who suggest that research into MMIT systems needs to include those with informatics and research training and experience. 782 Another gap in the research realm is the absence of formal study o f MMIT in relation to knowledge translation (translational research). Much evidence exists on many aspects of MMIT. Table 19. Frequency of research designs for included studies Design Frequency RCT 88 Cohort or case -control studies 21 Observational stu dies 207 Qualitative studies 39 Total 355 RCT Randomized controlled trial 74 Participants Health care providers. Physicians are well -studied. Nurses, pharmacists, midlevel practitioners (e.g., nurse practitioners, physician assistants, advance practice nurses, and midwives), and hospital administrators are not (Table 20). Studies that include m ental health professionals are also lacking. Studies that include nonphysician clinicians are not focused on the unique needs of the participants. The important issue of nursing workarounds that have developed to deal with systems that match physician but not nursing needs is also inadequately studied. Use and usability studies need to include all health professionals who use MMIT systems and studies need to be done th at will allow knowledge gained in usability studies to be transferred to other settings.

The age range of patients impacted by the MMIT were generally well -represented across age groups with notable concentration among those who require more prescription medications (e.g., middle age and geriatrics) (Table 21). However, the special needs of medication management for children such as age- and weight-based dosing were not adequately pursued. More study of pediatric patients would be beneficial. Many of these patient- specific studies used data from patients to evaluate MMIT systems and their functioning in hospitals and primary care settings. However the needs of the patients and their families to manage medications outside of hospitals and clinics were not studied. This lack of evaluation of MMIT systems that patients and families will use at home and the effects of these systems on patient care and outcomes is an important gap that will only grow because of the advent of new systems, improvements in existing ones, and the move of patient centered care, chronic disease management with the aid of health IT, and continued time and money pressures on health care providers. Qualitative studies that address pharmacists as well as patient needs and opportunities and important outcomes were also l acking. Table 21.

Hospitals and ambulatory care, but not necessarily specialty clinics, are also well - represented in the studies of this report (Table 22). The gaps are in other settings. Very few pharmacies or long -term care facilities were studied. Many existing articles on pharmacies and pharmacists were excluded because of lack of comparative data or integration of MMIT. Long-term care facilities, community locations, and homes also need formal evaluation to determine the effectiveness and use of MMIT applications for their constituents. One study evaluated outcomes at the population level. 712 MMIT applications tend to target in dividuals and few of them measure population level effects. Research into the effect of MMIT on populations is challenging and research will have to be carefully planned. Table 22.

CDSS and C POE systems are well -studied, most often in the prescribing and monitoring phases (Table 23). All other MMIT applications lack evidence of their effectiveness, especially in terms of workflow, communication, and clinical outcomes. Many studies did not report important details of the MMIT application itself, making the studies in this report more difficult to synthesize. From the descriptions in the articles we felt that descriptions of the system, including components and implementation issues such as training could have been added but they were not. Another substantial gap that we noted is that the content of the MMIT systems was not studied. Systems like CDSS and CPOE and functions like drug-drug interactions and the knowledge base that reminders, alerting systems, and order sets are based on need a strong, evidence -based foundation of knowledge that is based on health research and reliably updated and disseminated. Assessment of the need for and value of this clinical evidence base was absent. Table 23.

Health information exchange is defined as the movement of health information across organizations using nationally accepted standards was not studied in any of the d ocuments retrieved. Medication management is complex and challenged by interoperability of systems, and like reconciliation, it has not been evaluated in MMIT studies that we identified in this document. Reporting. Through the process of data abstraction , we found problems with standardization and expanded inclusion of data elements in terms of reporting health IT studies. We feel that authors should be encouraged to strive for publication in the peer- reviewed literature rather than trade publications and news magazines. We also feel that authors should include more data in their publications of MMIT interventions. Lacks appear in descriptions of what was in place for medication management before implementation of MMIT systems (baseline data), full explanations of the MMIT system and its implementation process, settings, including culture, and participants (both health professionals and patients and their families). A guideline for writing evaluation reports in health IT, the STARE-HI, was published in 2009. 783 We recommend that this document be used for planning and reporting research studies of MMIT.

Appendices Another of the challenges in this report to do with retrieval of studies from the bibliographic databases and also for abstraction and combining data, were inconsistencies in the use of terminology. We observed differences in how authors categorized medication errors, ADEs, and therapeutic failures. Several authors are seeking consensus on terminology in health IT. These definitional aspects are also addressed in the STARE -HI reporting guidelines listed above. 783 Most of the studies in this evidence report do not follow these guidelines. Benefit and impact. Benefit and impact are similar but not identica l. In the pharmaceutical world benefit can be thought of as being \"can it work\" often under ideal situations (i.e., efficiency research). Much of the evidence answering KQ1: Effectiveness is of this kind of research: evaluation of a project, often near its implementation and for a short period of time. Many of these studies attest to the fact that for process and other soft outcomes, many of the MMIT systems do work. Impact, or pragmatic studies, refer to measuring the effect of an intervention in the real world. Very few studies in this report are in this category. Trials of this nature are complex, long-term, have large numbers of people/situations being studied, and are done on mature and well - functioning systems. These trials are costly to complete and require maturity in the systems. Their location is likely best at those centers in the United States that have established and mature health care systems that have solid support for technology, strong research teams, experience with qualitative and quanti tative methods and expertise in collaborative projects that include clinicians, experienced informaticians , and patients and their families. The gaps for completing benefit studies include the medication management phases of order communication, dispensing, and administering; people besides physicians (pharmacists, nurses, other health care professionals, patients and families, vulnerable populations); nonhospital settings (long -term care facilities, community, pharmacies, and home settings); generics, form s of medication, and controlled substances; MMIT applications beyond CDSSs; and dispensing, administering, adherence tools, and patient involved health IT. Cost and economics. Cost and economics are complex issues and important to many people, groups, organizations, and governments. To complete a comprehensive economic evaluation (e.g., cost- effectiveness, cost -utility, or cost-benefit analysis) one needs to quantify all costs and benefits within a given perspective (e.g., societal). Strong economic evaluations can piggyback on an RCT, or an economic model may be developed with data from a number of sources. Well - designed studies with an economic evaluation component included, is the best way to move forward in this area. Many studies have provided cost data, but useful economic data involves far more input. An example of a cost study with data that is limited in its use is by Chisolm and colleagues, 446 who did a before- after study of children with asthma in a children 's hospital. Their pharmacy charges 78 were $373 before CPOE with standardized order sets were put in place, and $429 after implementation. Therefore, the gaps for estimates of costs in this report of MMIT are almost identical to those listed above. In addition, we identified gaps in research quality centering on research design and analysis. We need highly trained and experienced researchers and economists to complete useful and usable cost and economics studies in the complex and changing domain of MMIT. Summary This report identified broad based strengths and gaps in the MMIT literature. Many of the major endpoints sought were found to show positive and statistically significant improvements, especially those that dealt with process and issues related to use, usability, knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Clinical endpoints and full economic evaluations were lacking. We also identified gaps in the study of the phases of medication, people involved, locations of studies, and research methods. We also identified areas where these gaps are becoming mor e important such as patient and family needs and opportunities related to MMIT, complete MMIT systems, and interoperability. Much research has been done in MMIT, and moving forward needs directed and careful planning and vision to fill gaps in our evidence base, harness the best established and new research methods, and build on what we already know to embrace new and advancing abilities of MMIT. KQ3. What critical information regarding the impact of health IT applications implemented to support the phases of medication management is needed to give clinicians (physicians, nurses, psychologists, dentists), pharmacists, health care administrators, patients, and their families a clear understanding of the value proposition particular to them? The value propositions of health IT applications have been difficult to quantify with more of a focus in recent years on framing how best to consider and measure it.784 Menachemi and Brooks785 review the benefits and costs of EHRs and associated patient safety technologies. They have found that studies assessing the benefits of the technologies in process and clinical outcomes are far more frequent than those assessing the return on investment. This trend is supported by the considerable evidence presented in the current report; while we include numerous studies assessing process changes and clinical outcomes, the body of evidence on cost-effectiveness is sparse. A number of barriers to measuring return on investment in health technologies exist. Technologies do not result in a direct income stream and the benefits often accrue to organizations other than the ones making the investment as, for example, clinical benefit to patients and financial benefits to payers rather than the hospitals making the investments. 785 Investments in health IT produce a fundamentally different kind of asset to health care providers, and the technologies and changes they bring are so complex that it is difficult to measure their benefits. 784 Certainly the body of literature looking at return on inve stment for the various technologies covered in this report, across the various settings, is very limited. We use the Center for Information Technology Leadership' s (CITL) value framework (Table 24), which defines value as the sum of a technology' s financi al, clinical, and organizational benefits.786 This fits well with the definition used by AHRQ whereby \"value \" is defined as \"clinical, organizational, financial, or other benefits derived from the adoption, utilization, and 79 diffusion of health IT less the costs of achieving these benefits \" (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa- files/RFA -HS-04-012.html ). The same considerations for stakeholder value propositions are elements outlined by Ash and colleagues787 as important themes to consider when implementin g a system, specifically CPOE. We recognize that this framework does not include patients as an element, but we believe that the framework could be applied to the patient perspective and incorporate value propositions for patients where applicable. The req uired information to make an assessment of benefits is different depending on the stakeholder. The costs incurred by primary care physicians in practice will be different and balanced against different organizational benefits than those incurred in hospitals, and influenced by factors such as practice size, the sophistication of the technology, and others. 786 Similarly, what constitutes benefits to a patient will be different from that of other users. Subramanian and colleagues 788 have looked at costs and benefits to a number of stakeholders using CPOE with CDSS in long- term care facilities. Their process sheds light on the facets that we need to understand and study before we can make sweeping generalizations about value of health IT application. They identified the various stakeholders, the potential costs and benefits of the health IT , and factors which could affect costs and benefits. Ideally, such an assessment would be available for each stakeholder using each technology in each setting. This is not oft en the case so realistically we will broadly look at factors taken into account in making a value assessment and determine what we know and where the gaps lie. Table 24. Summary of the evidence in relation to the CITL value f ramework786 CITL Value Framewor k786 Current knowledge Financial Cost reductions The limited cost analyses evidence available indicates that MMIT may offer some cost advantages despite acquisition costs. Cost of system purchase, implementation and maintenance are rarely reported in the primary literature Investors in the technology do not always reap the rewards It is difficult to reach any definitive conclusion as to whether the additional costs and benefits represent value for money due to a lack of high quality, full economic evalua tions. Revenue enhancements MMIT rarely results in increased revenue Not within the purview of this report Productivity gains Some improvements seen in length of stay Some evidence of increased efficiency Qualitative evidence of workflow and health care provider relationship disruptions Seldom measured as main endpoints Clinical Care process advances A significant body of literature indicating positive, if modest, improvements Still a lack of quality studies with strong methods Clear indications that unintended consequences can impact the value of the systems to stakeholders Improved patient outcomes Shortage of quality studies with strong methods Some technologies show a positive effect on patient outcomes Often measured as secondary outcomes and lac k power Organizational Stakeholder satisfaction improvements Qualitative and quantitative support for improved satisfaction and perceptions for a range of stakeholders, including patients, using a number of different technologies in various settings Even when positive satisfaction is reported, improvements to the systems are often suggested Risk mitigation Not within the purview of this report 80 Summary of the Findings Given that the value framework is the sum of financial, clinical, and organizational benefits, the current body of literature summarized in our systematic review in KQ1: Effectiveness would indicate that too many unanswered questions exist to make a true value assessment for the different stakeholders and technologies in the applicable sett ings. Financial Benefits Cost reductions. The data on cost savings from the use of health IT in medication management are sparse. The few studies included in our review suggested that some cost savings may exist, which could be substantial over time. The economic information looks more favorable after the technology has been in place for an extended period of time so that the large upfront investment gets spread over time and then do we start to see a return on investment. However, a full economic evaluation requires the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both costs and consequences, which provides the best information for making a decision to adopt an intervention or not, and very few of these have been rigorously completed in this field. We don't have good evidence of a positive return on investment. Also, the initial expenditure and ongoing costs were rarely reported and the included cost analyses were based on projections of savings given reported changes in care processes r ather than improved clinical outcomes for patients. Revenue enhancements. No studies that quantified revenue enhancements were captured for this review. Because of the nature of health IT assets, they do not per se bring about additional revenues to the investors. Productivity gains. Evidence captured in KQ1: Effectiveness suggests that some productivity gains are achieved, often measured as improvements in efficiency in care processes. 429,457,463 Gains achieved by reductions in outcomes such as lengths of stay or rehospitalizations have been less successful, though Durieux and colleagues716 do report a significant decline in hospital length of stay in a review of drug dosing decision support technologies. A number of studies reported positive improvements in efficiency outcomes such as drug turnaround times, 584,586,628 and time to administering drugs.439,600 One study reported that nurses spent about the same time on computer documentation as paper documentation.561 In our review, efficiencies were rarely the main endpoints of any of the studies; they were frequently reported as secondary outcomes or additional measures analyzed, but without any assessment of the power of the analysis. Because of the quality of the studies, it is difficult to attribute tru e productivity gains except in the cases of some well-established systems as suggested by Chaudhry and colleagues. 607 The qualitative evidence indicates that stakeholders believe that gains in productivity have occurred.439,547,632 Clinical Benefits Care processes. Certainly this aspect of values is the most studied across the phases of medication management, with 379 studies included in our review in KQ1: Effectiveness. These studies included a number of settings and stakeholders, and most reported improve ments in processes of prescribing changes, adherence to guidelines or quality measures, error reductions, preventive care procedures done, and monitoring initiated. However, the studies were often observational and often had small sample sizes. In more than 80 percent of the cases in which an 81 improvement in process was sought, it was found to be positive. The findings of improvement were consistent across settings, levels of care, providers, and medication management phase. We report a positive effect in th e use of MMIT in the prescribing and monitoring of controlled and toxic drugs as well. To balance this positive nature of the results, a growing body of evidence delineates unintended consequences of some technologies that will also contribute to the value proposition of stakeholders. 632,734,752 Patient clinical outcomes. We reported on 78 studies that assessed clinical outcomes as their primary endpoints, the majority of which focused on prescribing and monitoring phases. About half of these studies reported positive effects of the MMIT on patient outcomes. However, when clinical measures were the primary endpoint, often no differences between the intervention and control groups in the higher quality studies were seen (see Table 15). The strongest evident iary weight for clinical outcomes is found in the use of CDSSs for the prescribing and monitoring phases, and the overall benefit is somewhat positive but most often mixed. 725 The measurement of clinical outcomes is often so far removed from the MMIT inter vention that it becomes difficult to make general conclusions about their efficacy, and adoption rates are still quite low. We found that efficacy was greater in interventions targeting specific populations or applications. Thus, a value assessment on patient outcomes would warrant a look at specific technologies, populations, and settings beyond the scope of this report. Organizational Benefits Stakeholder satisfaction . For implementation, adoption, and ongoing use of any technology to be successful, the p eople using the system need to find it useful, usable, and nondisruptive. Many studies have looked at workflow issues, satisfaction, and perceptions of users with regard to health IT. Our review includes only those providing qualitative data or comparison groups. The literature on satisfaction indicates that generally the stakeholders studied were satisfied with the technologies of interest, namely CPOE, CDSS, and e- Prescribing. 651,654 -656,656 -658 Some studies, however, found no differences in satisfaction.651,659 Levels of satisfaction and positive perceptions were shown to be positively correlated with measures such as ease of use, productivity, quality of care, and reliability. 654-657,661,673 Our review of the qualitative research in the area shows that t he implementation of MMIT generates emotion, both positive and negative. MMIT implementation did not just mean that a clinician needed to learn a new IT system but it also affected most of the other parts of the delivery of care processes including how the interdisciplinary care team worked together. When determining the proposition values, the type of technology and how well it meets expectations and workflow are important considerations for users, greatly impacting their perceptions and openness to adoption/use. Some literature has focused on comparing perceptions and attitudes of different health care providers, such as nurses compared with physicians and trainees ; 656,678 and residents compared with physicians using the same technologies.654,657,677 The findings from these studies indicate that perceptions of the benefits of MMIT can depend on the role of the user. The type of system and how it affects health care providers ' work will impact how satisfied these stakeholders are with the technologies. For any one technology or setting, insufficient data exist to determine levels of satisfaction among all stakeholders. From the literature we see that satisfaction and perceptions of the MMIT can vary according to provider role, setting, and technology, and no overall answer to the 82 question of stakeholder satisfaction exists. We have a deficiency of comprehensive studies of patients as stakeholders. Risk mitigation. No literature was captured on risk mitigation in relation to the use of MMIT. A focus of the greater body of research, especially commentaries and narrative reviews, is on the use of technologies to reduce medication errors. Such benefits could have repercussions on risk mitigation, but also needs to be balanced with the fact that some technologies have been shown to result in new kinds of errors. Conclusions Only one study attempted to look at the value propositions across stakeholders in the use of MMIT and they concluded that to facilitate adoption of CDSSs in the long term care setting, financi al incentives to both the institutions and physicians should be considered. 788 Certainly, from the literature, we see no clear understanding of what information is needed from the standpoint of each stakeholder. We can surmise from studies that physicians consider cost, usability, patient improvements, and easy integration into workflow as important factors to consider before they purchase MMIT technologies. Hospital administrators place emphasis on other aspects such as costs, return on investment, and organizational change. The relative importance of these factors will vary among physicians practicing in different settings, with cost being more important to physicians in private practice than in hospitals, and other related issues. Capitation rates will also be a factor for physicians and will vary across U.S. states. 786 Similarly, the importance of these factors will vary among pharmacists depending on their practice setting and the type of technology. For patients, convenience, usability, portability, and patient -centered functionality have been reported as important factors in their value assessment of consumer health IT. 4 For MMIT, patients will likely be concerned with reduced medication costs, avoidance of ADEs, and improved disease management, although no studies evaluated their value-based concerns. Work needs to be done to identify the needed critical information before we can truly assess what is missing. From the information garnered in this report, a growing body of evidence supports the use of some technologies (e.g., CDSSs) in prescribing and monitoring, which show positive changes in process, while large gaps in knowledge of the impact of the use of MMIT for other applications still exist (see KQ2: Gaps in Knowledge ). KQ4. What evidence exi sts regarding the impact of the characteristics of medication management health IT applications, such as open source, proprietary, conformity with Federal and other interoperability standards, and being Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT) certified, impact, likelihood for purchase, implementation, and use of such IT applications. Summary of the Findings Few studies (n = 21)45,48,632,653,661,663,667,789 -802 demonstrated evidence of the impact of the characteristics of MMIT ap plications on likelihood to purchase, implement, and use such IT applications (Table 25). Little substantial evidence was found from studies that assessed open source health IT applications that met our inclusion criteria. Only two articles discussed 83 conformity with standards653,801 and one the Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT) certified system.800 Such system characteristics as the use of proprietary IT systems was suggested by seven articles45,632,653,663,798 -800 and h omegrown IT application by one article.667 Two reported on a stand- alone e- Prescribing system.653,798 Most of the articles suggest that the decision to adopt health IT applications has been influenced by the feature sets of health IT applications. Each of the 21 articles included in this section established evidence on likelihood to use, one on purchase,800 and five on implementation.653,789,791,793,798 A sizeable number (n = 20) of articles were on the prescribing and ordering phases, with only one on the administering phase of medication management. 45 The findings of the articles included in our study suggest that certain features of systems improve the likelihood of purchase, implementation, and use of MMIT. However, the literature is sparse and evidence from studies with stronger methods that can address this question is lacking. Most often authors spoke about barriers and concerns towards implementation and acceptance rather than characteristics of MMIT that could facilitate implementation, purchase, and use of such systems. Insufficient details were given about the technology they were studying. Head -to-head comparisons of systems differing in these features were not found. A systematic review on CDSS revealed that widespread dissemination of appropriat e CDSS might improve clinical practice, but providing information in electronic format alone does not ensure uptake. 803 Fundamental issues related to system characteristics included the availability and accessibility of hardware, technical support and trai ning, system integration into clinical workflow, timeliness of clinical messages, and acceptance of the system by various stakeholders. 803 Another review involving descriptions of 112 information systems identified that for successful implementation, core components were order entry, guideline adherence, and decision support. 804 Involving end users in the development process was also shown to be a key to success.804 However, these systematic reviews did not explore whether health IT system characteristics l ike proprietary or homegrown, system configuration, system characteristics, CCHIT certified, conformity with interoperability standard and standalone or integrated had any impact on purchase, implementation, or use. 803,804 Table 25.

Nineteen articles were published in the original literature an d one was from the grey literature.800 General Study Characteristics Participants. More than half of the studies (n = 13)48,653,661,663,667,790,792,794 -797,799,802 evaluated physicians as the user of the technology. One article each included pharmacists,661 nurses,667 directors and the leader of IT application users,45 chief information officer,791 pharmacy directors,45,793 and two administrative and other medical staff.661,667 Two reported combinations of different types of health care providers.632,798 One study convened a panel of technical experts representing organizations having direct experience in implementing e- Prescribing standards.801 The size of the studies ranged from 14 to 18,600 participants. Study setting. In most of the studies, the partic ipants were primarily from hospitals,661,663,789 \u00ad 791,793 and some set in pharmacies,45 ambulatory care,632,653,667,798 -800 and primary care.794,795,797 Four evaluated a combination of various settings.48,792,796,802 Technology. Primarily five groups of health IT systems, namely, CPOE, CPOE with CDSS, CDSS, e -Prescribing, EHRs, and five other systems were studied. Research methods. Research methods were weak: eighteen articles were surveys, two used qualitative research,801,805 while one used data fr om scientific literature, organizations, government, and professional reports.797 Outcomes Identification of feature sets. Bell and colleagues conducted an expert panel consensus that resulted in 60 specific functional recommendations for e- Prescribing to improve patients' health outcomes and reduce costs.806 This list of features is useful for those considering an assessment in this area. We identified that one or more of these recommended features were the driving forces toward possible purchase, implementation, and use of health IT applications. Major features addressed in most of the articles were medication lists, 208,632,653,663,789,792,794,798,801 dosing calculations,661,789,792,793,799 CDSSs (alerts and messages drug approval),45,632,653,661,667,789 -794,796,798 -801 e-Prescribing,48,208,632,653,667,790,792,794 -798,802 and order communication of the prescription to pharmacies.45,632,792,794,798 Other factors were access to laboratory test results,45,789,790,792,794,797,799,800,802 implementation of guidelines,661,789,792,795,796,799 transcription services,791 formularies,653,793,795,801 tallman letters and change of color to differentiate between look -alike drug name pairs,45 integration with another system like BCMA , pharmacy information systems, etc.,45,791,793 and medication reconciliation (Table 26).792,793 (Tallman letters are the use of capitals to help guarantee recognition of differences between drugs with similar names, as for example, NovoLOG and NovoLIN , and Huma LOG and Humu LIN, helps differentiate these products.) 85 Table 26.

Wang and colleagues653 suggest that mandating the use of standards is necessary but not sufficient for achieving the desired effects of e-Prescribing. Bell and colleagues evaluated two standard s (Medication History Standard and Formularies and Benefits Standards) from the U.S. National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) that were considered as initial standards for e- Prescribing under Medicare. 801 Another study considered CCHIT certi fied IT applications to be the deciding factor for likelihood to purchase, implement, and use.800 The 2008 Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Analytic Ambulatory health IT survey reported commercial, proprietary EMR systems were being us ed without any one vendor being the dominant leader.800 Apart from these two articles,653,800 four other articles45,632,663,799 reported the use of commercial proprietary systems with medication management health feature sets. Use. All the studies addressing the decision to use were based primarily on one or more of the feature sets discussed above (Table 26). Three studies were on CPOE systems with CDSS capabilities45,667,793 and one on a CPOE system alone.663 The features that were more important were al lergy checking, drug interactions, medication formulation, interface with the pharmacy information system and direct order communication, and integration with the BCMA and laboratory systems. Two studies were on CDSS, 661,667 with one being integrated with CPOE.667 Their important features were e- Prescribing, drug -drug interactions, calculation of dosing, and access to additional information. Seven studies were based on EHR, EMR, or clinical information systems789,790,792,794,797,799,800 with one study789 mentioning that a sizeable number of hospitals reported having implemented several key functionalities of CPOE and CDSS. The important features were CPOE with CDSS, electronically available laboratory test results, medication lists, e -Prescribing with electr onic transmittal of prescriptions to pharmacies, access to reference materials, and dosing calculations. Three studies were on general health IT systems . 791,795,796 Grossman et al.,796 found the percentage of physicians reporting access to clinical activi ties such as obtaining guidelines, 86 generating reminders, and writing e -Prescriptions increased from 2000-2001 to 2004-2005 (p < 0.05). Six studies45,48,632,653,798,801,802 were on e-Prescribing with one being integrated with another system and hand -held access.632 Some of the more important features addressed by these studies were e- Prescribing, medication lists, drug interaction and allergy alerts, receiving laboratory results electronically, changing doses, formularies, and order communication of prescription to pharmacies. According to the study by Bell and colleagues,801 implementation of medication history standard and formulary and benefit standards in e- Prescribing would likely enhance usability of such systems if standard implementation was improved. The qualitative study by Weingart and colleagues632 found that the most valuable aspects of e-Prescribing in ambulatory care were the ease of changing doses, renewing prescriptions, ensuring legibility, and transmitting prescriptions to in - and out-of- state pharmacies. Participants were dissatisfied with the unreliability of transmitting prescriptions successfully to the pharmacy, creating medication lists, recording of allergy information, and quantity of irrelevant and inappropriate alerts. Despite thei r complaints about alerts, participants preferred to continue receiving alerts as a safeguard against missing a major interaction. The studies of such health IT systems as pharmacy information systems found that important features were CDSS alerts, interface with the laboratory system, and tallman letters and change of color to differentiate between look- alike drug name pairs. 45 Purchase. One article reported on likelihood to purchase in a group of which half of the respondents of that survey were planni ng to purchase a CCHIT certified EMR system.800 The important features were electronic connectivity for laboratory test results and orders, nursing and physician orders for medications, and prescription refills. Implementation. Five articles reported on t he likelihood to implement an MMIT system. 653,789,791,793,798 Larger hospitals, those located in urban areas, and teaching hospitals are more likely to implement EHR systems.789 Collectively, the important features were allergy checking, drug interactions, medication history, dosing calculation, medication formulation, and availability of laboratory test results. Wang and colleagues653 conducted a descriptive field study of ten commercially available ambulatory e -Prescribing systems, to compare the functional capabilities offered by commercial ambulatory electronic system with 60 expert panel recommendations suggested by Bell and colleagues. 798,806 Data were collected from vendors by telephone interview and at sites where the systems were functioning , through direct observation of the systems and through personal interviews with prescribers and technical staff. Five of the systems were full EHR systems and five were nonEHR systems. Among the 60 e- Prescribing recommendations by Bell and colleagues , 806 nine recommendations were not implemented by any of the ten systems.798 These included recommendations that would require e- Prescribing systems to handle prescription fulfillment data (their recommendations 10, 47, and 48), to use more complex drug benefit data (recommendation 22), and to use more advanced drug knowledge bases (recommendations 26 and 49). 798,806 Prescribing systems that were part of EHR systems implemented more recommendations than did stand -alone nonEHR systems. Considering all 60 recommendations, the median EHR -based system fully implemented 60 percent, whereas the median nonEHR system fully implemented 35 percent (p = 0.09). Including partial and full support together, median implementation levels were 72 percent for EHR systems and 46 percent fo r nonEHR systems (p = 0.06). On average, the systems fully implemented 50 percent of the recommended 87 capabilities, with individual systems ranging from 26 percent to 64 percent implementation. Only 15 percent of the recommended capabilities were not implemented by any system. Level of care. Six studies evaluated systems for ambulatory care.632,653,667,798 -800 Features of the six ambulatory care studies centered around clinician experience using commercial proprietary systems, with CDSS capabilities being the most common feature used. KQ5. What factors influence sustainability (use and periodic updates) of health IT applications that support a phase of medication management continuum (prescribing, dispensing, administering, and patients ' taking of medicatio ns)? Sustainability of Health IT and Medication Management Systems AHRQ seeks to support activities that can demonstrate the effect of health IT on important outcomes relating to quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness. Moreover, AHRQ places priorit y on initiatives to identify and overcome barriers to health IT implementation and adoption and to foster long- term sustainability.808 Intuitively, a system 's sustainability refers to its capacity to continue providing value. Sustaining the benefit of heal th IT applications may require ongoing resources for maintenance and updating, training and support for those who use the systems, as well as institutional support that encompasses planning, implementation and maturing of the systems, and replacement as needed. Thus the concept of sustainability raises questions about the long- term viability of many health IT interventions, as well as important concerns about the potential health impact of migrating existing processes to less sustainable or costly forms. We conducted an additional comprehensive review of the literature to find a suitable operational definition and set of metrics of sustainable health IT. We found this necessary because we did not have, and could not readily find a prespecified definition that was widely accepted or supported in the literature of health IT. In search of a definition of sustainability relevant to health IT, we did additional searching in the core informatics journals using the key term \" sustainability \" to identify articles th at have discussed the concept (Table 27). Some articles defined sustainability quite narrowly (e.g., the decline of prescribing improvements once experimental alerts were removed from a system that had integrated CPOE and CDSS systems). We believe that the most relevant available definition comes from Humphreys and colleagues, 9 who defined sustainability as the ability of a health service to provide ongoing access to appropriate quality care in a cost effective and health - effective manner. Our literature re views revealed three important findings: although sustainability is mentioned frequently in the core informatics literature, it is poorly and infrequently defined, and none of the articles identified in the primary literature searching done to produce this evidence report explicitly studied sustainability. These findings were not entirely surprising. A previous AHRQ-sponsored Evidence Report that assessed the costs and benefits of health IT in pediatrics found only one article that explicitly discussed sust ainability. 21 88 2009 Table 27. Frequency of core informatics journal articles that mention sustainability to the end of Informatics Journal Frequency of mention of sustainability to the end of 2009 Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 28 Journal of Medical Internet Research 90 Medical Decision Making 3 Journal of Biomedical Informatics 9 International Journal of Medical Informatics 22 Methods of Information in Medicine 30 BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 9 Future Sustainability of Health IT and Medication Management Systems In 2009, the United States passed the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) act to authorize incentive payments through Medicaid and Medicare to clinicians and hospitals when they use electronic health records (EHRs) for patient care. The legislation ties payments specifically to the achievement of advances in health care processes and outcomes. Starting in 2011, the HITECH act will make available incentive payments totaling up to $27 billion over 10 years. This legislation will require substantial collaboration between health IT workforce professionals including those from IT, health information management, and biomedical informatics to accomplish its goals. According t o Dr. David Blumenthal, the U.S. National Coordinator for Health Information Technology at the Department of Health and Human Services, \"[this legislation] will lead us toward improvements and sustainability of our health care system that can only be attained with the help of a reliable and secure nationwide electronic health information system. \" 809 HITECH 's goal is not just based on the adoption, but also on the \"meaningful use\" of EHRs . Meaningful use is defined by a set of core health IT objectives that constitute an essential starting point, as well as an additional menu of activities which providers and hospitals will choose to implement during 2011 to 2012 (see Figure 5). 809 Overall, these features should help clinicians make better medical decisions and potentially avoid preventable errors. This legislation may lead to improvements and sustainability of health IT applications that specifically support the medication management continuum. For example, to receive incentive payments, eligible professionals (e.g., physicians, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), and hospitals (e.g., acute care hospitals and critical care access hospitals) must implement and use the following core set of objectives that relate to medication management: CPOE, e - Prescribing, implementation of at least one decision support rule, and maintenance of active medication and allergy lists . Eligible professionals and hospitals may implement and use the additional menu set of objectives that relate to medication management: in corporation of clinical laboratory test results in the EHRs, performance of medication reconciliation across care settings, and sending reminders to patients for followup care. Conclusions We conducted an additional literature review of the core informatics journals to identify articles that have discussed sustainability related to MMIT systems and found that while sustainability is not infrequently mentioned in this informatics literature, it is often poorly defined, and none of the articles included in this evidence report explicitly discussed sustainability. Future research should develop an operational definition of sustainability that can 89 be used to study its determinants. Moreover, it is likely that the HITECH Act of 2009 will lead to improvements and sustainability of health IT applications that specifically support the medication management continuum through meaningful use. 90 Figure 5. Summary overview of meaningful use objectives Source: New England Journal of Medicine , 2010.809 Used with permissio n. 91 5a. To what extent does the evidence demonstrate that health care settings (inpatient, ambulatory, long -term care, etc.) influence implementation, use, and effectiveness of such health IT applications? Implementation Reports of implementation tend to be opinion pieces or descriptive studies. A number of articles looked at some or all of implementation, adoption rates, and factors related to adoption. These focused mostly on CPOE in hospitals,789,810 -814 e-Prescribing, or ambulatory CPOE in primary care.48,172,794,796,815 -819 These articles did not meet our criteria for inclusion in KQ1: Effectiveness because of method s limitations. The general findings for hospitals show that implementation and adoption are generally greater in larger, academic, urban, public hospitals. Adoption in primary care practices tends to increase with younger, recent medical grads, larger practice size, and also with more specialized physicians. Yet, overall, actual usage of the systems is low with varying rates across MMIT syst ems, facilities, and groups of people. Poon and colleagues 820,821 discussed a number of barriers to CPOE implementation in U.S. hospitals, and provided recommendations to overcome the barriers based on experiences in successful hospitals. They categorized barriers into physician and organizational resistance, cost and lack of capital, and vendor or product immaturity. They further provided recommendations to overcome these barriers. Ash et al. 787 provided a consensus statement with a list of categories and considerations for a successful implementation of CPOE (see http://cpoe.org/ for more details). Their predominant themes to consider are: motivation for implementation; CPOE vision, leadership, and personnel; costs; integration; value to users; project management and implementation staging; the technology; ongoing staff training, support, and evaluation. These themes reflect the considerations for the values propositions of the various stakeholders as addressed in KQ3: Value Proposition. The implementatio n of a new health IT can have unintended consequences, often as a result of the interaction between the technology and the sociotechnical system within which it is implemented. This would include the workflows, culture, social interactions, and technologies in place. Harrison et al. 822 have modeled this interactive sociotechnical system to help users and implementers understand how and where unintended consequences could arise within a particular setting. Some examples of unintended consequences have been reported in this document, and our sections on intermediate and qualitative research in KQ 1: Effectiveness describe some information on workflows, social interactions, communication, and interdisciplinary work challenges with MMIT implementation . Assessing the potential impact of a new MMIT system using the framework of Harrison et al. 822 could easily help to avoid some of the unintended consequences reported to date. Beyond CPOE and e- Prescribing systems, the useable literature on implementation and adoption of other technologies is negligible. Some surveys did look at the adoption of various health IT applications for patient safety. Menachemi and colleagues 823 measured rates of adoption of CPOE, BCMA applications, pharmacy IT systems, pharmacy dispensing, EHRs, PDAs and CDSSs in Floridian acute care hospitals. Pharmacy systems were widely adopted (85 percent for IT systems and 64 percent for dispensing), and the rest ranged from 12 to 40 percent. They also studied health IT adoption in U.S. pediatric hospitals and found a fairly high level of adoption (almost 50 percent for EHRs, 40 percent CPOE, and 36 percent CDSS). Furukawa and colleagues 824 used national survey data to measure adoption of technologies across the United 92 States. They found a range of levels of adoption across technologies, from 62 percent for automated drug dispensing to five percent for BCMA. Their analysis supports the findings that hospital size, teaching status, hospital or clinical ownership, and system membership are associated with adoption. Robinson et al. 790 found that adoption of 19 health IT capabilities, including MMIT, was higher when practices were evaluated for pay- for-performance and public reporting purposes, and in practices participating in quality improvement initiatives . From our review of the qualitative literature, we find that unintended negative consequences, the need to develop workarounds including changes to workflow, and the resultant negative emotions generated with MMIT implementation are important to recognize and deal with in order to improve the success of implementation. The American Society of Health -System Pharmacists (ASHP) have published the results of an ongoing series of surveys assessing the adoption and use of pharmacy informatics applications in U.S. hospitals and trends in pharmacy practice. 825 Again the studies are descriptive surveys and not included in our KQ1: Effectiveness . They do, however, show how hospitals are progressing rapidly in their adoption of health IT used in their pharmacies.826,8 27 Effectiveness Due to the observational nature of many of the studies assessing health IT across settings, this question is difficult to answer. Hospitals and primary care are well-studied, especially for the two phases of prescribing and ordering, and monitoring. Gaps are seen in the other phases of medication management, and education and reconciliation. Further, some MMIT applications are well-studied while others, such as those that pharmacist s and nurses use, are less well -evaluated. A limited numbe r of studies are carried out in long- term care settings, pharmacies, or with patients at home, or other community settings. Many of the hospital- and clinic-based studies tended to show improvements in process with some, but limited, evidence of clinical improvements. These research gaps in settings, MMIT applications, and health professionals, together with proof of effectiveness are similar to the deficiencies seen with cost- effectiveness or other types of economics studies, especially full economic analy ses which are required to address and satisfy the definition of sustainability used here. Use From KQ1: Effectiveness we see that the study of use of systems is rarely done in a completely rigorous way. Articles that measure use tend to frame it in the co ntext of adoption and implementation, looking merely to ascertain if systems are used, not how they are used and if they are being used appropriately. Few measure levels of use. Again, the definition of sustainability is not met without the inclusion of ec onomics studies. 5b. What is the impact (challenges, merits, costs, and benefits) of having electronic access to patients ' computerized medication records, formulary information, billing information, laboratory records in the quality and safety of care pro vided by health IT applications that support at least one phase of the continuum of medication management (prescribing, dispensing, administering, and patients taking of medications)? Almost all of the MMIT applications we report were integrated with at least one other system. The systematic review in KQ1: Effectiveness addresses the effect of these integrated 93 technologies on a range of outcomes, many related to patient safety and health care quality. Evidence is available to address prescribing and also monitoring. The other phases are not well-evaluated. The study of patient access to their medication records and integration of these data into clinic and hospital information systems (EMRs and EHRs) is exciting. Some evidence exists that the use of MMIT i ntegrated into clinician -based systems holds much promise and will be an exciting area of research in the next decade. This is especially important with the efforts by the U.S. government to improve health care delivery and to implement health IT systems t o enhance this expanded delivery. KQ6. Two-Way Prescriber and Pharmacy Electronic Data Interchange (e - Prescribing) (a) What evidences exists demonstrating the barriers and drivers of implementation of complete EDI that can support the prescription, transm ittal and receipt, and perfection process of e-Prescriptions? (b) How do barriers, facilitators, and economic incentives vary across pharmacists, physicians and other relevant stakeholders with respect to adoption and use of complete EDI (e -Prescribing/ord ering with e - transmission)? All studies eligible for inclusion in this evidence report were reviewed to determine if they evaluated two -way, complete EDI between prescribers and pharmacies, commonly referred to as e-Prescribing. To be considered a true one- way e -Prescribing system the article had to describe a computer system used by a prescriber to generate a prescription (authorization to supply drug) that is transmitted electronically to a pharmacy information system. Further, for the system to be considered a two -way e -Prescribing system it had to be capable of transmitting a message from dispenser to prescriber by electronic means. This criterion is broadly consistent with the definition of e-Prescribing promulgated under the U.S. Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. 828 We did not consider systems used for inpatients of a hospital to be an e- Prescribing system; these technologies are reviewed elsewhere in the report, often under the rubric of CPOE systems. Summary of the Findings Thirty -three reports434,5 49,561,575,579,584 -586,645,668,724,730,736,797,800,801,806,829 -844 were checked for eligibility and only one585 met the above criteria for inclusion for bidirectional e- Prescribing systems. Nearly all systems self -described by investigators as \"e-Prescribi ng\" allowed physicians or other prescribers to generate a prescription through a software application that were later reproduced in paper form prior to being dispensed by a pharmacist (incomplete one- way e - Prescribing). One report 585 described an interrupt ed time -series study of a two -way e -Prescribing system intended to reduce the time required for prescribers to respond to pharmacist queries and refill requests. The authors did not describe any barriers or facilitators to uptake of the system used in the small pilot study. We have extrapolated key themes from the data available on one-way or incomplete one- way e-Prescribing to describe potential barriers and drivers to implementation of complete two- way EDI. These data may be useful indicators of issues that would need to be addressed before widespread implementation of two-way EDI would be expected to yield benefits for stakeholders. The following facilitators and barriers are listed in order of high to low frequency of mention in the reviewed literature. 94 Facilitators 1. External monetary or other incentives to prescribers . Nearly all reports of e -Prescribing implementations in the United States described some financial incentive that was offered to prescribers to adopt an e- Prescribing system.839 In most of t hose cases where no financial incentive was offered, the system was adopted by a health system that required its prescribers to adopt the system. 2. Supportive regulatory environment . Formal endorsement by regulators such as the State Boards of Pharmacy or Me dicine seemed necessary enablers for prescribers to adopt e- Prescribing systems. 736,839 3. Existence of some standard for prescription electronic data interchange. A set of messaging standards to enable the electronic flow of prescription information between diverse software platforms have been developed for use in the prescribing and order communication processes. 834,836,845 While not all standards have been judged suitable for implementation,839 the core set of standards currently available should facilitate further development and testing of e-Prescribing solutions. Barriers 1. Incomplete consideration of the effects of e-Prescribing on pharmacists and pharmacies . Most evaluations of one- way e -Prescribing systems conducted in the United States focused almost en tirely on the e- Prescribing system from the perspective of the prescriber, the prescriber's staff, or both.736,833 -836,838,839 Several of these reports described a lack of awareness of the e-Prescribing process on the part of pharmacies and pharmacists and a subsequent need to educate pharmacists on the specific e- Prescribing process adopted by the prescriber.736,835 Pharmacists and pharmacy staff generally reported that e- Prescribing systems negatively impacted their workflow.645,833,834 The authors of an AHRQ commissioned report839 on e-Prescribing pilot projects conclude that the prescribing workflow advantages observed for prescribers using e- Prescribing may actually reflect a burden shift to pharmacists. While reduced pharmacy to prescriber callback rates are touted as a potential advantage to e-Prescribing, the highest quality evidence available did not support a reduced callback rate. 575 A sample of e- Prescribing prescriptions sent to selected pharmacies in Denmark was prospectively compared with a sample of handwritten prescriptions sent to the same set of pharmacies. The investigators ' adjusted analysis indicated a significantly higher likelihood (relative risk, 1.7; 95 percent CI, 1.3 to 2.2) of pharmacy callbacks to prescribers for electronic compar ed with paper prescriptions. 575 This finding is especially significant as nearly two - thirds of prescriptions are transmitted electronically in Denmark.575,797 All pharmacies in Denmark are government owned and therefore likely share the same IT infrastructure. 2. Pharmacists are an essential part of the medication use process and better integration of e-Prescribing and pharmacy information systems through, at a minimum, one- way complete electronic data interchange should be a focus of further research. 3. Regulatory and legal uncertainties. Some participants in U.S. studies were unsure whether complete one- way e -Prescribing was permitted under relevant State laws. 736,839 e-Prescriptions for controlled substances were not evaluated as a component of the reviewed st udies because of the perceived prohibition on the use of e-Prescribing for these drugs under relevant State and/or Federal laws. Prescribers were also concerned 95 that notification by pharmacies of prescription fill status (filled or not filled) could increase their exposure to malpractice claims.839 4. Low preexisting adoption rate of EMRs and EHRs. Nearly all of the systems evaluated in the United States described the use of prescription writing software limited to generating e -Prescriptions, but without any other clinical record keeping functionality. 736,839 These systems generated prescriptions and retrieved pharmacy dispensing histories while requiring providers to concurrently maintain paper- based medical records. Prescribers report deferring adoption of e- Prescribing (prescription writing) systems in favor of complete EMR systems that include e -Prescribing functionality.839 Thus the low rate of EMR adoption in the U.S. likely decreases the rate of e-Prescribing adoption. Addressing barriers to EMR adoption800 may increase the rate of e-Prescribing amongst physicians and other providers. Summary of Evidence No reports documenting the use of complete two- way EDI (prescribing) systems were located in the literature search for this report. Evidence from the li mited set of one- way e - Prescribing studies was extrapolated to identify possible key facilitators and barriers to completely electronic, two -way e -Prescribing systems. Possible facilitators include monetary or other incentives to providers, a permissive regulatory environment, and the existence of enabling technical standards necessary for e-Prescribing. Barriers identified included the low rate of EMR adoption in the United States, regulatory and legal uncertainties, and inadequate consideration of the effects of e -Prescriptions on pharmacists and pharmacies. KQ7. What evidence exists regarding the extent of integration of electronic clinical decision support (CDS) in a health IT system for prescribing and dispensing of medications? To what extent does the use of CDSS in a health IT system for prescribing and dispensing of medications impact the various outcomes of interest including health care process, intermediate and clinical? Summary of the Findings: All Phases of Medication Management Seventy -seven RCT s in total were designated as primarily studying CDSSs related to medication management and with integration with studies are contained in Appendix C, Evidence Tables 13-15. These studies involved 4,709 providers and approximately 828,441 patients in total (numbers were not specified in all articles) . Patients included were primarily adults, with only two studies addressing issues specific to children. Seven studies addressed seniors exclusively. Currently, AHRQ has contracted with Duke University to prepare an evidence report focused on CDSS due for release in 2011. 8 All studies assisted with at least the prescribing (71 percent) or monitoring (29 percent) phases of medication management. Notably, none concentrated solely on the order communication, dispensing, or administering phases of medication management. Reconciliation and education were also not addressed. The studi es were much more likely to focus on process changes than clinical (patient \u00ad important) outcomes. Furthermore, many studies did not report directly which outcome was their 96 main endpoint\u2014a fundamental flaw. A total of 36 articles measured changes in process as their main endpoints, 24 of which were deemed to have positive results\u2014meaning that at least 50 percent of the changes in process measured showed that the MMIT improved medication management. Only five of 34 studies measuring clinical outcomes, whether a main endpoint or not, had a statistically significant impact on a clinical outcome. These five RCTs were all published recently (since January 2005), addressed primarily the prescribing and monitoring phases of MMIT, and a variety of disease and drug tar get groups, usually in an outpatient setting. 402,537,541,620,634 Where clinical outcomes were thought to be designated main endpoints, 12 of 16 studies showed no differences in clinical outcomes between intervention and control groups. 403,518 -520,526,528,624,630,637,697,699,700 No study was able to demonstrate a positive impact on mortality. Regarding integration of the CDSS, authors used various descriptions of other components of the integration. EMRs, EHRs, and hospital information systems were specified in 41 of the studies, and CPOE was integrated with CDSS in 10 studies, seven of which specified CPOE in addition to the EMR. Strengths and Limitations As per our inclusion criteria, all trials used randomization for allocation. However, by applying the V erhagen/AHRQ RCT quality scale,10 the overall quality of methods of the studies was generally only fair at best with a mean quality score of 4.4 out of total possible nine points. One of the most important features to avoid bias, allocation concealment was only described to a minimally acceptable degree by 25 studies. Twenty articles scored six or more and none of the studies scored the maximum nine points. Mean followup of the studies was 9.9 months. Twenty-four studies (31 percent) used a cluster design. This design is prone to bias. Cluster numbers are often small, and therefore, if clusters initially randomized to control group drop out, or participants within the clusters (who are known to be in the intervention or control group) are selected in a biased manner, trial results may not be valid. Overall, high quality is lacking from RCTs that address CDSS integrated with other types of health IT. Only a small minority of these focus on clinical outcomes \u2014those outcomes that are most important to guide decis ions of patients' providers and policymakers about these interventions. Furthermore, a very small number report improvement in these clinical outcomes. General Study Characteristics Of the 77 trials, 46 (60 percent) were rated as impacting primarily the prescribing phase of medication management, 12 (16 percent) aimed primarily at medication monitoring, 15 (19 percent) tried to impact both phases and one addressed administering. Three trials (4 percent) attempted to influence a mix of prescribing, monitoring, order communication, and administering phases of medication management. The setting for the studies was judged to be ambulatory care in 53 (69 percent), or hospital- based in 19 (25 percent), with a small minority based in long term care (two ( 3 percen t)), or other settings (three ( 4 percent)) such as community or home. Approximately half (36 or 47 percent) of these studies were id entified as associated with academic institutions. Health care providers were a target of the CDSS in 64 studies and included physicians in most cases where targets were specified. However, many studies did not address the specific type of provider targeted by the intervention. Three studies identified pharmacists as one of the 97 intervention targets and one study targeted nurse s specifically. Patients were named as targets of the intervention in 22 studies, 13 of which exclusively targeted patients. A wide variety of diseases and drugs were studied as the topic of the CDSS. Of the 42 studies where disease targets were mentioned, 19 dealt with vascular disease including risk factors, eight with diabetes, six with asthma, and four with infections, including HIV. Drug topics were evaluated in 42 studies\u201419 were vascular medications, 13 antibiotics or vaccines, and five addressed multiple medications. The CDSS system was known to be ' home grown' in 26 studies, a commercially available product in 14, a hybrid of both in four, and unknown in 33. Thirty -five CDSS were thought to be integrated with an EMR or EHR system. Fourteen were integrated with CPOE or prescription writing systems, another 17 with a laboratory or imaging system and ten other multiple systems. Characteristics of each of the CDSS were beyond the scope of this review, so it is unclear whether any signals from these RCT s indicated how a system should be designed, installed, maintained and training supplied, to optimize the chance of success. Similarly, we were not able to critique the suitability of control groups in this systematic review, which were typically described as usual care. Outcomes Of the 77 studies, 54 indicated in some way that they had a primary or main outcome and only 16 appeared to have designated a clinical outcome as a main endpoint. Clinical outcomes were defined liberally as any clinical morbidity, mortality, quality of life, adverse event, or clinical surrogate such as improved LDL cholesterol levels. Only eight studies addressed mortality in any way; none had a significant effect. Overall, only five studies noted a positive change in clinical out comes. 402,537,541,620,634 All were published since early 2005. Four of the five took place in an outpatient setting.537,541,620,634 The studies addressed venous thromboembolism prophylaxis,402 asthma control,634 cholesterol management,541 diabetes care,537 and recommended drugs.620 The mean quality score of these five studies was only 4.8 out of nine. Two studies with the highest methodologic quality (six out of nine) are further described. One evaluated a CDSS which calculated venous thromboembolism risk and recommended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis when the risk was high thus improving their main endpoint of venous thromboembolism rates in a group of inpatients primarily with cancer. The other used a university affiliated managed care plan data to identify gaps in recommended drug therapy and monitoring to recommend drugs to stop or add, or for monitoring to take place. However, this analysis was based on a post-hoc outcome applied to a subgroup of the original participants and the changes in hospitalization are very high given the small change in recommendation use. In summary, we found no consistent impact of CDSS on clinical outcomes, and the quality of the studies is generally inadequate. In 38 studies, a process endpoint was determined to be a main endpoint. In 26 cases, the process was judged to be positively affected; with improvement in at least 50 percent of the process measures reported. The changes in process measured in these studies generally dealt with reminders about recommended medications or vaccines, 403,404,407,410,509,525,530,535,536 dose adjustments,398,412 recommended laboratory monitoring for medications prescribed or chronic disease management,412,504,513,516,612,619,771 'inappropriate' medications avoided,397,413,416,507,508,512,53 3 and other similar outcomes. Some of the alerts or reminders were based on established guidelines, while others were assessing more locally derived quality measures and standards of care. 98 Only one of the studies we reviewed scored at least eight out of nine for the AHRQ methods quality assessment. Terrell et al.416 randomized 63 emergency physicians to receive or not receive alerts to disrupt intended prescriptions of nonrecommended medications for seniors to be discharged from the emergency department . The CDSS resulted in a small decrease in the number of visits with a nonrecommended prescription from 3.9 percent to 2.6 percent (95 percent CI 0.34 to 0.89, p = 0.02). No clinical outcomes were measured in this study. One article measured a composite score in which a shared CDSS to support the primary care of diabetes improved the process of care and some clinical markers of the quality of diabetes care. 771 One other study evaluated whether actively or passively displaying context -sensitive links to infrequently accessed educational materials and patient information using an inpatient CPOE would affect access rates to the materials, and found that the active alerts were more effective. 638 Notably, the negative effects of the CDSS intervention were virtually never reported. Specifically, only two studies referred to any harm incurred by the study intervention.508,630 This implicates a major publication bias, a result of not requiring studies to measure and report on harm. In terms of costs, 11 studies reported that they had intended to measure costs or cost- effectiveness. However, no full cost- effectiveness analysis was found as part of the RCT. Separate publications on resource utilization are covered in the KQ1: Effectiveness section on economics outcomes. Summary In summary, despite it being 34 years since the first RCT619 in 1976, in this important area of health IT research, little high quality evidence shows a consistently positive effect of CDSS on clinical outcomes. Implementers, developers, and funders of MMIT applications need to continue to produce and rely on the best possible research evaluating outcomes important to people and institutions. The informatics world can strengthen their abilities to determine value for money in MMIT projects by obtaining input during planning for research projects from health technology appraisal methods and those who have expertise in clinical care, research methods, informatics, statistics, and stakeholders who will be affected by the MMIT system. 846 99 Discussion Summa ry of Key Findings We have presented the results of a systematic review of the literature regarding the use of health IT to enable all phases of medication management as well as reconciliation and education. We have focused on MMIT systems that were integr ated with other health IT systems. Our review identified a total of 7 89 studies dealing with health IT and medication management. Three hundred and sixty-one of these articles were only listed in the bibliography of this report and were not synthesized because they did not include comparative data, statistical methods, or qualitative methods. The remaining 428 articles were synthesized after being identified from an initial retrieval of 40,582 articles. We used these 428 articles to address the seven key questions (KQs) . Overall, we found that the literature on MMIT applications was heterogeneous. The majority were based on observational methods, often with identifiable opportunity for bias (e.g., descriptive before and after studies without statistical adju stment for time trends or group differences). Research methods were not uniform across MMIT applications, with 77 of 88 RCTs studying CDSS. KQ1. Effectiveness Process and other outcomes related to use and satisfaction with MMIT were often improved, especi ally for prescribing and ordering and the monitoring phases. Improvements in the appropriateness of prescribing and decreased errors (e.g., correct doses and timing, better choices of antibiotics, fewer drug-drug interaction potentials, and corrected doses related to body weight or liver function) seem to be consistently shown. Changes in workflow, improvements in communication, and improved efficiencies such as time reductions are also positive, although fewer studies addressed these types of outcomes. Clinical endpoints were sometimes found to be improved with the use of MMIT, more often in the observational studies than in controlled clinical trials. CDSS applications and, to a lesser extent, CPOE systems have been shown to be useful, especially when stud ying prescribing and monitoring in hospitals and clinics. Notable was the identification of strong emotions expressed by users of CPOE (clinicians), both positive and negative, which were reported in the qualitative studies. A number of unintended consequences of the technologies were found, some of which were unfortunate and some of which were beneficial. Few cost studies and full economic evaluations were identified. Those articles that were included found that health IT interventions may offer cost advantages despite their increased acquisition costs. Proof of clinical improvements and economic effectiveness through the use of MMIT is lacking. However, given the uncertainty that surrounds the cost and outcomes data, and limited study designs available in the literature, it is difficult to reach any definitive conclusion as to whether the additional costs and benefits represent value for money. KQ2. Gaps in Evidence and Knowledge The major gap in the research is true full economic evaluations, weighing all costs and benefits of the various MMIT technologies across all settings and participants. For the effectiveness research, we found gaps were related to setting (few studies were carried out in pharmacies, long -term care facilities, homes, or communities), people (few studies assessing outcomes for pharmacists, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, other health professionals including dentists and psychologists, or patients and families), and MMIT 100 technologies (rigorous studies of all but CDSS and CPOE, and especially those related to dispensing and administering, were sparse). Prescribing and monitoring were relatively well- studied while order communication, dispensing, administering, reconciliation, and education were understudied. Gaps were al so found in the sophistication and complexity of the quantitative research methods. Many of the studies initially identified were descriptive in nature. These are listed in the bibliography of this report. Qualitative studies and the quantitative studies t hat were hypothesis-based and comparative were analyzed. A good number of the studies, including those that were more strongly controlled (e.g., RCTs and cohort studies), often had methodology or reporting flaws or both including inconsistent use of standard methods for identifying and describing their methods, poorly justified or incorrect choices, or poor application of statistical tests and failure to adjust for group differences or cluster randomization. We also often found underpowered studies and situation -specific studies that were difficult to generalize or transfer to other settings or situations . In addition, we found substantial deficiencies in reporting data important to the understanding of published studies. Although we identified data deficie ncies in many aspects of studies, most serious were in descriptions of baseline data related to what was in place with respect to medication management in the health care setting before implementation of the MMIT system and descriptions of the MMIT implementation itself. Context is important for understanding studies and assessing their potential for application; detailed information on the setting and participants was also not often provided in studies. KQ3. Value Proposition for Implementers and Users Value propositions are determined by the balance of financial, clinical and organizational benefits. Limited data were available to address these issues comprehensively. Of note, we found that the various stakeholders had very different needs, perceptions, a nd access to MMIT systems and this must be addressed in valuing systems. KQ4. System Characteristics Different features of MMIT are important to various groups and settings. Very few studies (n = 21) reported on the specific feature sets of the systems being used and their links to purchase, implementation, and use. Few head- to-head comparisons using comparative effectiveness analysis methods, for example, were found. The evidence identified uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to gain an understanding of which features are important to users and stakeholders. Of note, we found that desired feature sets differed between the planning phase (perceived to be of value) and after implementation (based on actual use). KQ5. Sustainability Sustainability is vital to health IT. Before it can be fully understood and studied, it must be defined. For this document we chose to use a definition of sustainability that suggests sustainable systems are cost effective and clinically -effective. Because the evidence on economics data are lacking, we can add only a small amount of information on the sustainability of MMIT applications. Some data exist on effectiveness and use. We have included some data on patterns and characteristics that are important to use, includi ng data on barriers and facilitators of successful implementations and ongoing system use. Use is higher in physicians, larger and 101 better funded organizations, hospital settings, some larger primary care groups, and in academic medical centers. KQ6. Two-Way EDI Very little evidence exists on bidirectional communication between pharmacists and physicians to enhance the order communication process. Extrapolation of data on one- way communication, factors that work to increase electronic communication on medic ations between prescribers and pharmacists are external incentives, a supportive regulatory environment, and existence of standards for prescribing EDI. Three factors work against effective EDI: incomplete consideration of the workflow and financial effect s of e -Prescribing on pharmacists and pharmacies, regulatory and legal uncertainties, and low adoption rates of EDI capable EMR systems. Further development and evaluation of two-way EDI technologies for outpatient order communication regarding drugs is required to facilitate adoption. Pharmacies and pharmacists should take a more active role in the EDI development and evaluation process. KQ7. RCTs in CDSS CDSS applications are well -studied although problems with methods and reporting exist. CDSS is probably the best studied type of MMIT in terms of studies with strong methods and a sufficient number of studies to provide reliable answers to research questions of any of the MMIT applications. The first RCT was published in 1976, over 35 years ago. Of the 88 RCTs in this document, 77 are on CDSSs. The quality and sophistication of study methods, analysis, and reporting of the RCTs has improved over time, and there tends to be more measurement of clinical outcomes. However, evaluations of health care delivery, such as comparisons of effectiveness of treatment or prevention methods (e.g., drugs, services, and medical devices) are held to a higher standard than the types of reported research projects included in this evidence report. The studies in this report, while they met their own research objectives, collectively do not contain the research designs and associated clarity of findings to be able to definitively inform patients, clinicians, and policymakers regarding the effectiveness and overall impact of CDSS applications. Furthermore, the more rigorous and transferable research conducted tends to show no or limited effect on patient- important clinical outcomes . This report was not designed to evaluate specific MMIT applications. In addition, MMIT interventions were not catalogued and characterized in great detail. Therefore we found no obvious themes that would suggest that a certain type of MMIT intervention with a certain type of implementation for a certain type of user in a particular setting would be successful. However, the following areas of commonality emerged in our analysis. General 1. Research to date has concentrated on measurement of process changes and descriptive and pilot studies. In addition, some studies based on stronger methods have failed on issues such as adequate concealment of allocation and blinding, poor understanding of some methods, lack of adjustment of groups, and statistical challenges. Processes in health care are poor surrogates for clinical - or patient- important clinical outcomes, therefore it is important that new studies address clinical outcomes and use the most appropriate methods, and use them correctly, to adequately study MMIT applications. Researchers should also be encouraged to consider the generalizability or transferabili ty of their results for all of their projects. Researchers in health IT could strengthen their 102 studies by using interdisciplinary teams with representation of multiple stakeholders, learning from other domains such as health technology assessment and economics, and with better reporting of their studies and results. 2. Standard and accepted definitions are lacking for MMIT applications, as well as standards for presenting the results of studies of health IT applications. Definitions are inconsistent for MMIT applications (e.g., e-Prescribing, CPOE, EMR, or EHR hospital information systems), study designs (e.g., observational or before-after), and outcomes (e.g., adverse drug events, adverse drug effects, prescribing errors, or errors per patient, 100 orders, day, hospital day, or physician). This has made identification of studies, data abstraction , synthesis of evidence, and presentation of findings challenging. Many study reports did not include important information that would have made this report stronger. Noticeable deficiencies centered on the MMIT application, its setting within the institution, training and implementation details, and maintenance and updating information. Professional associations interested in MMIT are pushing for standardization of definitions. AHRQ can join this movement for more standardization of terminology and definitions. Effectiveness 1. Interventions most frequently targeted prescribing and monitoring stages of the medication use process. 2. Physicians who provided care in the hospi tal and ambulatory care settings were most likely to be the target of the intervention. 3. CDSS and CPOE applications were the most frequently studied type of health IT application studied. Seventy-seven of the 88 RCTs in this report study CDSSs. 4. Improvements in prescribing accuracy and decreased errors such as appropriate scheduling and choice of medications, prescribing taking into account weight- based dosing and dosing based on liver function, avoidance of drug-drug interactions and potential allergies and in being in accordance with guideline recommendations were consistently identified as improvements with the use of MMIT. Workflow, communication, interaction with peers and time considerations were found to be improved less often. 5. Studies that used health IT to identify and intervene on patients with actual problems (e.g., elevated blood pressure) or needed care (e.g., hemoglobin A 1c monitoring) appear to be more effective than CDSS approaches that identify potential problems (e.g., potential adverse drug events) . This was particularly true when patient -centered principles were employed, such as providing patients with reminders and decision support recommendations about their current health status. However, this may be alternatively explained by the greater difficulty in measuring outcomes, such as potential for ADEs. 6. Studies that have been successful in improving a patient' s clinical outcomes target high risk and vulnerable populations who have poor disease control, 515,610,624,693 lack sufficient access to health care providers to manage their condition,408 or subpopulations with sufficient economic resources to respond to the CDSS intervention.694 7. The effect of similar CPOE systems on mortality can vary substantially as a function of the extent to which i mplementation strategies disrupt or delay critical activities in the clinical setting, or demand additional time for order -entry from clinical staff. 103 8. Highly targeted interventions, focused on specific medical problems appear to be demonstrated as more eff ective than more diffusely focused CDSS and CPOE. Again this may be due to the greater difficulty in measuring the outcomes of diffusely focused CDSS and CPOE in the generally smaller sample size (and inadequate power) studies that were identified. Qualita tive 1. No qualitative studies were identified that directly addressed the effect of an MMIT system on intermediate health care outcomes for any phase of the medication management continuum (prescribing, order communication, dispensing, administering and moni toring). Patient safety was the main health outcome mentioned in qualitative studies. Before MMIT implementation, most studies found that clinicians expected that the MMIT system would improve patient safety. Once implemented, most clinicians felt that MMI T did improve patient safety. 2. Differences in study outcomes for similar qualitative studies across settings were not apparent, suggesting that findings from qualitative studies could be transferrable across settings. 3. Despite the willingness of many of the participants to use a new MMIT system designed to improve prescribing and ordering of medications including CPOE, reservations were expressed by some implementers that the MMIT system and the resulting change in workflow would impair existing interactions and relationships among health care providers and between physicians and patients. 4. MMIT systems often substantially facilitated clinicians ' monitoring of patients' adherence with their prescribed medication regimen.737 However, barriers were reported to us ing health IT systems for medication monitoring in some situations.747 For example, clinicians caring for patients with HIV/AIDS using a CPOE and CDSS system integrated with the hospital, pharmacy, and laboratory systems identified six barriers to using reminders, including workload, time to document, reminders that did not apply, inapplicability of reminders to the situation, lack of training to teach the users how best to use the new or modified system, quality of provider-patient interaction, and use of paper forms. 747 5. From qualitative studies, system design including workflow changes, challenges with the system interface and new communication processes demonstrated that without adequate attention to system changes, the new kinds of medical errors with potential detrimental impact to patient safety could occur. Unintended negative consequences including the need to develop workarounds (one-off or nonstandardized changes) to workflow and the frustration generated in some studies with MMIT implementation are important to recognize and deal with to improve the success of implementation. 6. MMIT implementation did not just mean that a clinician needed to learn a new IT system but it also affected most of the other parts of the delivery of care processes, including how the interdisciplinary care team worked together. Economics and C osts 1. Cost analyses can provide useful information on 'upfront' costs compared with 'downstream' cost avoidance if they explicitly measure all direct health care costs (e.g., capital cost s, health professionals' time), direct nonhealth care costs (e.g., home care 104 services, transportation) as well as indirect costs (e.g., productivity gains or losses) that could be affected by the intervention of interest. 2. It is important to be aware that the greatest reported costs associated with these health IT are associated with the purchase of new software to add to preexisting EMR systems, as well as implementation costs (e.g., management, clinical team involvement, training costs) and maintenance costs. This assumes a large investment has already been made to purchase, implement, and maintain an MMIT system. 3. The full enumeration of the total costs needs to be synthesized with the consequences or outcomes of the intervention (i.e., cost- effectiveness analysis, cost -utility analysis, and cost-benefit analysis). Full economic evaluations linked to clinical outcomes need to be done. 4. Adoption of newer technologies needs to be based on formal evaluation of whether the additional health benefit (effectiveness) is worth the additional cost. Given the tension between the clinical benefits of CPOE and CDSS and the high up-front costs, decisionmakers deciding whether to implement CPOE and CDSS need to better understand how and when financial benefits of such sys tems accrue (e.g., short -term compared with long- term benefits). These types of analyses are important for well - informed decisionmaking. Unintended Consequences 1. Unintended consequences, both positive and negative, were found across many of the studies as m ain endpoints, or were alluded to in others. Some were minor and some much more serious. A tracking system of major and clinically important unintended consequences would be useful for many audiences and should be considered by system developers and fundin g agencies. CDSS 1. Many studies have evaluated CDSS tools for improving the effectiveness of anticoagulants (proportion of days in therapeutic range for anticoagulants) and improving the choice, route, duration of antibiotics, and reducing ADEs related to antibiotic use, and most are successful. 2. Sophisticated CDSS and other advanced clinical support should be built to insure added clinical value without being burdensome to those who use them. These sophisticated systems are difficult to develop, implement, and maintain. Values 1. Values related to MMIT systems and implementations need to be determined from all stakeholders. Clinicians, administrators, and likely patients and their families have different values and place varying importance on each. System Characteristics 1. Most often authors spoke about barriers and concerns towards implementation and acceptance, rather than characteristics of MMIT that could facilitate implementation, purchase, and use of such systems. 105 Two-Way EDI 1. Two-way EDI between prescriber s and pharmacists is not common. Both facilitators and barriers exist that impact movement to implementation of e -Prescribing and two- way communication designed to enhance and streamline prescription optimization. Limitations Our review has a number of limitations. With the exception of PDA applications using patient -specific input, we focused on applications that enable medication management and that are integrated with other health IT systems. A number of technologies, such as smart intravenous pumps, bar-code scanners, and reporting systems for diabetes or asthma monitoring were not integrated with other health IT systems and were thus excluded. Indexing of individual articles in electronic databases is poor. Although we tried to be thorough in our search methods, we feel that we did not capture all potential articles \u2014a very difficult task in new and multidisciplinary areas of study. Further, we concentrated only on the main or major endpoints reported in studies with comparison groups and hypothesis testing. Given the heterogeneity in the literature, it was often difficult to discern main endpoints; where possible we determined main endpoints as those declared as such, or those that were the basis of power calculations (infrequently), or were stated to be main outcome measures in the abstract or objectives. We identified instances where the main endpoint was not clear. In these cases we gave priority to outcomes related to medication management and clinically important patient outcomes. We did not test the replicability of our abstraction of these outcomes. Because of the lack of clear definitions on some of the technologies and issues associated with health IT, we were unable to address some key questions as thoroughly as we would have liked. This is espe cially noted in KQ5 relating to sustainability and KQ3 on value propositions. We feel that these are important issues for all health IT, that need to be addressed to effectively answer questions about ongoing use and effectiveness of these technologies. It has proven difficult to synthesize the evidence on such a range of technologies, implemented in a number of settings and used by various stakeholders. Each intervention is so complex that it is often difficult to tell which studies are assessing the same processes. Also, outcome measures used by authors were variable. For example, similar outcomes such as prescribing changes were measured as changes in daily doses; prescribing rates per hospital, per physician, per 1,000 patient days, etc. The number of or ders and compliance rates were difficult to extract and synthesize. Our ability to draw conclusions is also reliant on the quality of the evidence we have found. In most cases, the research relies on observational studies, with RCTs and other methodologie s with stronger controls only available on a select group of health ITs and phases of medication management. Even in the case of CDSSs, a lack of RCTs addressing electronic decision support integrated with other types of health IT still exists. Only a small minority of these studies focus on clinical outcomes\u2014the endpoints that are most important to guide decisions by patients , providers and policymakers, about adopting these interventions. Furthermore, a very small number report improvement in these clinic al outcomes. We found great variation in the level of description of the health IT employed, with studies frequently lacking details on standards, hardware, integration, implementation dates and processes, and other similar factors. A large number of studies neglected to report the study dates 106 (see Evidence Tables in Appendix C). We repeat Chaudhry' s call for a set of standards for reporting on health IT research.607 Although the absence of a contemporaneous comparable control group is a problem with all observational studies, the creation of control groups by comparing intervention patients to those that do not participate, or do not have a problem to those that do is fundamentally far more likely to introduce major bias in the comparison (e.g., comparing patients with alerts to no alerts, 18 pharmacists volunteering to provide the intervention compared with those that do not volunteer, 694 and other similar problems701). The direction of the bias will depend on the study. Many observational studies suffered from selecting an outcome that was distantly or only marginally related to the intervention. Length of stay, all- cause ADEs were examples of this problem. Gurwitz and colleagues697 were able to show that only one-third of ADEs could have been prevented by the CDSS alerts provided. Moreover, in a substantial proportion of negative studies, minimal adoption was seen. The clinicians failed to adjust therapy or treatment based on recommendations, and thus it is not very surprising to find that the interventions had no effect on outcomes. Finally, the rate of some outcomes such as readmission, mortality, and nosocomial infections was too low to detect clinically meaningful differences if they had existed with the numbers involved in the study. Implications The s trength of this document lies in the breadth of health IT applications used across the phases of medication management, and in the organization of those findings, both through synthesizing the body of evidence by key questions and a tabular presentation of those findings. A review of this scope for MMIT has not been completed previously. We searched for literature across many domains and reviewed a substantial number of studies. The implications of the report fall within the purview of future research, policy, and evaluation. We have detailed gaps in evidence in KQ2 and future research needs in Chapter 5. Important implications of this evidence report exist for health care decisionmakers, especially AHRQ and the U.S. National Coordinator of Information Technology. A large amount of health care spending in the United States is currently being funneled into development and implementation of various health ITs. Certainly the burden of evidence is towards positive effects on process changes and measures of satisfaction and perceived benefits among users. These early indications are logical precursors to changes in demonstrated effects in benefits such as quality of care and clinical outcomes, economic benefits, or both as the technologies advance and mature. A lack of proven effectiveness in improving patient outcomes and a lack of studies on value and cost- effectiveness still exist. Currently, most systems are in their infancy and need to be continued to be scrutinized for effectiveness and safety. Because MMIT systems specifically, and health IT in general, are expensive to develop, support, and update, it is essential that these burgeoning health ITs be rigorously assessed for cost-effectiveness and clinical -effectiveness . This effectiveness information is essen tial for policymakers who are allocating scarce health care resources which have multiple competing priorities. Computerization of health care will continue with the adoption of more and newly developed MMIT and other health IT applications. Clinicians, researchers, policy advisors, and health administrators should be prepared for a major investment of time and resources for implementation and use. They need to consider direct and indirect effects on health care processes such as altered work flows, adverse patient outcomes, and indirect costs. Because of the paucity of successful clinical outcome studies, and the heterogeneity of the systems, the 107 specific interventions, and measures of effectiveness, this systematic review has been unable to clarify which f actors of topic, design, or implementation may assist in the success of the MMIT. Administrators will be able to plan for implementation better using the quantitative and qualitative findings and results. They will also be able to use this report to balance their expectations of MMIT installations and interact better with vendors and consultants. Researchers and research funders will have a roadmap of the evidence that supports the effectiveness of MMIT applications, an outline of gaps, and lists of remaining challenges. Researchers should be aware of quality and reporting issues related to research methods as described in this review, as well as the need for research teams to include expertise or consultation from all clinician groups affected by the technology, informaticians, and those with research skills in a wide range of methodologies (research synthesis, complex interventions, pragmatic trials, usability studies, statistical planning and analysis, health technology assessment methods, and knowledge translation skills). Researchers and evaluators also need to adhere to established publication guidelines such as the STARE- HI guidelines 783 for presenting results of their studies, to ensure that readers will have the information they need to plan for implementation of MMIT systems. The meaningful use objectives should also be deployed in all projects and implementations. Research funders can direct their programs and reinforce use of standard definitions, reporting standards, and meaningful use objectives. They can also encourage multicenter trials and those that have potential for broad applicability. Adherence of the MMIT systems to local, regional, and national standards is also important to encourage and foster. At the same time, incremental studies which show the transferability and reproducibility of findings from one study to other health care settings, systems (vendors), and health care issues (type of disease or patient and setting) should also be encouraged. Although the strength and breadth of the body of evidence supporting the usefulness of MMIT for improving health care is not uniform across people, places, and technology, it still is substantial. We can learn much from reviewing the original studies and systematic reviews on MMIT. We also feel that the content of this report can help us leverage our existing knowledge of MMIT to a broader audience and that this can improve the health and health IT effectiveness for many people in various health care settings. 108 Future Research We reviewed a larg e body of literature from many domains. From a content point of view, medication management information technology (MMIT) is well -covered, although coverage in the literature is not uniform for all aspects of MMIT. Effective medication management is important for many people and costly for individuals and society. Medications themselves are changing and becoming more complex with the emergence of new drugs and the integration of health information and genomics research to set the stage for individualized he alth care. As the population ages, we start to rely more on medications, and polypharmacy becomes standard. At the same time that the management of drugs and medications is becoming more complex and costly, the move to health IT is occurring at an increasing rate and with increasing sophistication. Newer health IT applications hold tremendous potential for patients through their health care providers and also with the move to self- management of chronic diseases, patient -centered care, personal health record systems tethered to electronic medical record systems (EMRs), and automatic monitoring devices built into smart homes to increase and prolong independence. We provide some future directions for consideration (Table 28). We saw much that was exciting and challenging in the evidential base of MMIT in this report. Future research should be conducted in those areas we have identified that can build on the existing evidence, address the gaps that have become evident, and to support trends that can improve the quality, efficiency, and cost of health care. The section on KQ2: Knowledge and Evidence Gaps has additional and supporting information. Table 28. Issues of consideration and/or further exploration in future research Research Methods: Research studies wit h control groups, statistically appropriate comparisons, and sufficient power and funding to produce unequivocal answers. These studies should recognize that MMIT applications need to be treated as complex interventions and evaluated as pragmatic studies (i.e., can they work in real life situations and settings). We need large overarching trials of complete systems, and we also need smaller scale research and evaluation of the components of MMIT systems. Studies of components, such as two-way communication between pharmacists and prescribers or email between caregivers and patients are important to aid in our understanding of the contribution that each makes towards building a complete MMIT system (complex interventions). Multicenter studies. Most studies seem to focus within a single organization using the same system and often done by those who built or developed the application. Multicenter studies can be supported, including involvement of centers that use different systems. A single study can yield valuable information about the system deployed as well as the organizational culture around the acceptance and use of the system, but understanding and enabling of generalizabilty or applicability and interoperability are more likely to occur with multicenter s tudies. Studies and guidance of how best to conduct usability studies and how to make their results applicable and available to others with the same or similar applications, target populations, and clinical settings. Tool kits, training sessions, and encouragement to publish usability studies are important steps towards improved usability testing and transfer of knowledge rated to the findings of these usability studies. Adherence to standardized reporting and communication guidelines such as STARE -HI for published articles and technical reports. Consistency in reporting details of systems include substantial details and descriptions of the features and characteristics of the MMIT system, and how it fits into existing systems, priorities, and cultures of the institution; settings and user groups; exact details of the interaction of the system with clinicians and patients; and concise reporting of the outcomes assessed. Research into studying how best to collect and analyze existing health data from patient care records (e.g., EMRs and EHRs) to produce new knowledge related to treatment outcomes, prognostic information and other related health issues. Newer methods to collect (harvest and analyze) research data from clinical health IT systems deserve further s tudy taking into account ethics, privacy, and security issues. \" 109 Table 28. Issues of consideration and/or further exploration in future research (cont inued ) Research Needs: Studies for order communication, dispensing and administering phases, and related aspects of medication management such as post -professional and professional education, electronic medication reconciliation, and health information exchange methods and standards. Studies in pharmacy settings to better understand how MMIT can be used to improve interprofessional communication, communication between pharmacists and patients, and prescribing outcomes. Studies that focus on patient -centered MMIT applications, such as medication adherence and automated and self-reported measures of monitoring medications tied to integrated systems. Studies of issues related to standards and interoperability and how these affect generalizabilty or transferability, and the spread of MMIT across institutions and geographic regions. Studies targeting nonphysician s including pharmacists, advanced practitioners (e.g., nurse practitioners and physician assistants), nurses, mental health professionals, and patients, as well as formal and informal caregivers who might use MMIT applications as part of providing care. RCTs and other studies with appropriate methods that concentrate, if possible, on clinical outcomes related to the use of medications and detailed costs. Special consideration needs to be given to adherence to accepted research methods and newer research methods such as cluster randomization. Studies of MMIT that leverage existing sources of electronic data such as clinical chemistry, hematology, and therapeutic drug monitoring across various health care settings to improve laboratory -based medication monitoring. Recognition that genomic data will likely have a major effect on choices of medications once the research has evolved to the extent where drug treatment decisions can be made for individuals based on their genetic profiles. This genomic information will become an essential part of the data in the next generation of CDSSs and will likely need to be evaluated as such. Qualitative and mixed methods studies on the effects of MMIT from the perspective of the patients and their existing needs and values and the implications of developing MMIT applications. Qualitative and mixed methods studies to provide a greater understanding of the role, function, and effects of MMIT on clinician workflow, inter -and intra-personal communication and satisfaction. Studies in older adults who reside in long-term care settings (e.g., nursing homes, assisted living, home- based primary care) and studies that centre on the geriatric population and those with complex care needs related to medications. Studies with pediatric populations in inpatient and outpatient settings. Improved methods of dissemination of MMIT research methodologies, strategies, and results. Those interested in MMIT can learn much from those who have expertise in clinical and translational research and knowledge translation (i.e., application of research findings) using improvement science principles. Comparative effectiveness research to compare the effect of more than one type of MMIT on process or outcomes. Data on unintended positive and negative consequenc es of MMIT applications should be collected and disseminated with priority given to those consequences that have substantial potential for harm or benefit or occur frequently. Sophisticated concurrent prospective economic evaluations conducted in the real world to address whether MMIT interventions are cost effective are vital for policymakers and decisionmakers. Studies of the ability to apply standard health technology appraisal methods to improve the ability to determine value for money of MMIT interventions to show if these methods should be adopted. Study the value of feature sets of the various technologies and how they impact purchasing and use for multiple MMIT intervention stakeholders and insure that results are applicable to multiple stakeholder s. Studies must include multiple stakeholders: clinicians, other health care providers, patients, caregivers, administrators, vendors, computer programmers, etc. Study of how best to keep systems that rely on a strong knowledge base (e.g., CDSS, CPOE, order sets, drug- drug interaction programs) current with new scientific knowledge (i.e., guaranteeing the fidelity of evidence-based knowledge resources) Develop a more relevant operational definition of sustainability related to MMIT applications, and require future studies to state explicitly how they intend on studying and reporting on these results. Consensus meeting of experts on the types of preferred research methods to ascertain effectiveness and ensure production and reporting of quality evidence. Series of related studies, building sequentially, testing interventions across facilities, vendors, and settings to improve applicability and transferability of research findings. 110 Need for High Quality E vidence High quality evidence is lacking in many MMIT phases, care settings, and populations (Table 29). Despite the fact that many RCTs exist in the MMIT literature, they are concentrated in certain areas: 77 of 88 RCTs evaluated CDSSs. The prescribing and monitoring phases have a strong base of studies and systematic reviews. Almost completely lacking were studies in the other phases. For this report we provide the numbers of studies and research methods used (Table 29). In addition, we used the bibliographies and summaries from more than 100 systematic and narrative review articles for this report. Table 29.

These articles were not formally evaluated but are listed in the bibliography. We need well -designed research studies with control groups and appropriate analysis. Research needs center on issues related to: Appropriate methods for MMIT and the needs of the stakeholders. Important issues are multicentered studies, research teams with a broad experience or consultation in research methods, statistical analyses, clinical care, and informatics, and that represent the interests of all groups involved in the use of the MMIT system. Recognition that MMIT applications are complex interventions and their evaluation must reflect their u se in real life settings and situations (i.e., complex interventions methods and pragmatic trials). Qualitative and mixed methods studies to understand issues related to workflow, communications, interdisciplinary collaboration and care processes, and patient use and values. We also found that certain technologies (CDSSs, either stand -alone or integrated with CPOE systems) are well -studied. Although much data exist, as these CDSS and CPOE systems evolve and have greater penetration among health care settin gs, we should continue to evaluate their effectiveness. The tools that are outside the prescribing phase of medication management and the health IT tools that pharmacists, nurses, other health care professionals, and patients use are less well-studied\u2014fewer studies and weaker methods. Need for Well-D esigned Research Despite having 88 RCTs in the MMIT literature base, many of the studies have weaknesses. This is shown by the low quality scores, most of which were in the range of four to five out of nine points. In addition, we saw errors and poor methods in published studies. For example, most of the RCTs with clinical outcomes (n = 28) used cluster randomization methods to allocate 111 clinical units or clinicians to study groups, but analyzed and reported results based on patients or medication events. Many authors did not test or adjust for clustering so that complex analyses could be accomplished appropriately. We also identified problems with poor application of methods in most other research studies. Traini ng informaticians in research methodology and statistical methods is crucial. Many programs sponsored by the U.S. National Library of Medicine and other institutions are graduating health informaticians. Training programs are content-rich because of the breadth of the field. Formal training and experience in the research methods and statistical analyses components of the training initiatives might be useful to determine what is being taught and if it is sufficient to produce researchers who are competent in evaluating MMIT and other health IT systems. By settings and levels of care. Adult hospitals were relatively well -studied and we have sufficient evidence to show that MMIT systems for ordering medications improve processes and reduce medication errors. Adult ambulatory care clinics were also well -represented in the literature, although studies of errors and error prevention have not been done. Additional studies are especially needed in the nursing home setting, where some 1.6 million people receive care annually, and concern continues about the quality of pharmaceutical care, the frequency of polypharmacy, and an insufficient health care workforce with a poorly developed safety culture. Other long-term care settings such as assisted living and home- based primary care also need more research. The number of older adults continues to increase rapidly and they frequently have multiple comorbidities resulting in complex medication regimens, polypharmacy, and ADEs. Studies conducted in pediatric hospitals are w arranted because these patients are particularly vulnerable to medication errors and those medication errors that do occur have three times the potential to cause harm. 847 Community pharmacies and the newer mail -order and online pharmacy services were not studied. Evaluating these settings may be problematic because of their commercial nature. Homes and other residential or community settings will become more important to study with the spread of patient- centered medicine and associated technologies such as PHRs and remote MMITs. Monitoring . Our data suggest that interventions that focused on laboratory-based medication monitoring (22 of 29 studies) were associated with the most number of interventions, and showed statistically significant changes in at least half of its main endpoints. We recommend additional research in this area especially because laboratory data are readily available in most clinical settings, and studies in the acute, ambulatory, and nursing home settings suggest that failure to act on available laboratory information accounts for a substantial number of ADEs. 848\u00ad 850 With the integration of more health IT systems and the move to more patient directed care, systematic monitoring will become even more important. Practitioners and patients . Nurses and pharmacists are not studied as thoroughly as physicians. Mental health professionals and other health care workers who prescribe, including dentists, are studied even less than nurses and pharmacists. Each group of health professionals reports different needs for their MMIT and health IT tools (e.g., specialist physicians compared with primary care, nurses compared with physicians in hospital wards need compatible but different MMIT tools for ordering, dispensing, and administering). These differences need to be studied and applied in building, evaluating, and implementing MMIT applications. Nurse practitioners, 112 advance practice nurses and physician assistants, and allied and other health professionals should also be the target of MMIT interventions, especially because they play an increasing role in providing primary and subspecialty care, especially in the United States. The move to patient-centered care and chronic disease management also make the study of patients and their informal caregivers an important area for research and development. Unique needs of evaluation of health IT. MMIT applications are neither simple nor isolatable components that can be easily studied as such. Research methods to evaluate MMIT applications should be based on principles of complex interventions. For example, the U.K. Medical Research Council provides a framework for individuals to consider when planning complex intervention projects ( http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Utilities/Documentrecord/index.htm?d=MRC003372). In addi tion, MMIT applications are often being changed and modified to address problems or to implement fixes or upgrades. This ever changing aspect of health IT poses challenges for health researchers. Classical evaluation and research methods dictate that what is being evaluated needs to be stable over the time period of the study. \" Fast\" analysis methods may need to be developed. MMIT systems, as for any IT system, are easiest to study in laboratory settings. Because health care is so complex, the study of MMI T systems must be done in real settings. Pragmatic trials methods (trials done in real life situations) may also need to be applied in many research projects related to MMIT systems. Commercial interests also complicate the evaluation of MMIT and health I T. This makes research harder to do and provides barriers to the most common government-based funding sources. AHRQ has provided funding for many unique and valuable health IT applications that have included much evaluation of MMIT. They should be encouraged to continue to provide leadership in this domain. Another challenge to research methods is that often the existing evaluations have been done by system developers or implementers. This ownership can cloud an evaluator's vision (i.e., bias) or at least s tand in the way of publication of negative findings. Some evidence exists that evaluation of one's own system contributes to biases towards the system being found to be positive. 725 Knowledge translation/translational r esearch . Because many of the studies in MMIT are small descriptive studies and often done by developers, generalizabity or transferability are often not ideal. Researchers in this domain of \" getting research into practice\" (i.e., knowledge translation or translational research) can provide tools and insights in two areas. The first is how to harness existing knowledge tool development such as building the knowledge base behind health IT systems such as CDSS, CPOE systems, and other knowledge summaries such as clinical practice guidelines and order sets. Second, those involved in knowledge translation can assist in the dissemination of studies of MMIT applications, or provide leadership in how we can disseminate studies of health IT. 725 MMIT applications do not stand alone. MMIT implementatio n has had substantial impact on communication, interpersonal, and inter-professional relationships, and development of unintended consequences. In some cases, issues such as rage against the machine, guilt, embarrassment associated with reminders and alert s, and frustration have been reported. The qualitative and mixed methods studies summarized in the KQ1: Effectiveness section are 113 examples of studies that have shown how MMIT and health IT can and do affect individuals on a personal level. More of these studies of the effects of these technologies on people, clinicians, and individuals need to be done in various settings and with all technologies. Workflow and communication are ideally studied using qualitative and mixed methods. Sustainability. Sustainability is tremendously important to MMIT and other health IT applications. See also KQ5: Sustainability . We could not find an agreed upon definition and used one from Australia: \"the ability of a health service to provide ongoing access to appropriate qualit y care in a cost effective and health- effective manner .\" The informatics domain needs to have an agreed upon definition of sustainability. Once this is established, research needs to be done to identify our current \" sustained \" systems and determine the factors that are associated with them. Qualitative and quantitative studies are essential and they need to be done by people with strong content and methods background and sufficient financial backing. Partnerships among Federal groups (e.g., AHRQ, Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, Health Resources and Services Administration, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), vendors, professional organizations (e.g., Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, American Medical Informatics Association, and the major pharmacy associations such as the American Pharmacists Association, American Society of Health System Pharmacists, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, American College of Clinical Pharmacy, American Societ y of Consultant Pharmacists, National Community Pharmacists Association, and National Association of Chain Drug Stores), researchers, and others could work together to address the sustainability challenge. We also need studies of successful MMIT applications as well as systematic study of failures . Perhaps the HITECH Act of 2009 will lead to improvements and sustainability of health IT applications that specifically support the medication management continuum through meaningful use. Standards and certifica tion. We were asked to provide the evidence on the influence of standards and certification and how they affect MMIT systems. This evidence is sorely lacking. Standards are necessary for interoperability and smooth functioning of existing systems and large scale integration of data at State and national levels. Leadership, probably more than research efforts, continues to be needed in this domain. Measurement and definitional issues. Other gap s in the evidence that need addressing are definitional or meas urement issues. Because health IT is an interdisciplinary field, standard definitions are crucial. Producers and users of research and evaluations function best when everyone is using the same terms with the same parameters. One simple example we found is a formal working definition of the difference between an e- Prescribing system and a medication - based CPOE system. Some European literature described a system as e- Prescribing, while the same system in the United States would be classified as COPE. Another idea that seemed to cause confusion among authors and readers is the use of EMR or EHR systems, and hospital information systems. Consistency in reporting and communicating MMIT information is also important. Clinical practice guidelines, CPOE, and CDSS. One final issue that seems unresolved centers on the evidentiary nature and strength of the knowledge base that forms the foundation of CDSS applications, order sets, and most other MMIT systems. Some systems linked to established 114 clinical practice guidelines, but we did not find studies that addressed the strength of the evidence base of MMIT systems. We feel that a strong, reliable, consistent, fully disseminated, and continually updated evidence base for MMIT and other health IT systems is vital. More emphasis has been placed on the mechanics of these systems than content. Establishment of standards and content for the knowledge base is something that is potentially more important than the mechanics of these decision -support systems. The U.S. National Library of Medicine could provide leadership here. They have already built strong knowledge management tools such as their Unified Medical Language System that knits together multiple vocabularies in a machine processable form. They have also developed other information handling and processing tools, and techniques such as natural language processing capabilities of medical text, RxNorm (a standardized electronic nomenclature for clinical drugs and drug delivery devices), and codified drug allergy information provision and transfer. Their work in genomics and proteomics is also important once an individual's genetic information is ready for useful integration into our health IT and MMIT systems to provide individualized medicine. 115 Conclusions Our evidence rev iew on the use of health information technology (health IT) in enabling medication management derives from a summary of 428 studies assessing the use of integrated health IT that assisted with at least one phase of the medication management process, and associated aspects of education and reconciliation. We define the medication management process as having five phases; prescribing, order communication, dispensing, administering, and monitoring. For this report we also included medication reconciliation, education, and adherence. Key Question (KQ) 1: Effectiveness assessed the effectiveness of health IT on changes in process and intermediate, cost, and clinical outcomes. We limited our studies to those that used qualitative methods or included comparison groups, hypothesis testing, and appropriate statistical analysis. We did this in an effort to limit inclusion to studies that used research methods and had data that we could use to draw conclusions. The majority (378 of 428 studies) of the evaluated studies were included in KQ1: Effectiveness . Even so, our findings indicate that RCTs and other methodologies with controlled populations are lacking in adequate details and robust methods, which result in an only incremental addition to the evidence base for the use of MMIT. Most of the studies in this evidence report are quantitative observational assessments, often using historical controls. The evidence from these studies indicate positive effects on improving process, often measured as improvements in medication orders during the prescribing and monitoring phases. The bulk of this evidence of improvement is shown in studies set in hospitals. We also found improvements associated with MMIT systems related to use, usability, knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Th ese cumulated changes can, but may not always, lead to efficiency and cost gains. On the other hand, little work is being done on the other phases of medication management with integrated health IT. Some IT applications used in dispensing and administering are stand -alone technologies and, by definition, not included in this report. We found little evidence of significant effects on clinical outcomes; possibly because of the small number of events, the outcomes being far removed from the application of the technology; or that they were often not the main endpoints of the studies included in the review. We do not know if MMIT applications are clinical- and cost effective because of a lack of sound economic data. The qualitative literature highlighted positiv e and negative perceptions and satisfaction with the integrated health IT applications, supporting much of the literature on the importance of the effects of the technologies on workflow and the working relationships of the users. We have identified a num ber of gaps in the evidence of the effects of MMIT applications: most notably the order communication, dispensing, and administering, as well as reconciliation and education. Inpatient care is well-studied, followed by ambulatory care. A low number of studies assessed long -term care and effects on pharmacies, especially those outside the hospital setting. Gaps in research also exist for studies that evaluate MMIT that are not computerized decision support systems (CDSSs) or computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems. The domain of patient and informal caregiver access to MMIT applications, especially those applications that are integrated with such existing clinical applications as electronic medical record systems (EMRs), will be an exciting and promising new domain of study. One major gap is the assessment of MMIT tools that are used by nonphysicians. The value of the MMIT systems needs to be summed up across financial, clinical, and organizational components. The values proposition for each stakeholder will be different based 116 on their own value set, and what is important to each has not been well -studied . Though some evidence suggests positive financial and organizational gains, these gains are not universal and will depend on the technology, the setting, and the impact on the stakeholders using them. Clinical benefit is proving difficult to assess. Rigorous studies are needed to truly assess economic and other values. This broad scoped review sought to include a large number of health ITs across an ar ray of settings and users. As such, the literature was heterogeneous and difficult to synthesize. Based on our findings, we feel that it is important to note that the burden of proof of the value of MMIT is somewhat limited, but promising. We feel also tha t decisionmakers must be aware of the potential for negative impacts of the technologies and carefully consider these possibilities during implementation and provide for continued monitoring across all stakeholder groups. . The evidence base of MMIT applications is strong and varied, and it can be further strengthened by using multicentered studies, building an integrated body of evidence which will demonstrate the transferability and applicability of the systems, and multidisciplinary teams of researchers, or at least consultation input from clinicians; methodologists, including biostatisticians; informaticians; particular health IT users and representatives of various stakeholders. We can also learn much from those who work with complex interventions, prag matic trials, research syntheses, knowledge translation or translation research challenges, and health technology assessment studies to enhance the construction, conduct, and communication of health IT implementation and use research findings. 117 References 1.

Yes/no Is the quantitative study a Randomized controlled trial? [info button \"experimental design that studies the effect of an intervention or treatment using at least two groups: one that received the intervention and one that did not; participants ARE randomly assigned to a group (therapy, prevention) \"]. 6.1.1.1 1. Was the assignment to the treatment groups really random? Yes/no. look for methods of randomization (random number generator, coin flip etc) 6.1.1.2 2. Was the treatment allocation concealed? Yes/no. This means that the people involved in getting the people into the study did not have any information or knowledge of what group the person might be going into. Look for things like: 6.1.1.3 3. Were the groups sim ilar at baseline in terms of prognostic factors? Yes/no. did the groups have similar characteristics at baseline? 6.1.1.4 4. Were the eligibility criteria specified? Yes/no. Were there clear criteria for inclusion/exclusion for the study population? 6.1.1.5 5. Were outcome assessors blinded to the treatment allocation? Yes/no. Were the people measuring or analyzing data blinded to what groups the data came from? 6.1.1.6 6. Was the care provider blinded? Yes/no. Did the clinician know what group the s tudy sample belonged to? 6.1.1.7 7. Was the patient blinded? Yes/no. (were the people blinded to the group they were in?) 6.1.1.8 8. Were the point estimates and measure of variability presented for the primary outcome measure? Yes/no. This is a 2 par t question. The first --point estimates means that we have some sort of summary number like average minutes per prescription or rate of errors with the new/old system. The second issue is the measure of variability. Look for SDs (standard deviation measures usually in the form of mean 20 minutes per patient + -23 cm) or confidence intervals --for example mean 24 minutes (95% CI 21 to 25 minuets). Not asked 9. Did the analyses include an intention to treat analysis Yes/no. Look for the phrase \"Intention to treat\" or ITT. It refers to analyzing people as they were randomized. For example patients allocated to surgery would be analyzed within the surgery group even if they had been too sick, say, to get the surgery and got the drug instead). Sum quality sc ore from the above 8 questions (automatic summation of 9 items \"yes\") [don't worry about this] 6.1.2 If not an RCT, does the article report a cohort study? Yes/No Cohort study: involves establishing groups, often people, one of which is \"exposed\" (e.g. HIT) and one is not exposed. Both groups followed forward in time to determine if the outcomes of interest develop. 6.1.2.1 1. Is there sufficient description of the groups and the distribution of prognostic factors? Yes/no. This question should be answe red yes if you see a table of data on the study participants, usually Table 1 at the front end of the article. B-23 Version 10-07-09 Question Methods Assessments Options Instructions 6.1.2.2 2. Are the groups assembled at a similar point in their disease progression? Yes/no. This question only applies to studies of people who have a condition. The question needs to state how long the people in each of the groups had the disease or condition in question-- e.g. the mean number of years since diagnosis. 6.1.2.3 3. Is the intervention/treatment reliably ascertained? Yes/no. Is there a description of the medication management or health information technology --answer yes if more than a paragraph on each. 6.1.2.4 4. Were the groups comparable on all important confounding factors? Yes/no. Again look for data in Tables that gives data on how comparable the groups were. 6.1.2.5 5. Was there adequate adjustment for the effects of these confounding variables? Yes/no. You will not likely see this information as it refers to adjustment in the analyses. Look for terms like adjust ment, adjusted, regression analyses. 6.1.2.6 6. Was a dose -response relationship between intervention and outcome demonstrated? Yes/no. You will not likely find this information so say no. 6.1.2.7 7. Was outcome assessment blind to exposure status? Yes/no. This means that the people analyzing/assessing the data don' t know which group the data came from -that way they are not biased thinking that people in this group should do better than the other group 6.1.2.8 8. Was follow -up long enough for the outcomes to occur? Yes/no. Use common sense here --for example, were the errors assessed say within the first month, or 6 months of implementing a new system. Say no if there is not time for the intervention (or new system) to have an effect on the situati on. 6.1.2.9 9. Was the proportion of follow -up >80%? Yes/no. This question is looking for an assessment of the number of people who were initially enrolled into the study AND the number who were available for assessment at the end of the study. Also called follow up rate or proportion or just follow up. 6.1.2.10 10. Were drop -out rates and reasons for drop-out similar across intervention and unexposed groups? Yes/no. This question is asking \"why\" did people drop out or why they were \"lost \" to the study. Sum quality score for above 10 questions (automatic summation of 10 items \"yes\") [this will not show in the interface, but be done by the computer system independently) 6.1.3 If not an RCT or cohort study, does the article report on a case control study? Radio --start off Case control study: A study where groups of people are formed, one of which has the outcome of interest (e.g. better prescribing) and one of which does not (not better prescribing). Often members in the groups are \"matched\" in relation to things like age or experience. People in both groups are evaluated to assess if the exposure of interest (e.g. EHRs) were present in the past. 6.1.3.1 1. Is the case (people with the outcome) definition explicit? Yes/no. See the question and methods section to ascertain if the people who are the cases (e.g. those with errors in prescriptions) are described. B-24 Version 10-07-09 Question Methods Assessments Options Instructions 6.1.3.2 2. Has the disease state of the cases been reliably assessed and validated? Yes/no. If a disease or disorder mentioned, did the y tell how it was ascertained--often using rules or standard definitions. 6.1.3.3 3. Were the controls randomly selected from the source of population of the cases? Yes/no. This is often hard to tell. Look for the word \"random \" or some mention of how the controls were selected. Often this will be no. 6.1.3.4 4.How comparable are the cases and controls with respect to potential confounding factors? Yes/no. Look for Table 1 or in the first paragraph of the results section. If some information on the comparability of the groups is listed answer yes. 6.1.3.5 5. Were interventions and other exposures assessed in the same way for cases and controls? Yes/no. Were measurements taken the same for the controls and the case groups? 6.1.3.6 6. How was the res ponse rate defined? Yes/no/n/a Not applicable 6.1.3.7 7. Were the non-response rates and reasons for non-response the same in both groups? Yes/no/n/a Not applicable 6.1.3.8 8. Is it possible that over \u00ad matching has occurred in that cases and controls were matched on factors related to exposure? Yes/no/n/a Not applicable 6.1.3.9 9. Was an appropriate statistical analysis used (matched or unmatched)? Yes/no/n/a Not applicable Sum score (automatic summation of 9 items \"yes\") [this will not show in t he interface, but be done by the computer system independently) 6.1.4 If not an RCT, cohort study or case control, does the article report on a case series? Radio --start off If not an RCT, cohort study or case control, does the article report on a case series?[info button \"a medical research study that tracks patients with a known exposure given similar treatment or examines their medical records for exposure and outcome. \"] 6.1.4.1 1. Is the study based on a representative sample selected from a relevant population? Yes/no. Answer yes if the article explains why and how these cases were chosen. 6.1.4.2 2. Are the criteria for inclusion explicit? Yes/no. Answer yes if they list what the criteria for choosing the sites listed? 6.1.4.3 3. Did all indi viduals enter the survey at a similar point in their disease progression? Yes/no. Answer yes if a disease is present and they provide any information on how long the disease had been diagnosed. 6.1.4.4 4. Was follow -up long enough for important events to occur? Yes/no. Likely not applicable . 6.1.4.5 5. Were outcomes assessed using objective criteria or was blinding used? Yes/no. The outcomes such as error rates need to be assessed in a blinded manner to suit methodologists. Look for the terms blind:, mask:, placebo:, etc. 6.1.4.6 6. If comparisons of sub- series are being made, was there sufficient description of the series and the distribution of prognostic factors? Yes/no . Answer yes if any information is given. If the analysis of the cases wa s down broken down into subcategories, such as men and women, children and adolescents, young or old....

Yes/No A before -after study will have measures taken before and after implementation of a change. 6.1.6 If not any of the above, is the study a time -series? Yes/No 6.1.7 If not any of the above, is th is an observational study? (can include a case study with data, survey etc). Yes/No An observational study is one where the researchers have no control over exposures and instead observe what happens to groups of people. B-26 Appendix C . Evidence Tables Evid ence Table 1.

Considerable gains in efficiency were noted, which included the time necessary to have orders accessibl e to nursing, radiology, and laboratory. This gain in efficiency will likely result in long-term cost savings and increased quality of care.

Relevant differences between teaching and nonteaching hospitals include extent of collaboration, staff longevity, and organizational missions. 322 Themes included: language and misunderstandings, context matters and it affects the way of doing things, benefits and tradeoffs, 'contrasts, conflicts and contradictions ', collaboration and trust, customization and organization of information, defining boundaries of CPOE, ongoing nature of implementation. 327 Explores the theme of leaders and bridgers -administrative; clinical; 324 Designers need to recognize that CPOE features and implementation strategies can increase negative emotions and impact success of implementation. Positive feedback might alleviate some of the problems. 323 An organizational culture characterized by collaboration and trust and an ongoing process that includes active clinician engagement in adaptation of the technology were important elements in successful implementation of physician order entry at the institutions that we studied. 322 Publication of the results of these iterative inquiries served to promote a realization that implementation of CPOE is not easy and that the negatives must be weighed against the positives. 327 Understanding multiple perspectives should be under taken, with insights used to form strategic implementation plans.325 house officers felt that CPOE assists patient care but may undermine education; it works best when tailored to fit local and C-227 Evidence Table 10.

KQ1: Primary qualitative outcomes for all technologies across phases (cont inued ) Article Information MM Phase(s) HIT studied Integrated systems Settings Results Conclusions Banet (2004)198 Design: Before-after N Study End: 00/0000 e -Medication administration sy stem (e-MAR, e -TAR) Integrated Imaging systems, Laboratory system, Pharmacy ED, Academic For the open -ended question on ease of CPOE documentation, responses fell into the following themes: improvements in the clarity of orders, system helps organize and time their tasks, positive responses about efficiency and standardization of documentation provided by templates, general improvement in ED processes, decreased number of verbal orders and time searching for charts. For the open ended question for sugge stions for improvements, themes included: additional terms and phrases for templates, process issues not affected by the ED application, complaints regarding technical problems with the system, suggestions for additional functionality, comments about the medication order icon on the tracking board. The findings from this study indicate that users perceived no change in the total amount of time spent on documentation, a perception that was corroborated by the results of the time-motion studies. Nurses also perceived that certain processes, such as laboratory and radiology tests, were accomplished more efficiently after the implementation. Bastholm Rahmner (2004)330 Design: Qualitative N reminders Pharmacy General Hospital 4 categories for possibilities and obstacles. (1) possibilities related to access to patient drug history (which is not met by the new system), increased pharmacological knowledge from alerts etc., access to information more readily and time saved; (2) obstacles centered around technical problems given current problems with the EMR and too frequent alerts, computer shortages within the ED, altering routines and habit s and the resulting diminishing patient contact since they need to leave the consulting room to enter the prescriptions; Gaining access to patient drug history enables physicians to carry out work in a professional way. Alerts and producer -independent drug information are valuable in reducing workload. However, technical prerequisites form the base for a successful implementation. Time must be given to adapt to new ways of working. C-229 Evidence Table 10. KQ1: Primary qualitative outcomes for all technologies across phases (cont inued ) Article Information MM Phase(s) HIT studied Integrated systems Settings Results Conclusions Beuscart -Zephir, (2010)331 Design: Qualitative N = 00/0000 Study Integrated EHR/EMR system Acute care/ tertiary, 3,000 Beds Academic (3) standard ethnographic methods were used to support the analysis of the current work system and work situations, coupled with cognitive task analysis methods and documents review; (4) usability inspection (heuristic evaluation) and both in-lab (simulated tasks) and on-site (real tasks) usability tests were performed for the evaluation of the CP OE candidate. The study focused on the nurses ' tasks of preparing and administering oral route drugs to the patients, with a particular attention to the nurses ' needs in terms of information necessary to efficiently and safely support their tasks. The anal ysis of the work situations identified different work organizations and procedures across the hospital 's departments. The most important differences concerned the doctor -nurse communications and cooperation modes and the procedures for preparing and administering the medications. The assessment of the medication CPOE functions uncovered a number of usability problems, including severe ones which could be impossible to detect. C-230 Evidence Table 10. KQ1: Primary qualitative outcomes for all technologies across phases (cont inued ) Article Information MM Phase(s) HIT studied Integrated systems Settings Results Conclusions Boonstra (2004)332 Design: Qualitative N = Insurance Ambulatory care Five factors related to the perceived advantages and disadvantages of the system. (1) sy stem: usability issues and features of the system viewed as positive by some (user friendly, integrated) and negative by others (unfamiliar with the disease codes system, lack of flexibility, lack of computer resources); (2) finance: though the software was free, the government reaped the economic benefits of using it and the GPs were required to keep their EHR systems up to date; (3) system in consultation process: some felt it was more efficient during consultation and led to better quality; others felt it took longer and took away from patient focus; (4) cultural factors: users tended to have a culture of professional quality, non\u00adusers tended to focus on human relations; (5) policy environment: helps doctors become more cost conscious, but benefit only f or insurers, and focused solely on costs. Designing a system that met the diverse needs of users more satisfactorily, in being more compatible with their diverse cultures, may have encouraged wider and more creative use, and thus achieved more savings than the present arrangements have achieved. C-231 Evidence Table 10. KQ1: Primary qualitative outcomes for all technologies across phases (cont inued ) Article Information MM Phase(s) HIT studied Integrated systems Settings Results Conclusions Buhrer (2008)333 Design: Qualitative N = Pre-BCMA: (1) scheduled medication passes take longer (35/35); (2) system is overwhelming (25/35); (3) the system would direct nurses' attention away from patients (23/35); (4) nurses expected system to improve patient safety (30/35). Post-BCMA: (1) liked working with the system (19/32); (2) BCMA improves safety (28/32); (3) overwhelmed at beginning of the implementation (12/32); (4) more focused on system than the patient and found this annoying (20/32); (5) would like to switch back to the previous, paper - based system. Negative attitude: (1) computer carts: too heavy and too big and some without storage drawer; (2) scanners: too few wireless scanners; (3) batteries: unreliable power indicators and weak batteries; (4) lost orders: sometimes disappeared from the medication schedule, causing confusion; (5) docum entation: required launching a separate cumbersome application. Positive attitude: (1) organization: nurses found BCMA system 's scheduling function helpful; (2) carts: some use cart as a \"portable desk \". Implementation of BCMA into the active process of medication administration was a significant source of negative attitudes in nurses. Qualitative examination of users ' attitudes (negative and positive) toward specific attributes can result in improved design of both technology and implementation strategies. C-232 Evidence Table 10. KQ1: Primary qualitative outcomes for all technologies across phases (cont inued ) Article Information MM Phase(s) HIT studied Integrated systems Settings Results Conclusions Campbell (2009)334 Design: Qualitative N = 32 semi - structured interviews=43 hours; 400 hours of observation shadowing 95 clinical Study 340 (Wishard); 893 (Mass .); 150 (Faulkner); 725 (Brigham); 238 (Alamance) Beds Academic Themes: CPOE systems can affect clinical work by: (1) introducing or exposing human/computer interaction problems; (2) altering the pace, sequencing, and dynamics of clinical activities; (3) providing only partial support for the work activities of all types of clinical personnel; (4) reducing clinical situation awareness; (5) poorly reflecting organizational policy and pro cedure. CPOE systems are tools intended to support and improve the delivery of care, and are not solutions for all problems related to clinical practice. Workflow issues resulting from CPOE can be mitigated by iteratively altering both clinical workflow and the CPOE system until a satisfactory fit is achieved. Cross (2009 )335 Design: Qualitative N = 10 patients Implementation: 00/0000 Study Start: 00/0000 Study End: 00/0000 Monitoring including adherence and compliance CDSS/CDS/CCDS/ reminders h ome automated tele\u00admanagement Integrated electronic messaging system, Personal health records systems Ambulatory care, Home, Academic Patients ' perceptions: (1) constant communication: assist them in monitoring the symptoms of disease, both from a medical provider and a patient perspective; (2) use of computer was not difficult; (3) improved safety; (4) keep the patient and provider up to date on changes in symptoms. Analysis of the responses were sorted into three topic areas: (1) user attitudes about the interface; (2) user attitudes about the content of self - testing; (3) user attitudes about the self-testing process. Pilot testing of a tele-management system customized for UC revealed a high level of acceptance and interest among patients. The results suggest that implementation of a tele\u00admanagement system will be feasible on a long-term basis with only minor modifications. C-233 Evidence Table 10.

Physicians in these practices tended to have positive attitudes about and previous experiences with e-Rx or EMR, participation in continuing education courses relating to e-Rx, and plans for the future use of other HIT. Physicians in the 3 practices where the programs were successfully installed but unevenly implemented had high expectations about the ease of implementation, but at the same time reported concerns about how e-R x might affect their clinical independence or undermine their authority with patients. Prescribers and staff members in the 2 practices that successfully installed, but then discontinued use of the program exhibited very little advance knowledge of program functions or the potential effect on prescription workflow. Two practices failed to install e -Rx; physicians and support staff in these practices expected that e-Rx would lead to greater efficiency and safety but, at the same time, had little specific knowledge of program functionality. Practice leaders should plan implementation carefully, ensuring that practice members prepare for the effective integration of e-Rx technology into clinical workflow. C-234 Evidence Table 10. KQ1: Primary qualitative outcomes for all technologies across phases (cont inued ) Article Information MM Phase(s) HIT studied Integrated systems Settings Results Conclusions Feldstein (2004)337 Design: Qualitative N = 20 system Ambulatory care The study found some common theme with respect to prescribers ' frustrations with CPOE systems: (1) alerts that contained low -priority information; ( 2) intrusive alerts presented at the wrong time in the workflow; (3) difficult -to-interpret alerts; (4) delays caused by the alert; (5) redundant and repetitive alerts. Although alerts may slow the work process, busy clinicians generally find them helpful. Safety alerts need to be concise and relevant, have clear action steps, and provide options for users with different experience levels and work styles. Health care decisionmakers should prioritize safety -related alerts and educational programs to facilitate the implementation of CDSS at CPOE. Fernando (2009)338 Design: Qualitative N = EHR/EMR system, Imaging systems, Laboratory system Acute care/tertiary, 66 ED beds Three major issues emerged from the findings: (1) the implementation of the new system was accompanied by major shifts in ED work responsibilities and tasks; (2) the appearance of dysfunctional consequences related to the excess time it took to electronically order and the usability of some features of the new system; (3) doctors ' concerns that their views and opinions about design and implementation of the new system had not been adequately addressed The implementation of electronic ordering has important implications for ED functioning and the delivery of patient care. The complexity of the ED makes it vulnerable to disruption caused by inadequate system design and ineffective channels of communication across the hospital. Fields (2007)339 Design: Qualitative N = 17 Health care Start: 00/0000 Study End: Hospital system Acute care/tertiary, Critical care units (CCU, ICU, NICU) 19 beds in the MICU Beds Four themes were suggested: (1) ease of use; (2) speed; (3) trust; (4) hopefulness. Participants valued CPOE potential and were hopeful that future systems would be easy to use, decrease error potential, be more customizable for individual users, and contain concise physician order sets to foster medication order safety. Participants valued CPOE potential although they commented on improvements and challenges. C-235 Evidence Table 10.

Many of the technical components of the system initially showed problems, but evolved with increased functionality and improved performance. Attitudes to the system in the early stages were mixed. Over time, staff attitudes changed to become more balanced and the potential benefits of the system became clearer to most. The system structured the work of staff, sometimes unexpectedly. This theory -led evaluation offers valuable insights into a c ritical contemporary policy area. Technical systems are never perfect, and they require time and effort to become embedded into any particular clinical context. The effectiveness of ICT changes and develops over time, have quite different effects in differ ent settings. For this reason a sophisticated evaluation framework is necessary.

The hospital employees had major concerns before implementation of a CPOE system. The elucidation and understanding of these concerns and worries can help to inform and strengthen implementation strategies. C-236 Evidence Table 10. KQ1: Primary qualitative outcomes for all technologies across phases (cont inued ) Article Information MM Phase(s) HIT studied Integrated systems Settings Results Conclusions Graham (2008)341 Design: Qual itative N Formulary Emergency department, Academic Coding categories for identifying usability problems from the analysis of video-based data included: (1) interface problems; (2) content problems; (3) slips and mistakes. From 56 recorded sessions, a total of 422 events were recorded. The events were further grouped into seven main categories: (1) negative commen ts; (2) positive comments; (3) (4) application events; ( 5) problems; (6) slips; (7) mistakes. This study provides a framework for evaluating CDSS applications in a clinical environment and has identified specific areas for improvement in the applications utilized. A number of interface issues that could lead directly to adverse medical events that were identified raises concerns about the potential for similar undocumented problems in other clinical applications currently in use or being developed for implementation. Application of usability engineering principles can help identify interface problems that may lead to medical adverse events, and need to be incorporated early in the design phase to ensure that such problems can be corrected w hile there is still time and it is cost effective to do so. Grossman (2007)342 Design: Qualitative N = 26 -Transmission \u00ad the prescription to/from doctor to pharmacy Integrated Stand-Alone, EHR/EMR system Ambulatory care Qualitative data were narratively analyzed from 44 telephone interviews with 26 medical practices, 21 with e-Rx. Barriers were reported related to mainta ining complete lists of patients and their medications, use of CDSS, getting patient -specific formulary data, and EDI. Factors associated with these issues related to product limitations, external implementation challenges (e.g., communication with pharmacists and vendor support), and physician preferences on specific product features.

EMR and CPOE were commonly believed to both improve and worsen the ease and quality of personal performance, productivity and efficiency, and patient outcomes. Physicians felt encouraged by employers and others to use the systems but also had personal role-related and moral concerns about doing so. Perceived facilitators and barriers were numerous and had their sources in all aspects of the work system. Hurley (2007)241 Design: Mixed methods N = Integrated CPOE/POE system, EHR/EMR system, Pharmacy Acute care/tertiary, Academic Interview questions followed the same subscales as the satisfaction scale. Nurses found the new system more time consuming but acknowledged that the extra time was wisely spent to assure verification. They viewed saving time on handwritten, paper - based medication sheets transcribi ng as a positive change. They felt there was an increased sense of safety for the patients and the nurses and that the system helped with the 5 rights. In terms of access, they appreciated greater access to medications and information (policies, guidelines , drug resources, patient files, etc.), but felt there were still some delays in getting medications from pharmacy. A medication administration system that nurses view as being effective, by promoting efficacy, safety, and easy access, will support their nursing practice. Results of this study can give confidence to nurse executives that nurses can be satisfied with technology to make medication administration safer and more efficient and provide easier access to system components.

Usability: The nurses discussed that it was a t ime consuming learning threshold, but once used to the LIFe-reader\u00aes ' functions, they were regarded as fast. The nurses experienced that the keyboard of the LIFe-reader\u00ae was too small and not suited to the Swedish language, and that the pen was not easy to use. Usefulness: The nurses believed that it would be different to use the PDA once they started to work as district nurses. Some nurses thought they would have used the LIFereader \u00ae in a different way if they could have had it for a longer time or if they knew they could have kept it. The drug reference text in the LIFe \u00ad reader\u00ae had the highest priority but there was also a potential for more functions and features We found that the LIFe -reader\u00ae has the potential to be a useful and user -friendly MDSS for n urses in home care when obtaining profiles of the patients ' medication regarding drug- drug interactions, therapeutic duplications and warnings for drugs unsuitable for elderly patients.

Prescription patterns in Iranian teaching hospitals are physician centered, top-down with possibility for med ication errors. Although barriers exist towards implementation of CPOE, there is a general willingness among the physicians to use such a system if it provides significant benefit. Koppel (2005)345 Design: Mixed methods N = 291 health care Study Start: 00/2002 Study End: 00/2003 Integrated nurses medication lists, Pharmacy Acute care/tertiary, 750 Beds Academic Identified 22 previously unexplored medication- error sources that users report t o be facilitated by CPOE. We group these as: (1) information errors generated by fragmentation of data and failure to integrate the hospital 's several computer and information systems; (2) human- machine interface flaws reflecting machine rules that do not correspond to work organization or usual behaviors. A leading CPOE system often facilitated medication error risks, with many reported to occur frequently. As CPOE systems are implemented, clinicians and hospitals must attend to errors that these systems cause in addition to errors that they prevent. Koppel (2008)346 Design: Mixed methods N = 14,2203 medication -Medication e-TAR) Integrated Hospital information system Acute care/tertiary, 1,399 Beds Academic 15 workarounds falling into 3 categories were identified: omission of process steps (7 workarounds), steps performed out of sequence (1 workaround) and unauthorized process steps (7 workarounds). The probable causes and potential errors for each workaround were determined. Probable causes included technology, task, organizational, patient and environmental related causes. BCMA systems are intended to advance medication safety, our data reveal that integrating BCMAs within real-world clinical workflows requires critical attention to ensure that technology safety features are used as intended and that systems are designed to support this use. Compliance with patient safet y protocols is best achieved by configuring BCMAs for efficient as well as safe patient care. Repeated examinations and corrections of BCMA actual uses are needed to optimize their role in preventing medication errors. C-240 Evidence Table 10.

(1) efficiency: alerts and reminders being efficient and not wasting time; (2) usefulness: alerts being useful and appropriate; (3) Information content: about timely, rich, and accessible information; (4) user interface: important for smooth and efficient work and provision of valuable information quickly and accurately; (5) workflow: issues related to the information being available when needed. Note that considerable emotion was associated with alerts and reminders (criticism, embarrassment, guilt, frustration, annoyance, and anger). the clinicians provided considerable feedback on the usefulness and usability of alerts and reminders in EMRs. Lai (2007)348 Design: Mixed methods Study Start: 00/0000 Study End: 00/0000 order communication CPOE/POE system Unspecified Hospital, Pharmacy, Inpatient hospital based 1) patient safety: pharmacy leaders all believed CPOE would improve patient safety, allergy, dosing and interaction alerts. Some expressed concern that poor design/implementation could lead to increased errors; 2) pharmacy practice: most believed the system would lead to improved efficiencies facilitating more time spent with patients; 3) pharmacy profession: most felt CPOE would improve working relationships with physicians and nurses by facilitating new collaborations The scaling analysis found that pharmacy leaders of community, academia, and hospitals had different experience and/or opinions regarding the impact of CPOE. Most pharmacy leaders held positive opinions regarding the impact of CPOE on the pharmacy practice and the profession, with varying concerns regarding its impact on practice and safety.

KQ1: Primary qualitative outcomes for all technologies across phases (cont inued ) Article Information MM Phase(s) HIT studied Integrated systems Settings Results Conclusions Lapane (2008)90 Design : Mixed methods N = 276 primary care prescribers and their staff care An open -ended approach was used to elicit information about the benefits and drawbacks of e-R x. 15 different parent nodes were defined. Attention focused on 2 parent nodes, impact on clinical practice and software features. Physicians found the drug allergy alerts useful. For drug- drug interactions, they found these beneficial to patient safety. Many of the interaction alerts were however ignored and many were viewed as too trivial or unnecessary. Physicians suggested that alerts be provided for current medication only and for them to be less sensitive, more sensible, possibly having a personal set ting for severity levels. Prescribers believe that refinements to the drug alerting systems are necessary to reduce common overriding of alerts. In addition to honing the specificity of the alerts and permitting prescribers to set the severity threshold for alerts, prescribers recommend having the drug alert algorithms run against current medication regimens.

Physicians expressed concerns about: (a) appropriateness of physician- directed CIT as a solution for medical errors; (b) current technical capabilities; (c) level of technical support for CIT solutions; (d) introduction of new errors. (2) At what cost to the medical profession? Physicians were concerned about the time efficiency and workload redistribution associated with the introduction of CIT. The study concluded that health care organization attempting to promote physician use of CIT should consider physician' s perspectives about technology adoption and use to address their concerns, reduce skepticism, and increase the likelihood of implementation success.

The main effects of the e-Rx were analytical capacity of the pharmacists and physician and dissemination of knowledge, integration of process tasks, process automat ion, facilitates interpretation of prescriptions, improves relevance and meaningfulness of interaction and improves quality of information transmitted. e-Rx has tremendous capacity to change and improve pharmacists professional work and interactions. Nanji, (2009)351 Design: Qualitative N = 10 Pharmacy Acute care/tertiary, 750 Beds Pharmacy, Inpatient hospital bas ed, Academic 3 barrier themes: (1) process (training requirements and process flow issues); (2) technology (hardware, software, and the role of vendors); (3) resistance (communication issues, changing roles, and negative perceptions about technology). Bar code scanning system implementation is a difficult process with several barriers involving processes, technology and organizational resistance. Adequate training, continuous improvement, and adaptation of workflow to address one 's own needs mitigated process barriers. Ongoing vendor involvement, acknowledgment of technology limitations, and attempts to address them were crucial in overcoming technology barriers. Staff resistance was addressed through clear communication, identifying champions, emphasizing new information provided by the system, and facilitating collaboration. C-244 Evidence Table 10.

For after BCMA implementation: In addition to the \"Five Rights \" of medication another theme emerged, namely, \"New Articulation Work \" and describes support and problem resolution strategies employed as nurses developed new coordination mechanisms. The implementation of new information technology in the clinical setting can be disruptive to existing patterns of articulation work, or work that coordinates the activities of people across time and space. Implementation teams must familiarize themselves with articulation work and support users in developing new ways of coordinating with colleagues on other shifts and in remote physical spaces.

(4) Concerns were shown over time, loss of personal touch, and not understanding the system; (5) advantage for staff when language is not English; (6) error reduction; (7) pre-EPA: inherent mistrust for computer systems; (8) post EPA: perceived disadvantages of the paper - based systems; (9) post EPA: perceived extra time needed if nursing staff had to check the drugs prescribed on the computer. Patients generally had a good understanding of how paper -based system had worked and majority had safety concerns with it. Anticipated advantages were mostly about increased efficiency and reduced time. On balance, inpatients seemed neither for nor against EPA.

Pirnejad (2008)256 Pirnejad (2009)257 Design: Mixed information system Acute care/tertiary, 1237 Beds Academic 256 The coding scheme included differentiation between those features that were considered supportive from features that w ere considered non- supportive to nurses ' and physicians ' medication work. Many of the paper - based system 's non- supportive features were improved by the CPOE system. And, more useful features such as safety alerts and the possibility for physicians to pres cribe electronically from everywhere in the hospital greatly benefited the prescription phase and improved the medication process. Nevertheless, nurses and physicians listed many non-supportive features of the CPOE system as well. 257 Workflow impediments from the perspective of physicians and nurses are described. The care providers devised compensatory work -arounds due to interoperabilities in the CPOE system. 256 It is clear that moving from the paper based to the CPOE system had positive and negative imp acts on nurses ' and physicians ' medication work. In our study, many of the CPOE system 's non - supportive features were listed because the system damaged the synchronization and feedback mechanisms between nurses and physicians. 257 The interviews revealed that both nurses and physicians considered the system to be an improvement in their medication work compared to the old paper -based system. They complained about problems in coordination and collaboration. Problems forced them to develop informal rules and work methods to adapt the system in a way that it met their work requirements.

KQ1: Primary qualitative outcomes for all technologies across phases (cont inued ) Article Information MM Phase(s) HIT studied Integrated systems Settings Results Conclusions Ruiz (2010)357 Design: Qualitative N = 19 primary care Ambulatory care Our data analysis elicited a number of themes, of which six are most relevant to the two areas of our inquiry. (1) pain as part of growing old; (2) concerns about using pain medications; (3) waiting times for pain clinic; (4) value of ancillary services; (5) poor training in pain management; (6) value of CPRS as a support tool. The findings of this study clearly point to the need for a more systematic and solid understanding of the competencies of primary care practitio ners in managing chronic nonmalignant pain in elderly veteran patients. While various types of support have been made available to primary care providers, competency -based training targeted on the elderly population must occur to facilitate the assessment and treatment of such pain. Particular attention must be given to the role of the EMR system as a source of clinical decision support complementary to and reinforcing competency -based training approaches. Saleem (2005)358 Design: Qualitative N = 90 Study Start: 01/2004 Study End: 06/2004 and compliance CDSS/CDS/CCDS/ reminders Integrated CPOE/POE system, EHR/EMR system, Laboratory system Ambulatory care Five barriers, f our of which have related subcategories, and four facilitators, organized by three themes: (1) organizational; (2) workflow; (3) computer interface. Barriers: (a) Lack of coordination between nurses and providers; (b) Using the reminders while not with the patient, impairing data acquisition and/or implementation of recommended actions; (c) Workload; (d) Lack of CR flexibility; (e) Poor interface usability. Facilitators: (a) Limiting the number of reminders at a site; (b) Strategic location of the computer workstations; (c) Integration of reminders into workflow; (d) Ability to document system problems and receive prompt administrator feedback. Barriers might explain some of the variability in the use of CRs. These barriers may be difficult to overcome but s ome strategies may increase user acceptance and therefore the effectiveness of the CRs. These include explicitly assigning responsibility for each CR to nurses or providers, improving visibility of positive results from CRs in the electronic medical record , creating a feedback mechanism about CR use, and limiting the overall number of CRs.

It was verified that multiple variables affect a successful transition to an electronic order entry system and that workarounds and artifacts were used.

Delegates reported concerns about the current prescribing support prompts, primarily the low specificity of the pop- ups, which were too numerous, often unhelpful and therefore ignored. Information overload may have a negative impact on cognitive performance. Prescribing errors remain a major source of unnecessary morbidity and mortality and current systems do not appear to have significantly reduced this problem; nor has the extensive literature about how to reduce unnecessary alerts been taken into account. We need a new and more rational basis for the selection and presentation of alerts that would help, not hinder, the clinician 's performance. C-251 Evidence Table 10.

They occurred at new medication order entry, communication with the pharmacy and administration. The technology introduced intentional blocks (safety features such as excessive dose blocking, dual documentation and ADE monitoring) that lead to workarounds. Unintentional blocks leading to workarounds included wireless speed and printing each order on a separate page. Organization process blocks leading to workarounds included double checking of preparation and administration documents and limited resources such as fax machines. As new technologies are introduced, c ontinued monitoring to identify work flow is needed so appropriate changes can be made to address the underlying problems that create work flow blocks ultimately leading to potential workarounds. Additionally, as technology is implemented, organizational processes that will interface with the technology must be carefully re-engineered to reduce the unintended consequences of change. Weingart (2009)363 Design: Qualitative N = 25 health problematic features: list management for patients; creating medication lists; poor recording of allergy information; awkward prescription writing leading to work -arounds; problematic alerts leading to alert fatigue Front -line clinicians find many features of the e -Rx system burdensome. The value of e-Rx alerts is diminished by the quantity of irrelevant and inappropriate alerts. e-Rx triggers a vari ety of clinician behaviors (other than terminating or changing a prescription) that may improve patient safety.

Fourteen facilitating factors and 14 barriers were identified. Several categories differentiated the two hospital groups. Significantly more people from the successful hospital group reported supportive administration and supportive heads of medical sections; direct involvement of physicians, mandatory implementation, adequate training, and sufficient hardware facilitated success. In terms of barriers, only inadequate hardware and lack of ability to easily do patient transfer and advance admission orders (medical records package) differentiated the two groups and in both cases the item was mentioned more frequently by the successful hospitals. These findings support the notion that the changes involved in instituting a physician order entry system are system wide and involve individual as well as organizational factors. weir (2007)365 Design: Qualitative N = 88 Study End: 00/0000 Prescribing CPOE/POE system Integrated Hospital information system Ambulatory care Tasks were related to organization, assigning, determination, educating, scheduling, tracking, overview, correlating documenting, reminding, handing off, prioritizing, accepting, communicating, conforming, and informing. Task components were related to cueing, status, timing, communication, ownership, and linkage. Goals were associated with relevance screening, ensuring accuracy, minimizing memory load, and negotiatin g responsibility. User creates strategies to learn how to effectively deal with new systems and processes, information overload must be carefully managed, and communication is vital and is often affected by new systems.

Themes centered on transformation of the prescription and drug order during physician rounds, transformation of the drug order and dispensing with the CPOE syst em (user rights, inflexibilities and displacements with the use of CPOE, going back to the paper system, unified and inflexible CPOE medication model), transformation of continuing medication with the system (discharge, withdrawal or discontinuous patient routes, and new tasks and demands on the clinicians with the CPOE system). CPOE system did not meet naive and early expectations. Some adverse effects of the CPOE system were noted. Zhan (2006)181 Design: Mixed methods N CPOE/POE system Unspecified Hospital Some of the themes taken from the CPOE -related error descriptions included: faulty computer interface, CPOE design failures, especial ly lack of connection with other parallel systems, inadequacy of decision support and human errors occurring in interactions with the computer. A national, voluntary medication error-reporting database cannot be used to determine the effectiveness of a CPO E system in reducing medication errors because of the variability in the level of underreporting from different institutions. However, it may provide valuable and useful information on the specific types of errors related to CPOE systems. C-254 Evidence Table 11.

Clinical decision support features introduced many of these unintended consequences. 374 CPOE systems can affect clinical work by: (1) introducing or exposing human/computer interaction problems; (2) altering the pace, sequencing, and dynamics of clinical activities; (3) providing only partial support for the work activities of all types of clinical personnel; (4) reducing clinical situation awareness; and (5) poorly reflecting organizational policy and procedure.372 Careful analysis of overdependence on technology data revealed 3 themes: (1) system downtime can create chaos when there are insufficient backup systems in place; (2) users have false expectations regarding data accuracy and processing; and 3) some clinicians cannot work efficiently without computerized systems. 373 CPOE enables shifts in power related to work redistribution and safety initiatives and causes a perceived loss of control and autonomy by clinicians.

Examples include fragmented CPOE displays that prevent a coherent view of patients ' medications, pharmacy inventory displays mistaken for dosage guidelines, ignored antibiotic renewal notices placed on paper charts rather than in the CPOE system, separation of functions that facilitate double dosing and incompatible orders, and inflexible ordering formats generating wrong orders. Three quarters of the house staff reported observing each of these error risks, indicating that they occur weekly or more often. Use of multiple qualitative and survey methods identified and quantified error risks not previously considered, offering many opportunities for error reduction.

These intercepted errors were not administered to the pati ent because either the pharmacist intercepted the prescription before administration or the nurse recognized the error. Singh (2009)376 Design: Cross - sectional N = 997 Start: Acute care/tertiary, Pharmacy, Inpatient hospital based Of 55,992 new prescriptions, 532 (0.95%) were reported to contain inconsistent communication (control prescriptions = 465), a rate comparable to that obtained from the unreported group. Drug dosage was the most common inconsistent element among both groups. Certain medications were more likely associated with errors, as was the inpatient setting (OR 3.30; 95% CI 2.18 to 5.00) and surgical subspecialty (OR 2.45; 95% CI 1.57 to 3.82). About 20% of errors could have resulted in moderate to severe harm, for which significant independent predictors were found. Despite standardization of data entry, inconsistent communication in CPOE poses a significant risk to safety.

The objective of the study was to determine whether computerized alerts were effective at increasing the percentage of ambulatory patients with laboratory monitoring at initiation of drug therapy. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of drug dispensing with baseline laboratory monitoring. Alerts were triggered by a dispensing of one of 15 target drug or drug classes. The alert was sent electronically to the Clinical Pharmacy Call Center daily if lab tests were not completed. This team of pharmacists contacted patients by phone to remind them their test was due or to order the tests if the physician did not do so. The intervention therefore had 2 stages; the alerting of the pharmacist by the computer and the phone follow -up by the pharmacist. 10,169 dispensing were included; the primary outcome was the percentage of drug dispensing with baseline lab monitoring.

For this report we defined clinical outcomes liberally as any clinical morbidity, mortality, adverse event or clinical surrogate such as improved LDL cholesterol, asthma symptoms or quality of life, as the primary outcome of the study. They are also defined in this report as those things that happen to, and are important to patients in the study or real life situations. Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) . A computer application that allows a provider's orders for diagnostic and treatment services (such as medications, laboratory, and other tests) to be entered and transferred electronically. During ordering or monitoring the CPOE system can compare the order against standards for dosing, checks for allergies or interactions with other medications and warns the physician about potential problems including duplication. Most CPOE systems are integrated into other existing health IT. Source: Health IT.hhs.gov glossary Cost -Benefit Analysis . Cost- Benefit Analysis (CBA) requires programme co nsequences to be valued in monetary units, thus enabling the analyst to make a direct comparison of the programme' s incremental cost with its incremental consequences in commensurate units of measurements. CBA compares discounted future streams of incremen tal programme benefits with incremental programme costs; the difference between these two streams being the net F-1 social benefits of the programme. In simple terms, the goal of analysis is to identify whether a programme 's benefits exceed its costs a positive net social benefit indicating that programme is worthwhile. Source: Drummond MF, Methods for the Economic Evaluation of Health Care Programmes, Ch-7, 3rd Edition, 2005 , Oxford University Press Cost -Effectiveness Analysis . Cost- Effective Analysis (CEA) i s one form of full economic evaluation where both the costs and consequences of health programmes or treatments are examined. In CEA , the incremental cost of a programme from a particular viewpoint is compared to the incremental health effects of the progr amme, where the health effects are measured in natural units related to the objective of the programme. The results are usually expressed as a cost per unit of effect.

The cost study designation is a broad umbrella term used for all studies that include costs. More formal costs studies include cost-benefit, cost- utility, cost effectiveness analyses. Cost -Utility Analysis. Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA) is one form of evaluation where both that focuses particular attention on the quality of the health outcome produced or forgone by health programmes or treatments. In CUA, the incremental cost of a programme from a particular viewpoint is compared to the incremental health improvement attributable to the programme, where health improvement is measured in quality- adjusted life -years (QALYs) gained, or possibly some variant, like disability adjusted life- years (DALYs) gained. The results are expressed per QALY gained. Source: Drummond MF, Methods for the Economic Evaluation of Health Care Programmes, Ch-6, 3rd Edition, 2005, Oxford University Press. e-Prescribing . A type of computer technology that clinicians use handheld or personal computer devices to review drug and formulary coverage and to transmit prescriptions to a printer or to a local pharmacy and often store this information. e- Prescribing software can be integrated into existing clinical information systems to allow physician access to patient specific information to screen for drug interactions and allergies. e- Prescribing systems are less complex than CPOE systems that allow ordering of drugs.

An electronic record of health -related information on an individual that conforms to nationally recognized interoperability standards and that can be created, managed, and consulted by authorized clinicians and staff across more than one health care organization. An EHR system is usually broader than an EMR system. EMRs have traditionally been hospital based. For this report we use whatever designation the authors provide in their studies.

For this evidence report intermediate outcomes were defined as satisfaction with system, usability, knowledge, skills, and attitude, and other related issues. Major Endpoint . Also known as the primary outcome. The major endpoint is the main outcome that researchers determine to be the most imp ortant of any of the measures taken during planning and implementation of a study. Most studies have one to two major endpoints and multiple endpoints. Study size calculations are based on the major endpoint. Medication Errors . Any error that occurs duri ng the medication management process (prescribing, order communication, dispensing, administering, and monitoring). These can be potential errors --ones that are identified and addressed before the patient receives the medication or actual errors. The actual errors are ones that occur when the patient receives the wrong medication, the wrong dose or form, or at the wrong time. Medication errors can also be preventable and non-preventable. We used author identified statements of our classification of medication errors in this report. Source: Ferner RE, Aronson JK. Clarification of terms used in medication errors: Definitions and classifications. Drug Safety. 2006 Nov;(11):1011-22. F-3 Medication Management. Medication management is a continuum that covers all aspects of prescription medication. Medication management includes the five phases of the medication process (prescribing and ordering, order communication, dispensing, administering, and monitoring).Bell and colleagues in their seminal work on describing and modeling medication management outline the phases as being prescribe, transmit, dispense, administer and monitor 1 For this report, based on input from our TEP, to have greater clarity of what is occurring in the transmit phase, especially the active invol vement by the pharmacist, we refer to the transmission of the order or prescription and the bi-directional communication between prescriber and pharmacy staff as \"order communication\". Medication management can also include procurement, storage, reconciliation, and reporting involved in the assessment of patients for the need for drugs through to optimal care and monitoring after the drugs are prescribed. For this report we also included issues related to education or training in the use of health IT in medication management. Medication Management through Health Information Technology (MMIT). MMIT systems are electronic systems that (1) collect, process, or exchange health information about patients and formal caregivers, ( 2) are integrated with existing he alth IT such as EHR or EMR systems, and (3) provide advice or suggestions to either the health care provider or the patients and their families on issues related to medication management.

Pragmatic trials are designed to find out about how effective a treatment actually is in routine, everyday practice. Pragmatic trials answer questions about the overall effectiveness of an intervention, and cannot study the contributions of its different components. Pragmatic trials are used to test an overall 'package' of care, including the contribution of the therapeutic relationship, patients' expectations, and any specific therapy that is used. Generally a pragmatic trial would compare the effect of this package of care with another treatment, not with a placebo. Pragmatic trials are used with the aim of providing the evidence that will help policy makers, practitioners or patients make choices between two interventions. They help define the best use of limited resources. Source: http://www.frtcm.org/Pragmatic%20trials%20CTM%202004%2012%20136-40.pdf Primary Outcome: See Major Endpoint. Process Changes: Also known as Process Outcomes. These are study outcomes related to how the care process happens. For example, time to perform tasks, workflow changes, improved efficiencies, modifications of prescriptions, and errors in prescriptions are considered to be process changes or outcomes for studies of MMIT. Qualitative Research . Qualitative research seeks out the ' why', not the 'how' of its topic through the analysis of unstructured information\u2014things like interview transcripts, open ended survey responses, emails, notes, feedback forms, photos and videos. It doesn' t just rely on statistics or numbers, which are the domain of quantitative researchers.
