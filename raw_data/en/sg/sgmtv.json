Responses to [survey]questions on reactions after [vaccination]were extracted, and a pre-trained natural [language]inference model was used to identify and classify free-text comments related to [menstruation]and [vaginal bleeding]in response to an open-ended prompt about any symptoms at intervals after [vaccination]. Related responses were further categorised into themes of timing, severity, perimenopausal and postmenopausal [bleeding], resumption of menses, and other responses. We examined [associations]between symptom theme and [respondent]characteristics, including [vaccine]type and [dose]number received, solicited local and systemic reactions reported, FINDINGS:63 815 975 363 [female] [respondents] [aged]18 years). Common themes identified included timing of [menstruation](70 981 [83\u00b76%] responses) and severity of menstrual symptoms (56 890 [67\u00b70%] responses). Other themes included menopausal [bleeding](3439 [4\u00b70%] responses) and resumption of menses (2378 [2\u00b78%] responses). to menopausal [bleeding]were to seek [health to other COVID-19 [vaccination]are being submitted to v-safe, although this study is unable to characterise the relationship of these symptoms to COVID-19 [vaccination].
