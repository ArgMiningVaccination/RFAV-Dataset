We work on unique Th1/Th17/Th2-promoting vaccine adjuvants dmLT or LTA1 adjuvants to enable generation of mucosal immunity or for mucosally delivered vaccines. Our work with dmLT has continued ever since Dr. Norton's post-doctoral fellowship with John Clements and with enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), polio, tuberculosis and other vaccines. In addition, our laboratory has also pioneered the use of LTA1 for intranasal use in flu, klebsiella and opioid vaccines. We have also demonstrated improved safety of LTA1 compared with native enterotoxin. Our work continues to promote these adjuvants, supporting existing vaccines in pre-clinica/clinical development, test new formulation to harness the unique properties of these adjuvants, and collaborate with numerous other national and international scientists on this work. As part of this, we aim to freely share LT, dmLT, LTA1 etc. associated proteins with other laboratories. (3) Investigate the mechanisms of LT-based proteins on development of immunity in vaccines and therapeutics. We recently observed that neither dmLT or LTA1 signal through PKA activation. In addition, we have used active site mutant E112K to prevent the stimulation of immunity and inflammation (as a novel inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapeutic), likely through interactions with the host ARF protein. In the ongoing studies, we plan to define how these proteins stimulate immunity, which key signals are involved and which cells. We are using targeted genetic depletion models to perform these studies as well as comparisons with novel mutant LT proteins. This research aims to: (1) provide mechanistic incite that can be used to support dmLT vaccines in clinical trials or pre-clinical studies, (2) understand LT-based protein interaction on immunity to design next generation adjuvants and therapeutics, (3) provide context to how LT protein during ETEC infection shapes memory responses. (3)Understand factors regulating development of protective immunity. Humans have a wide-variety of responses to infection or vaccination. The drivers of what shapes immunity is not always clear. Many of our pre-clinical studies are limited in their evaluation of host factors that play major roles in vaccine efficacy or immunity to infections, including age, co-morbidities (e.g. diabetes, cancer), and inflammation. Our recent studies with flu have confirmed that both baseline levels of inflammation and diabetes alter responses to flu infection and vaccination (Baudier et al, in preparation). With the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic these knowledge deficiencies are even clearer. We plan to tackle these questions by evaluating human samples for protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection and also investigate this immunity within context of vaccination to influenza, RSV, or SARS-CoV-2 through a NIH funded projects.
