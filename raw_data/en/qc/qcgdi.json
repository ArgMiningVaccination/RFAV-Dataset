Energy psychology is a relatively new discipline developed by Fred Gallo and based on Chinese acupuncture. Like acupuncture, stimulating specific points along twelve major pathways that are known as meridians, alters the body's energy. Each meridian passes through a specific organ of the body. The entire system is interconnected so that the chi, (also known as life force, ki, prana, and life energy), travels from one meridian to the next. These meridians interact with a number of more concentrated energy fields called chakras. The subtle energy (chi) that flows through your body is as important to your health and well-being as the more traditionally recognized bodily functions. Often when these energies become weak, disturbed or out of balance, we experience physical and emotional symptoms. In order to relieve these symptoms, the energy that flows through your body must be restored. The meridian system used in energy psychology is a part of traditional Chinese Medicine. It is believed that energy flows through the paths of the meridians on the body, and by tapping these points, the energy is rebalanced and restored. Energy Psychology is based on the notion that when you have a thought, for example, a fear of snakes, you get \"stuck\" in your emotional or linear mind, and by performing energy psychology (tapping on the meridians throughout your body), you are getting \"unstuck\". Energy Psychology can Help You to: - Boost energy levels - Find and remove energy blocks - Strengthen your immune system - Alleviate stress and pain - Improve overall mind-body health - Achieve peak performance in physical, mental and creative aspects of life - Relief from trauma or PTSD - Relieve symptoms of anxiety, stress, fear, and/or phobias. Energy Psychology and energy medicine all began with Roger Callahan developing the Callahan Technique. Originally, Callahan was trained in hypnosis and was a behavioral psychologist (as is Dr. Diane\u00ae). He had a patient who had had a phobia of water, and he had learned in China that by tapping a sequence of acupuncture points, it broke up the fear of water locked inside of her. Since then, Dr. Diane\u00ae has been able to see physical, scientific evidence of this (aside from patients no longer having phobias after treatment) using infrared cameras, which allow us to actually see the blood flow in the brain. Dr. Diane\u00ae uses this method specifically for trauma patients, and can markedly watch their progress. Dr. Diane\u00ae became interested in Energy Psychology after also having a patient with a phobia and anxiety. She had done some research to help her patient, and discovered the Callahan Method. She even met Roger Callahan himself in 1995 and train with him in Energy Psychology. Eventually, the Callahan method morphed into Thought Field Therapy TFT), which is still used in our office today. Dr. Diane\u00ae on Energy Psychology From Dr. Diane\u00ae book Coping with Concussion and Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: \"Energy Psychology is a term coined by Fred P. Gallo, Ph.D, who was trained by Dr. Callahan. Dr. Gallo's approach, sometimes referred to as Energy Diagnostic and Treatment Methods and/or NeuroSomatic Stimulation, is a combination of TFT Therapy that uses acupuncture points along with applied kinesiology using muscle testing to examine how a person's bodily energies are functioning. This approach also incorporates cognitive behavioral and mindfulness principles to balance the body's energy systems in relation to emotion, cognition, behavior, and health.\" Dr. Diane\u00ae has the knowledge, training and certification to work with you to bring about remarkable change in your emotional health and behavior. Dr. Diane\u00ae has, in addition to training with the forefather of Thought Field Therapy, Roger Callahan, had the pleasure of training with the forefather of Energy Psychology himself, Fred Gallo, in 2002. She trained specifically in Thought Field Therapy and Emotional Freedom Technique, and in 2002 became a EDxTM (Energy Diagnostic and Treatment Methods) certified practitioner. Thought Field Therapy (TFT) Developed by Roger Callahan, Thought Field Therapy (TFT) is a meridian based, mind body therapy. TFT Therapy is based on the idea that a thought produces a specific electrical field and by tapping on various acupuncture meridian points in a specific sequence, the energetic source of a problem can be neutralized or eliminated. This technique is extremely effective with anxiety, phobias, and trauma. Dr. Diane\u00ae is certified in Thought Field Therapy. Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) EFT, developed by Gary Craig, is an emotional version of acupuncture. Instead of using needles, however, you stimulate well-established energy meridian points on your body by tapping them with your fingertips. Thus, the process is easy for you to memorize and is portable so you can do it anywhere. It launches off the EFT Discovery Statement, which says... \"The cause of all negative emotions is a disruption in the body's energy system.\" This common sense approach draws its power from time-honored Eastern discoveries that have been around for over 5,000 years and Albert Einstein, who told us back in the 1920s that everything (including our bodies) is composed of energy. These ideas have been largely ignored by Western Healing Practices and that is why EFT often works where nothing else will. It's not that EFT is so stunning; rather, it is because conventional healing methods have simply overlooked the obvious. You will see that clearly as you allow EFT to bring freedom into your life where you thought none was possible. Dr. Diane\u00ae is experienced in Energy Psychology, in addition, she is an EFT practitioner and trauma therapist. This technique can be found in her book, [Coping with Concussion and Mild "}
