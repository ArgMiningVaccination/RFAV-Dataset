For healthcare personnel or a healthcare facility to receive and administer vaccine priority groups, including healthcare staff, you must be enrolled as a COVID-19 vaccine provider. Individual healthcare providers and personnel do not have to be enrolled as COVID-19 vaccine providers to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Every vaccine provider should have an emergency plan. If you don't have one developed for your clinic, please use our [COVID-19 Vaccine Accountability and Management Plan](/page/resources/14607.pdf) as your emergency planning resource. COVID-19 Community Vaccination Program Enrollment MSDH is offering funding from the CDC to ensure greater equity and access to COVID-19 vaccine for those disproportionately affected by COVID-19. MSDH needs the assistance of enrolled immunization providers to administer COVID-19 vaccinations within their communities. Populations that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 include, but are not limited to: - People in racial and ethnic minority groups - People living in rural communities - People who are underinsured or uninsured - Communities with a high social vulnerability index Vaccine Orders Providers may now make orders on an as-needed basis.
