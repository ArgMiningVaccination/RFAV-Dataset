It consists of gently laying the hands on different areas of the body, or sometimes hovering a few inches over the body. This protocol is useful for relieving stress, pain, and also helps with healing dis-ease on all levels either as a stand-alone protocol or as an adjunct treatment with other modalities. The human body is made up of a network of various energy channels or meridians. While acupuncture and medical massage is a more aggressive approach to bodywork, there are times where a subtle energetic approach is warranted when working with those energies in the body. The goal is to help you harness your true power on a mind, body, and spirit level. These treatments allow you to go to a deeper level of self awareness and often bring profound insights into your patterns and how they affect your health. An experienced practitioner typically spends years studying and utilizing these techniques, with the first level of training focused on cultivating one's own energy before setting out to help others. I was initiated into my training at the IM School of Healing Arts in 1995 under the guidance of my Sufi teacher Levent Bolukbasi. Here I spent the first 3 years focusing on my own self-mastery in order to gain an understanding of how my worldview and experiences set up behavioral patterns and physical character structures in my own body. Having a thorough understanding of myself on these levels is what empowered my ability and intuition to effectively help others on their journey. Upon completing the basic coursework, I continued for the next 4 years in the supervision program and eventually became a teacher at the school until I left to pursue a practice on my own. It is this knowledge that I hope to pass on to you and help you harness your true power and unfold your transformation. When I work with patients today, each treatment is different based on how you present in clinic that day. I may choose to do energy work alone or with acupuncture. A treatment can last anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour, but that also varies depending on what is going on for you that day. During the session you may experience different feelings or memories which I encourage you to express either during the session or in a brief discussion afterwards. These are often things that have been buried in you for a long time and they are coming up for the purpose of releasing them and the constraints they may have had on you for years. As you have your experience on the table, I am also sensing various changes going on as I work over you and sometimes I get pictures or images or even messages to bring to you. These I share without judgment and simply report what I see. I consider myself more of an observer or witness to your healing while your body is in fact doing all the work and healing itself. My intent is to hold the space, keeping it safe and sacred for your healing to engage in a deep and meaningful way. Contemplative Spiritual Counseling Contemplative Spiritual Counseling incorporates the use of relational and intersubjective therapeutic techniques to help identify some of the spiritual and emotional blocks that get in the way of our healing evolution. It involves some discussion of old beliefs or circumstances. "}
