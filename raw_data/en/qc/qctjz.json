Rise to wholeness and prepare to lead the world. \u2014 Maharishi Mahesh Y ogi, September 3, 1974 W elcoming students arriving at Fairfield campus MESSAGE FROM OUR FOUNDER MESSAGE FROM OUR PRESIDENT Dear Friends and Donors, W arm greetings from all of us at MIU! As you'll see from the won- derful stories in this Annual Report, 2021 has been a most exciting year! Enrollment is booming and has reached an all-time high of nearly 2,500 students. Roughly 800 students are enrolled in our BA and MA pro - grams in Maharishi AyurV eda, and we have other, equally exciting new programs on the way. Our graduate programs in Screenwriting, Creative Writing, the Arts, Management, and Maharishi V edic Science are also growing rapidly. And our brand-new Doctors Fellowship program will offer Integrative Medicine training and professional certification to doctors\u2014 bringing MIU visibility and prestige within the medical community. Our campus is in the midst of a stunning makeover. W e have trans- formed our main boulevard (RK W allace Drive) and completed the new Wege Center for the Arts in glorious fashion. W e have built many new classrooms and housing facilities and acquired new land and buildings to accommodate more students, staff, and faculty. And we were just gifted the very grand Fairfield Business Park building (formerly Books Are Fun), to accommodate our rapidly expanding Computer Professionals program. The striking photos in the following pages tell that story\u2014and more. It is also a thrill to report that we've just created a new Institute for Permanent Peace at MIU, designed to greatly expand our Super-Radiance numbers and to fulfill MIU's mission to bring peace, harmony, and pros - perity to the world. The Institute was created in collaboration with Howard and Alice Settle, who are implement- ing a brilliant plan to replace our current trailer park with a glorious Va s t u Global Peace Village, allowing us to boost our Dome numbers to 2,500 and beyond. In the meantime, while that con- struction unfolds, we have launched a major Pan-American initiative to con- nect Sidhas across the entire W estern Hemisphere to our Golden Domes. If you are a Y ogic Flyer, please join us in the \"Virtual Dome\" at https://virtual- dome.org And more good news: T o respond to the national need for more teachers of Transcendental Meditation, we are developing a low-residence, partially online TM T eacher Training Course. W e will be launching a pilot course this year, primarily aimed at MIU's Next-Generation administrators and faculty. This inspiring growth is due to you\u2014our cherished donors, who truly comprehend Maharishi's vision and share his commitment to an enlightened, prosperous, peaceful world. As we end this year of historic transformation, please give generously to our crucially important Annual Fund , which fuels all our programs and the remarkable expansion we are enjoying today. With my heartfelt wishes for your health and happiness, 2 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITYCAMPUS NEWS MIU RECEIVES MAJOR GIFTWith enrollment growing at a furious pace... MIU needs more space! W e are now feverishly remodeling this glorious Maharishi Sthapatya V eda building, converting office spaces into handsome bedroom/bathroom suites as well as a caf\u00e9, lounge, and common areas. The first student residents of this spectacular build- ing will be Computer Science students who have fin- ished their on-campus classes and are waiting for job placement at major companies around the US. The new residential floors are expected to be ready for the first group of ComPro students in February 2022. Located four miles north of the main campus, this majes- tic 87,000 sq. ft. building, known as the Fairfield Business Park (formerly the Books Are Fun building), is in pristine condition. It will provide valuable classroom, administra - tive, and residential facilities to our ever-expanding Com- puter Science Program. Alan and Linlin are the owners and executive team of Midwest Development and Investment Corporation. For the ten years ending in June 2020, Alan also served as CEO at Maharishi AyurV eda Products International. During his years with Maharishi AyurV eda, Alan con- sistently grew MAV while fulfilling Maharishi's mission to bring MAV to the United States\u2014employing many people in Fairfield, thereby contributing to our local and international TM community. Linlin is a Certified Management Accountant, recip - ient of numerous national management and accounting awards, and is a highly regarded professor in the MIU Accounting Department.

ANNUAL REPORT 2021 | 5CAMPUS NEWS Jeffrey Abramson Steps Down as Board Chair and Ed Malloy T akes the Reins Rod Eason, Vice President of Enroll- ment, reports that online enrollment jumped the most\u2014a 41 percent in- crease from last year. Most academic departments are now offering online degree programs at the undergrad- uate or graduate level, or both. MIU has greatly expanded its online offer - ings over the past six years and, as a result, has attracted an increasingly diverse student body. People who are drawn to Consciousness-Based education, but are unable to move to Fairfield, can now enjoy its benefits without having to leave their jobs or uproot their families. Graduate Programs In addition to our large undergraduate Maharishi AyurV eda program, MIU's MS in Maharishi AyurV eda and Inte - grative Medicine (MAVIM) has now reached 295 students, with more about to arrive. Our MS in Computer Profession- als program and our Accounting Pro - fessionals MBA have rebounded to their pre-COVID enrollments. These online programs serve mostly inter - national students who were unable to obtain visas in 2020 due to embassy closures and travel restrictions.Undergraduate Programs According to Eason, our most popular on-campus undergraduate program, due to its flexibility and seven different specializations, is the BA in Applied Arts and Sciences. Its total enrollment is 109. The online BA in AyurV eda W ell- ness and Integrative Health is anoth- er popular undergraduate program with 208 students, including 78 new fall students and more due to arrive in February.Online Programs Supercharge Enrollment STUDENTS BY LOCATION FALL 2021 TOTAL ENROLLMENT GROWTH The greatest appeal is the uniqueness of the educa- tion itself. That's the reason students enroll at MIU. \u2014 Rod Eason Rod Eason, Vice President of EnrollmentThis fall our University total enrollment was a record 2,487 students\u2014a major increase from last year's 1,976 students. 6 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY Jeffrey Abramson Ed Malloy Laura Wege At the annual Board of Trustees meeting last June, Jeffrey Abramson announced that he would be stepping down as Board Chair after 12 years at the helm. Happily, he confirmed that he will continue as an active Board member, safeguarding and guiding the University's stability and growth. Mr. Abramson has been one of MIU's most generous benefactors. Over the past decade he spearhead- ed the transformation of our digital capabilities, contributing his own re - sources and inspiring donations from others to support our rapidly expand- ing online programs and upgrading inter-departmental communications. He contributed to extensive renova - tions and new furnishings for every major residence hall. He regularly supported faculty research, the Annu- al Fund, and the endowment\u2014ensur - ing MIU's stability. For these valuable contributions and so much more, Mr. Abramson was awarded MIU's highest honor: the Doctor of W orld Peace honoris causa . W e celebrate his great achievements and look forward to his continuing support and inspired vision. Ed Malloy Named Board Chair Ed Malloy is remembered by all as the mayor of our fair city, having been elected for nine consecutive terms from 2002 to 2020. As mayor he secured multiple grants for commu- nity development and accomplished a revival of Fairfield's downtown. He also secured grants for improvement of the Fairfield Municipal Airport, construction of the new Sportsplex, completion of the 16-mile Fairfield Loop Trail. Under his leadership, Fairfield was named one of \"Iowa's Great Places.\" Microsoft News selected him as \"One of 15 Greenest Mayors in America.\" Mr. Malloy has been a member of the MIU Board of Trust- ees since 2009, guiding fundraising campaigns, especially in growing the University's endowment.Laura Wege Appointed Trustee Vice Chair Chairman Malloy will have the benefit of a new Vice-Chair: Laura W ege. Ms. W ege was Deputy Director of the Trade Register and former Legal Counselor for the Chamber of Com- merce and Industry in her homeland of Romania where she had earned her BA and Law Degree. At the Univer - sity of Miami she received her Master of Laws in International Law, and she has a Doctor of W orld Peace honoris causa from MIU. A long-time pow - erful and devoted supporter of our University, she will be joining forces with T om Stanley as co-Vice Chair. The selection of Laura W ege and Ed Malloy was a resoundingly unani- mous decision by all 36 Trustees. Congratulations, Laura and Ed! And thank you, Jeffrey! ANNUAL REPORT 2021 | 7CAMPUS NEWS After graduating from Oxford Uni - versity, Dr. Katz learned Transcen - dental Meditation from Maharishi in 1960. Soon thereafter he assisted Maharishi in his translation of and commentary on the Bhagavad-Gt, published in 1967. Dr. Katz com - mented, \"The Gt was translated and discussed on land, sea, and in the air, in town houses and country houses, by the Thames and by the Ganges, in the Alps, and on the canals of V enice. I had never known such happiness as this work with Maharishi gave me.\" Maharishi commented that if it were not for V ernon's inspiration and per -sistence, the translation and commen - tary would never have come out. Festive with banners and posters, and newly landscaped with colorful, late-summer flowerbeds, the dedi - cation included a Zoom connection with Dr. Katz in London.

Under the guidance of President Hagelin, the building was restored and rededicated in honor of the University's cherished friend and Trustee Emeritus, Dr. Vernon Katz. 8 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY ANNUAL REPORT 2021 | 9CAMPUS NEWS Update on MIU in China MIU has been offering MBA and PhD programs in China for the past three years in collaboration with two renowned Chinese universities. In the port metropolis of Shanghai at Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU), we have 64 students at the School of International Policy and Affairs (SIPA). SJTU is the top-ranked school of its kind in all of China. MIU is also partnered with Shenyang Jianzhu University (SJZU) in Hunan District, Shenyang City, Liaoning Province. We have thirty-six PhD students enrolled at SJZU. In 2021 SJZU had 18,000 degree can- didates and 1,560 faculty members. Their campus is impressively beauti- ful and in 2008 received the \"China's Model Habitat Environment\" award for its streamlined facilities and hu- man-scaled architecture that accom- modates tens of thousands of people. SJZU collaborates with several other universities in other countries and attracts students from Japan, Russia, United States, Germany, Britain, Fin- land, Austria, Cameroon, Vietnam, Philippines, and Korea. The first classes toward a Doctorate in Management at Shenyang started in December 2020. The PhD program had been planned as a part-time track in Shenyang along with one year of full-time study at the Fairfield, USA campus. However, due to COVID restrictions, this was not possible. For this reason, MIU's course in the Sci- ence and T echnology of Consciousness (STC) was successfully taught live by MIU bilingual professors Y unxiang Zhu and Lijuan Cai in Fairfield through the Canvas learning manage - ment system and cloud conferencing. Upon completion of the STC class last year, Drs. Y unxiang and Lijuan shared their students' appreciation of STC. The students saw a profound resemblance between Maharishi's Science and T echnology of Con- sciousness, including the experience of transcending, and the time-honored principles of Confucius and the Dao De Jing of Laozi. In recent years, Con- fucian wisdom and the teachings of Laozi are enjoying a huge resurgence throughout China. On December 18, using Zoom, MIU and SJZU jointly held an online opening ceremony for a new group of PhD students who were accepted into the PhD in Management program. The photos on the following pages show the opening ceremony in China, in the company of SJZU President Y an W eidong. President Y an showed his kind re - gard toward MIU by highly praising our University in his closing remarks. He personally delivered the acceptance letters from MIU to each of the stu- dents enrolled in our program and took pictures with the students. In attendance were President Y an W eidong's team: Li Y upeng, Shenyang Jianzhu Uni- versity Vice President W ang Xing, Dean of the School of International Exchanges and Foreign AffairsFeng Xu, MIU Chief Representa - tive and CEO of First Education Xia Baishu, Dean of Graduate School Pan Yi, Dean of Student Affairs Kong Fanwen, Dean of School of Management Li Jun, Chair of School of Manage - ment Li Jiakun, Dean of School of For - eign Languages Liu Y achen, Doctorate Advisor Professor Tian Shen, Professor, and teaching faculty representative Zhou Ying, Professor, and teaching faculty representative W ang Bing, faculty translator Joining the above were other School of International Exchanges faculty and administrators and the new PhD stu- dents.

Her objective was to educate MIU stu- dents, staff, and faculty about the di- verse groups on campus. Each video narrows in on a particu- lar issue in the DEI domain, including gender, sexual orientation, politics, so - cioeconomic status, meditation status, religious/spiritual identity, disability, age, and military/veteran issues. City of Fairfield Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee The City of Fairfield DEI Committee was formed in the fall of 2020 with the understanding that more diversi- ty, equity, and inclusion drives value for our community. When we are better informed about one another, we are more likely to understand and tolerate differences. Fairfield's DEI Committee is dedicated to providing informed, authentic leadership for diversity, equity, and inclusion issues in Fairfield. Last summer, a subcom - mittee was formed to research reso - lutions and formal reports pertaining to DEI that had historically been sub - mitted to city councilors and mayors around the state of Iowa. The sub - committee then drafted its own DEI resolution and presented it to the Fairfield city councilors and Mayor Connie Boyer in November of 2021. The proposed DEI resolution echoes the US Constitution, State Constitu - tions, Civil Rights Acts, and Execu- tive Orders regarding the civil rights of every person regardless of race, col- or, creed, gender, or national origin. It epitomizes America's promise of jus - tice and tolerance for all. For the coming year, they anticipate launching a DEI website, some DEI city-wide events, and a city-wide cul- ture survey pertaining to DEI. Campus-wide Campus Culture Survey In November, in collaboration with the city's DEI Committee, MIU's Of- fice of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion administered a campus-wide survey to learn how students, administrators, and faculty feel about our campus cli- mate regarding diversity and inclusion of all the many groups represented here. This information will help the DEI Office develop a Diversity Stra - tegic Action Plan, and it will support research, education, and programming to advance inclusivity at MIU.A Snapshot of Our Campus Community Data from MIU Human Resources and the Enrollment Office yWHEREAS, the City of Fairfield believes in and stands for val- ues of diversity, equity, fairness, inclusion, and justice; and, yWHEREAS, the City of Fairfield condemns discrimination based on faith, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, age, immigration status, military sta- tus, class, or disability; and, yWHEREAS, the City of Fairfield welcomes all people and recog- nizes the rights of individuals to live their lives with dignity; and, yWHEREAS, the City of Fairfield will continue to work to ensure that everyone has the resources they need to succeed by making our city services, programs, and public spaces accessible and open to all individuals; and, yWHEREAS, the City of Fairfield believes in the public sector for the public good, and advancing equity and inclusion is critical to the success of our communities and our nation; and, yWHEREAS, the City of Fairfield is committed to leading with respect and acceptance of differ - ence; yNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RE- SOLVED by the City Council of the City of Fairfield, Iowa, that the City's commitment to the val- ues of diversity, equity, fairness, inclusion, and justice is hereby reaffirmed.Statement of Intent for the City of Fairfield, Iowa Students and Administrators by Ethnicity Students and Administrators by Generation 24 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY ANNUAL REPORT 2021 | 25TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR AMERICA 'S COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESSFEATURES 2,500 Sidhas to Generate Coherence From MIU A National Super-Radiance Program is Underway! MIU is the preeminent educational institution providing knowl- edge and experience of consciousness. As custodians of this knowledge, it is appropriate that MIU take responsibility for the nation's col- lective consciousness. This year, we are announcing and inaugurating the Institute for Permanent Peace to implement Maharishi's technologies of con- sciousness on a grand scale, so that our US national consciousness will be maintained permanently at a very high level. The Institute for Permanent Peace The Institute for Permanent Peace will recreate the same deep level of collective coher - ence that many of us enjoyed during the 1983 Taste of Utopia conference, when 8,000 Sidhas packed the Gold- en Domes. And again, from 2007 to 2010, the same effect, known as the Maharishi Effect, had a profoundly pos- itive impact on the quality of life not only for those at MIU but across the US, as indicated by FBI crime statistics and a host of other data. The massive reduction in violent crime, homicides, and drug-related deaths during these periods was the subject of peer-reviewed studies published in prestigious journals. The Maharishi Effect\u2014created by the square root of 1% of the population practicing Transcendental Meditation and the The Institute for Permanent Peace has a highly practical, deeply thought-out business plan to build our Sidha num- bers systematically to 2,500 on a permanent basis, cre - ating coherence, peace, and good fortune for the whole United States. 28 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITYFEATURES advanced TM-Sidhi program in a group\u2014is the only known technology to ever impact human society at this profound level. Unfortunately, that profoundly coher - ent, peaceful atmosphere dissipated as the number of Sidhas diminished. Now we are going to prevent that from ever happening again. ANNUAL REPORT 2021 | 29If you desire not to be tossed about by the ups and downs of different values of the economy, politics, religion, and social change, the Ideal Vastu Village will provide that level of awareness, that steady level of consciousness, which will turn every situation to your advantage, which will prove the situation to be in your favor, whatever it may be to others. \u2014MaharishiGlobal Peace Village Aspirational Goal: 1,000 Vastu Townhomes for 2,000 Sidhas Sidhas from around the country are moving to community villages adja- cent to MIU, creating a new Global Peace Village. All the surrounding vil- lages in total will provide 1,000 afford- able Vastu homes. One of the new communities will re - place Utopia Park and will be owned and operated by MIU. Current occupants of Utopia Park will be the first to move in. The remaining homes are already reserved and sever - al hundred more people are on a wait - ing list. Construction will be inaugurated May 3, 2022, which is Akshya Tritiya (\"day of lasting achievements\"), Golden Jubilee Celebrations.FEATURES 30 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITYVastu community within walking distance to: Golden Domes Main Campus Schwartz-Guich Sustainable Living Center Argiro Student Center Dining Hall Maharishi Vedic Observatory Educational Programs Library Maharishi AyurVeda Wellness Clinic Maharishi School Childcare Golden Dome Market Golden Dome Market Caf\u00e9 Grace Ananda Recreation Center Punj Outdoor Tennis Courts Yingwu Zhong Sports Center Swimming Pool Jefferson County Loop Trail North Campus Village Student Regenerative Organic Farm32 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITYFEATURES Enlightened Leadership Program Bennet Strauch It simply feels good and natural to be part of the Enlightened Leadership Pro - gram.

Their natural enthusiasm for the TM and TM-Sidhi program had a noticeably powerful and positive impact on their peers who were new to everything. They took our discussions to the next level by bringing out deeper points of knowledge; but they also never appeared arrogant, nor were they out of synch with the rest of the group. They were also proactive in assisting the pro - fessors with setting up the room and cleaning up afterwards\u2014in the classroom and on the TM Retreat. They are natural leaders.

That being said, I feel strongly that I am exactly where I am supposed to be. Nature has a path for all of us\u2014all we need to do is take that most natural step. Dylan MacDonald The choice to come to MIU was such a spontaneous one, and because of that, I truly had no idea what to expect. I feel like this is exactly where I need to be for my own personal growth. Nowhere else do I feel I can get an education while expanding my consciousness. MIU is a unique place where I can focus on all aspects of life simultaneously.This is the most fortunate generation ever because we have the Total Knowledge and the Technologies of Consciousness from Maharishi to create perpetual world peace through the group dynamics of consciousness. Until we can all be together again to do our program in the Golden Domes, we fortunately have the internet to connect us together virtually. We are already doing our Transcendental Meditation and Transcendental Medita- tion-Sidhi program, including Yogic Flying, twice a day anyway. Let's do it together at coordinated times throughout our hemisphere, exactly accord- ing to the plan Maharishi laid out for the world of global Super Radiance. It's easy for us to do, and the results will be great. \u2014 Bevan Morris, Prime Minister, Global Country of World PeacePan-American Peace Initiative Western Hemisphere Connected in Virtual Dome Illustration 109601621 \u00a9 Monika Hu\u00e1kov\u00e1 | Dreamstime.com ANNUAL REPORT 2021 | 37 Congratulations 2021 GRADUATES Commit yourself first and foremost to the development of your full unlimited po - tential. While you are young, this is the time to invest. Because you are young, the reward will be even greater. Always remember that your consciousness is the most precious resource in the universe. Indeed, it is the same consciousness that runs the universe.

So drink deep from the well from where all that intellect, that creativity, that intelligence come. Exposing ourselves to that deep inner reality will not only deliver from great fear and fatigue, it will fuel you, it will support you, it will guide you at every turn to make the best choices so that really great things can be achieved. And when you leave here, keep taking those deep dives within. Become anchored in supreme fulfillment\u2014anchored in what you truly already are. Be - come awake to your full re - ality.

Imagine if the people of the past had been exposed to Consciousness-Based education (CBE) from the start!\u2014what a dif- ferent national history we would've had.

The many stars and dust and gas clouds that make up NGC 5585 contribute only a small fraction of the total mass of the galaxy. As in many galaxies, this discrepancy can be explained by the abundant yet seemingly invisible presence of dark matter. The stellar disc of the galaxy extends over 35,000 light-years across. When compared with galaxies of a similar shape and size, NGC 5585 stands out by having a notably different composition: Contribut - ing to the total mass of the galaxy, it contains a far higher proportion of dark matter. Credit: ESA/Hubble & NASA, R. Tully, Acknowledgment: Gagandeep AnandWhat is the universe made of? (L to R) Peter Hodak, Ellen Metropole, Ashley Deans, Hearn, Kent Not Robert Klauber and Fred Travis Kent Kachejian, an MIU doctoral candidate this year, interviewed President Hagelin about the progress of his team' s research on dark matter. Kent : Dr. Hagelin, last year your sci- ence team set up a lab equipped with state-of-the-art scales and computers to research dark matter, and we're curious to know what progress has been made. But first, would you briefly remind us what this mysterious dark matter is? Dr. Hagelin: Dark matter is the term scientists use to describe parti- cles we cannot directly see. These par - ticles do not absorb or emit light, even though they have mass. Dark matter is essentially invisible to us and passes right through us. W e only know of its existence by its gravitational effects. The first evidence for dark matter came in the 1960s, when astronomer V era Rubin showed that visible matter could not account for the observed ro - tational velocities of stars. Her finding implied that either some invisible (i.e., \"dark\") form of matter exists or that the laws of gravity and general relativ - ity are wrong\u2014which seemed unlikely. Since then, calculations have shown that dark matter composes a whopping 90% of our galaxy and 80% of the uni- verse. Since Rubin's discovery, scientists around the world are eager to better understand the characteristics of dark matter, and to figure out what it is\u2014 where it comes from, and how it fits into our physical picture of the universe. One leading theory holds that dark matter is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP)\u2014it inter - acts via the weak force, one of the four fundamental forces in nature. But the standard model of physics today, the highly successful unified electroweak theory, does not include such WIMPs. In my published research, I've shown that \"supersymmetric extensions\" of this standard model do include a WIMP particle\u2014and this has been the pre - dominant theory of dark matter ever since. But... despite its predominance, that theory is actually rather boring. Why? Because WIMPs are SO weakly inter - acting that they are virtually impossi- ble to see\u2014and have escaped detection for 35 years now, despite a multibil- lion-dollar effort. And furthermore, even if we do eventually succeed in detecting one, they are of no practical relevance to life: their interaction with planet Earth is far too weak. My team is now pursuing a second, equally viable dark matter theory that involves electrically charged particles, which interact via the electromagnet- ic force\u2014which is billions of times more powerful than the weak force. W e call these microcharged dark mat- ter (mcDM) particles because their electric charge is tiny\u2014a million to a billion times smaller than an electron's. Although that charge seems tiny to us humans, who are made of normal matter, these particles would inter - act with each other (with their own kind) with much greater strength. As a con- sequence, they would attract each other and clump together to form invisible objects, planets, stars, even dark matter galaxies. The astrophysical About 80 percent is dark (unseen) matter. 40 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITYFEATURES42 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY ANNUAL REPORT 2021 | 43 This image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows the galaxy cluster Abell 3827. The pale blue blotches and contour lines surrounding the four central galaxies are dark-matter concentrations (as determined by the grav - itational lensing of a far-distant galaxy located behind the cluster). The pale blue dark-matter clump at the left is significantly displaced from the position of the galaxy just to the right of it, implying that dark matter can clump to itself. In other words, some unknown form of DM-DM interaction is occurring. Credit: ESO/R. Massey implications are huge and, as we will see, there are significant implications for life on Earth as well. Kent: Could you describe for us the experiments being conducted in the lab and the results you're seeing from them? Dr. Hagelin: How do you capture a microcharged dark matter (mcDM) particle? W ell, because mcDM par - ticles have electrical charge, a normal electrically charged object, such as a metal plate, would attract and collect them. And if it collects enough, you would start to see an increase in the plate's weight. It's a very straightfor - ward proposition but requires delicate measurement. So, we're doing that experiment, not with a charged plate per se , but with a capacitor\u2014an electrical component that stacks together many charged plates to attract dark matter particles more efficiently. W e're looking for weight gains using two highly sensitive scales\u2014and we are seeing increases in weight, in support of our hypothesis. Kent: That's very exciting. Are there any other implications of these find- ings? Dr. Hagelin: Y es! Even more in- teresting is that we're seeing a much bigger weight gain when a human be - ing is within a few feet of the exper - iment. This effect is large and highly statistically significant. If confirmed, it would fit beautifully with our the - ory\u2014because if mcDM truly exists, it would be attracted to the human body. It could surround us like an invisible cloud, like a halo with its own vibrant dynamics. According to string theory, the world of mcDM particles would be filled with a hidden light\u2014the light of \"hidden sector photons,\" which our human eyes can't see. This mcDM could form its own bodies, bodies that interact with ours (albeit weakly). This may be what the \"subtle body\" is made of. So, these find- ings may explain deep mysteries about the mind and the \"biofield\"\u2014which has been described as a subtle field that permeates and surrounds living beings. Kent: Could this dark matter ac- tually be the stuff of which thoughts are made? Could you elaborate on its connections with the so-called subtle body? Dr. Hagelin: Some sort of energet- ic field does seem to surround biolog- ical systems and may support healing and healthy functioning. Physiologists speculate about a biofield and subtle body because the physical brain itself, despite its remarkable abilities, is es- sentially a classical neural switchboard. It's not easy to understand how such a classical switchboard can think ab - stractly or have emotions. But a subtle body made of mcDM is perfectly de - signed for that. As for dark matter characteristics, if my calculations are accurate (and I believe they are), then mcDM would have the temperature of outer space: two degrees above absolute zero! And hence, like a superfluid, it would be governed by quantum mechanics rath- er than classical mechanics. A classical computer is either yes or no, one or zero. But quantum comput- ers can entertain a simultaneous coex- istence of yes and no. And that is what abstract thoughts are like. The mind can think abstractly and can entertain multiple possibilities simultaneously, including highly nuanced emotions. Human awareness is much more than yes or no, on or off, one or zero. So, if the subtle body made of mcDM is governed by quantum phys- ics, and if this subtle body plays a sig- nificant role in our thought processes, we would have a plausible explanation for how our human mind can think abstractly and have feelings. Think of the subtle body as a quan- tum co-processor for the brain which can entertain contradictory realities. An mcDM body could do that. Kent: Many physicists and astro - physicists are thinking about these is- sues today, but if your team could pro - duce physical evidence for these novel theories, it would be a whole new ball game. Dr. Hagelin: Ye s ! It's worth spend- ing time and resources on this re - search\u2014hopefully with help from some granting partners. Specifically, our team critically needs a higher class of weight scale, called a comparator , which is in the $200,000 range. W e've received $70,000 for this so far. If our current findings are confirmed with a comparator scale, we will have succeeded where billions of dollars in prior efforts have failed. W e will have solved the biggest mystery in particle physics and astrophysics today, while simultaneously shedding light on some of the deepest questions that have baf- fled humanity for centuries. Kent: I'm looking forward to fur - ther confirmation... and publication of the experimental results. Dr. Hagelin: So am I. And I would like to express my deep appreciation and thanks to those who have sup - ported our research so far\u2014especial- ly the W ege Foundation, the Emerald Gate Foundation, Milton Roegner and other heroes who have stepped forward this past year. And I'd like to thank the many other donors who have supported MIU faculty research in general. This is so vitally important for our University. Thank you, wonder- ful donors!If microcharged dark matter truly exists, it would be attracted to the human body. It could surround us like an invisible cloud, like a halo with its own very lively dynamics. FEATURES Background photo Credit: ESA/Hub - ble & NASA, R.

Sepulveda Blvd. in West Los Angeles, home to our new Doshi Center for Integrative Medicine. This satellite clinic will allow hundreds of students in our BA and MS programs in Maharishi AyurVeda and Integrative Medicine to complete their one- week intensive practicums without traveling to MIU. The Center was a gift from LA residents Navin and Pratima Doshi, who love MIU and wanted the University to \"be closer to home. \" W e launched the Center on May 14, the auspicious day of Akshya Tritiya (\"day of lasting achievements\"), with a gala all-day celebration. Thousands of guests and supporters attended events in the morning, midday, and evening, either in person or by Zoom. The high- light was a live international broadcast at noon, hosted in person by President Hagelin and featuring talks by Dr. Doshi, our Ayurvedic physicians, and student practitioners (https://vimeo. com/553101028).Currently the Doshi Center is offer - ing health and wellness consultations every Monday to Friday, providing easy access for everyone on the W est Coast. These consultations include an integrated health evaluation and rec- ommendations for self-care and daily routine. The Center's resident physi- cians are John Zamarra, MD, a long- time cardiologist and Los Angeles res- ident; and our own world-renowned expert (V aidya) Manohar Palakurthi, who studied extensive -ly under the guidance of Maharishi Mahesh Y ogi. The two physicians meet jointly with patients and students, pro - viding best practices from both W est- ern and Eastern approaches. They supervise, and provide training in the practice of integrative medicine. From this new Doshi Center, we hope to see our MIU graduates spread out across the world to bring health and wholeness to people everywhere.DOSHI CENTER FOR INTEGRATIVE MEDICINEFEATURES46 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY ANNUAL REPORT 2021 | 47 Unparalleled Medical Textbook on Maharishi AyurVeda The curriculum for the Doctors Fellowship pro - gram, which will provide training to physicians and other licensed primary care providers, was submitted to the American Board of Integra- tive Medicine in December 2021. The textbook is comprised of chapters from an international panel of experts, overseen by an editor with the unique qualification of fluency in the languages of the ancient Indian Ayurveda texts and of modern medical science. The new textbook will bring the complete and restored knowledge of Ayurveda to a new and receptive audience. Never before has this knowledge been available in a single, compre - hensive text.MIU is one of only two ac - credited integrative med- icine training programs for doctors in the US \u2014alongside the Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine in Arizona. As of this year, MIU will be part- nering with the W eil Center as a col- laborator and co-promoter of our own Integrative Medicine and Maharishi AyurV eda program, thus provid- ing MIU with some core curricular elements required for accreditation while we provide for both institutions the majority of the curriculum, which is focused on Maharishi AyurV eda in its purity. Once doctors complete their train- ing at MIU, they will very likely want to hire our Maharishi AyurV eda and Integrative Medicine (MAVIM) grad- uates\u2014a great many of whom also plan to become TM teachers\u2014to assist them in their professional practices. For example, MAVIM graduates could assist in patient diagnoses, herbal recommendations, lifestyle counseling, and TM instruction. Our MAVIM graduates will have deeper and longer training and will be able to handle the time-consuming aspects, such as life - style counseling and TM instruction, that the medical doctor won't person- ally have time for. MIU was the first accredited univer - sity in the US to offer a bachelor's and master's in Ayurveda. Medical doctors from across the country coming to MIU for their integrative medicine training through this new Fellowship Program, will further distinguish MIU within the medical profession.Fellowship Program for Medical Doctors MAHARISHI AYURVEDA AND INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE Paul J.

(\"The Future of Medicine: Frontiers in In- tegrative and Medicine,\" www. mdpi.com/) This study, \"Transcriptomics of Long-T erm Meditation Practice: Ev - idence for Prevention or Reversal of Stress Effects Harmful to Health,\" was a comparison of gene expression in over 16,247 genes and loci (gene lo - cations) in long-term (38 years) Tran- scendental Meditation practitioners and a tightly-matched non-TM-prac- titioner control group. T wo hundred of these genes met the strict criteria for differential expression between the two groups. The most pronounced differential expression was related to immune function and energy efficiency. In par - ticular, 49 genes known to be associat- ed with inflammation were down-reg- ulated in the meditator group. And genes known to be antiviral and anti- body components of the immune sys- tem were up-regulated in the medita - tors. In layman's terms, the TM group's health-promoting genes were express- ing and the disease-related genes were not. Mr. W enuganen's study brings to light the genetic underpinnings of previous research on the beneficial ef- fects of regular, long-term TM prac- tice, specifically: improved energy efficiency healthier aging reduced inflammation reduced cardiovascular disease reduced coronary artery disease reduced diabetes complications increased immunity to viruses, other microbes, and cancer reduction in short-term and long- term harmful effects of stressConsciousness-Based Education Conquers College Stress Experts and researchers use terms like \"epidemic\" and \"crisis\" to charac- terize the mental and physical health challenges facing American college students \u2014even prior to the COVID pandemic. According to a 2018-2019 student survey from the American College Health Association, over 70% of respondents felt \"overwhelming\" anxiety, while 40% experienced de - pression so severe they had difficulty functioning. The most common health challeng- es are depression, anxiety, eating disor - ders, addictions, poor sleep, frequent infections, and substance abuse. A study by MIU faculty member Marie Loiselle, PhD, and Fred Travis, PhD, published this year in the Journal of American College Health, reports an opposite trend, one of good health and well-being, with the Consciousness- Based approach at MIU. The researchers examined whether studying in a Consciousness-Based ed- ucation institution influenced college students' mental and physical health. The Duke Health Profile survey was used, assessing eleven areas of mental and physical health, both as entering freshmen (2008-2014) and at gradu- ation. The archived data was analyzed from 2019 to 2020. Ms. Loiselle used ANOV A (\"analysis of variances\"\u2014a statistical examina - tion of the differences between all the variables) for all eleven subscales. The results revealed significant increases in physical, mental, and perceived health (p<.017) and self-esteem (p<.001), and significant decreases in anxiety, depression, and anxiety-depression (p<.001). There were no significant group effects on pain, disability, or so - cial health. All students surveyed spent 2 to 3 years at MIU and had participat- ed in at least one daily practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique. They had access to counseling and re - ceived a variety of healthy lifestyle rec- ommendations, and ate fresh organic vegetarian meals in the dining hall. Their semester and class structures in- cluded standard Consciousness-Based education methodologies. The data showed significant im- provements in eight out of eleven areas covered in the survey. These findings would not reflect normal maturation during the college years, since research indicates a general decrease in mental and physical health of American stu - dents at college. Consciousness-Based education was found to buffer the negative physical and mental effects of stressful college years, lowering anxiety and depression while improving self-esteem and gen- eral health. The study concludes that Consciousness-Based education pres - ents an effective alternative for educa - tors and administrators to consider in assisting students to combat the stress of college years. It is widely known and accepted that stress in the physiology can overload adaptive mechanisms, leading to epigenetic effects harmful to health. Research on the reversal of these effects is therefore extremely important.

T anner documents how a combi- nation of good governance, grassroots projects, innovative environmental policies, and valuing biodiversity have contributed to the long-term health and wealth of Costa Rica. In the 1980s Costa Rica was on the verge of losing its forests and biodi- versity and heading toward becoming another country in a long list that has had its natural resources exploited without tangible benefits for its citi- zenry. Y et over the last three decades, Costa Rica has restored its bounteous forests while providing employment and financial security for its people. How they did it shows a path for oth- er countries to follow, protecting their natural resources and simultaneously providing widespread employment at livable wages. The film features Jane Goodall, re - nowned primatologist, anthropologist, and environmentalist; and Randall T olpinrud of the Pax Natura Founda - tion, who has been working on conser - vation initiatives in Costa Rica since the 1990s. Cinematography was pro - vided by faculty member Cody Olivas, and sound by MIU alumnus Donald Revolinski.Stuart T anner's Documentary Peace with Nature in Costa Rica Professor Ayako Huang has been participating in the Sustainable Mindset Group offered by Principles of Responsible Management Education platform, a United Nations-sponsored initiative that aims to raise the profile of sustainability in schools around the world. Huang shared her experience of MIU's Consciousness-Based edu- cation as relevant to classroom and school management and, after she completed the Sustainability Mind- set Certification, was invited to con- tribute a chapter for a new textbook, Revolutionizing Sustainability Edu - cation, Stories and T ools of Mindset Transformation. There is growing awareness among management scholars and practi- tioners that merely understanding global problems is insufficient to ef- fect lasting engagement and more sus- tainable behaviors. Research indicates that to impact behavior, something deeper, the \"mindset\" of the individual and of the collective, has to shift. This begs the question: How do you shift a mindset? A sustainability mindset is a way of thinking that results from (1) a broad understanding of the eco - system, (2) social sensitivi- ty, and (3) an introspective dive within oneself to dis- cover the Self. That inward dive expresses spontaneously in be - haviors for the greater good. Rather than manipulating circum- stances to achieve an external goal, the book's theme suggests bringing knowledge of one's Self into the equa - tion. Students will thereby better understand their place in the global ecosystem and understand their po - tential impact on the environment. Editors Ekaterina Ivanova and Is- abel Rimanoczy are, among other scholarly distinctions, conveners of the PRME W orking Group on Sus- tainability Mindset, which is a co - hort of over 170 academics from 165 universities on five continents.

The study by Robert Schneider, MD, reviewed research on widely practiced and extensively researched meditation techniques such as the TM technique, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), and yoga. Co-authors were Dr. Komal Marwaha and John Salerno.The study showed that the Transcendental Meditation technique has substantial published evidence for reducing stress, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, carotid atheroscle - rosis, cardiovascular disease hospital - ization, clinical events, and mortality. Research on other approaches to meditation shows a narrower range of benefits. MBSR is mildly effective in reducing stress and cigarette smok- ing, and it has some positive impact on reducing blood pressure. Studies on yoga show promising results on insulin resistance and carotid atherosclerotic disease. However, the review did not find enough evidence on effectiveness of other meditation techniques, e.g., Zen and Qigong, to suggest impact on cardiovascular disease, insulin resis - tance, clinical events, mortality, etc. Conclusion: The Transcendental Meditation technique is the most rec- ommended approach for prevention of cardiovascular disease. TM Technique Reduces Stress in African American Adults The age-adjusted mortality rates for heart disease and stroke remain highest in African Americans among all ethnic groups in the US. African American adults have a 20 percent higher mor - tality rate from cardiovascular disease as well as higher rates of cardiovas- cular risk factors such as high blood pressure. Compounding this disease burden are the pervasive disparities in access to high-quality healthcare. A study led by Dr. Schneider with co-authors Carolyn King and Sanford Nidich, published in the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology, found that the Transcendental Meditation technique reduces stress in African American adults with \"high normal\" and \"normal\" blood pressure. While previous trials have focused on the treatment of Grade 1 Hypertension, this is the first published clinical trial on stress reduction for only slightly el- evated or normal blood pressure. The results showed a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure in the high normal group assigned to practice the TM technique over an average of 20 months. In the normal blood pressure group, there were no significant chang- es in blood pressure. The study followed 304 people ran- domly assigned to either a TM or a \"health education\" group and recorded their blood pressure periodically for 36 months. None of the participants had a history of cardiovascular disease. W e already know that 40% of indi- viduals with \"high normal\" blood pres- sure will develop hypertension within two years, and 63% become hyperten- sive over four years. The new research Dr. Robert Schneider Continues Pioneering Health Research results suggest that TM practice by people with slightly elevated blood pressure can contribute to the preven- tion of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and related health disparities in high-risk populations.

Watching her parents practice medicine inspired her to follow in their footsteps and study Western medicine. While in medical school, she lost her brother in an accident, which furthered her desire to practice medicine. At the same time, her experience of grief propelled her on a spiritual journey to find the meaning of life. Manisha completed her internal medi- cine residency at Columbia University Irving Medical Center Hospital and her fellowship training in rheumatol- ogy at the University of Iowa Hospi- tals and Clinics. While studying in Iowa City, she and her husband, who is a gastroenterologist, learned the Transcendental Meditation technique. \" After learning TM, I felt a lot of bal- ance in my life, and I also wanted to learn V edic knowledge,\" said Manisha. Manisha is now completing her final year of the online MS in Maharishi AyurV eda and Integrative Medicine program (MAVIM). \"It's a wonderful program,\" she said. \"It's very thorough and complements my W estern medical training.\" Manisha lives in California and runs the Moksha Holistic Health Center with her family. She provides inte - grative healthcare for rheuma - tology patients and offers consultations and work - shops in Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle. She also co-hosts a wellness segment on the local news program Central V alley T oday . Using Ayurvedic spices for health and di- gestion is one of the top - ics Manisha likes to talk about, and she grows her own herbs and spices, including turmeric. When her patients complained about the bitter taste of turmeric, she and her children came up with the idea of incorporating it in ice cream. She part- nered with a local organic dairy farm, designed the labels and the packaging, and started manufacturing her Golden Ice-Spice ice cream. Manisha is passionate about in- tegrating W estern medicine with Ayurveda, emphasizing the role of consciousness in maintaining a bal- anced life. She is currently writing a book about the connection of spiri - tuality and medicine that will include simple everyday practices for heal- ing, empowerment, and self-realization.Motsei Masilo is about to finish her online MBA degree and has already been accepted into the PhD program in management. Motsei attended the University of Cape Town and earned a bachelor's degree in social science psychology. For twenty years she worked for Roche Pharmaceuticals in various HR and management roles in South Africa, Europe, and India. She has also served on the boards of several organizations. When her employer became a spon- sor for the Maharishi Invincibility Institute in Johannesburg in 2015, Motsei learned the Transcendental Meditation technique and fell in love with it. During her career Motsei has at- tended a variety of leadership training programs, but she had always dreamed of pursuing an MBA. When she left Roche in 2019 she had no doubt she wanted to enroll at MIU, which she did in 2020. Motsei enjoyed the classes so much that she got up at 2:00 a.m. twice a week to participate in the class- es happening live at MIU's Fairfield campus. \"For the first time, I felt school had a meaning,\" she said. \"I realized how im- portant it was to get immersed in one subject at a time. I also appreciate how the teachers have an interest in you getting a good grade and they encour - age you to do better.\" During her studies at MIU, Mot- sei also gained a deeper understand- ing of the Transcendental Meditation technique and was able to incorporate its regular practice into her routine. \"I could tell the difference,\" she said. \"I was more relaxed. Even stressful things were not stressing me anymore. I be - came more insightful and creative in a different way than I was before.\" While pursuing her education, Motsei started an HR consulting business. One of her clients is the Maharishi Invincibility Institute, where she is helping to start a career center designed to pre - pare students for the corporate work en - vironment from the moment they begin their studies. In the long run, Motsei's goal is to add sustainability to her consulting business.Motsei Masilo Finding Meaningful Education For the first time, I felt school had a meaning. I realized how important it is to get immersed in one subject at a time. I also appreciate how the professors have a genuine interest in you getting a good grade and they encourage you to do better.OUTSTANDING STUDENTS ANNUAL REPORT 2021 | 57T am Van V o MIU is a Good Fit for His Already Advanced Education Jenna enrolled at MIU in August 2019, pursuing several tracks, and graduated this year (2021) with a ma - jor in applied arts and sciences and a minor in sustainable living. \"Studying at MIU has helped me get to know myself more fully,\" said Jenna. \"I have a deeper experience and connection with my students and I am enjoying my job even more.\" The prac- tice of the TM technique plays a large part in her ability to give to others. \"I realized how smoothly my workday goes when I practice twice a day. As a fuller, more happy and aware human being, my heart and mind overflow and it's just natural to give my all to each situation and each student.\" Jenna has a special concern for the environment, especially recycling to reduce waste. Last year she began a campaign to encourage the use of washable lunch trays, instead of using single-use Styrofoam, at her stepson's high school. She talked to the school board and called 30 similar schools about their practices, resulting in many of the high schools, including her stepson's, switching to washable, reusable trays. Jenna is also particularly interest- ed in composting. She worked with Iowa W aste Exchange to find a way to compost the food waste at the school where she teaches. \"I think it's fascinating that every- thing returns to where it came from and then continues in another form to help other things grow,\" she said. \"It's strange that we discard things in the trash that goes to a landfill, when it could go back into the ground. It also costs a lot of money to cope with all the collective waste matter, if we don't recycle back into the soil.\" After completing her bachelor's de - gree, Jenna plans to enroll in MIU's MBA in sustainable business.OUTSTANDING STUDENTS Studying at MIU has helped me get to know myself more fully. I have a deeper experience and connection with my students and I am enjoying my job even more.But T am wanted to advance his learn- ing by studying abroad and liked the practical focus of the ComPro cur - riculum offered at MIU. He enrolled here and has found MIU to be a good fit to supplement his already advanced education. \"My doctoral education focused on research and theoretical problems,\" said T am. \"In contrast, at MIU the computer science master's program has been more practical. It's helped me improve my tech skills and gain knowledge in cutting-edge tech- nologies like big data, micro services, and machine learning,\" he said. \"But equally important, my time at MIU has helped me improve my soft skills, my social intelligence, my interperson- al skills.\" T am especially gives a nod of appreciation for the course on \"Lead- ership for T echnical Managers\" taught by Professor Jim Bagnola, in which he discovered that for success in the job market, social intelligence defines a job applicant far more than quantita - tive intelligence. \"With artificial intel- ligence and automation making many hard skills obsolete, social intelligence is increasingly valued in the work- place,\" he said.In this regard, the practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique was an important part of the curricu- lum. Says T am, \"I really enjoy this ef- fortless meditation technique. It helps me grow my awareness of others. I am like a sponge soaking up knowledge of people, places, and things. Everywhere I go I'm observing so much more and connecting the dots. And I feel so re - laxed about it. I'm finding that being in a relaxed state plays a big role in the ability to absorb information.\" With artificial intelligence and automation making many hard skills obsolete, social intelligence is in- creasingly valued in the workplace.MIU student Tam Van Vo had already earned a master's degree in computer science and a PhD in information and communication at the Toyota Technological Institute in Japan. He had worked for multiple companies in Singapore and his homeland of Vietnam as a data scientist and machine learning engineer.

She received her PhD from North Carolina State University and her research focused on the biological and anti-cancer properties of dietary phytochemicals. She completed the Fellowships in Research and Science T eaching (FIRST) postdoctoral program in the Department of Physiology at Emory University School of Medicine and in the Department of Pharmacology and T oxicology at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. Montreka learned about the Tran- scendental Meditation program and Fairfield from watching an Oprah special in 2012. She was so im- pressed that she went to MIU and joined a week-long women's confer - ence at The Raj Ayurveda Health Spa where she learned the TM tech- nique, toured the MIU campus, and met people she liked. She considered attending MIU but due to work ob - ligations, she could not. In 2017, however, she learned about the online MBA program and the rest is history. Or should we say her story? Montreka is currently program manager for surgical education at Morehouse School of Medicine, providing support for surgery resi- dents and medical students as well as teaching about compliance and accreditation. \"The information I have learned in my MBA classes has helped me significantly in making decisions and preventing and solving conflicts. I like to focus on respect, forgiveness, hu- mility, and love. I grew up with those values and MIU has added structure to that foundation.\"She also finds that her TM prac- tice helps her stay calm in stressful moments. \"It's easy to get caught up in what's going on, but TM helps me stay in balance; it defines my day,\" she said. Montreka is enthusiastic about educating and inspiring people. She aspires to motivate others to be their best authentic selves and reach for their highest goals. She is passionate about nutrition and wants to increase awareness about the relationship be - tween agriculture, nutrition, and the environment. \"I would like the next generation to appreciate and embrace agriculture,\" she said. In her free time, she loves gardening and being out- doors.Montreka Dansby Enthusiastic About Educating and Inspiring The information I have learned in my MBA classes has helped me significant - ly in making decisions and preventing and solving conflicts.

He inherited a love of the performing arts from his theater-trained parents and acted in stage productions throughout middle and high school. He dreamed of becoming a film- maker and studied the works of Da - vid Lynch, which led him to discover MIU. He attended a Visitors W eek- end in the summer of 2019 and en- rolled that fall in the Cinematic Arts and New Media Program. Abdul likes the small classes at MIU, where students can develop a stronger connection to their professors, each other, and the subjects under study. He enjoys collaborating with other stu- dents and forging strong friendships. In the summer of 2020 Abdul had the opportunity to make a short doc- umentary about MIU alumnus Rad- im Schreiber, who has won multiple awards for his photographs of fireflies. Abdul filmed and edited the docu- mentary within one month, with the help of MIU cinematography alumna Nina Ziv, who provided aerial photog- raphy, and Professor Amine Kouider, who produced the film. Recently Abdul had his first paid assign- ment as a production assistant on an indepen- dent feature film shot in Bentonsport, Iowa. \"W orking on a film set was something I have always dreamed about, and it was very reward- ing.\" Abdul is graduating in spring 2022 and plans to move to New Y ork City to pursue acting and inde - pendent filmmaking.Abdul Khalik Mokhtar \"Consciousness-Based education has helped me become a better filmmaker. \" 60 | MAHARISHI INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITYOn her way to Hawaii, Kather - ine made a stop at MIU and spent a memorable weekend. A few years later she learned the Transcendental Meditation technique and, when she decided to return to school, she joined MIU's online Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences program. Over the past few years Katherine has been working on a book based on the family stories she has collect- ed from her father. When she took a course on cinematography, she decid- ed to switch majors and tell her tale through film. Katherine's classes have been instru- mental in giving her direction on how to bring her stories to life. \"Because every class is project based, each class was supporting what I already wanted to do,\" she said. As of December 2021, she is work- ing on a documentary about her an- cestors, including the story of her great-grandfather, who was orphaned in Crete and sent in a wooden bar - rel across the sea to T urkey, where he eventually became a guard of the sul- tan. Later he was imprisoned in a war camp, from which he escaped by sea to Lebanon. Katherine has recently taken a trip to Lebanon to interview relatives and film the locations of her father's narrative. The film explores in- tergenerational trauma and heroism, the idea that the emotional ex- periences of our an- cestors get passed down to subse - quent genera - tions. Katherine says her TM practice of five years and the online TM retreats offered by MIU have made a tremendous impact on her personal growth and creative expression. \"There is less inhibition, and there is an ability to focus and per - severe, to follow the idea into creation,\" she said. \"It's also easier to be myself in the world.\"Katherine Eid Poet, Storyteller, and Budding Filmmaker After attending college in Georgia, Katherine em- barked on a 10-year jour - ney exploring her family history.

He began to specialize in Agile Man - agement Methodology, and when he wasn't able to pay for a course he of- fered his work as payment. He became the youngest certified Agile coach in Pakistan and consulted with many companies internationally. \"I am passionate about gaining the latest knowledge and trends in tech- nology,\" he said. \"I am a risk taker and I am excited to do new things.\" Faqir re - alized that his specialized skills made him more valuable to clients, and he wanted to help others achieve similar success. In 2019 he started a nonprof- it company to train others how to be adaptable in highly competitive busi - ness environments. \"I faced the same challenges when I started, so I am do - ing this for free,\" he said. Due to the pandemic, companies in Pakistan were downsizing, so Faqir switched to coaching people in resum\u00e9 writing and interviewing. Using his networking skills, he helped over 2,000 people find jobs in the IT sector with firms outside Pakistan. He is especially proud of assisting many women, who face far more hurdles than men in the job market. In 2020 he and a friend both enrolled at MIU; Faqir is currently pursuing an MBA in SAP Enterprise Resource Planning and business analytics.Faqir appreciates Consciousness-Based education and the depth of Maharishi's knowledge. As an advocate of continu - ous self-improvement, he has already experienced significant personal chang- es as a result of regular practice of Tran- scendental Meditation. \"I see myself as a different person now,\" he said. \"I have more focus, and even though I am very busy, I don't feel any pressure. It's won- derful to feel so free and yet so focused.\" Faqir is currently working on a re - search article on the impact of digital transformation on organizational sus - tainability and believes MIU is unique - ly positioned to take the lead in this area and to consult for other institutions.Faqir Khan I see myself as a different person now.

At the Maharishi Foundation, I enjoy the sense of community. Even more than that, though, I appreci- ate the overall kindness and mutual respect shared throughout the TM organization.Our Alumni Are Everywhere!

In these highly stressful times, it is so important to have an anchor to that non-changing Absolute state that exists within. In my few short years of teaching, many people have expressed their gratitude and awe at finding that it is natural for the mind and body to settle and enjoy transcending so easily. So many of them have also had truly tangible and life-changing results like normalized blood pressure, relief from anxiety and depression, and the wak- ing up of latent desires and ambitions that now have room to be fulfilled. It is a joy to bring peace to people every day and experience my own expanding consciousness as a happy byproduct.\" Sarah Sica (2002) is Director of Programs for the David Lynch Foundation in New Y ork City. \"I feel lucky that my parents decided to move to Fairfield so that my sister and I could attend Maharishi School. I loved being able to do asanas, pranayama, and TM twice a day with the rest of the School and that every subject was always connected back to our Self, and universal principles were seen across disciplines. \" As a TM T eacher, it's gratifying to see people feeling better within just a few days of learning the technique. It's such a simple and empowering tool to allow someone to connect with them-selves again and lower the wide range of symptoms of stress. I feel grateful to have been able to do this work with the David Lynch Foundation these past eight years.\" Kelly Malloy (2002), \"T eaching TM in New Y ork has been a true gift of a career.

Y our continued generosity is vital for the growth and progress of Maharishi International University and its affiliated colleges and programs around the world. To all our generous donors, thank you!RESIDENT'S P I am all about music. As a vocalist, lyricist, and producer, my stage name is \"Veda, \" which stems from my appreciation of Maharishi's knowledge of the reality of life. The music I make alternates between pop, alter - native, and hip-hop, and has a suave, introspective sound, rooted in a wide spectrum of experiences soaked up from integrating silence and dyna- mism as an advanced meditator and an MIU alumna. My early interest in music began while attending trilingual school; to this day I love writ - ing and performing in English, Spanish, and my native French. My love for music grew expo - nentially when in my mid-teens I started competing across Quebec with a hip-hop dance company. At 18, I moved to MIU to study music and in 3 years completed a bachelor's in Sound Design and a vocal program at the Musicians Institute of the College of Contemporary Music. My first year at MIU I wrote 200 songs. I mixed, mastered, and wrote every song on my first album while I was an MIU student. That's why I love MIU so much: my creative process came alive. Almost like magic an idea for a song would strike during a conversation and I would write it down, or pull over in my car to write a line. Ideas for lyrics and melodies were bubbling up and Tran- scendental Meditation was the key\u2014opening me to creative possibilities. On returning to Montreal, I took a leap of faith during the pandemic and re - leased my first singles: \"Quiet, '' \"Forgive and Forget, '' and \"Lingo. \" The response was over 220,000 views and streams. In May 2021, I was invited to the inauguration of the Doshi Integrative Medicine Center in Los Angeles, where I performed two of Dr. Doshi's poems (\"Uni- ty, \" and \"Now\") that I'd arranged especially for this event. More and more I feel that producing and performing mu- sic brings me full circle: flowing from deep within my being to an outer expression and then later, back to inner fulfillment when I hear the final recording.

For post-secondary education or adults returning to further their education, people get something extra-special at MIU. And as alumni, by giving back, we are also paying it forward for new students to benefit. As a journalist and activist, I'm quick to recommend MIU to everyone. \u2014Ken Chawkin 84 Krista Sikes Joel Silver and Trudy Berkovitz Colleen Simo Laura Simon Maggie Simon Kristen Sinclair Perry and Meredith '75 Skeath Willard Skinner Annie Skipper Dennis and Betsy Slotnick Laurie and Renee Sluser Barry and Judy Smith Edwards and Janet '87 Smith Karen Smith '79 Randolph Smith and Lakshmi T erry Smith and Eva Smith Soine Diana Spano Greg Stallone Maryellen Stamos Ronald Stechert '82 Alan and Phyllis Steinberg Alison Stendahl Mary Stensgaard Bill Stephens III John SterlingPatti Steurer and David Fuerstenau Jim and Malinda Stevens Mary Martha Stevens Cheryl Stone Karolyn Stonefelt Stefan Stoss Rob and Ros Stowe Adam Strachan Marie Michelle Strah Peter Strong and Nancy Litwack-Strong Sam Suffern III Stephen Sufian Simi Summer '77 Robert and Cynthia Swanson Fred Swartz Aisling Swift Timothy Szal eall Judith T empler Jeffrey and Cathy T epper Tim and Patti Thar Greg and Thelen Fred Thiessen Granger and Cheryl Thomas Bill and Christiane Thompson Erik '86 and Sarah Thompson Scott Thompson Jerry and Mindy '81 Tiberi Barry '85 and Donna T obias Janice T Holly T and Dennise ojislav Trajkovic Peter Trivelas Stephen and Jacqueline Truch Leslie T ung and Silvia Roederer Christina T Ulicny Savin Harshini Bill James Denise W and Ron Bessette Keith and Samantha W allace Ken W alton Nathan W ard Donna W arwick Kim W atkins-Rodriquez Susan W atterson Kathryn W ayler Larry W eakly Stephen Weber Mary W ebster Richard W einert '79 David and Donnalyn W endell and Ananka Kahlmeyer Dav id We st Nicholas and Nancy '90 White Janet Whitton Fred and Patricia Wildes Wiley Sandra Willbanks '88 Fran Williams '85 Lorraine Williams Susan Williams Paul Wilson Lewis Wilson II Paul Winer and Carol Chesnutt Stephanie Wingate Steven '12 and Geri David and Mara '02 Winningham Frank and Marji Wintroub L.

Based on this foundational experience of the underlying field of creation, MIU's education brings a practical context for all that flows in our day-to-day lives. MIU is the expression and expansion of this foundational knowl- edge; it is a lighthouse for the US and the world. \u2014 Linlin and Alanords of Wisdom and Gratitude from Alan Marks and Y e Shi (Linlin), MIU's precious benefactors who recently donated the Fairfield Business Park. Linlin and I had dis- cussed in the past a goal of endowing the University with a fund that with each year brought income. This building, this Vastu, is just that. Being able to help our University expand physically and also sustain itself from the income the building generates, for years to come in the future\u2014this met our vision in a perfect manner. We want to acknowledge all of you for your dedication and love for Fairfield and MIU, and for making this donation possible.Alan and I are very happy that we were able to make this donation to MIU. Giving one of the largest Vastu buildings in the US and world to MIU feels natural and fulfilling for us. For Alan and me, the donation to our beloved University where I work is like sharing with family. We are truly blessed to do so. And thank you all, our dear colleagues and friends, for your long-time support and dedi- cation to the University and community.
