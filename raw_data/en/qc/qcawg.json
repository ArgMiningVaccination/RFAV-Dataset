I'm currently in Bali and the full moon is something that this culture really celebrates with ceremonies; it is so beautiful. I've always been interested in how the astronomical positions of the planets and events on earth can impact us, and, whilst I'm a big believer in the idea that health and happiness is an inside-out job, I do also believe that there is something greater than us that moves us - and, for me, it makes sense that this includes the planetary system! I'm also a big believer that it's great to combine aromatherapy with other holistic modalities. So, if you're interested in astrology and aromatherapy, this blog talks a little about how we can bring these two ancient arts together and how our star sign can guide our choice of essential oils to support our health. Each star sign has a different set of characteristics that define our personality - some of which are positive and some more challenging. In many cases, these characteristics can be related to our health and may lead to particular 'health challenges'. So, by understanding the common traits associated with our star sign, we can seek out essential oils that will nurture the positives and help heal both emotional and physical health problems. In the following article, we'll look at the key personality traits of each zodiac sign and suggest essentials oil and blends to support each sign. Aquarius - Born between Jan 20th - Feb 18th This sign is known to be ruled by Uranus and influenced by the Air element. This means its personality traits are independent and individual, but valuing connection with friends. Aquarians can be rebellious and stubborn, but they are also kind and loving people. They are intellectual but they are also dreamers, and this makes them very innovative! They may suffer with circulatory imbalances. Balancing essential oils: [Neroli](https://www.baseformula.com/neroli-essential-oil) and Myrrh Neroli is very relaxing and calming and helps ground dreamers who come up against inevitable challenges. Myrrh is also very grounding. Balancing blend: Diffuse 2 drops Neroli, 2 drops Lavender and 1 drop Myrrh in an aromatherapy diffuser or candle burner. How to use: Try a beautiful meditation to ground yourself in times of imbalance. Diffuse the above blend and enjoy 10 minutes of breathing. Inhale for a count of 8, pause for 4, and then exhale for 10. Pisces - Born between Feb 19th - Mar 20th Pisces is said to be ruled by Neptune and Jupiter and influenced by the Water element. This means it is very spiritual, intuitive, and psychic, again quite dreamy, and imaginative. They are also very empathetic, caring, and sensitive, but can be impressionable and taken advantage of at times, which can lead to some depression. They may suffer with lymphatic system issues, such as water imbalance. Balancing essential oils: [Melissa](https://www.baseformula.com/melissa-true-essential-oil), Bergamot and Patchouli Melissa oil is very comforting and settling, and along with Patchouli can help grounding. Bergamot is also very emotionally soothing and can help with water balance. Balancing blend: Diffuse 3 drops Melissa, 2 drops Bergamot and 2 drops Patchouli in an aromatherapy diffuser or candle burner. How to use: This sign also benefits from a grounding meditation session (a little bit of breathing can really help re-balance) and perhaps a little self-nurturing too! Aries - Born between Mar 21st to April 19th Aries is rules by Mars and influenced by the Fire element. They make very enterprising leaders because they are courageous and confident, and always go and get what they want. They are exciting and full of energy, but this can make them quite impatient and easily bored. They can also be a little argumentative and 'fiery.' Imbalances can be seen in the head region and with stress. Balancing essential oils: [Rosemary](https://www.baseformula.com/rosemary-essential-oil), Peppermint and Chamomile Although they are drawn to Rosemary, Peppermint and Chamomile might be better to cool them down! Rosemary can help support their health, but as it is so stimulating, something like Chamomile might be more calming in those 'fiery' moments. Peppermint is also cooling and will help with headaches! Balancing blend: In a spray bottle, mix 10 drops Peppermint and 20 drops Chamomile in 100ml of Lavender Hydrolat. How to use: Spritz this soothing blend over the body as and when required throughout the day to calm and balance. Taurus - Born between Apr 20th - May 20th Taurus is ruled by Venus and its element is Earth.
