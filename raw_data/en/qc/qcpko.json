Or a tasted a squeeze of lemon and felt more refreshed? If so, you're already practicing aromatherapy. Therapeutic scents can literally help us feel better inside and out. Essential oils are aromatic liquids found within many shrubs, flowers, trees, roots, bushes, and seeds. Sometimes, they are called the \"life blood\" of the plant because they carry nutrients and oxygen throughout the plant system. That was my question when I first got started. But essential oils quickly found their way into my everyday life! Now I diffuse oils regularly to uplift my spirits, energize me, or keep me focused and grounded in the midst of a busy day. I also love to use them to help my children relax and prepare for bedtime. Through the years, I've used essential oils to support nearly every system in my body from digestive to immune to respiratory. I also have replaced many of my natural beauty products and cleaning products with essential oils (saving my family money!) Years ago, I worked with a physical therapist who incorporated massage and used Young Living oils. I will never forget the wonderful smells of these oils and how great I felt every time I left her office! As I researched Young Living as a company, I was impressed by their quality (above organic) and \"seed to seal\" process. They have their own farms around the globe. They weed by hand and use their own oils for pest control. They distill their oils without chemicals. By using Young Living, I know that the plant's \"living energy\" is in every bottle. Their essential oils are 100% pure, effective, and safe. Of all the oil companies out there, I found that Young Living has the best and most affordable starter kits. They make it easy for a newbie to get started! Their best value, by far, is the Premium Starter Kit. This is how I got started, and you can see me unbox my kit in the video below. The kit comes with 11 oils (worth over $160), a home diffuser (worth $96), a rollerball for your bottles, and tons of samples! The kit retails for over $300, but as a wholesale member you get a nearly 50% discount. When I got started with Essential Oils, I ordered them one at a time. I usually bought them on Amazon. But little did I know that I was spending more money than I needed to\u2014and potentially making compromises on the purity and quality of the oils that I bought. Unfortunately, there are lot of impostor oils that are labeled Young Living, when in fact they are diluted, cheap oils.
