Newman, Sung-Jae Lee, Naihua Duan, Ellen Rudy, T Boscardin, Lisa Kakinami,Steven Shoptaw, Allison Diamant, and William E. Cunningham Objective. To assess HIV vaccine acceptability among high-risk adults in Los Angeles. Study Setting. Sexually transmitted disease clinics, needle/syringe exchange pro- grams, Latino community health/HIV prevention programs. Study Design. Cross-sectional survey using conjoint analysis. Participants were randomly selected using three-stage probability sampling. Data Collection. Sixty-minute structured interviews. Participants rated acceptability of eight hypothetical vaccines, each with seven dichotomous attributes, and reported post-vaccination risk behavior intentions. Principal Findings. Participants ( n51164; 55.7 percent male, 82.4 percent ethnic minority, mean age 537.4 years) rated HIV vaccine acceptability from 28.4 to 88.6; mean554.5 (SD 518.8; 100-point scale). Efcacy had the greatest impact on accept- ability, followed by side effects and out-of-pocket cost. Ten percent would decreasecondom use after vaccination. Conclusions. Findings support development of social marketing interventions to in- crease acceptability of ''partial efcacy'' vaccines, behavioral interventions to mitigate risk compensation, and targeted cost subsidies. Key Words. HIV, AIDS, HIV vaccine, conjoint analysis, risk compensation, venue-based probability sampling HIV vaccines are the holy grail of AIDS research. Stable annual HIV incidence in the United States estimated at 56,500 per annum (Hall et al. 2008) and 2.5million new HIV infections worldwide in 2007 (UNAIDS 2006) strongly suggest that behavioral prevention alone is insufcient to control the epidemic. To date, over 100 HIV vaccine (including three phase III) trials have been conducted (IAVI 2009), though no candidate vaccine has yet provenrHealth Research and Educational Trust DOI: 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2009.01039.x 2167 Health Services Research efcacious. Increasing resources for HIV vaccine research (Cohen 2006) and a doubling of candidate vaccines in clinical trials in the past decade (IAVI 2009) demonstrate a commitment to HIV vaccine development as a crucial com-ponent of combination prevention (Padian et al. 2008), the best long-term strategy for addressing the most urgent global health challenge of our time. Dozens of studies have focused on critical social and behavioral dimen- sions of HIV vaccine trials\u2014 \u2014willingness to participate (Mills et al. 2004), social consequences of participation (Allen and Lau 2008; Newman et al. 2008), and behavioral risk compensation (Colfax et al. 2005). Relatively fewer investi- gations have addressed the very different and much broader challenges for dissemination of an approved HIV vaccine to millions of people (Newman et al. 2004a). UNAIDS has estimated global HIV vaccine uptake at only 19 percent among the 8 percent of 15-49-year-olds at high risk for HIV infection\u2014 \u2014due to challenges around availability, access, and acceptability(Esparza et al. 2003). Bridging the gap between global need and future uptake is fundamental to the success of HIV vaccines in controlling the epidemic. In addition to challenges for uptake, risk compensation\u2014 \u2014the possibility that individuals might respond to HIV vaccination with increased high-risk behaviors\u2014 \u2014may offset the benets of ''partial efcacy'' vaccines (Blower, Schwartz, and Mills 2003; Newman et al. 2004b). Furthermore, widespread expectations of an HIV vaccine as the long awaited ''magic bullet'' coupled with breakthrough HIV infections among those newly vaccinated may produce an ''early idealization, sudden condemnation'' phenomenon\u2014 and LeBaron 2002)\u2014 \u2014that threatens the success of the entire HIV vaccine enterprise.

The pur- pose of this investigation was to assess the acceptability of future FDA- approved HIV vaccines among individuals from vulnerable communities atrisk for HIV infection and to quantify the relative impact of several potential vaccine attributes on HIV vaccine acceptability. We also estimated behavioral risk compensation in response to HIV vaccine uptake. METHODS Participants We recruited participants at risk for HI V infection in Los Angeles (LA) County using three-stage probability sampling. Stage I: we randomly selected sites from three venue-based strata: (1) LA County sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics ( n512); (2) Latino community-based org and health-related (PPES) sam- pling assigned sampling probability for each site proportional to estimated client load. Stage II: we randomly selected 4-hour sessions (morning, afternoon, or evening) within each site; 75 sessions fr om each stratum were sampled. Stage III: we randomly selected participants within each session at selected sites. Eligibility criteria included the following: at least 18 years old, not em- ployed by recruitment site, and not known to be HIV positive. Trained in- terviewers administered one-time, 60-minute structured questionnaires usinglaptop computers programmed with Questionnaire Development System (QDS ) software (NOVA Research Company 2003). Participants were reimbursed U.S. $20. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by UCLA, LA County Department of Public Health, and University of Toronto IRBs. All participants provided informed consent. Measures We used conjoint analysis to assess the acceptability of hypothetical FDA- approved HIV vaccines and the impact of various vaccine attributes on acceptability. In contrast to a compositional approach\u2014 \u2014presenting a series of vaccine attributes one by one for evaluation\u2014 \u2014we used a decompositional approach (Green and Srinivasan 1978; Hay 2002) by presenting participantswith composite HIV vaccine scenarios. We constructed eight hypothetical HIV vaccines that varied across seven dichotomous attributes. We used a 2 7-4fractional factorial experimentalHIV Vaccine Acceptability 2169design (Plackett and Burman 1946) to reduce the number of scenarios required from 128 (275128) to 8. We based attributes and values on our formative research (Newman et al. 2004b, 2006, 2009), consultation with HIV vaccinescientists, and the need to present meaningful alternatives from a consumer perspective (Green and Srinivasan 1978; Ryan and Farrar 2000). We con- structed a ninth, optimized HIV vaccine to check the validity of conjoint analysis ratings, by setting each attribute to our hypothesized preferred value: 99 percent (versus 50 percent) efcacy, no (versus minor) side effects, U.S. $10 (versus U.S. $250) cost, 10-year (versus 1-year) duration of protection, 1 (versus 4) dose(s), administered orally (versus by injection), and cross-clade (versus single-clade) protection. Trained research staff administered HIV vaccine conjoint scenarios during face-to-face interviews. The nine scenarios were presented simulta- neously in a set of laminated cards. Participants rated their acceptance of eachvaccine on a ve-point Likert-type scale, from ''denitely not'' to 50t o ''denitely'' 5100. Data Analysis . We derived the acceptability score of each hypothetical HIV vaccine by computing the mean of the individual vaccine acceptability ratings across respondents. Next, we applied a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model to t each respondent's acceptability ratings across eight vaccine scenarios, with the seven vaccine attributes as independent variables. The effect for each vaccine attribute (e.g., efcacy) from the ANOVA model is the impact score of the attribute on vaccine acceptability for the individual respondent (Newman et al. 2006). We averaged individual impact scores across respondents for each attribute (e.g., efcacy) to compute its impact onoverall HIV vaccine acceptability, with a one-sample t-test to determine statistical signicance. We conducted a Wald's F-test to compare mean acceptability of the eight vaccines in the factorial design to the acceptability rating of the ninth, optimized vaccine. We assessed postvaccination risk behavior intentions in regard to condom use for vaginal sex and anal sex, number of sexual partners, and needle sharing. Participants rated each item on a ve-point Likert-type scale from ''denitely increase'' to ''denitely decrease'' the behavior. We assessed risk behavior intentions in response to one of eight HIV vaccine scenariosrandomly selected for each participant, in order to mitigate respondent burden. For each respondent, we constructed an analytic weight, which permits us to adjust the sample to represent the reference population of persons2170 HSR: Health Services Research 44:6(December 2009)attending each site. Each weight is the product of the session sampling weight (adjusts for differential sampling probabilities across sessions and participants within sessions) and a nonresponse weight (adjusts for differential cooperationwith the survey) (Duan et al. 1999). To adjust standard errors and statistical tests for the complex sample design and differential weighting, we used linearization methods in STATA v10 (Kish and Frankel 1974). RESULTS Between August 2006 and May 2007, we recruited 1,164 participants in LA County across three strata: (55.7 percent) of participants were male; mean age537.4 years. The majority were ethnic minorities (20.5 percent African American, 50.0 percent Latino, 11.9 percent Asian Pacic Islander/American Indian/Other). Most (57.1 percent) had high school-degree education or less,with median annual income of U.S. $14,280. Half (50.4 percent) had no medical insurance and 46.7 percent were unemployed. Table 1 reports so- ciodemographic characteristics of the sample. HIV vaccine acceptability ranged from 28.4 to 88.6 on a 100-point scale, from ''denitely not'' 50 to ''denitely'' 5100, with mean acceptability of 54.5 (SD518.8). Table 2 shows the acceptability of the eight HIV vaccines and their attribute proles. The acceptability rating of the ninth, optimized vaccine was 93.1 (SD 519.2), signicantly higher than mean acceptability (54.5; SD 518.8) of F(1, 448) 51,945.49, po.001). Efcacy had the greatest impact on acceptability, controlling for other vaccine attributes. Participants were signicantly less likely to indicate accep-tance of immunization with a 50 percent efcacy than a 99 percent efcacy vaccine (39.6 versus 69.5 on the 100-point scale; po.001). Side effects (tem- porary body aches and fevers) had the second greatest impact on HIV vaccine acceptability, followed by out-of-pocke t cost (U.S. $250 versus U.S. $10). Table 3 shows the impact of the seven vaccine attributes on HIV vaccine acceptability. Overall, 9.7 percent (95 percent CI 57.4, 11.9 percent) indicated they would use condoms less for vaginal sex if they received an HIV vaccine; 10.4 percent (95 percent CI 57.2, 13.5 percent) would use condoms less for anal sex; and 10.4 percent (95 percent CI 57.4, 13.3 percent) would increase their number of sexual partners. Very few (2.2 percent; 95 percent CI 50.1, 4.4 percent) participants reporting injection drug use indicated intentions to in- crease needle/syringe sharing after HIV vaccination.HIV Vaccine Acceptability 2171Table 1: Sociodemographic Characteristics of the Study Sample ( N51,164)n Characteristics n (%) Age (years) 37.4 (12.2, 17-86)w Ethnicity African American 238 (20.5%)Caucasian 205 (17.7%)Hispanic (English is primary langauge) 148 (12.7%) Hispanic (Spanish is primary language) 434 (37.3%) Asian Pacic Islander, American Indian, multiple race, Other 138 (11.9%) Born in the United States 769 (66.0%)Gender Male (2.3%) Bisexual 76 (6.5%) Injection drug user 301 (25.9%)Highest education completed No formal education or incomplete primary 344 (29.6%) Completed high school or GED 320 (27.5%) Some college or associate's degree 356 (30.6%)Bachelor's degree or higher (graduate/professional school) 143 (12.3%) Relationship status Single (never married) 737 (63.4%) Married/common law 234 (20.1%)Separated/divorced/widowed 192 (16.5%) Ongoing relationship with a spouse or partner No 493 (42.4%)Yes 670 (57.6%) Monthly income from all sources combined (U.S.$) $1,190 ($0-$25,000) z Insurance Public 322 (27.7%)Private 255 (21.9%)None 586 (50.4%) Current employment status Working 621 (53.4%)On disability or retired 85 (7.3%) Not working 458 (39.4%) nAll numbers are weighted and adjusted for sampling design effect. wMean, standard deviation, and range are reported. zMedian and range are reported.2172 HSR: Health Services Research 44:6(December 2009)Table 2: Acceptability (Mean) of Hypothetical HIV Vaccines with Different Attribute Proles (in Order of Decreasing Acceptability; N51,164)n HIV Vaccine Acceptability\u2014 \u2014 Mean (SD)wVaccine Attributes CostDuration of Protection (Years) Doses RouteProtection (Cross-Clade) 88.6 (21.4) 99 None 10 10 1 Injection One type 68.6 (29.9) 99 None 250 1 1 Mouth Multiple 60.8 (32.9) 99 Minorz250 10 4 Injection Multiple 60.0 (32.3) 99 Minor 10 1 4 Mouth One type47.3 (32.3) 50 None 10 1 4 Injection Multiple 41.5 (32.7) 50 None 250 10 4 Mouth One type 41.1 (31.8) 50 Minor 10 10 1 Mouth Multiple28.4 (30.9) 50 Minor 250 1 1 Injection One type nAll numbers are weighted and adjusted for sampling design effect. wOverall vaccine acceptability: 54.5 (SD: 18.8). zTemporary body aches and fevers.

For anal sex ( n5687), 13.2 percent (95 percent CI 58.4, 17.9 percent) reported intentions to de- crease condom use after receiving a 99 percent efcacy HIV vaccine versus 7.0 percent (95 percent CI 53.6, 10.5 percent; p5.025) after receiving a 50 percent efcacy vaccine. Among the 987 participants who responded to the item about sexual partners, 13.0 percent (95 percent CI 59.5, 16.6 percent) would increase their number of partners if they received a 99 percent efcacy vaccine versus 7.7 percent (95 percent CI 53.8, 11.5 percent, p5.038) with a 50 percent efcacy vaccine. DISCUSSION This probability sample survey of ethnically and racially diverse adults re- cruited from venues that serve populations at elevated risk for HIV infection indicates that future HIV vaccine acceptance is far from guaranteed among those likely to be targeted for initial dissemination. HIV vaccine acceptability varied widely depending on the characteristics of the vaccine. Overall, the moderate level of vaccine acceptability suggests hope; however, initial HIV vaccines (Stover et al. 2007) are more likely to parallel the least acceptable of the vaccine scenarios presented. Vaccine efcacy had the greatest impact on acceptability. Participants indicated high levels of acceptability for a vaccine that delivers sterilizing immunity. However, initial HIV vaccines will likely be of low to moderate efcacy (Stover et al. 2007). Low levels of acceptability of partially efcacious HIV vaccines portend signicant challenges for the effectiveness of vaccines in controlling HIV on a population level. Concerns about temporary minor side effects had the second greatest impact on HIV vaccine acceptability. A public perception of vaccines as delivering sterilizing immunity using a ''small dose'' of virus to generate an immune response (Newman et al. 2009) may pose particular challenges in thecase of HIV (versus influenza, for example) due to fear of iatrogenic infection. Social marketing interventions to promote acceptability of partially efcacious HIV vaccines (Newman et al. 2004a), and public education about recombi-2174 HSR: Health Services Research 44:6(December 2009)nant genetic vaccines (i.e., that they cannot cause HIV infection) and possible vaccine side effects, may be key components of programs to facilitate uptake of initial HIV vaccines among vulnerable adults. The impact of out-of-pocket cost on HIV vaccine acceptability is notable among this sample of low-socioeconomic status adults, half of whom lacked health insurance coverage. The intersection of poverty and HIV prevalence (Simon et al. 1995; Cunningham et al. 2005) suggests the importance of pro- active government policies to subsidize HIV vaccine costs for low-income adults. Given the relative lack of control that vaccine scientists may have over initial vaccine efcacy and minor side effects, price subsidies are a readily available and likely a cost-effective mechanism (Hecht and Suraratdecha 2006) to facilitate broad vaccine uptake among vulnerable adults. Among other HIV vaccine characteristics, likely vaccine consumers exhibited flexibility regarding the number of doses required and the vaccine'sduration of protection. Overall, it may be advisable for vaccine promotion efforts to target efcacy, side effects, and cost in order to have the greatest impact on uptake among adults from vulnerable communities. Beyond challenges for HIV vaccine acceptability, we found evidence suggesting modest risk compensation\u2014 \u2014a 10 percent increase in sexual risk behaviors in response to HIV vaccine uptake. Mathematical modeling of the epidemic suggests that even slight increases in sexual risk behaviors may compromise the effectiveness of a partially efcacious HIV vaccine, partic- ularly with less than optimal uptake (Blower, Schwartz, and Mills 2003). Thesignicantly lower estimate of risk compensation in response to a moderately versus a highly efcacious vaccine, however, suggests that diverse, low-socio- economic-status adults understood the implications of partial efcacy. Educational and social marketing interventions delivered at the advent of public HIV vaccine availability may need to carefully balance vaccine promotion\u2014 \u2014particularly in the case of a partially efcacious vaccine\u2014 \u2014with clear messages about the imperative for integrated behavioral and biomedical prevention in order to mitigate behavioral risk compensation. However, such caveats that communicate the realities of partial efcacy may render social marketing of a vaccine more challenging. To this end, formative research is needed to support balanced, evidence-informed dissemination strategies. Limitations to this study include reliance on stated intentions, which are imperfect proxies of behavior. However, we used conjoint analysis to more closely simulate real-world decision making (Green and Srinivasan 1978; Ryan and Farrar 2000). The wide range of acceptability, in expected direc- tions, based on HIV vaccines with different attribute proles increases theHIV Vaccine Acceptability 2175validity of the ndings, as does the signicantly greater acceptability of the vaccine scenario with all attributes optimized. Nevertheless, subjective and objective factors not included in this analysis may also have an impact on HIVvaccine uptake. Additionally, stated risk behavior intentions in response to future vaccine uptake may be an underestimate; risk compensation, fueled in part by nonrational cognitive processes (Stacy, Newcomb, and Ames 2000), may be greater in response to an actual vaccine. In particular, IDUs sampled at needle exchange programs may be more concerned about the risks of HIV infection and needle/syringe sharing than IDUs who do not access prevention services; HIV vaccine acceptability might be lower and risk behavior inten- tions higher among the latter. Finally, the present sample, while representative of adults attending venues in Los Angeles that provide services to a range of persons at elevated risk for HIV infection, is not meant to represent persons at risk for HIV infection in the United States and may not generalize to otherlocales or populations. Further research on HIV vaccine acceptability among adults and adolescents in other HIV epicenters is warranted, particularly in low- and middle-income country settings. HIV vaccines are an important component of evolving combination prevention that integrates an array of biomedical and behavioral approaches in preventing new HIV infections. With over 50,000 annual HIV incident infections in the United States (Hall et al. 2008) and 2.5 million globally (UNAIDS 2006), each year of delay in dissemination of initial HIV vaccines will result in millions of new infections that might otherwise have beenaverted. Supporting formative research to build evidence-informed interven- tions for roll-out of initial, even other innova- tions in biomedical prevention\u2014 \u2014is likely to be a cost-effective strategy in contrast to the price of lifetime antiretroviral treatment. In addition to providing a foundation for social marketing and behavioral interventions, formative sociobehavioral research conducted among vulnerable adults can contribute to a long-term process of community engagement in HIV vaccine development (Newman 2006) that may foster communication, trust, and the acceptability of future HIV vaccines.
