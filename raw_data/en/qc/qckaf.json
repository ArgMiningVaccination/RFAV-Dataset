Network Open on 4/26/2023 Calciphylaxis is a rare and fatal disease that mainly occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and there is no approved medication to treat it. Sodium thiosulphate (STS) has been used as an off-label therapeutic in calciphylaxis to improve pain and accelerate the healing of skin lesions. However, there are no data from clinical trials to demonstrate the effectiveness of STS in calciphylaxis. We performed a meta-analysis of present cohort studies that provided data comparing outcomes among patients treated with and without STS to evaluate the efficacy of STS for calciphylaxis in CKD patients. We discovered that skin lesion improvement and survival rates were comparable between the STS and control groups. We also noted that there is a trend of reporting calciphylaxis refractory to STS in recent years discovered by meta-regression. Considering the sample size and other methodological limitations of studies included in our meta-analysis, a future large and well-designed randomized controlled trial is warranted to establish the effect of STS on calciphylaxis.

However, at low concentrations, indoles are widely used in perfumes! Many indoles are generated in the gut by the microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, the gut microbiome. In a recent collaborative study, we found that a gut microbiome derived indole family member, indole-3 propionic acid (IPA), has a neuroprotective role in patients who undergo surgeries. Patients that have lower blood IPA levels have a higher likelihood of developing delirium after surgeries, suggesting raising the blood IPA levels might be protective.

The results showed that rates of molecular testing increased substantially during the study period and use of molecular testing remained low. Rates of molecular testing and targeted therapy use were lower than expected, and rates varied by practice type with higher rates at NCI-designated cancer centers. These results suggest that where patients were treated may have affected access to recommended testing and therapies. (Summary submitted by Thomas J. Roberts, MD, MBA, Hematology/Oncology Unit, Department of Medicine) Patients with CHIP Without Increased Risk of Breast Cancer Relapse or Mortality [Clonal Hematopoiesis in Young Women Treated for Breast Cancer](https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-23-0050) Gibson CJ, Fell GG, Sella T, Sperling AS, Snow C [et al.], Miller PG Published in Clinical Cancer Research on 4/28/2023 Patients who are treated with chemotherapy and radiation for cancer are more likely to have acquired mutations in their blood cells, termed clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Since CHIP has been associated with an increased risk of developing blood cancers and elevated mortality in aging populations, understanding factors that contribute to its development is important for our patient populations. We studied a group of women under 40 years old who were treated for breast cancer and found a low rate of CHIP one year after the completion of treatment, that the level of CHIP did not significantly change over a four-year interval, and that after nine years of follow up, individuals with CHIP did not have an increased risk of breast cancer relapse or mortality. These results should be reassuring to young women with breast cancer who are incidentally found to have CHIP, and to oncologists who use genomic assessments of peripheral blood in the care of their breast cancer patients.

We used microbiome-dependent mouse cancer models to discover that gut bacteria suppress PD-L2 expression on dendritic cells and RGMb expression on CD8+ T cells. Combining blocking antibodies to PD-L2 or RGMb with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade promotes a durable anti-tumor response in multiple tumor models that do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade alone. These studies identify a novel role for RGMb in CD8+ T cells and suggest that targeting RGMB/PD-L2 could promote anti-tumor immunity in patients whose microbiome is preventing a response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.

ChatGPT is a conversational AI program that was developed based on natural language processing NLP) technology. We retrieved eight common questions and answers about colonoscopy from the publicly available webpages of three nationally ranked hospitals and input them into Chat GPT. A team of four gastroenterologists then rated the answers provided by ChatGPT. The study is the first of its kind, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that a contemporary LLM-derived conversational AI program is able to provide easy-to-understand, scientifically adequate, and generally satisfactory answers to CQs about colonoscopy as determined by gastroenterologists.

The relationship between FTR and race/ethnicity is unknown. We discovered that this relationship is unique among non-White patients. In our study, Black recipients had an increased risk of mortality after HT without a significant difference in FTR compared to White recipients; while, in contrast, Hispanic recipients had an increased likelihood of FTR without a significant mortality difference. We suggest tailored approaches to addressing these health inequities to improve overall HT outcomes. (Summary submitted by Orit Z.

This study used a unique experimental model to identify key differences in the airway response to allergens in allergic participants with and without asthma, with the goal of identifying biological signals that are specific to asthma. We identified several cellular and molecular pathways that were unique to asthma. In particular, asthmatic airways were dominated by pathways involved in airway inflammation and abnormal remodeling, while the airways of allergic individuals without asthma demonstrated signs of resolving inflammation and promoting tissue repair.

Genetics plays a significant role in IBD. However, most genetic data on IBD have been generated from people of European descent. Our new study represents the most extensive IBD genetic investigation conducted in East Asian populations. We discovered 80 new genetic loci linked to IBD among East Asians, and an additional 240 when combined with Europeans. Additionally, we developed an improved polygenic score for assessing IBD risk, particularly for those of Asian heritage.

But hundreds of genetic disorders that are not currently included in newborn screening now have targeted treatments, including a growing number of devastating childhood diseases for which gene and cell therapies can offer permanent cures. In this survey study of 238 rare disease experts, 87.9% agreed that genomic sequencing for treatable genetic conditions should be available to all newborns. Over 80% of participants agreed that a specific list of 25 genetic disorders should be added to newborn screening. This work may lay a roadmap for expanding newborn screening and identifying children at risk for rare disease. (Summary submitted by Nina B.

In this study, we measured lipoprotein(a) levels in patients undergoing evaluation of the coronary arteries via invasive cardiac catheterization. We found that elevated lipoprotein(a) was associated with the number and severity of coronary artery blockages and with cardiovascular events - such as heart attack or cardiovascular death - in follow-up. This works adds to the evidence that elevated lipoprotein(a) may cause heart blockages and heart attacks. Clinical trials of new therapeutics aimed at lowering lipoprotein(a) are underway for patients with established cardiovascular disease. (Summary submitted by Thomas C. Gilliland, Jr, MD, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine) Gut Microbiota Affect Delirium Patients [The Association Between Gut Microbiota and Postoperative Delirium in Patients](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-023-02450-1) Zhang Y, Baldyga K, Dong Y, Song W, Villanueva M [et al.], Xie Z Published in Translational Psychiatry on 5/9/2023 | [Press Release](https://www.massgeneral.org/news/press-release/gut-bacteria-delirium-elderly-patients) A new study has uncovered a potential association between gut bacteria and postoperative delirium, a common complication that affects patients after surgery. Through an analysis of fecal samples from surgical patients, researchers observed that higher levels of a specific bacterium called Parabacteroides distasonis in postoperative samples were potentially linked to the presence of delirium. These findings provide insights into the possible pathology of postoperative delirium and present the opportunity for targeted interventions. The study underscores the importance of investigating the relationship between gut bacteria and brain function, opening up exciting possibilities for improving postoperative care, particularly in elderly patients.

Trigeminal neuralgia has yet to be successfully modeled in rodents. Our research team discovered that a natural skull base foramen, foramen of lacerum, provides direct access to the trigeminal nerve root in rodents. Impingement of the nerve at this location leads to drastic trigeminal neuralgia-like behavior in rodents, including lancinating pain attacks and dental pain. Using this model, the team discovered a unique brain cortical neural activity pattern that is likely a key substrate mediating pain. This novel tool provides a powerful platform to accelerate mechanistic exploration and therapeutics development.

These bacteria are influenced by diet and medications to regulate distinct metabolic pathways. These findings provide new insights into the ways that the micro-environment within the colon can lead to the formation of different types of pre-cancerous polyps and suggest new strategies for the diagnosis and even prevention of these polyps.

Radical cystectomy (RC) is the traditional standard of care, which involves removing the bladder and some surrounding organs. However, it is a major operation with significant morbidity. Bladder-sparing therapy using trimodality therapy (TMT) combines transurethral endoscopic resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) with concurrent radiation and chemotherapy, and this alternative has emerged as an effective treatment for select patients with MIBC. In the absence of completed randomized control trials, we conducted a large multi-institutional study comparing cancer outcomes after RC and TMT in patients who were eligible for both approaches (e.g. single tumors less than 7 cm). We found no statistically significant differences in terms of rates of cancer specific survival. This paradigm-changing study provides the best available evidence to support that TMT should be offered to all suitable candidates with MIBC and not only to patients with significant comorbidities for whom surgery is not an option.

However, the specific targets of ROS following chemotherapy remain almost completely unknown. By integrating cysteine-based chemical proteomics and functional genomic CRISPR screening, we gain unprecedented insights into mechanisms of action of ROS-generating chemotherapies at protein- and organelle-level resolution. Importantly we identify CHK1 as a nuclear H2O2 sensor that launches a cellular program to dampen ROS. CHK1 phosphorylates the mitochondrial DNA binding protein SSBP1 to prevent its mitochondrial localization, which in turn decreases nuclear H2O2. Our results reveal a druggable nucleus-to-mitochondria ROS sensing pathway-required to resolve nuclear H2O2 accumulation and mediate resistance to platinum-based agents in ovarian cancers.

Through neuroimaging, his scans showed that his brain had extensive amyloid plaques and tau tangles. But one brain region called the entorhinal cortex, a known hub for memory, navigation and the perception of time, had a very minimal amount of tau tangles. Genetic analyses of this patient revealed that he was a carrier of a rare variant in the Reelin gene (Reelin-COLBOS), a variant that offers protection by diminishing the pathological modifications of tau. Together, the findings demonstrate that Reelin-COLBOS signaling pathways influencing tau play an important role in the protection against Alzheimer's disease.

Previous studies have described association with H1N1 infection and immunization. However, what are the risk factors that affect neuronal loss in narcolepsy has been the most important unanswered question in the field. In our study, we discovered genetic variants that mediate immunity through the human leukocyte antigen as well as variants affecting interferon signaling or infection. Our findings highlight the role of T-cells and antigen presentation, and connect narcolepsy with autoimmunity, immunization, and infection with H1N1. (Summary submitted by Hanna M.

However, we did not know which of these measures were of highest priority to key stakeholders. In the current study, we engaged parents who lost a child to cancer in a discrete choice experiment to understand their priorities. Bereaved parents prioritized measures focused on managing symptoms and meeting families' goals and wishes. In contrast, quality measures assessing their child's hospital resource use were substantially less important. Findings help set a family-centered agenda for quality improvement in children with advanced cancer.

In this study, we developed an AI tool to identify those at highest risk for severe lung disease based on chest x-ray images from 40k individuals. We found that the AI tool could accurately predict lung disease mortality beyond age, smoking, and other known risk factors.

We found that a new, neurodevelopmental polygenic score (PGS) that reflects shared features of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, depression, and Tourette syndrome, predicted a wide range of symptoms in early adolescence. Using transcriptomic data, we found that expression of implicated neurodevelopmental genes peaks in prenatal life, within the cerebellum. In turn, smaller cerebellar volumes are associated with increased symptom severity. These findings suggest that the genetic basis of childhood psychiatric symptoms differs from that for adults, and implicate altered fetal cerebellar development in emergence of symptoms a decade after birth.

A leading cause of autism spectrum disorders, FXS results from inactivation of FMR1 gene due to a congenital trinucleotide (CGG) repeat that expands to hundreds. By investigating conditions favorable to FMR1 reactivation, we discover conditions that induce a strong repeat contraction and full FMR1 reactivation in cellular models. We trace the mechanism to a special nucleic acid structure called \"R-loops\" formed between DNA and RNA, which cells see as DNA damage and instigate cells to bring repair mechanisms to fix the problem. The native repair mechanism drives excision of the long CGG repeat to more normal copies and enable cells to re-express the crucial FMR1 gene. Our study, therefore, identifies a potential method of treating or even \"curing\" FXS in the future.

To gain insight, we examined tissues from 32 Alzheimer's disease and healthy donor brains and performed a detailed gene expression analysis using a technique called single-nucleus RNA sequencing. This generated a large dataset representing 51,586 individual endothelial cells, revealing new findings about this often-overlooked cell type. For example, comparisons of gene expression show these cells are surprisingly different across five brain regions even in healthy aging. In disease, cells in each brain region react differently to the development of pathology, with amyloid plaques being associated with the greatest changes. These findings help explain how important vascular functions are non-uniformly disrupted across brain regions in Alzheimer's and point towards novel gene targets to reverse dysfunction.

BCG has a fascinating century-long history and has been linked with several beneficial off-target effects, including decreased death in newborns, decreased risk of several types of cancers, improvements in glucose metabolism in type-1 diabetes, and decreased respiratory infections. Currently, the only US FDA-approved use of the BCG vaccine is for treating certain superficial bladder cancers. In analyzing medical records from Mass General Brigham databases, our team identified a 20% decrease in the 15-year incidence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in bladder cancer patients receiving BCG treatment compared with individuals receiving an alternative treatment for a similar disease. We also found a 25% decrease in the incidence of death in these individuals. Our results support further study of BCG in preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative diseases, as well as more broadly and improving geriatric health in a globally cost-effective way.

Recent genomic studies have revealed that the Mab evolutionary tree is characterized by extremely dense clusters of isolates sampled from diverse geographies. While Mab was historically thought to be acquired by patients independently from the environment, these results raise the possibility of patient-to-patient transmission. In this study we provide evidence that the emergence of Mab clusters has coincided with a slowing of the mutation rate, resulting in the appearance of dense clusters. We propose that changes in the mutation rate result from beneficial mutations in DNA repair machinery. These results challenge the transmission model of cluster emergence in Mab.

Recent studies suggest that CHIP accelerates development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in healthy persons. To evaluate CHIP's impact in a higher-risk population, we examined 13,000 patients previously diagnosed with ASCVD. Our study revealed that ASCVD patients with CHIP, particularly those with mutations in high-risk genes, faced a higher risk of new ASCVD events or death. These results pave the way for future clinical trials targeting CHIP for ASCVD risk reduction.

Although prior research has demonstrated multiple social, environmental, cultural, and molecular factors that influence food choices, the impact of genetic variation on food choice behavior remains largely unexplored. In a secondary analysis of the ChooseWell 365 study, the relationship between genetic variation linked to nutrient preferences (i.e., preference for carbohydrate, fat, or protein-rich foods) and workplace food purchases was examined among 397 MGH employees. The results suggested that individuals with a stronger genetic predisposition towards carbohydrate-rich foods tended to make more purchases overall and to select healthier food options. While these findings are preliminary, they provide valuable insights into how specific genetic susceptibilities concerning nutrient preferences can shape long-term food choices. This knowledge can guide future experiments to enhance understanding of food choice behavior. (Summary submitted by Anne N.

We found that, relative to other patients, those living with HIV or hepatitis C are less likely to receive surgery, even though surgery is often the best treatment. This suggests that doctors and healthcare systems need to do more to combat discrimination, and to work directly with people living with HIV and hepatitis C to make sure that they are accountable to providing the best possible care to all of their patients.

Specifically, astrocytic calcium signaling is implicated in many functions such as regulating synaptic transmission, vascular dynamics and neurovascular coupling, among others. Here, we have used high-resolution multiphoton imaging to analyze calcium signaling in vivo in awake mice with AD pathology. We have observed a cell-wide astrocytic calcium dysregulation due mainly to neuronally-derived soluble Abeta, with calcium hypoactivity in the astrocyte structure in close contact with blood vessels (endfeet) and hyperactivity of spontaneous calcium signaling throughout the rest of the astrocyte. Our findings highlight a role for astrocytic calcium pathophysiology in soluble-Abeta mediated neurodegenerative processes in AD.
