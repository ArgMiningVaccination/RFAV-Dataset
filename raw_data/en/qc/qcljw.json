SUMMARY: This Federal Register notice announces the policy of the federal agencies involved with the review of biotechnology research and products. As certa in concepts are new to this policy, and will be the subject of rulemaking, the public is invited to comment on these aspects which are specifically identified herein. DATE: Comments must be recei ved on or before August 25, 1986. Public Participation: The Domestic Polic y Council Working Group on Biotechnology through the Office of Science and Technology Policy is seeking advice on certain refinements published herein to the previously published proposed coordinated framework for regulation of biotechnology. These new aspects include the Biotechnology Science Coordinating Committee's (BSCC's) definitions for an \"ontogenetic organi sm (new organism)\" and for \"pathogen.\" These definitions are critical to the coordinated fram ework for the regulation of biotechnology because they establish the types of the organism s subject to certain kinds of review. It is the intention of the Domestic Po licy Council Working Group on Biotechnology, the Biotechnology Science Coordina ting Committee (BSCC), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Sc ience Foundation (NSF), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (O SHA) that the policies contained herein be effective immediately. In consideration of co mments, modifications, if any, may be published either in a separate notice or as part of proposed rulema king by the involved agencies. Information submitted to an agency that is trade secret information or confidential business information should be clearly marked so that it can be accorded the protection provided to such by each respective agency. ADDRESS: Comments specific to th e BSCC definitions or overall comments to the Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology statements should be addressed to: BSCC: Docket #BSCC 0001, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Executive Office of the President, NEOB-Room 5005, Washington, DC 20506. Comments relating to the policy stat ements of a particular agency should be sent directly to the agency contact identified at the beginning of the respective agency policy statement.

Introduction This notice describes the comprehensive federal regulatory policy for en suring the safety of biotechnology research and products . Specifically addressed are agency policies that formed part of the previously proposed Coordinate d Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology, published in the Federal Register December 31, 1984 (49 FR 50856, hereinafter \"the December 84 Notice\"). These agency policies build upon ex perience with agricultura l, pharmaceutical, and other commercial products developed by traditional genetic modification techniques. Existing statutes provide a basic network of agency jurisdiction over both research and products; this network forms the basis of this coordi nated framework and helps assure reasonable safeguards for the public. This framework is expe cted to evolve in accord with the experiences of the industry and the agencies, and, thus, modifications may need to be made through administrative or legislative actions. The application of traditional genetic modification techniques is relied upon broadly for enhanced characteristics of f ood (e.g., hybrid corn, selective breeding), manufactured food (e.g., bread, cheese, yogurt), waste disposal (e.g., bact erial sewage treatment), medicine (e.g., vaccines, hormones), pesticides (e.g. Bacillus thur ingiensis) and other uses. Federal agencies implement an array of laws which seek to ensure the safety of these products. A concise index of these U.S. laws was published in the Federal Register November 14, 1985 (50 FR 47174, hereinafter \"the November 85 Notice\"). These la ws are product-specific because they regulate certain product uses, such as foods or pesticid es. This approach pr ovides the opportunity for similar products to be treated similarly by particular re gulatory agencies. Biotechnology also includes recently devel oped and newly emerging genetic manipulation technologies, such as recombinant DNA (rDNA), recombinant RNA (rRNA) and cell fusion, that are sometimes referred to as genetic engineeri ng. While the recently developed methods are an extension of traditional manipulations that can pr oduce similar or identical products, they enable more precise genetic modifications, and theref ore hold the promise for exciting innovation and new areas of commercial opportunity. Concerns were raised as to whether products resulting from the recently developed techniques would pose greater risks than those achieved through traditional manipulation techniques. For example, what might be the possible environm ental consequences of the many anticipated agricultural and environmental applications that will take place outside the physical constraints of a contained facility? In pa rticular, the environmental appli cation of genetica lly engineered microorganisms may elicit concern because they ar e of microscopic size, and some may be able to reproduce, proliferate, and become established. The underlying policy question was whether the regulatory framework that pertained to products developed by traditional genetic manipulation te chniques was adequate for products obtained with the new techniques. A similar question ar ose regarding the sufficiency of the review process for research conducted for agri cultural and environmental applications. The Administration, recognizing its responsibility to confront these concerns, formed an interagency working group under the former Wh ite House Cabinet Council on Natural Resources and the Environment in the spring of 1984. Th e working group sought to achieve a balance between regulation adequate to ensure health and environmental safety while maintaining sufficient regulatory flexibility to avoid im peding the growth of an infant industry. Upon examination of the existing laws availabl e for the regulation of products developed by traditional genetic manipulation techniques, the wo rking group concluded that, for the most part, these laws as currently implemented would address regulatory needs adequately. For certain microbial products, however, additional regulatory requirements, available under existing statutory authority, need ed to be established. The existing health and safety laws had the advantage that they could provide more immediate regulatory protection and certainty for the industry than possible with the implementation of new legislation. Moreover, there did not appear to be an alternative, unitary, statutory approach since the very broad spectrum of products obtained with genetic engineering cut across many product uses regulated by different agencies. Because of the rapid growth in the scientific knowledge base, the working group felt strongly that the federal agencies needed to have an interagency mechanism for sharing scientific information related to biotechnology, partic ularly information on research and product applications submitted to the agencies. The December 1984 Notice described the regulatory framework envisioned by the working group, and recognizing the evolutionary nature of its development, asked for comments. In summary, the Notice stated that the Food a nd Drug Administration (FDA) would regulate genetic engineering products no differently that those achieved through tr aditional techniques. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) desc ribed existing and prop osed new policies for regulating pesticidal and nonpestic idal microorganisms. The Depa rtment of Agriculture (USDA) stated that under its different legislative authorities it coul d broadly regulate genetically engineered plants and animals, and plant and animal pathogens. The Notice also proposed an interagency science coordinating mechanism. Many comments were received in res ponse to the Notice. These cont ributed to the refinement of both the regulatory requirements and the in teragency science coordination mechanism. The interagency coordination mechanism, the Biotechnology Science Coordinating Committee (BSCC), discussed in more detail in section C, of this Preamble, came into being while the agencies were still in process of refining thei r regulatory proposals. Consequently, the BSCC was able to play a helpful role in the formula tion of two basic principles: (1) Agencies should seek to adopt consistent definitions of those genetically engineered organisms subject to review to the extent permitted by their respective statutor y authorities; and, (2) ag encies should utilize scientific reviews of comparable rigor. The regulatory framework anticipates that future scientific developments will lead to further refinements. Experience with earlier basic scient ific research has shown that as the science progressed and became better understood by the pub lic, regulatory regimens could be modified to reflect more complete understanding of the potential risks i nvolved. Similar evolution is anticipated in the regulation of commercial product s as scientists and regul ators learn to predict more precisely particular product use that require greater or lesser controls or even exemption from any federal review. This framework has sought to distinguish between those organisms that require a certain level of federal review and those that do not. This follows a traditional approach to regulation. Within agriculture, for example, introdu ctions of new plants, animals and microorganisms have long occurred routinely with only so me of those that are not nati ve or are pathogenic requiring regulatory approval. It should be noted that microorganisms play many essential and varied roles in agriculture and the environment and th at for decades agricultural scientists have endeavored to exploit their adva ntages through routine experiment ation and introduction into the environment; and as a rule these agricultural a nd environmental introductions have taken place without harm to the environment. B. The Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology General Comments This notice includes separate descriptions of the regulatory policies of FDA, EPA, OSHA and USDA and the research policies of the National institutes of Health (NIH), NSF, EPA and USDA. The agencies will seek to operate thei r programs in an integrated and coordinated fashion and together should cover the full range of plants, animals a nd microorganisms derived by the new genetic engineering techniques. To th e extent possible, responsibility for a product use will lie with a single agency. Where regulat ory oversight or review for a particular product is to be performed by more than one agency, the policy establishes a lead agency, and consolidated or coordinated reviews. While th is preamble seeks to convey an overview of the coordinated framework, it must be noted that th e regulatory requirements are highly technical; reliance only on the simplified summary statemen ts herein could be misleading and, thus, the agency policy statements must be consulted for speci fic details. In the event that questions arise regarding which federal agency has jurisdicti on, an information contact is provided at the beginning of this notice. While in part certain USDA and EPA requirements are new, the underlying regulatory regimens are not new. Members of the agricultural and industrial communities are familiar with the general requirements under these laws which include the Federa l Plant Pest Act, The Plant Quarantine Act, the Toxic Substances Contro l Act (TSCA), and the Federal insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Because this comprehensive regulatory framework us es a mosaic of existing federal law, some of the statutory nomenclature for certain actions ma y seem inconsistent. Certain laws, such as USDA's Federal Plant Pest Act, require a \"permit\" before a microorganism pathogenic to plants may be transported or imported. Under other laws such as FIFRA, the agencies \"license\" or \"approve\" the use of particular products. TSCA requires a \"premanufacturing notification (PMN)\". There are also some variations among the agencies in the use of the phrase \"genetic engineering.\" Regardless of the nomenclature, the public should be aware that the reviews conducted by each of the regulatory agencies are intended to be of comparable rigor. Agencies have agreed to have scientists from each other's staff participate in reviews. Each regulatory review will require that the safety, or safety and efficacy, of a particular agricu ltural or industrial product be satisfactorily demonstrated to the regulatory agency prio r to commercialization. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) im poses procedural requirements on all federal agencies to prepare an analysis prior to making a decision to take any action that may significantly affect the environment. Depe nding on the characterist ics of a proposal, an environmental assessment, or a broader environmen tal impact statement may need to be prepared in connection with the re lease of genetically manipulated or ganisms. EPA's actions under most of its environmental statutes ha ve been considered to be the functional equivalent of NEPA compliance. For the handling of microorganisms, agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services have established recommendations for the safe use of infectious agents. The CDC/NIH publication, Biosafety in Microbio logical and Biomedical Laborator ies, describes combinations of standard and special microbi ological practices, safety equipment and facilities which are recommended for working with a variety of infectious agents in research laboratories, academic and industrial. The USDA also has issued guidance on other infectious agents. The NIH has published guidelines for the co ntained use of DNA organisms in the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, Federal Register, May 7, 1986 (51 FR 16958, NIH guidelines). The guidelines recommend physical containment at specific levels for different experiments, and exempt ot her experiments from containment requirements. However, they recommend Biosafety Level 1, the least stringent level of physical containment, for some \"exempt\" experiments. For large- scale exempt experiments, the NIH guidelines recommended \"Biosafety Level 1-Large-Scale\" although following review by the Institutional Biosafety Committee, \"some latitude\" in the application of these requirements is permitted. The appropriate large-scale containment require ments for many low risk DNA derived industrial microorganisms will be no greater than those appropr iate for the unmodified parental organisms. This concept is discussed further in th e Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) document, described in the International Aspects section below. OSHA in its Federal Register Notice of Apr il 12, 1984 (50 FR 14468) stated that its authority under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. et seq.) provides an adequate and enforceable basis for protecting the safety and health of employees in the field of biotechnology and that no additional regulation is necessary. After consideration of comments in the April 1984 notice, OSHA is publishing this po licy statement in final form without change. Product Regulation Agencies involved with regula ting agriculture, foods, medical devices, drugs, biologics and pesticides have had extensive experience with pr oducts that involve living organisms in their manufacture and/or ultimate use including releases into the environment for these purposes. By the time a genetically engineered product is r eady for commercialization, it will have undergone substantial review and testing during the research phase, and t hus, information regarding its safety should be available. The manufacture by the newer technologies of food, the development of new drugs, medical devices, biologics for humans and animals, and pesticides, will be reviewed by FDA, USDA and EPA in essentially the same manner for safety and efficacy as products obtained by other techniques. The new products that will be brought to market will generally fit within these agenci es' review and approval regimens. The regulatory scheme for products is described in Chart I Coordinated Framework -- Marketing Approval of Biotechnology Products.

Jurisdiction over the varied biot echnology products is determined by their use, as has been the case for traditional products. The detailed descri ption of the products and their review are found in the individual agency policy statements cont ained in this Federal Register Notice. The following is a brief summary of jurisdiction as described in Chart I. Foods, food additives, human drugs , biologics and devices, and an imal drugs are reviewed or licensed by the FDA. Food products prepared fr om domestic livestock and poultry are under the jurisdiction of the US DA's Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS). Animal biologics are reviewed by the Animal a nd Plant Health Inspection Service, (APHIS). APHIS, also reviews plants, seeds, animal biologics, plant pests, animal pathogens and \"regulated articles\", i.e., cont ain genetically engineered organi sms containing genetic material from a plant pest. An APHIS permit is required prior to the shipment (m ovement) or release into the environmental of regulated ar ticles, or the shipment of a plant pest or animal pathogen. \"Other contained uses\" refers to the closed sy stem uses of those microorganisms, subject the TSCA, that are intergeneric combinations, i. e., deliberately formed microorganisms which contain genetic material from dissimilar source organisms. These are subject to EPA's PMN requirement. EPA is considering promulgati ng a rule to exempt certain classes of microorganisms from this requirement. Microbial pesticides will be reviewed by EPA, with APHIS involvement in cases where the pesticide is also a plant pest, animal pathogen, or regulated artic le requiring a permit. (FDA may become involved in implementing pesticide tolerances for foods.) \"Other uses (microorganisms)\" include uses involv ing release into the environment. For these, jurisdiction depends on the characte ristics of the organism as we ll as its use. \"Intergeneric combination\" * microorganisms will be reported to EPA under PMN requirements, with APHIS Involvement in cases where the microorganism is also a regulated arti cle requiring a permit. \"Intrageneric combinations\" are those microorgani sms formed by genetic engineering other than intergeneric combinations. For th ese, when there is a pathogenic1 source organism, and the microorganism is used for agricultural purposes, APHIS has jurisdiction. If the microorganism is used for nonagricultural purposes, then EP A has jurisdiction, with APHIS involvement in cases where the microorganism is also a regulat ed article requiring a permit. Intrageneric combinations with no pathogenic source orga nisms are under EPA jurisdiction although EPA will only require an informational report. \"Nonengineered pathogens\" that are used fo r an agricultural use will fall under APHIS jurisdiction. Those that are fo r a nonagricultura l use come under EPA jurisdiction, with APHIS involvement in cases where the microorganism is also a plant pest or animal pathogen requiring a permit. Nonengineered nonpathogenic microor ganisms are under EPA jurisdiction which will require only an informational report. Research The coordinated framework for the regulation of biotechnology establishes requirements for the conduct of research. 1 \"Intergeneric organisms (new organisms)\" and \"pathoge n\" are defined in section D. of the preamble. Approximately ten years ago the NIH issued the NIH guidelines describing the manner in which research with organisms deri ved by rDNA techniques should be conducted. Since then the guidelines have been modified many times with gradual relaxation of these requirements. The guidelines prescribe the conditions under whic h institutions which receive NIH funds must conduct experiments. For a very small cate gory of NIH funded experiments including environmental release, the guidelines require that the Director, NIH, a pprove each experiment on an individual basis. For each of these experiment s, the RAC conducts a scientific review with an opportunity for public comment, and makes a recommendation to the NIH Director. As research experiments have expended out of the biomedi cal area to environmental applications both agricultural and nonagric ultural, other agencies have become involved, with shifting of responsibility for research appr oval to NSF (described in th e November 85 Notice), USDA's S&E, and EPA. These other agencies' policie s build, in part, on the NIH guidelines and NIH experience. The S&E guidelines for agricultura l research published separately for comment in this issue of the Federal Register have adopt ed the NIH guidelines with certain modifications including expansion of the scope to manipul ation techniques other than r DNA; the table included with the S&E guidelines shows where particular el ements of the NIH guidelines are used. It should be noted that not all experiments i nvolving the environmental release of genetically engineered organisms require prior federal approval. In plant appl ications there is a substantial body of research indicating that such experiments are of low ri sk. For certain categories of microorganisms modified by traditional genetic modification techniques, there is also a substantial body of research indicating low risk for environmental experiments. Chart II\u2014 Coordinated Framework\u2014Biotechnology Research Jurisdiction shows which agency has responsibility for a particular experiment. If more than one agency has potential jurisdiction, one agency has been designated as the lead agency and it is marked with an asterisk on Chart II. The lead agency designation depends on which research agency is f unding the research (e.g., NIH, S&E, or NSF) or which regulatory ag ency reviews specific purpose research (e.g. pesticides). In the chart and in this discussion, the authority re fers to approval of the actual execution of experiments and not to their funding.

For contained federally funded research for bi omedical and agricultural purposes, research approval will be granted by the funding agency. The NIH guidelines relate primarily to biomedical experiments and only to those us ing rDNA techniques. Research on foods/food additives, human drugs, medical devices and biologics will continue to rely on the NIH guidelines, with NIH approval required for certain experiments such as human gene therapy, and FDA permission for clinical trials. Fashioned after the NIH guidelines, the S&E guide lines apply to agricultural research on plants, animals, and microorganisms and provide guidance for laboratory and field testing of organisms derived using rDNA manipulation and other technologies. Adheren ce to the appropriate set of guidelines is required for institutions receiving financial support fr om NIH, S&E, or NSF. These guidelines specify what type of review procedures are requi red for specific categories of experiments. Some experiment s require individual approval by the respective agency providing institutional support. For those experiments that require agency approval, advisory committees at NIH, S&E, and NSF, composed primarily of nongovernment scientists, may be asked to provide expert review. In addition, research on plants, animals, and animal biologics will come under APHIS permit requirements if a regulated arti cle, plant pest, animal pathogen is involved. An APHIS permit is required prior to the shipment (movement) or release of a regulated article, or the importation or shipment of a plant pest or regulated article used in any research experiment. EPA has authority for all environmental research on microbial pesticides regardless of whether research is federally funded or not. EPA will re gulate research under a tw o level review system based upon its evaluation of the potential risks posed by various types of microorganisms with lesser notification required for level reporting and fu ll review for level II. For the \"the uses\" category from Chart II (research involving nonpesticide microorganisms released into the environment), jurisdiction for release may be under S&E, NSF, APHIS, or EPA depending primarily upon the source of the f unding, but also upon the purpose of the research and the characteristics of the genetically engi neered microorganism. Thus, federally funded research conducted for an agricultural use will require adherence to S&E guidelines and approval of certain experiments by S&E or NIH dependi ng on which is the funding agency. EPA will review commercial research. APHIS's jurisdiction applies to issuing permits for regulated articles, plant pests, or animal pathogens. EPA will require an informational report for nonengineered microorganisms released into the environment, with APHIS involvement for the review of plant pests or animal pathogens. There may be situations where one agency may choose to defer to, or ask advice from, another agency. If experiments requiring NIH, NSF or S&E review/approval are submitted for review to another agency, then NIH, NSF, or S&E may de termine that such revi ew serves the same purpose, and based upon that determination, notif y the submitter that no NIH, NSF, or S&E review will take place, and the experiment may proceed upon approval from the other agency. C. Interagency Coordination Mechanisms The Domestic Policy Council Wo rking Group on Biotechnology The Domestic Policy Council Working Group on Biotechnology has been responsible for this coordinated framework for the regulation of biotechnology; it also c onsiders policy matters related to agency jurisdiction, commercialization, and interna tional biotechnology matters. The Working Group monitors developments in biotec hnology and is ready to identify problems and make appropriate recommendations for their solution. The Domestic Policy Council Working Group on Biotechnology is a continuation of a similar group established under the former Cabinet Council on Natural Resources and the Environment. Although at the present time existin g statutes seem adequate to deal with the emerging processes and products of modern biotechno logy, there always can be potenti al problems and deficiencies in the regulatory apparatus in a fast moving field. The Working Group will be alert to the implications these changes will have on regulation, and in a timely fashion will make appropriate recommendations for administ rative or legi slative action. The Biotechnology Science C oordinating Committee (BSCC) The BSCC is responsible for coordination and cons istency of scientific policy and scientific reviews. The BSCC, established October 31, 198 5 as part of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (FCCSET) , consists of senior policy officials of agencies involved in the oversight of biot echnology research and products. FCCSET is a statutory interagency coordinating mechanis m managed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Executive Office of the Presid ent, with a mission to coordinate federal science activities among federal agencies. The November 85 Notice described the structure and activities of the BSCC. One of the primary activities of the BSCC has been the development of definitions because a common scientific approach is essential to a coordinated federal regulatory framework. The underlying scientific issue, theref ore, was defining those organism s subject to certain types of agency review. The definitions are included in the followi ng section of this preamble and have been incorporated, with modification, into the individual policy notices of the involved agencies. Explanatory material is also included in the agen cy policy statements. As mentioned elsewhere, the BSCC is seeking comments on these definitions Research to develop genetically modified organisms for environm ental and agricultural applications (as for research on traditionally m odified organisms) generally proceeds in a stepwise manner from highly contained facilities to progressively lesser degrees of containment as the investigator determines the safety and efficacy of experimental applications; there are conducted sequentially under cont rolled laboratory conditions, gr eenhouse testing, small field trials, and full field trials. The BSCC recognizes the need for further work to define the nature and extent of physical and biol ogical barriers that limit or mana ge environmental release of modified organisms during greenho use testing and field research. The BSCC is authorized to hold public meetings in order to discuss public concerns about scientific and other issues. Accordingly, the BS CC will hold its first public meeting shortly after publication of this notice for discus sion of the scientific aspects of this notice and the receipt of comments from the public. The public meeting will be held in July 1986. Details regarding time and location will be separately a nnounced in the Federal Register. D. BSCC Definitions Any proposal to regulate the rese arch and products of genetic ma nipulation techniques quickly confronts the issue of what organisms should be considered appropriate for certain types of review. The BSCC formulated de finitions are effective immedi ately but are open to comment; the text following the definition of \"pathogen\" contains details of the request for comments. Organisms meeting two different sets of criteri a are proposed. First are organisms formed by deliberate combination of genetic material from sources in differe nt genera. It was recognized, however, that in certain precisely constructed \"intergeneric organism s\" the genetic material is not considered to pose an increased risk to hum an health or the environment; thus, such combinations are excluded from the definition. A detailed explanation of the scientific basis for these exclusions is found in th e footnote after the de finition of pathogen. The BSCC specifically requests comments on whether also to consider for exclusion those organisms that exchange DNA by known physiological processes, as explai ned in the text immediately following the definition of \"intergeneric organism (new organism).\" The second definition is \"pathogen.\" This include s microorganisms that belong to a pathogenic species or that contain genetic material from s ource organisms that are pa thogenic. In certain precisely constructed modified organisms, the ge netic material from a pathogenic donor is not considered to pose an increased risk to human health or the e nvironment; and, therefore, such combinations are excluded from the definition. The BSCC definitions of \"intergeneric organism (new organism)\" and \"pathogen\" describe the combinations genetic material that would cause a modified organism to come under review. This does not mean to suggest that the behavior of a genetically manipulated organism exempted from these definitions is wholly predictable (s ince any biological organism is never 100% predictable), but that the probability of any incremental hazard compared to the unmodified organism host is low. Also, this does not mean that any product manufacture or research experiment using an organism exempted fr om the definition shoul d be conducted without adherence to proper manufacturing st andards or research guidelines. Given the statutory differences in the laws that they administer, the agencies adopted the principles underlying the definitions in ways consistent with their legislation. EPA, APHIS, and S&E are using the definitions to identify levels of review for microbial products within their jurisdiction. EPA, APHIS, FDA, S&E, and NSF are using the defin itions as factors to consider in the review of products or experiments. The BSCC is attempting to define what constitutes \"release into the environment.\" The BSCC is establishing a working group on greenhouse containm ent and small field trials in order to develop scientific recommendations. The concept of \"containment\" has traditionally been used to describe physical conditions which severely limit release (for example, a contained laboratory fermentation facility). Containment can also be \"b iologic\" because the abili ty of an organism to reproduce, exchange genetic information, or become established can be effectively limited biologically. Thus, the BSCC's exploration of the conditions that consti tute release into the environment will consider circumstances of both physical and biological containment for particular organisms and the circumstances of their release. While the concept of physical containment may imply the high containment c onditions found in certa in laboratories and greenhouses, in agricultural practice many simple r effective barriers are routinely used; these include microplots for soil bacteria and fungi, paddocks for noninfective animals, and removing or covering the reproductive pa rts of plants and animals. Release into the environment, for the time being, will have somewhat varying definitions for the regulatory and research review of the different agencies. There may be minor differences between agricultural and nonagricultural approa ches and between macro-and microorganisms. Intergeneric Organism (New Organism) Those organisms deliberately formed to contain an intergeneric combination of genetic material; excluded are organisms that have re sulted from the addition of intergeneric materials that is well- characterized and contains only non-coding regulatory regions such as operators, promoters, origins of replication, terminators and ribosome binding regions. \"Well-characterized and contains only non-coding regulatory regions \" means that the producer of the microorganism can document the following: a. The exact nucleotide base sequence of the regulatory re gion and any inserted flanking nucleotides; b. The regulatory region and any inserted flanki ng nucleotides do not code independently for a protein, peptide of functional RNA molecules; c. The regulatory region solely controls the activ ity of other sequences th at code for protein or peptide molecules or act as recognition sites for the initiation of nuc leic acid or protein synthesis. Pathogen A pathogen is a virus or microorga nism (including its viruses and plasmids, if any) that has the ability to cause disease in othe r living organisms (i.e., humans, animals, plants, microorganisms). A microorganism (including viruses) will be subj ect to regulatory policies regarding pathogens if: a. the microorganism belongs to a pathogenic sp ecies, according to sources identified by the agency, or from information known to the producer that the organism is a pathogen; excepted are organisms belonging to a strain used for la boratory research or commercial purposes and generally recognized as non-pathogenic according to sources identified by a federal agency, or information known to the producer and the appr opriate federal agency (an example of a nonpathogenic strain of a species which contains pathogenic strains is Escherichia coli K-12; examples of nonpathogenic spec ies are Bacillus subtilis, La ctobacillus acidophilus, and Saccharomyces species); or b. The microorganism has been derived form a pathogen or has been deliberately engineered such that it contains genetic material from a pa thogenic organism as defined in item a. above. Excepted are genetically engineered organisms developed by transferring a well- characterized, non-coding regulatory region from a pathogeni c donor to a non-pathogenic recipient. \"Well-characterized, non-coding regulatory regi on\" means the producer of the microorganism can document the following: a. The exact nucleotide base sequence of the regulatory re gion and any inserted flanking nucleotides; b. The regulatory region and any inserted flanki ng nucleotides do not code independently for a protein, peptide, or functional RNA molecules; and, c. The regulatory region solely controls the activ ity of other sequences th at code for protein or peptide molecules or act as recognition sites for the initiation of nuc leic acid or protein synthesis. This definition excludes organisms such as comp etitors or colonizers of the same substrates, commensal or mutualistic microorga nisms, or opportunistic pathogens. The footnote contains the scientific basis for exempting non-coding regulatory regions from the definitions of intergeneric organisms and pathogen. 2 2 The BSCC has based the exemption of intergeneric transfers of regulatory regions on their lack of coding capacity for the production of proteins, peptides or functi onal RNA molecules. It has been recomme nded by other members of the scientific community that there should be additional exemptions such as ribosomal proteins, ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs. The BSCC has chosen to examine these suggesti ons in more detail during the next fe w months. At the present the BSCC has excluded: 1. Origins of replications; 2. Ribosome binding sites; 3. Promoters; 4. Operators; and, 5. Terminators. The basis for these exemptions is as follows. Each of these regulatory elements has no coding capacity for the production of any gene product and therefore does not promote the production of any new material. What these elemen ts are responsible for is the initiation and modulation of nucleic acid synthesis at the specific region where they appear in the chromosome. Bacterial genes are precisely regulated and this regulation is based on a series of regulatory elements. The principal regulatory unit is the operon. Operons are co ntrolled primarily, but not exclusively, through the regulation of the rate of initiation of messenger RNA synthesis. This regulation is ba sed on the interaction of two short nucleotide sequences in the DNA, the promoter, which is the site of RNA polymerase binding and th e operator, which follows cl osely and acts as an off- on switch for the movement of the polymerase into the structural gene which follows. The function of the operator is to bind a cellular repressor protein which is synthesized in respons e to changing nutritional stimuli. Terminator regions are short nucleotide sequences which signal the termination of mRNA synthesis by the polymerase. They act as a signal for the dissociation of the polymerase from the DNA. Replication of DNA in every biological system that has been examined is initiated at a specific site or group of sites in the chromosome. Those sites have broad specificity and a DNA mol ecule without the appr opriate site will not be replicated. The sites which are critical to the init iation of replication are known as origins of replication. These regions are short nucleotide sequences which serv e as initiation sites for specific enzyme ac tion during the DNA replication process. For example, in order for mammalian DNA to replicate in bacteria, it must be associated w ith a bacteria l origin of replication and vice versa. Ribosome binding sites are short nucleotid e segments at the beginning of messenger RNA molecules which signal the attachment of ribos omes for the initiation of protein sy nthesis. Functioning in this role they are not translated into the protein or peptide being processed. The BSCC is requesting comments on these definiti ons during the period of sixty days following the date of this notice and specifically seeks comments addressing the following: 1. The suitability and applicability of these defin itions to applications involving release into the environment, contained industrial large-scal e applications, foods/food additives, drugs, medical devices, and other possible products. 2. Whether combinations of genetic material from organisms that exchange DNA by known physiological processes should be excluded from the definition of intergeneric organisms: i.e., should organisms be excluded which contain intergeneric combinations of certain specified rDNA molecules that consist enti rely of DNA segments from di fferent genera that exchange DNA by known physiological processes? As certain rDNA organisms are exempted under section III-D-4 of the NIH guidelines, the quest ion was raised whether these organisms when used in the environment should be similarly ex empted from federal product review. This exemption would not, however, exclude from review such \"natural exchangers\" that are also pathogens or plant pests. In the event that the exclusion of such different species that exchange DNA by known physiological processes is accepted as appropriate, a list of such species combinations that has been mainta ined and updated by the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities of the National Institutes of Health will be updated, in lig ht of environmental use. 3. What are the most appropriate definitions of \"release into the environment\" for macro- and microorganisms. E. International Aspects The United States seeks to promote internati onal scientific cooperati on and understanding of scientific considerations in biotechnology on a range of techni cal matters. These activities add to scientific knowledge and ultimately contribute to protection of health and the environment. The United States also seeks to reduce barriers to international trade. U.S. agencies apply the same regulation and approval procedures on dom estic and foreign biotechnological products. We are seeking recognition among nations of th e need to harmonize, to the maximum extent possible, national regulatory oversight activities concerning biotechnology. Barriers to trade in biotechnological products should be avoided as nations join toge ther in working toward this mutual goal. The U.S. agencies that have published separate policy statements as pa rt of this notice are committed to the policy described in this se ction on international harmonization and have incorporated by reference the langua ge in this International Aspects section as part of their respective agency policy statements. Organization for Economic Coope ration and Development (OECD) The approach of the comprehensive framework c ontained in this notice takes into account, inter alia, the broad goals described by an Ad Hoc Group of Government Experts convened by OECD in their recent report entitled, \"Recombinant DNA Safety Considerations, Safety Considerations for Industrial, Agricultural and Environmenta l Applications of Or ganisms Derived by Recombinant DNA Techniques,\" The United States is pleased to have had the opportunity for its experts to work with those of other governments in the preparation of this report. The report includes the following concepts: Summary of Major Points Recombinant DNA techniques have opened up new a nd promising possibilities in a wide range of applications and can be expected to bring c onsiderable benefits to mankind. They contribute in several ways to the improvement of human h ealth and the extent of this contribution is expected to increase significantly in the near future. The vast majority of industrial rDNA large-scale applications w ill use organisms of intrinsically low risk which warrant only minimal containment, Good Industrial Large-Scale Practice (GILSP). When it is necessary to use rDNA organisms of higher risk, additi onal criteria for risk assessment can be identified and furthermore, the technology of physical containment is well known to industry and has successfully been used to contain pathogenic organisms for years. Therefore, rDNA microorganisms of higher risks can also be handled safely under appropriate physical and/or biol ogical containment. Assessment of potential risks of or ganisms for environmental or agri cultural applications is less developed than the assessment of potential risks for industrial appl ications. However, the means for assessing rDNA organisms can be approached by analogy with the existing data base gained from the extensive use of traditionally modified organisms in agricultu re and the environment generally. With step-by-step assessment duri ng the research and deve lopment process, the potential risk to the environment of the appli cations of rDNA organisms should be minimized. I. General Recommendations 1. Harmonization of approaches to rDNA t echnology can be facilitated by exchanging: Principles or guidelines for national regulations; developments in risk analysis; and practical experience in risk management. Therefore, information should be shared as freely as possible. 2. There is no scientific ba sis for specific legislation fo r the implementation of rDNA technology and applications. Member countries should examine their existing oversight and review mechanisms to ensure that adequate re view and control may be applied while avoiding any undue burdens that may hamper technol ogical developments in this field. 3. Any approach to implementing guidelines should not impede future developments in rDNA technology. International harmonizat ion should recognize this need. 4. To facilitate data exchange and minimi ze trade barriers between countries, further developments such as testing methods, e quipment design, and knowledge of microbial taxonomy should be considered by both national a nd international levels. Due account should be taken of ongoing work on standards within international organizations such as: World Health Organization; Commission of the Eur opean Communities; International Standards Organization; Food and Agricultural Organization; and, Microbial St rains Data Network. 5. Special efforts should be made to improve public understanding of various aspects of rDNA technology. 6. For rDNA applications in industry, agriculture and the environment, it will be important for OECD Member countries to watch the devel opment of these techniques. For certain industrial applications and for environmental and agri cultural applications of rDNA organisms, some countries may wish to have a notification scheme. 7. Recognizing the need for innova tion, it is important to consider appropriate means to protect intellectual property and confidential ity interests while assuring safety. II. Recommendations Specific for Industry 1. The large-scale industrial application of rDNA technology s hould wherever possible utilize microorganisms that are intrinsi cally of low risk. Such micr oorganisms can be handled under conditions of Good Industrial Large-Scale Practice (GILSP). 2. If, following assessment usi ng the criteria outlined in the document, a rDNA microorganism cannot be handled merely by GILSP, measures of containment corresponding to the risk assessment should be used in addition to GILSP. 3. Further research to improve techniques for monitoring and controlling non-intentional release of rDNA organisms should be encouraged in la rge-scale industrial applications requiring physical containment. III. Recommendations Specific for Envir onmental and Agricultural Applications 1. Considerable data on the environmental and human health effects of living organisms exist and should be used to guide risk assessments. 2. It is important to evaluate rDNA modified orga nisms for potential risk, pr ior to applications in agricultural and the environment. However, the development of general international guidelines governing such applications is premat ure at this time. An independent review of potential risks should be conducte d on a case-by-case basis prior to application. Case-by-case means an individual review of a proposal against assessment criteria which are relevant to the particular proposal; this is not intended to im ply that every case will require review by a national or other authority since variou s classes of proposals may be excluded. 3. Development of organisms for agricultura l or environmental a pplications should be conducted in a stepwise fashion, moving, where appropriate, from the laboratory to the growth chamber and greenhouse, to limited fiel d testing and finally, to large-scale field testing. 4. Further research to improve the predicti on, evaluation, and monitoring of the outcome of applications of rDNA organisms should be encouraged. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration. [Docket No. 84N-0431] Statement of Policy for Regul ating Biotechnology Products ACTION: Final policy statement for regulating biotechnology products. SUMMARY: In the Federal Regi ster of December 31, 1984 (43 FR 50878), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a policy statemen t for regulating biotechnology products. The policy statement was part of a larger document th at included an index of U.S. laws related to biotechnology, a description of the policies of the major regulatory agencies that are involved in reviewing the products of biotechnology, a descri ption of a proposed scientific advisory mechanism for assessment of biotechnology issues, and an explanation of how the activities of the Federal agencies involving biotechnology will be coordinated. Of the comments FDA received on the policy statement, most favored the policy statement; some requested further clarification and guidance. The current acti on constitutes FDA's final policy statement which has been revised in response to the comments. ADDRESS: Written comments should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA- 305), Food and Drug Administration, Room 4- 62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION C ONTACT: Dr. Mary Ann Danello (HF-5), Food and Drug Administration, Room 14-90, 5600 Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301-443-4650. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FDA's policy statement of December 31, 1984 stated the FDA regulation must be based on the rational and scientific evaluation of products, and not on a priori assumptions about certain processes. Accordingly, FDA's admini strative review of products, including those that empl oy specialized biotechnological techniques, is conducted in the light of the intended use of a product on a case-by-case basis. FDA believes the agency need not establish new administrative procedures to deal with gene ric concerns about biotechnology. These views were supported by the majority of comments received in response to FDA's notice. Thirty-four comments were received, with 12 fr om manufacturers of regulated products, 16 from associations and universities, and 6 from indi viduals. A summary of the comments and the agency's response to them follow: 1. Many commenters urged the agency to publish additional \"Points to C onsider\" documents to provide further guidance for biotechnology product applicants. These commenters specifically requested guidance in the area of animal drugs (especially protein drugs) and human foods and food additives. FDA agrees that \"Points to Consider\" documents provide useful guidance, especially in areas involving new biotechnology, and will consid er developing these documents where appropriate. 2. Related comments raised questions on FDA's general requirements for approving biotechnology products that are animal drugs, human foods, or food additives. In response to these comments, FDA has amended the animal drug section (\"General Requirements for Animal Food Additives and Drug s\") to be more informative and has added a new section concerning its pol icies on human foods and food additives (see \"General Requirements for Human Foods and Foods Additives\"). 3. Many comments questioned the need for new or supplemental marketing applications for biotechnology products that are identical to products derive d from conventional technology. The agency has re-examined this issue and conti nues to believe that, as a general principle, new marketing applications will be require d for most products manufactured using new biotechnology. For example, use of recomb inant DNA (rDNA) technology has the potential to lead to new structural feat ures in the product, result in product micro-heterogeneity, or introduce new contaminants (e.g., associated with new cell subs trates), each of which may affect the safety, efficacy and stability of the product. Because of potential differences in the products resulting from use of recombinant DNA technology, the resulting products may be \"new\" products requiring separa te approval under the applicab le statutory provisions. However, each case will be examined separately to determine the appropriate information to be submitted. In some instances complete new applications may not be required. For example, the sponsor of a conventionally pr oduced animal drug produc t who manufactures an identical or virtually identic al product using biotechnology may be required to submit only a supplemental application. However, if the animal drug product manufactured using biotechnology differs significantly from the pr oduct manufactured by conve ntional processes, a complete original application would be requi red. The agency believes that each product must undergo adequate and appropr iate testing and review to ensure that it is safe and effective regardless of the technology empl oyed. Sponsors are urge d to communicate with FDA to establish the scope of information required for products of biotechnology. 4. Many comments questioned the need for th e proposed review mechanism by a Biotechnology Science Board (BSB). These comments stated th at the additional layer of review would cause delays in the product approval process. A notice published in the Federal Register of November 14, 1985 (50 FR 47174) discussed the establishment of the Biotechnology Scien ce Coordinating Committ ee (BSCC) within the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering and Technology. That notice addressed various criticisms of the BSB. FDA believes that the new BSCC will facilitate sharing of biotechnology information among agenci es and will not delay agency reviews of product applications. In view of the foregoing, FDA's final polic y statement for regulating biotechnology products reads as follows: Introduction A small but important and expanding fraction of the products the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates represents the fruits of new technological achievements. These achievements are in areas as diverse as polymer chemistry, mol ecular biology, and micro-miniaturization. It is also noteworthy that technologica l advancement in a given area ma y give rise to very diverse product classes, some or all of which may be under FDA's regulatory jurisdiction. For example, new developments in recombinant DNA research can yield products as diverse as food additives, drugs, biologics, and medical devices. Although there are no statutory provisions or re gulations that address biotechnology specifically, the laws and regulations under which the agency approves products place th e burden of proof of safety as well as effectiveness of products on the ma nufacturer. The agency possesses extensive experience with these regulatory mechanisms and applies them to the products of biotechnological processes. In this notice, FDA proposes no new procedures or requirements for regulated industry or individua ls. Rather, the administrativ e review of products using biotechnology is based on the intended use of each product on a case-by-case basis. The marketing of new drugs and biologics1 for human use, and new animal drugs, requires prior approval of an appropriate ne w drug application (NDA), biologi cal product license, or new animal drug application (NADA) . For new medical devices, in cluding diagnostic devices for human use, either a premarket approval applic ation (PMA) or reclas sification petition is required. If the device is determined to be s ubstantially equivalent to an already marketed device, a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) is required. For food products, se ction 409 of the act requi res preclearance of food additives including those prepared using bi otechnology. Section 706 of the act requires preclearance of color additives. The implementing regulations for food and color additive petitions and for affirming genera lly recognized as safe (GRAS) food substances are sufficiently comprehensive to apply to thos e involving new biotechnology. 1 FDA endorses the BSCC definitions of \"intergeneric\" (new) organi sm or \"pathogen\" found in the preamble, believing that they describe the microorganisms appr opriate for review when environmental or agri cultural applications of the microorganisms are contemplated (and see pp. 22-25). As discussed below in this notice, \"new\" drugs, biol ogics, medical devices, and food additives are defined in the statutes estab lishing FDA's jurisdiction over such products. Genetic manipulations of plants or animals ma y enter FDA's jurisdiction in other ways; for example, the introduction into a plant of a gene coding for a pe sticide or growth factor may constitute adulteration of foodstuff derived from the plant, or the use of a new microorganism found in a food such as yogurt could be considered a food additive. Such situations will be evaluated case-by-case and in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), where appropriate. The Regulatory Process Congress has provided FDA authority under the act and the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to regulate products regardless of how they are manufactured. Each request for product approval will be considered using the appropriate statutor y and regulatory criteria. The following sections summarize general requirements for various ki nds of products and a ddress specific comments concerning particular product ca tegories. Individual regula tions should be consulted for additional details. General Requirements for New Dr ugs and Biologics for Human Use A new drug is, in general terms, a drug not genera lly recognized by qualified scientific experts as safe and effective for the proposed use. New dr ugs may not be marketed unless they have been approved as safe and effective for their intended us es. Clinical investigations on human subjects by qualified experts are a prerequi site for the determination of safety and effectiveness. Sponsors of investigations of new drugs or new uses of approved drugs file a Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Drug (IND) to conduct clinical in vestigations on human subjects. The IND must contain information to de monstrate the safety of proceeding to test the drug in human subjects, including, for example, drug composition, manufacturing and controls data, results of animal testing, tr aining and experience of investig ators, and a plan for clinical investigation. In addition, assura nce of informed consent and protection of the rights and safety of human subjects is require d. FDA evaluates IND submissions and reviews ongoing clinical investigations. Significant ch anges in the conditions of th e study, including changes in study design, drug manufacture or formulation, or proposals for additional studies, must be submitted to FDA as amendments to the IND. FDA approval of an NDA or an abbreviated Ne w Drug Application (ANDA) is required before the new drug can be marketed. The NDA must contain, among other information, the following: A list of components of the drug and a statem ent of the composition of the drug product; A description of the manufacturing and packaging procedures and controls for the drug product; A description of the nonclinical studies concerning the drug' s pharmacological actions and toxicological effects; A description and analysis of each clinical study; and A description and analysis of any other data or information relevant to an evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the drug product, including commercial marketing experience. NDA holders who intend to market an approved drug under conditions other than those approved in the NDA must submit a supplemental NDA containi ng clinical evidence of the drug's safety and effectiveness for the added indications. Exte nsive changes such as a change in formula, manufacturing process, or method of testing differing from the conditions of approval outlined in the NDA may also require additional clinical testing. Biological products must also be approved by F DA prior to marketing, as required by section 351 of the PHS Act. A biological product is \"any virus, therapeutic se rum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, a llergenic product, or analogous product * * * applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of diseases or injuries of man * * *.\" Unapproved biological products are regulated under the same regulations as new drug s during the IND phase. Prior to marketing, separate licenses are issu ed for the manufacturing establishment and the biological product. The manuf acturing establishment and the biological product must meet standards (including any FDA standa rds specific for the product) designed to ensure the safety, purity, potency, and efficacy of the product. To ob tain a license, the facility must also pass a prelicensing inspection. Licensed products are subject to specific requirements for lot release of FDA. Manufacturers of new drugs and biologics must operate in conformance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations. These regulation s require adequately equipped manufacturing facilities, adequate ly trained personnel, stringent control over the manufacturing process, and appropriate finish ed product examination. CGMP's are designed to protect the integrity and purity of the product. The sponsor's process techniques are also considered in FDA's reviews and communications for the development of appropriate information on which the submission of an NDA, ANDA, or biological product license application would be based. For example, the use of recombinant DNA technology to manufacture new drugs or biologi cal products may result in products that differ from similar products manufactured with conventional methods. Determination of the extent of testing required will depend upon the na ture of the particular product. In some instances the molecular structur e of the product may differ from the structure of the active molecule in nature. For example, the fi rst human growth horm one manufactured using recombinant microorganisms has an extra amino acid, an amino-terminal methionine; hence, it is an analogue of the native hormone. Such diffe rences could affect the drug's activity or immunogenicity and, consequently, could affect the extent of testing required. Another consideration in the review of new drugs or biol ogical products produced by recombinant techniques is whether the manufactur ing process includes ade quate quality controls. For example, the occurrence of mutations in the coding sequence of the cloned gene during fermentation could give rise to a subpopulation of molecule s with an anomalous primary structure and altered activity. This is a potential problem inherent in the production of polypeptides in any fermentation process. As with conventionally produced products, assurance of adequate processing techni ques and controls is important in the manufacturing of any biotechnology-produced new drug or biological product. Review of the production of human viral vaccines routinely involves a number of considerations including the purity of the media and the serum used to grow th e cell substrate, the nature of the cell substrate, and the characterization of the virus. In the case of live viral vaccine, the final product is biologically active and is intended to replicat e in the recipient. Therefor e, the composition, concentration, subtype, immunogenicity, reactivity, and nonpathoge nicity of the vaccine preparation are all considerations in the final review, whatever the techniques employed in \"engi neering\" the virus. However, special considerations may arise based upon the specific technology employed. For example, a hepatitis B vaccine produced in yeast (via recombinant DNA techniques) would be monitored for yeast cell contaminants, while dist inctly different contaminants would be of concern in a similar vaccine produced fr om the plasma of infected patients. Nucleic acids or viruses used for human gene ther apy will be subject to the same requirements as other biological drugs. It is possible that scientific reviews of these products will also be performed by the National Institutes of Health. To provide guidance to current or prospective manufacturers of drugs and biological products, the FDA has developed a series of documents describing points that manufa cturers might wish to consider in the production and testing of pr oducts. The \"Points to Consider\" documents generated to date include se veral topics: interf eron, monoclonal antibodies, products of recombinant DNA technology, and the use of new cell substrates. These \"Points to Consider\" documents are available from the agency upon request from the Office of Biological Investigational New Drugs (301-443-4864). FDA plans to develop additional \"Points to Consider\" in areas of scientific interest to manufacturers of new drugs and biologics. General Requirements for Animal Food Additives and Drugs Animal food additives and drugs ar e subject to similar mandatory re quirements of the act as the like products for use in humans. Animal biologics, however, are licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under the au thority of the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act of 1913. Questions as to whether a product is an animal biological subject to USDA licensure, or a new animal drug to be regulated by FDA are referred to a standing committee of representatives from USDA and FDA. New animal drugs must go through the Investigational New animal Drug (INAD) and New Animal Drug Application (NADA) process, a pro cedure similar to that required for human drugs, as discussed earlier. However, INAD re gulations do not require advance agency approval for clinical investigations for the drug, although author ization is required for use of edible products derived from food-producin g animals in which the drug has been used. The data must be specific for each animal species for which th e drug is intended. For NADA approval, it must be shown that the product is safe and effectiv e when used in accordance with approved label directions. Also, it must be shown that those dr ugs which are intended for use in food-producing animals and used in accordance with approved label directions, do not accumulate as unsafe residues in the edible tissues of the animal at the time of slaughter. Mo reover, the manufacturer must submit acceptable methods for measurement of any drug residue in edible tissues. Further, animal drugs, including premixes for use in medicated feeds and medicated feeds, must be manufactured in conformance with CGMPs. Substan ces that are used in animal feeds, other than drugs, and that are produced by recombinan t DNA technology, are considered to be food additives and require approval of a separate food additive petition (FAP), even though a similar substance is currently approved as a food additive. There have been questions about the requirement of an origin al application for a biotechnology product, even when the product is identical to a currently approved animal drug held by the same applicant. FDA's Center for Veterinary Medi cine (CVM) has determined that, when the new substance produced by biotechnology is identical or virtually identical to an approved substance produced by conventional technology, only a suppleme ntal application is n ecessary. Of course, in this instance the sponsor of the biotechnol ogy product must also be the sponsor of the conventionally produced product. If, on the other hand, the new substance produced by biotechnology is significantly diffe rent from that produced by conventional means, an original application will be needed. Two examples, each involving the adoption of rDNA technology as an alternative means of producing a substance that is curr ently the subject of an approve d NADA, will illustrate. In the first example, the drug is (or appears to be) unchanged by the new production method. Under the current regulations, such a departure in manufacturing procedure requires a supplemental application which requires approval before implementation. The supplement would be a Category II supplement under CVM's supplemental po licy in that it involves a revised method of synthesis or fermentation for the new drug substa nce. However, in accordance with the CVM's supplemental policy the underlying safety and e ffectiveness data suppor ting the original NADA usually would not be reviewed (for compliance with contemporary standards) since there is likely no increased risk of human exposure to th e drug. Data may be requi red to demonstrate the new animal drug product is essentially biologic ally equivalent to th e drug product for which approval has already been granted. Approval of such a supplemental NADA is not required to be published in the Federal Register. In the second example, a new method of manu facture changes the molecular structure or chemical composition of the active ingredient. Su ch a change in the identity of the new animal drug normally will require an original new animal drug application and subsequent publication of a notice of approval in the Federal Register. Ordinarily, an origin al NADA requires complete safety and effectiveness studies, meeting contempora ry standards. However, reference to data in another NADA sometimes suffices to support a se parate NADA approval, where the existing NADA is owned by the applicant of the new NADA, or where the new applicant obtains authorization to reference might be made to data contained in the NADA supporting approval of the drug as produced by conventional means. It may be possible to regard the new application as if it were a Category II supplement. This finding would be dependent upon data showing the ne w substance to be sufficiently similar to the original in terms of its pharmacology, toxicology, bioequivalence, and metabolism. Thus, regardless of the type of application required, there is no legal requirement for the generation of new safety and effectiveness data if the applicant has access to previously submitted data, and there is no scientific need. General Requirements for Medical Devices Medical devices for human use are regulated by requirements of the act as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976. In general, a device is a health care product that does not achieve any of its principal in tended purposes by chemical acti on in or on the body or by being metabolized. Devices include diagno stic aids such as reagents, antibiotic sensitivity discs, and test kits for in vitro diagnosis of disease. The act establishes three classes of devices: Cl ass I (general controls), class II (performance standards), and class III (premarket approval). Cl assification of a device is determined by the level of regulatory control needed to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. A class I device is a device for which the \"general cont rols\" authorized by or under various sections of the act are sufficient to provide reasonabl e assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device. A class II device is a device for which general controls by themselves are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the Safety and effectiveness of the device, for which there is sufficient information to establish a performance standard to provide such assurance, and for which it is th erefore necessary to establish a performance standard to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. A class III device is a device that cannot be classified into class I or class II and that is pur ported or represented to be for use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of su bstantial importance in preventing impairment of human, health, or that presents a potential unrea sonable risk of illness or injury. Premarket approval obtained in accordance with section 51 5 of the act is required to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and eff ectiveness of a class III device. Before a manufacturer may introduce into commer ce any medical device it has not previously marketed, the manufacturer must submit to F DA a premarket notificati on. This notification requirement is designed to assure that manuf acturers do not intentiona lly or unintentionally circumvent the automatic classification into cl ass III of devices not on the market prior to enactment of the Medical Device Amendments and not substantially equivalent to pre amendment devices. A new device, that, is one not substantially equi valent to a previous device, remains a class III device requiring FDA approval of a premarke t approval application (PMA) unless FDA reclassifies it into class I or class II, usually in response to a manufacturer's petition. In the premarket approval process the manufacturer must establish by valid scientific evidence that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This evidence usually is data from clinical investigations. For a significant risk device, as defined in FDA's regulations, the sponsor must submit an application to FDA for approval to conduct a clini cal investigation. This application seeks an Investigational Device Exemption. When the manufacturer believes that there are sufficient data to establish the safety and effectiveness of its device, the manufacturer files a PMA. General Requirements for Foods several sections of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act apply to the Agency's regulation of food. No particular statutory provision or regulation deals expre ssly with food produced by new biotechnology. Accordingly, when confronted by an issue concerning the regulation of food produced by new biotechnology, the Agency will apply the releva nt statutory or regulatory provisions. Most issues concerning the safety of a food will involve the application of either section 402(a)(1) or section 409 of the Act. Section 402(a)(1) of the Act provides, in part, that a food is adu lterated if it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious \"added subs tance\" which may render it injuri ous to health.\" Courts have agreed with the agency's interpretation of this se ction that any substance th at is not an inherent constituent of food may be regulated as an \"added substance.\" See, for example, United States v. Cartons of Swordfish, 395 F. Supp. 1194 (S.D.N.Y. 1975). Furthermore, if the quantity of the constituent exceeds the amount that would normally be present because of some technological adjustment to the product, that excess quantity may also be viewed as \"added substance\" within the meaning of the section. See United States v. Anderson Sea Foods, Inc., 622 F.2d 157 (5th cir. 1980). Thus, section 401(a)(1) applies to most of the harmful substances that may occur in human food. For example, is a food produced by new biotechnology contains a higher level of a substance than it might ordinarily have, then that level \"may be injurious to health\" and the agency could regulate the product under section 4 02(a)(1). Similarly, if a food produced by new biotechnology contains, as a result of the production process, a harm ful or deleterious substances not contained ordinarily in the food, the f ood could be in violation of the section. The other primary statutory provisions that FDA relies upon in determini ng the safety of food and food constituents are sections 201(s) and 409, the food additive provisions of the Act. The definition of food additive appears in section 201( s) of the Act and includes both artificial and natural substances. The definition provides that: the term food additive means any substance the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of any food (including any substance intended for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, proces sing, preparing, treating, packag ing, transporting, or holding food; and including any source of ra diation intended for any such us e), if such substance is not generally recognized as sa fe by qualified experts. If the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for a given food us e, the product is not a food additive. Comments questioned whether a substance (inclu ding microbes) that is GRAS could lose its GRAS status solely because it was produced or modified by new biotechnology. The answer is yes, if the substance (and its contaminants) has been altered in such a way that it can no longer be generally recognized by qualified experts to be safe. In this instance, the substance would be a food additive and the provisions of section 409 would apply. Section 409 provides that in order to be lawfully used in food, a food add itive must be the subject of an approved food additive regulation, published upon approval of a food additive petition. The FDA may not approve a food additive regulation until certain basic evidentiary criteria are met. Most important of these is that the additive must be shown to be safe under the conditions that it will be used. This requires a demonstration to a reasonable certainty that the additive will not adversely affect the health of consumers. FDA anticipates that the techniques of new biotechnology used in producing food will, for the most part, involve rDNA and microbi al isolation. The agency app lies certain general principles that it will follow in determining the safe ty of foods produced by such techniques. When determining the safety of food produced by rDNA techniques, the agency takes into consideration, but is not restricted to, whether: 1. The cloned DNA as well as the v ector used are properly identified; 2. The details of the construction of the production organism are available; 3. There is information documenting that the inserted DNA is well-characterized2 and free from sequences that code for harmful products; and 4. The food produced is purified, characterized, and standardized. 2 As defined by the BSCC definitions in the preamble, \"well-characterized\" means that the producer can document the exact nucleotide sequence of the insert and any flanking nucleotides. When determining the safety of food produced by microbial isolation, the agency will take into consideration, but is not restricted to, whether: 1. The microbial isolate used fo r production is identifie d taxonomically, and if the strain of the isolate has been genetically manipulated, whethe r each strain contributing genetic information to the production strain is identified; 2. The cultural purity and genetic stability of isolate has been maintained; 3. Fermentation has been performed with a pure culture and monitored for purity; 4. The microbial isolate used for production also produces anti biotics or toxins; 5. The isolates are pathogenic3; and 6. Viable cells of the production stra in are present in the final product. 3 A pathogen is a virus or microorganism (including its viruses an d plasmids, if any) that has th e ability to cause disease in o ther living organisms (i.e., humans, an imals, plants, microorganisms). A microorganism will be included within this definition if: a. The microorganism belongs to a pathog enic species, according to sources identified by the agency, or from information known to the producer that the organism is a pathogen; exce pted are organisms belonging to a strain used for laboratory research or commercial purposes and gene rally recognized as nonpathogenic accordi ng to sources identified by a federal agency, or information known to the producer and the appropria te federal agency; an example of a nonpathogenic strain of species which contains a pathogenic stra in is Escherichia coli K-12; examples of nonpathogenic species are Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Saccharomyces species; or b. The microorganism has been derived fro m a pathogen or has been deliberately engi neered such that it contains genetic material from a pathogenic organism as de fined in item a above. Excepted are gene tically engineered organisms developed by transferring a well-characterized, non-coding regulatory region from a pathogenic donor to a nonpathogenic recipient. \"Well-characterized, non-coding regulatory region\" means that the producer of the microorganism can document the following: a. The exact nucleotide base sequence of the regula tory region and any inserted flanking nucleotides; b. The regulatory region and any inserted flanking nucleotides do not code independently for protein, peptide, or functional RNA molecules; and, c. The regulatory region solely controls the activity of other sequences that code for protein or peptide molecules or act as recognition sites for the initiation of nucleic acid or protein synthesis. This definition excludes organisms such as competitors or colonizers of the same substrat es, commensal or mutualistic microorganisms, or opportunistic pathogens. As a general rule, the extent of testing required on a food product produced by biotechnology will depend upon many factors, including the novelty of the substances used to produce the food (e.g., whether a substance is an \"intergeneric\" organism, as defined by the BSCC definitions in the preamble), the purity of the resulting product, and the estimated consumption of the product. The agency will require that the final product intended for commerciali zation be the article tested.

Obligations Under the National Environmental Policy Act All premarketing approvals of FDA-regulated pro ducts are subject to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality's regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) and as further described by FDA's NEPA-implementing procedures (21 CFR Part 25, fi nal rule published April 26, 1985; 50 FR 16636). For new products or major new uses for existing products, these procedures ordinarily require the preparation of an environmental assessment. An environmental impact statement is required if the manufacture, use, or disposal of th e product is anticipated to cause significant environmental impacts. International Aspects FDA is committed to the policy described in the s ection entitled \"Interna tional Aspects\" in the Office of Science and Technology Policy Genera l Preamble, published in today's Federal Register.

During the last decade, advanc es in the biological scie nces have increased the ability of humans to change or combine the inhe rited characteristics of microorganisms, plants, and animals. These advances, along with more traditional genetic engi neering and biological techniques, are expected to l ead to a wide variety of us eful products. Among these are microorganisms that will be used to degrade toxic pollutants, leach minerals, enhance oil recovery, produce industrial chemical s, and act as pesticides. As with chemicals used for the same types of purposes, many of these microorga nisms will be reviewed by EPA for potential health and environmental risks. Specifically, EPA reviews and may register pes ticide products under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), and review s chemical substances (except those used as pesticides, foods, food additives, cosmetics, drugs, and medical devices) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). EPA's Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances (OPTS) is responsible for implementing both FIFRA and TSCA. This notice describes how EPA pl ans to address microbial products that are subject to FIFRA and TSCA, and explains the scope of coverage and procedures for review of these products under both statutes. The following questions are addressed in this notice: 1. What microbial products are subject to revi ew under FIFRA and how will they be reviewed? (Unit II) 2. What microbial products are subject to revi ew under TSCA and how will they be reviewed? (Unit III) 3. What definitions will be used to identify the products that will be addressed by the appropriate statute? (Unit IV) In reviewing products, the Agency is required under both FIFRA and TSCA to consider the potential benefits to society as well as any poten tial risks. EPA will take both risks and benefits into account in its regulatory decisions concerning these products, and will implement the two statutes in as consistent a fashion as possible within statutory constraints. B. Background 1. December 1984 proposal. EPA issued for comment a \"Proposed Policy Regarding Certain Microbial Products\" as part of the Office of Science and Technology Policy's \"Proposal for a Coordinated Framework for Re gulation of Biotechnology.\" This proposal was published in the Federal Register of December 31, 1984 (49 FR 50880) and is hereafter referred to as the \"December 84 notice.\" Briefly, in the Decembe r 84 notice EPA proposed a mechanism for review of genetically engineered and nonindigenous microbial pesticides under FIFRA. It also described how EPA proposed to address ce rtain genetically engi neered microorganisms subject to the new chemical substance prem anufacture notification (PMN) provisions of section 5 of TSCA. 2. Comments on the December 84 notice. EPA r eceived comments on the December 84 notice from 68 organizations and individuals. All the comments received by EPA are available for review and copying from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. M onday through Friday, excep t legal holidays, in the TSCA Public Information Office, Rm. E-107, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. The Agency has carefully evaluated these commen ts. Several of the proposed policies set forth in the December 84 notice have been revised or clarified in this noti ce in response to these comments and as a result of the regulatory e xperience EPA has gained over the past year. One of the most frequent comments addressed EPA's authority under TSCA and FIFRA. The Agency has continued to evaluate the extent and limit of its statutory authority and has concluded that TSCA and FIFRA provide sufficient authority for the Agency to meet its goals and responsibilities in regulating biotechnology products. However, some new regulations will be required and others will have to be modified in order to fully implement certain aspects of EPA's policies. These regulations and modificati ons are discussed in Units II and III of this notice. Numerous commenters addressed the scope of EPA's policy and raised questions about which microbial products are subject to TSCA and FI FRA. In Units II.B, and III.B, the Agency provides detailed explanations of which microor ganisms are and are not subject to FIFRA and TSCA, and from among the products that are subj ect, which are subject to regulatory review prior to any environmental application. Many commenters expressed concer n that the Agency was relating a microorganism's potential for risk to the process by which it was made , particularly in th e definition of which microorganisms are \"new\" and therefore subjec t to PMN under TSCA. First, commenters suggested that the process by which an organism wa s modified was too indire ct as an indicator of its newness. They pointed out that while certain processes can be used to produce new combinations of traits in microorganisms, their use does not necessarily mean that new combinations of traits have been formed. Sec ond, the process-based appro ach was believed to be an insufficient indicator of risk, because gene tic engineering processes do not necessarily produce organisms that present risks, nor are non-engineered organism s necessarily safe. Finally, because the process-based approach woul d single out certain tec hniques for regulation, it would result in market distortions that favored the more traditional techniques even though the newer techniques could be as safe or safer. After reviewing the comments, the Agency consid ered a number of alternatives to the \"process- based\" approach. In choosing among these alte rnatives, EPA carefully considered how well the options approximated risk (there was uncertainty with all the options in this respect), whether they could be implemented and enforced through cr iteria that were unamb iguous to all affected persons, and (in the case of orga nisms subject to TSCA) the TS CA mandate to review \"new\" substances. The alternative EPA has chosen gi ves particular attenti on, under both FIFRA and TSCA, to microorganisms that (1) are used in the environment, (2) ar e pathogenic or contain genetic material from pathogens, or (3) contain new combinations of traits (e.g., organisms that are genetically modified to contain genetic ma terial from dissimilar source organisms and organisms that are nonindigenous). EPA belie ves these categories have sufficiently high potential for widespread exposure, adverse effects, or uncertainty concerning potential effects to deserve particular regulatory sc rutiny. This approach takes a significant step towards separating products on the basis of potential risk. The Agency also received comments on the information and data to be submitted by companies filing notifications of in tent to conduct field tests with cer tain microbial pesticides. These requirements have been clarified and additional references have been cited in the FIFRA unit of this notice that should provide us eful guidance on what information to submit. The TSCA unit contains similar guidance on the submission of information. Finally, several commenters addressed issues pertaining to confidentia l business information (CBI). Some expressed concern that CBI be ade quately protected from disclosure, while others stressed the need for public access to info rmation on new biotechnology products. EPA has summarized its position with respect to CBI and public disclosure later in this overview (Unit I.G). A background document providing mo re detail on the Agency's response to comments on the December 84 notice has been placed in the public record for this notice and is available in the TSCA Public Information Office (address listed in Unit VI of this notice). C. Summary of EPA Policy This notice focuses on oversight and review proc edures for microorganisms that are subject to FIFRA or TSCA. Microorganisms intended for us e as pesticides are subject to FIFRA, and many microorganisms intended for general comm ercial and environmental applications (e.g., metal leaching, pollutant degradation, enhanced n itrogen fixation) are subject to TSCA. This notice addresses the rationale fo r various requirements and provi des guidelines for compliance. Specifically, EPA's policies that apply to mi crobial products subject to FIFRA or TSCA jurisdiction will include the following specific requirements: 1. Microorganisms deliberately formed to contain genetic material from dissimilar source organisms (inter-generic) will be subject to review before any environmental releases, including small-scale field tes ting and other environmental research and development (R&D). Under the statute, those that are subject to TSCA and used in closed systems (i.e., never intentionally released to the environment) must be reported before they are manufactured for non-R&D commercial purposes. Ho wever, EPA is considering pr omulgating a rule to exempt certain contained uses from this requirement. 2. Microorganisms formed by genetic engineering other than inter-generic combinations will be subject to the following provision s: (a) if any source organism is a pathogen, the resulting microbial products are subject to review under FIFRA or TSCA prior to any environmental release, except if used solely for non-pesticidal agricultural uses, in which case they are subject only to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) review (see the USDA notice in this Federal Register) (b) if source organisms are not pathogens, th e resulting microbial products are subject to abbreviated review under FIFRA (if they are pesticides) before any small-scale environmental release, or will be subject to the reporting requirements of sections 8 (a) and (e) of TSCA. 3. Nonengineered microorganisms: (a) indigeno us pathogens will be reviewed under FIFRA or TSCA prior to use on greater than 10 acres of land and greater than 1 acre of water, except those that are solely for non-pesticidal agricu ltural purposes, which will be subject only to USDA authority; (b) nonindigenous pathogens will be reviewed under FIFRA prior to any environmental release, and under TSCA prior to release at greater than 10 acres, unless they are pathogens used solely for non-pesticidal agricultural purpos es in which case they will be reviewed by USDA (see USDA no tice in this Federal Register ); (c) nonindigenous microbial pesticides that are not pathoge ns will be subject to abbrevia ted review under FIFRA before any small scale environmental release; (d) in digenous microbial pesticides that are not pathogens will be reviewed under FIFRA pr ior to use on greater than 10 acres. 4. All other microorganisms used or intended for us e as pesticides and not covered in Unit I.C. 1 through 3, regardless of source, mode of action, or method of manufactur e will be reviewed under FIFRA prior to use on greater than 10 acres unless exem pted by regulation. 5. Manufacturers and importers of microorgani sms under TSCA, if they are not otherwise subject to review, will be required to subm it general information, before environmental release, that the Agency can use to monitor e nvironmental uses and to determine if additional requirements are necessary in the future. EPA will gather such information by means of a TSCA section 8(a) reporting rule. 6. Manufacturers and importers of all microorganisms subject to TS CA must report any information on substantial risks under TSCA section 8(e). Registrants of microbial pesticides must report any information rega rding unreasonable adverse effects of the pesticide on the environment under FIFRA section 6(a)(2). A table at the end of Unit I summarizes the policies for prior notific ation and review of microorganisms applied in the environment. This policy is immediately effective for micr obial pesticides under FIFRA and for \"new\" microorganisms subject to premanufacture no tification under TSCA. Implementing other aspects of the policy for TSCA substances, howev er, will require rulemaking. Until final rules are effective, EPA expects manufacturers to comply with most aspects of the policy voluntarily. The one exception is that manufacturers of microorganisms, described in Unit I.C.5, that are excluded from other TSCA notification requiremen ts are not expected to report until a final section 8(a) rule is promulgated. This notice also describes the types of information EPA expects to receive from persons subject to these policies to permit an evaluation of possible risks. EPA will determine specific information needs on a case-by-case basis, and will frequently use non-Agency experts with specific knowledge of the relevant microorganisms and uses to assist in reviews. In addition, EPA is establishing a biotechnol ogy Science Advisory Committee (S AC) to provide peer review of specific cases and advice on technical issues . The SAC will be composed of non-Agency scientists and members of the lay public. Mo re information on the SAC may be found in Unit I.F. Although many of the policies described in this notice are immediately effective, the Agency recognizes that biotechnology is a rapidly develo ping field and that newl y available information may affect the judgments underlying these po licies. Accordingly, EPA recognizes that modifications of these policies may be necessary in the future, and it is willing to make such modifications as may be appropriate. Therefor e, EPA encourages all interested persons to provide comments on the policies described in this notice. Comments should be submitted to the address provided at the beginning of this EPA notice. The public will have additional opportunities for comment when the Agency proposes rules for those parts of its policy that require rulemaking procedures. These parts ar e specifically indicated in Units II and III. D. Rationale for Approach This unit provides a discussion of EPA's rationale for giving special focus to environmental release, pathogens, and microorganisms with new character istics (e.g., containing genetic material from dissimilar source or ganisms or nonindigenous organisms). 1. Environmental releases. Physical containment can be used to mitigate undesirable or unexpected characteristics of a microorga nism by providing the means to control a microorganism's growth, reproduction, and e xposure to other organisms. However, microorganisms meant to be released in the environment are not subject to this control mechanism. Although many microorganisms will be biologically contained, that is, they will have existing and inherent limitations on thei r growth and survival, some of them may reproduce and thereby increase in number in the environment beyond the amounts originally released. Some will also have independent m obility, or may be spread beyond the area in which they are used. Thus, to ensure that environmental releases of microorganisms do not pose unreasonable adverse effects, the Agency has determined that it should review and evaluate proposals for certain e nvironmental releases before they are allowed to proceed. The microorganisms to be subject to review before any environmental release are described in the following paragraphs, and in Units II and III of this notice. The Agency acknowledges the difficulty of defining environmental release. For now, the Agency's approach will focus on when an organism is considered to be contained rather than when it is released. Guidance is provided in Unit IV on how to determine whether a microorganism is considered to be contained. The definition of environmental release will be refined in subsequent rulemaking activities. 2. Pathogenic microorganisms. Given their ability to cause disease in plants, animals, humans, and microbes, EPA generally believes pathogeni c microorganisms should be reviewed before they are released in the environment. As used in this notice, a \"pathogen\" is a microor ganism that has the ability to cause disease in living organisms. This includes previous ly documented pathogens, and microorganisms deliberately formed to contain genetic ma terial from pathogens (e.g., through genetic engineering techniques). A complete discussion of the defi nition of pathogenicity is included in Unit IV, as well as guidance to aid in the determination of whether a particular microorganism falls within the scope of the EPA policies that address pathogens. Pathogens are a clearly defined category of organisms known to cause adverse effects. In addition, because of the increased uncertainty about behavioral changes that may be associated with genetically engineered pa thogens, the Agency has decided to review genetically engineered pathogens prior to a ny environmental release (including small-scale field testing). However, the Agency will defe r review of nonengineered indigenous pathogens until they are used in larger scale applicati ons (greater than 10 acres), because ample experience indicates that nonengineered, indigen ous pathogens are sufficiently well controlled by natural mechanisms in small-scale environmental applications. Further, the Agency will not review pathogens used solely for non-pest icidal agricultural purposes (except those formed through inter-generic combinations, whic h are \"new\") because these are adequately reviewed by the USDA (see the USDA no tice in this Federal Register). The Agency's decision to focus on pathogens does not mean that EPA has concluded that nonpathogens are necessarily safe or that all pat hogens present unreasonable risks. In fact, the Agency expects to identify widely varying degr ees of risk among different uses of pathogens. It should be clear that other c onsiderations besides pathogenicity will affect the evaluation of risk, e.g., functions of the recombined genes, pos sibilities for genetic transfer, environmental fate, and potential competition with other organisms. When othe r considerations indicate that it is appropriate, the Agency will consider ex cluding specific categories of pathogens from review, or may provide guidance that would lim it the information requirements associated with its reviews of pathogens. As explained in Unit IV, the Agency has already exempted from review as pathogens organisms that inco rporate only certain ge netic material from pathogens. 3. Microorganisms with new char acteristics. A third factor that makes potential adverse effects of microorganisms less predictable is the existence of new traits or characteristics. These traits may be new to the organism, or new to the environment in which the organism is released. a. Microorganisms having significant poten tial to exhibit new tr aits. Modern genetic engineering techniques permit genetic material to be intentionally combined in organisms that would not normally share that genetic mate rial. Some of these genetically engineered microorganisms may exhibit new or altered traits affecting, for example, their survivability, host range, substrate utilization, competiti on with other organisms, or protein or polysaccharide production. In some cases such microorganisms may be able to evade or overcome natural controls on their growth, or controls on their ability to cause adverse effects. In many other cases, thei r natural hardiness will be reduced. In addition to the possibility that certain engi neered organisms may exhibit new traits, if they are released they may be transported through natural dispersal mechanisms to other areas in the environment that have not prev iously contained orga nisms having these new combinations of traits. Because of these considerations, EPA's policies will give particular regulatory attention to organisms that have a significant probability of exhibiting a new trai t or combination of traits (standards for this are explained belo w). This approach accomplishes two important objectives. First, it identifies a group of microorganisms whose behavior in the environment poses significant uncertainty and thus warrants regulatory review. Simultaneously, it provides a way of defining \"new\" microorganisms th at are subject to PMN requirements under TSCA (see Unit III.C.1). EPA's policy, specifically, focuses on microorgani sms that have been deliberately altered to contain genetic material from dissimilar source organisms, because such organisms are more likely to exhibit new combinations of traits and their behavi or is therefore less predictable. Given this con ceptual basis, the question th en becomes how dissimilar two organisms must be before combinations of genetic material between them are likely to produce \"new combinations of traits.\" Based on the following considerat ions, EPA has decided that inter-generic combinations (combinations from source organisms of different genera) but not intra-generic combinations (source organisms from the same genus) are sufficiently likely to result in new combinations of traits that they should be given special at tention. First, combinations of genetic material from microorganisms from di fferent genera are more likely to result in new traits than combinations of genes from microorganisms within the same genus. Also, while genetic exchange occurs natura lly and somewhat commonly among many microorganisms, it is more likely to occur in nature within a single genus than across many different genera (Refs. 2, 12, 13) . Finally, genus designations provide a practical criterion for administrative and regulatory purposes. The Agency has decided to exclude certain co mbinations from special consideration as inter-generic organisms. Excluded are inter-g eneric combinations in which the genetic material added to the recipient microorganism consists only of well-characterized, non- coding regulatory regions. The resulting organisms do not possess new combinations of traits; rather, they exhibit quantitative cha nges in preexisting trai ts. In addition, if experience or data indicate that certain other inter-generic co mbinations warrant exclusion, the Agency will use the appropriate statut ory or policy mechanisms under FIFRA and TSCA to waive certain requirements for review ing them. For example, EPA is considering exempting from PMN review under TSCA those inter-generic combinations used only in physically contained systems. Although EPA considers intra-generic combinations to be less likely to produce new combinations of traits than inter-generic combinations, the Agency realizes that science provides no absolute standard for such dist inctions. Nevertheless, EPA believes the approach it has adopted is practical and facilitates the iden tification of those microorganisms that should be subject to sp ecial attention and al so that should be considered \"new\" under TSCA. If experience reveals that intr a-generic combinations that could cause adverse effects will be devel oped, the Agency will modify its policies to require review of these products. Unit IV contains more detailed guidance for determining if a given microorganism is the result of an inter-generic combination. The determinations are based on taxonomic designations of organisms. The Agency is aware that microbial taxonomy is a dynamic and often controversial scien ce (Refs. 4, 18) and that new information concerning microorganisms' properties and interrelati onships will alter taxonomic designations. However, the Agency believes that its pro cedures can be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the developments that will occur, and that there are many significant advantages to using taxonomic standards. Thes e advantages are discusse d in more detail in Unit IV. b. Nonindigenous microorganisms. Another categor y of organisms that ar e likely to exhibit traits new to an environment is nonindige nous microorganisms. Applications of nonindigenous microorganisms in the environmen t could pose a high degree of uncertainty with respect to their behavior. Experience s hows that scientists cannot always accurately predict how such organisms will behave in thei r new environment (Ref. 15, 16). It can be difficult to predict whether a nonindigenous mi croorganism will be subject to the physical and biological control factors pr esent in the environment where it is to be introduced. In a small number of cases, nonindigenous pathogens such as the chestnut blight fungus and the Dutch elm disease fungus have caused significant adverse effects. As a result, there exist today regulations that govern the intentional movement of some, but not all, nonindigenous species (e.g., the Plant Pest Act administered by USDA). EPA belie ves that nonindigenous microorganisms whose uses are covered by FIFR A should be subject to Agency review and evaluation before they are released in the e nvironment, to minimize the uncertainties with respect to their behavior. However, EPA doe s recognize that small-scale use of certain nonindigenous microbial pesticides (i.e., pathogens) may pose greater potential risk than others, and has accordingly adopted abbreviated review procedures for small-scale use of nonpathogenic nonindigenous microbial pesticides. Unit II addr esses these issues, and Unit IV provides guidance on determining whether a microorganism is nonindigenous. E. Explanation of Jurisdiction\u2014 EPA and USDA Both EPA and USDA seek to assure the safe ty of microbial products and yet minimize impediments to intellectual and economic adva nces in biotechnology. Because some of the statutes the agencies administer entail overl apping responsibilities, the two agencies are eliminating duplicative requirements wherever possible and coordinating their reviews. Where allowed by statute, EPA and USDA ha ve sought to eliminate overlapping reviews altogether. This notice reflects many instances where this has been done. Where overlaps could not be avoided, the agencies have established me chanisms for coordinating their reviews. EPA and USDA will identify principal lia isons who will have the responsibility to share information, coordinate data requests, and keep one another informed of communications with submitters. Also, the agencies will form a coordinating comm ittee to meet periodically and work out general coordination problems that may transcend specific reviews. Finally, the National Biological Impact Assessment Program that has been es tablished within USDA will provide a common resource of scientists available to both agencies to review procedures, pr otocols, and projects on an advisory basis. Submitters are encouraged to contact either agen cy if they have jurisdictional questions, but general guidelines are described below. First, inter-generic microorganisms containing genetic material from a pathogenic source organism must be reported to both agencies (definitions of \"inter-gener ic\" and \"pathogen\" may be found in Unit IV). In this case, statutor y constraints make it necessary for both EPA and USDA to review the products be cause the microbes are potential \"pests\" subject to the Plant Pest Act, and they are \"new\" and ther efore subject to TSCA premanuf acture notification (or they are pesticides and subject to FIFRA notification). However, the agency reviews have somewhat different purposes, in that the EPA review is for a general use of an organism under TSCA or for use as a pesticide under FIFRA, while the USDA re view is for a specific permit application. The agencies will coordinate thes e reviews as explained earlier. Second, persons developing inter-generic organism s that contain no genetic material from a pathogen and that do not meet the USDA definition of a \"plant pest\" will be expected to report only to EPA; they will not report to USDA at al l. EPA will inform USDA and the submitter if any data suggest that the organism has pest qua lities which may require a permit from USDA. This avoids unnecessary duplicati on of effort and is consistent with the non- discretionary responsibility under TSCA to re view new organisms and under FI FRA to review pesticides. Third, in the case of intra-generic engineered or ganisms that contain genetic material from a pathogen, the use of the organism will determine wh ich agency reviews it. When used solely for non-pesticidal agricultural purposes, such organisms must be reported only to USDA under the Plant Pest Act. When used for non-agricultural purposes, such organisms should be reported to EPA, either voluntarily under the TSCA section 5( a)(2) rule EPA will be developing or, if the organism is a pesticide, under FIFRA. In both cases, the microorganisms should also be reported to USDA as potential plant or animal pathogens . When such dual reporting is necessary, the agencies will assist the submitter by coordi nating through the mechanisms described above. In the case of intra-generic microbes contai ning no genetic material from pathogens and nonengineered microorganisms, EPA will gather general information under section 8(a) of TSCA and conduct abbreviated reviews under FIFRA (see Units II and III of the EPA notice). Both agencies agree that members of this catego ry of microbes, in gene ral, present the lowest risk and therefore do not need a high level of scrutiny be fore any release into the environment. However, the FIFRA abbreviated reviews and the TSCA section 8(a) reporting will ensure that both agencies are aware of envir onmental releases of these orga nisms and can take appropriate action when necessary. F. EPA Biotechnology Science Advisory Committee EPA is establishing a Science Advisory Comm ittee for biotechnology. The formation of this committee is consistent with intentions stated in two Federal Register notices issued by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (49 FR 50904, December 31, 1984 and 50 FR 47174, November 14, 1985). The committee's primary functi ons will be to provide peer review of specific product submissions under TSCA, FIFRA, and other EPA statutes and scientific oversight of the Agency's biotechnology programs. The committee will consist of independent scientis ts and members of the lay public. It will be of sufficient size and diversity to provide the range of expertise required to a ssess the scientific and technical issues pertinent to its responsibilities. The comm ittee will be supplemented by consultants when they are needed to extend the range of expertise of the standing committee, and will be authorized to form subcommittees or pane ls for any purpose consistent with its charter. Scientific members of the committee will be selected on the basis of their professional qualifications to examine the questions of hazard, exposure, and risk to humans, other non-target organisms, and ecosystems. Some committee me mbers will serve as liaisons (holding joint membership) with the FIFRA Scientific Advi sory Panel (SAP) and with the EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB). The SAC will also incl ude nonvoting representatives from other Federal agencies that are involved in re gulating products of biotechnology. The Agency intends for meetings of the SAC to be open to the public. Meetings may be closed by the Chairperson when necessary, such as durin g discussion of issues subject to statutory confidentiality requirements, but EPA will encour age open public discussion of issues to the greatest extent possible (see unit I.G). G. Confidential Business Information Both FIFRA and TSCA generally prohibit the Agency from re leasing certain confidential business information (CBI). These prohibi tions apply to information on products of biotechnology, and the Agency w ill meet its obligations to protect information claimed confidential by applicants and othe r data submitters. However, th e Agency also recognizes that there is strong public interest in many aspects of biotechnology, part icularly in the possibility of adverse effects resulting from th e environmental release of genetic ally engineered organisms. Accordingly, if is the Agency's policy to carry ou t as much of its review as possible in the open, in order to provide an opportunity for public pa rticipation and to increase public confidence in the review process. The Agency is encouraged by the extent to which industry and other submitters have been willing to authorize the rele ase of relevant information to date and urge future data submitters to limit conf identiality claims as much as possible in order to foster an open review process. H. International Aspects EPA is committed to the policy described in the section entitled \"Interna tional Aspects\" in the Office of Science and Technology Policy Preambl e, published in this Federal Register.

Applicability of Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to Microbial Products A. Background Biological agents, including microor ganisms, may be used as pesticides, and as such they are subject to regulation under FIFRA unless sp ecifically exempted by regulation. FIFRA establishes EPA's authority over the distribution, sale, and use of pesticide products. Before EPA can register a pesticide, it must have suffi cient data to determine that the product, when used in accordance with widespread and commo nly recognized practice, will not cause (or significantly increase the risk of ) unreasonable adverse effects to humans or the environment. In recent years, the Agency has put in place policie s, procedures, and regulations to address the human health and environmental concerns raised by the application of biological pesticides (including genetically engineered and nonindigenous microbial products) in the environment. This unit outlines EPA's regulatory mechanism for these products and updates its policy on small-scale field testing of microbial pesticides. Regulations promulgated under FIFRA and a ppearing at 40 CFR 162.5(c)(4) specify that microorganisms, when used as pesticides, are regu lated under FIFRA. The specific kinds of data and information that are required to support th e registration of each microbial pesticide under FIFRA are detailed in 40 CFR 158.65, 158.170, and 162.163. The Agency has also published guidance for developing these data in the Pe sticide Assessment Guidelines: Subdivision M -- Biorational Pesticides (Ref. 20). The Agency must conduct a complete evaluation a nd review of the data submitted to support any pesticide registration before de termining whether the pesticide should be registered. This evaluation is conducted with respect to the gene ral criteria set forth in 40 CFR 162.7(d) and (e) and 162.167. Prior to registration, producers may test their pesticide products under an experimental use permit (EUP), issued pursuan t to section 5 of FIFRA and 40 CFR Part 172. The data and information needed to support the i ssuance of an EUP for microbial pesticides are specified at 40 CFR 158.170. The regulations governing EUPs include a generally applicable presumption that EUPs will not be required for certain small-scale experimental uses of new pesticid es (or new uses of previously registered pesticides). Recently, how ever, the Agency issued a statement of interim policy on small-scale field testing of nonindigenous and genetically altered microbial pesticides, published in the Federal Register of Oc tober 17, 1984 (49 FR 40659); see also 49 FR 50882, December 31, 1984. Briefly, the policy statement announced that the small-scale field test provision of 40 CFR 172.3 would not automatically apply to, and that the Agency should be notified before the initiation of , any field testing of genetically altered or nonindigenous microbial pesticides to determine if EUPs are required. This policy is being revised by this notice and is discussed in detail in Unit II.D. B. Scope of FIFRA 1. Pesticides addressed by this notice. All pesticid es whose active ingred ient(s) consist of microorganism(s) (i.e., all microbial pesticides ) are addressed by this notice. Microbial pesticides may include bacteria and blue-green al gae, fungi, viruses, and protozoa used as pest control agents. 2. Pesticides not addressed by this notice. The Ag ency has determined that certain nonmicrobial organisms which fall within the definition of bi ological control agents are already addressed by other agencies, specifically USDA and the Depa rtment of the Interior. Examples of these biological control agents are ve rtebrates, insect predators, nematodes, and macroscopic parasites. Therefore, pursua nt to section 25(b) of FIFR A and 40 CFR 162.5(c)(4), these nonmicrobial biological control agents have been exempt ed from regulation under FIFRA. However, if EPA, in cooperation with other agencies, determines that certain biological control agents exempted by \u00a7 162.5(c)(4) are not being adequate ly regulated, these organisms will be referred to the attention of the appropr iate agency or added to the exceptions in \u00a7 162.5(c)(4) by amendment. In th e latter case, those organisms would no longer be considered exempt from the provisions of FIFRA. This unit of the notice does not address any chemical pesticide product or byproduct produced by microorganisms. Such chemicals are c overed under current pe sticide regulations, registration procedures, data requirements, and testing guidelines (see 40 CFR Parts 158 through 180; and Subdivisions D through O of the Pesticide Assessment Guidelines). 3. Information-gathering policy. In order to expand its level of knowledge and expertise, monitor the industry, and determine whether its current policy needs modification, the Agency needs as complete a data base as possible. Accordingly, those deve loping microbial products intended for use as pesticides th at are not otherwise subject of FIFRA review are encouraged to keep the Agency apprised of their activities. In addition, regi strants of microbial pesticides are reminded that, pursuant to FIFRA section 6(a)(2), they must report any information regarding unreasonable adverse effects of the pesticide on the environment. C. Microbial Pesticides \u2014History a nd Long-Term Regulatory Strategy 1. History. Microbial pesticides have been in use for many years. In 1948, the Federal Government registered the first such product, Bacillus popilliae, to control Japanese beetle larvae in turf. However, it was not until th e late 1960s and early 1970s that interest in microbial pesticides began to increase. At that time, EPA began to develop policies and procedures to specifically address microbial pesticide products. In 1983, EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs issued testing guidelines for microbial pesticides (Ref . 20). A year later, EPA issued a final regulation (40 CFR Part 158) specifying the data requirements for pesticide registration (i ncluding genetically engineered microbial pesticides). As of 1985, there were 14 microbial pesticides used in se veral hundred separate produc ts registered for use in agriculture, forestry, mosquito control, and homes. As indicated in Unit II.A above, EPA issued an interim policy on small- scale field testing of genetically altered and nonindi genous microbial pesticides in October 1984 (49 FR 40659). To date, under this policy, EPA has received and reviewed five notifications for genetically engineered microbial pesticides and two notifications for nonindi genous microbial pesticides. Three EUP applications, required in part to address unresolved i ssues identified in the review of these notifications, have since been receiv ed. These applications were for genetically engineered microbial pesticides. 2. Long-term regulatory strategy. Although EPA ha s an established regulatory mechanism for microbial pesticides, the Agency envisions some further modifications in the future to specify certain policies in more detail, keep the asse ssment process current with existing scientific knowledge, and ensure an efficient review mechanism. Some of these anticipated modifications are discussed here. As noted in Unit I, EPA intends to revise the EUP regulations (40 CFR Part 172) to incorporate the concepts embodied in the in terim policy on small-scale field testing. Specifically, Part 172 will be revised to specif y more clearly which applicants must notify EPA before conducting small-scale field tests w ith microbial pesticides and the content of notification. As noted in the overview to this EPA notice (Unit I.F), EPA is forming a Science Advisory Committee. The Scientific Advisory Panel, an advisory group mandated by FIFRA, will continue to serve in its advisory capacity on specific submissions under FIFRA, until the SAC is formed. FIFRA requires EPA to review a nd periodically update its guid elines, and OPP has begun this process for the Subdivision M Pesticide Assessmen t Guidelines. The Guidelines are currently being revised to reflect curre nt testing methodology and a dvances in risk assessment capabilities resulting from OPP's recent expe rience in evaluating genetically engineered microbial pesticides. In a ddition, as the Agency gains ri sk assessment experience and assembles a larger body of risk assessment data , it may be appropriate to amend the Part 158 data requirements regulation to add to or m odify the data requirements that apply to genetically engineered and noni ndigenous microbial pesticides. D. Regulatory Review of Microbial Pesticides This unit describes EPA's data requirements and re view procedures for microbial pesticides. In particular, Unit II.D.1 describes th e requirements and review plan for those microbial pesticides subject to review under FIFRA before they may be used in any application in the environment (i.e., small-scale field testing). Unit II.D.2 outlines the regulatory review for those microbial pesticides subject to the FIFRA requirements for an experimental use permit or registration. In most instances, microbial pesticides subject to the provisions in Unit II.D.1 will also be subject to the provisions in Unit II.D.2 when they are to be used for larger scale or commercial purposes in the environment. 1. Small-scale field testing . Prior to obtaining a registrati on for a pesticide product, appli cants generally need to conduct field studies in order to gather product performance, use, and ot her types of data necessary to support the registration of their product. The re gulations governing field studies (40 CFR Part 172) include a generally applicable presumption that EUPs will not be required for certain small-scale uses of new pesticides (or new uses of previously register ed pesticides). The Agency issued a statement of interim policy ad dressing small-scale fiel d testing of microbial pesticides in 1984. The interim policy announced that the Agency should be notified before initiation of any field testing of genetically altered or nonindi genous microbial pesticides. The purpose of this policy is to provide a m echanism for the Agency to evaluate these proposed small-scale field tests for possible ri sk to human health or the environment and determine whether EUPs are required before the tests can be initiated. Small-scale field studies are (1) terrestrial field studies that involve 10 acres or less of land; and, (2) aquatic field studies that involve 1 surface acre or less of water. To minimize the regulatory burden on producers of genetically engineered and nonindigenous microbial pesticides, and more closely correlate the level of Agency revi ew with potential risk of the microorganism, the Agency has adopted a two-level review system based on its evaluation of the potential risks posed by various types of microorganisms. The two-level system will allow the Agency to receive some basic information on small-scale testing of genetically engineered and nonindigenous micr oorganisms that are less likely to pose significant risks to humans or the environmen t (Level I reporting), while reserving full notification and review proce dures for microorganisms about which there is more concern (Level II notification). The review system is designed so that producers of microbial pesticides may proceed with their small-scale field tests without Agency approval, unless they are notified within a specified time that additiona l information or an EUP is required. In the case of level I reporting, producer s need only provide a limited amount of information, and are assured of an expedited res ponse from the Agency if it is determined that additional information is required. The two-level system is based on the analysis se t forth at Unit I.D, in which the Agency has defined groups of microorganisms that raise more concerns about their likelihood to pose risks to humans or the environment, when rele ased into the environment, than other microorganisms. Specifically, these include microbial pesticides formed by deliberately combining genetic material from organisms of di fferent genera and gene tically engineered or nonindigenous microbial pesticides derived fr om pathogenic source organisms. However, other genetically engineered and nonindigenous microbial pestic ides are less likely to pose significant risks to humans or the environment when applied in small-scale field test. Accordingly, the Agency has determined that th is second category of mi crobial pesticides will be subjected to a reporting requirement and wi ll be reviewed as described in Unit II.D.1 a through c below. The Agency will have up to 30 days to review the reported information. The kind of information needed to fulfill the reporting requirement is typically already available to an applicant as an essential part of product research and development, and is not generally expected to requi re generation of new data. All microbial pesticides formed by deliberately combining genetic material from organisms of different genera, and all geneti cally engineered or nonindigenous microbial pesticides derived from pathogenic source organisms will be subjec t to the full notification requirements (Level II) as described in Unit II.D.1.e below. The Agency has determined that these organisms should continue to be subjected to the full notif ication and review pro cedures set out in the original interim policy published on October 17, 1984. The Agency will have up to 90 days to review a Level II notification. The scope and requirements for Level I reporting a nd Level II notification ar e detailed below. The interim policy as revised by this notice does not apply to st udies conducted under enclosed, contained conditions, as defined in Unit IV. a. Level I reporting. Level I reporting for small- scale field testing app lies to all genetically engineered or nonindigenous mi crobial pesticides not othe rwise covered by Level II notification as detailed in II.D .1.d below. Small-scale field tests of additional groups of genetically engineered and nonindigenous micr obial pesticides now covered by Level II notification may also be determined to warrant only abbreviated review in the future. The Agency will make these determinations on a case-by-case basis. b. Level I information. Each report should include the following information, or, where specific information is not submitted, documentation of why it is not practicable or necessary to provide the information. (1) Identity of the microorgani sm, including characteristics, and means and limits of detection. (2) Description of the natural ha bitat of the microorganism or its parental strains, including information on natural predators, parasites, and competitors. (3) Information on the host range of the pare ntal strain(s) or noni ndigenous microorganism. (4) Information on the relative environmental competitiveness of the microorganism, if available. (5) If the microorganism is genetically engi neered, information should be provided on the methods used to genetically engineer the mi croorganism(s); the iden tity and location of the rearranged or inserted/deleted gene segm ent(s) in question; a description of the new trait(s) or characteristic(s) th at are expressed; information on potential for genetic transfer and exchange with other organisms, and on genetic stability of a ny inserted sequence. (6) A description of the proposed testing program, incl uding site location, crop to be treated, target pest, amount of test material to be applied, and method of application. c. Level I reporting process. EPA with have up to 30 days to review th e above information to make a preliminary determination of the need for an EUP. If the Agency does not notify the applicant of the need for an EUP within th e 30 days, the applicant may proceed with the proposed field test. If, on preliminary assessmen t, the test raises sufficient concerns such that the Agency determines that additional in formation or monitoring is warranted, then an EUP will be required (e.g., microorganisms for wh ich there is limited sc ientific information or regulatory experience, or that raise significant questions concerning genetic stability, competitiveness, or mode of action, or that warrant specific environmental monitoring during the test). In this case, the applicant has two options. First, the applicant may apply for a permit, providing the necessary data and information required to support the application. Alternatively, th e applicant may provide all a dditional data and information required under Level II notification as outlined in Unit II.D.1.e below. If the latter option is chosen, the Agency will have an additional 60 days to review the full notification package and make a final determination as to whether an EUP is required. d. Level II notification. Level II notification for small-scale field testing applies to microbial pesticides: Microbial pesticides formed by deliberately combining genetic material from organisms of different genera, genetically e ngineered microbial pes ticides derived from source organisms that are pathogens (as defi ned in Unit IV), and nonindigenous pathogenic microbial pesticides (a s defined in Unit IV). e. Level II requirements. Notification shoul d include adequate information to allow the Agency to evaluate the small-scale field testing program. Each notification should include the following information, or, where specific information is not submitted, documentation of why it is not practicable or ne cessary to provide the information. (1) Background informati on on the microorganism. (a) Identity of the microorgani sm, including tables of characteristics, and means and limit of detection using the most sensitive and specific methods available. (b) Description of the natural ha bitat of the microorganism or its parental strains, including information on natural predators, parasites, and competitors. (c) Information on host range, especially infectiv ity and pathogenicity to nontarget organisms. (d) Information on survival and ability of the mi croorganism to increase in numbers (biomass) in the environment (e.g., laboratory or containment facility test data). (e) If the microorganism is ge netically altered, the following information should be provided in addition to the information listed in (a) through (d) above: i. Information on the methods used to genetically alter the microorganism. ii. The identity and location of the rearranged or inserted/deleted gene segment(s) in question (host source, nature, base sequence data, or restriction enzyme map of the gene(s). iii. Information on the control region of the gene(s ), and a description of the new trait(s) or characteristic(s) that are expressed. iv. Information on potential for genetic transf er and exchange with other organisms, and on genetic stability of any inserted sequence. v. Information on relative environmental competi tiveness compared to the parental strains. (2) Description of proposed field test. (a) The purpose or objectives of the proposed testing. (b) A detailed description of the proposed testing program , including test parameters. (c) A designation of the pest organism(s ) involved (common and scientific names). (d) A statement of composition for the formulation to be tested, giving the name and percentage by weight of each ingredient, active and inert, production methods, contamination with extraneous microorgani sms, potency and amount of any toxins present, and where applicable the number of viable microorganisms per unit weight or volume of the product (or othe r appropriate system for de signating the quantity of active ingredient). (e) The amount of pesticide product proposed for use and the method of application. (f) The State(s) in which the proposed program will be conducted, and specific identification of the exact location of the test site(s) (including pr oximity to residences and human activities, surface water, etc.). (g) The crops, fauna, flora, geographical de scription of sites, modes, dosage rates, frequency, and situation of a pplication on or in which the pesticide is to be used. (h) A comparison of the natural habitat of the microorganism with the proposed test site. (i) The number of acres, number of structural sites, or number of animals/plants, by State, to be treated or included in the area of experi mental use, and the procedures to be used to protect the test area from in trusion by unauthorized individuals. (j) The proposed dates or period(s) during wh ich the testing program is to be conducted, and the manner in which supervision of the program will be accomplished. (k) A description of procedures for monitori ng the microorganism within and adjacent to the test site during the field test. (l) The method of disposal or sanitation of plan ts, animals, soils, etc., that were exposed during or after the field test. (m) Means of evaluating potential adverse effects and methods of controlling the microorganism if detected beyond the test area. In addition, the following referenc es should be consulted for furt her guidance of the kinds of data and information that may be relevant to the evaluation of ge netically engineered microorganisms: \"Proposed Points to C onsider for Environmental Testing of Microorganisms\" developed by the National Ins titutes of Health Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee Working Group on Release into th e Environment (Ref. 11); \"Subdivision M: Biorational Pesticides\" (Ref. 20) ; a report by the Cornell Ecosystems Research Center titled \"Potential Impacts of Environmental Rel ease of Biotechnology Products: Assessment, Regulation, and Research Needs\" (Ref. 9); a National Science Foundation Report titled \"The Suitability for Environmental Applications of Biotechnology\" (Ref. 3); and EPA \"Points to Consider in the Microorganisms\" (available fr om TSCA Assistance Office at the address given at the beginning of this notice). (f) Level II review process. Once the supporting data have been submitted, EPA has up to 90 days to review each notification of intent to conduct small-scale field testing and to determine whether an EUP is required. The Ag ency encourages prospective applicants to meet with EPA prior to submission of their notification to discuss their field test and determine what specific data would be necessary to evaluate the product. EPA's review process will include some or all of the elements described in the following paragraphs. As the Agency builds a baseline of risk assessment data and gains more experience in evaluating these products, cert ain steps may no longer be necessary. In addition, an abbreviated review pr ocess may be appropriate in so me situations (e.g., review of a proposal that is similar to an already reviewed case). Such a determination will be made on a case-by-case basis. Once a notification is received, OPP review s each proposal and assesses potential risks associated with the proposed experiment. OPP develops a written scientific position for each proposal which identifies potential problems or significant unanswered questions and sets forth a statement of the overall likelihood of si gnificant risk from the proposed field testing. As the review process proceeds, it may be necessary for OPP to request supplemental information. OPP obtains comments on its assessment from a workgroup within EPA and from other Federal agencies as appropriate (e.g., USDA , National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, and National Science Foundation). Their comments are in corporated into the scientific position, as appropriate. OPP contacts the appropriate State pesticides regu latory authorities to ensure that they are aware of the proposal and to disc uss EPA's assessment. These contacts ensure that the actions of EPA and the State agencies ar e as consistent as possible. OPP also notifies the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the USDA so that they can determine whether any aspect of the proposed experiment falls within APHIS jurisdiction and, if so, to avoid duplicative or conflicting assessments. Thus far, reviews of small-scale field testing proposals for genetically engineered microbial pesticides have emphasized some questions th at have not been as significant in the assessments of naturally occurring microbial pe sticides. For example, OPP has identified potential risks associated with th e transfer of inserted genetic material to other organisms, the competitiveness of the engineered organism co mpared with the parental organisms in the environment, and the ability of the engineered organism to become established in a new ecological niche and thereby pose a potential adverse environmental impact. OPP has addressed these and similar questions on a case-by-case basis in its risk assessments. In some cases, applicants have addressed quest ions by redesigning the proposed application or test microorganism to minimize the potential ri sk. In other instances, EPA has established data requirements and test methods as a baseli ne, and has designed speci fic laboratory test(s) (or tiered series of tests) to establish whethe r the effect of concern is likely to materialize under field conditions. If the notification raises comp lex or controversial scientific questions, OPP provides the notification package and its sc ientific evaluation to a group of independent scientists constituted as a subpanel of FIFRA's Scientific Advisory Panel. Separate subpanels may be formed to review each proposal since each microorganism and its proposed use may differ and raise questions that require the analysis of individuals wi th different expertise. The purpose of the SAP subpanel is to obtain an in dependent peer review of the OPP scientific position, to address specific scie ntific questions raised by OPP, and to identify any additional points, questions, or problems. As noted prev iously in Unit I.F, the Agency is forming a Science Advisory Committee which will assume these responsibilities in the future. At the conclusion of the review , the Agency then decides whether an EUP is required. The decision document sets forth OPP's conclusions w ith respect to potential risks associated with the proposal, identifies any remaining questions or additional data that may be needed to complete the risk assessment, and, if an EUP is required, may recommend restrictions, limitations, or modifications of the proposal to address areas of concer n. If an EUP is not required, the applicant may proceed with the pro posed field test. If an EUP is required, the applicant must apply for a permit, providing th e necessary data and information required to support the application. The Agency may decide to require an EUP to ensure that the experiment is conducted within certain defined limitations, the necessary data are developed to assess the proposal, or certain kinds of data are developed during the test and reported to the Agency. 2. EUPs, large-scale testing, and registration . Before a pesticide may be marketed as a commer cial product, it must fi rst be registered as provided for in section 3 of FIFR A. Large-scale field testing of a microbial pesticide is often necessary to evaluate a potentia l product and obtain data needed to support registration of the product. This testing, like sma ll-scale field testing under an EUP, is subject to section 5 of FIFRA which authorizes EPA to approve appl ications for EUPs for limited use of an unregistered product or use of a re gistered product for an unregiste red use. Data requirements for registration are specified in 40 CFR 158.170 and a subset of these requirements applies to large-scale field testing propos als to be performed under EUPs . The regulatory review process consists of the same basic elements in both situations and is de scribed in this unit. a. Scope. All microbial pesticides to be used in large-scale field tests are subject to review under FIFRA EUP regulations. The conditi ons under which an EUP is required are specified at 40 CFR Part 172, which also provides guidance on how to determine whether an EUP must be obtained. Likewise, all micr obial pesticides are subject to the FIFRA registration requirements. b. General requirements for microbial pesticid es. The existing pesticide data requirements and regulations governing large-scale fiel d testing (40 CFR Parts 158 and 172) and registration (40 CFR Parts 158 a nd 162) are applicable to al l microbial pesticides, both naturally occurring and otherwise. The agency believes that these requirements ar e adequate for the assessment of indigenous microbial pesticides, and provide a basis for evaluating genetically engineered and nonindigenous microbial pesticides as well. However, the Agen cy believes that additional data and information, determined on a case-by-ca se basis, may be necessary to evaluate some properties of genetically engineered a nd nonindigenous microbial pesticides. Part 158 explicitly provides the necessary flexibil ity to require additional data (\u00a7 158.65) as well as the flexibility to waive data requi rements that are not applicable (\u00a7 158.45). c. Additional requirements for genetical ly engineered and nonindigenous microbial pesticides. Any additional data requirements will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the particular microorganism, its parent microorganisms, its native habitat, the pesticide use pattern, and the manner and ex tent to which the microorganism may have been engineered. These additi onal requirements could include: (1) Description of the natural ha bitat of the microorganism or its parental strains, including information on natural predators, parasites, and competitors. (2) Information on relative ability to surviv e and increase in number or biomass as compared to the parental strains. (3) Selected environmental fate tests from 40 CFR 158.170. (4) Additional toxicology tests from 40 CFR 158.170. (5) If the microorganism is genetically altered, then information on the genetic modification techniques used, the identity of inserted gene segment(s) (base sequence data or restriction enzyme map of the gene), the control region of the gene(s), a description of the new traits or characteristics that are in tended to be expressed, and tests to evaluate genetic stability and excha nge, may be required as specified previously at Unit II.D.1.b above. d. Review process for genetic ally engineered and nonindigenous microbial pesticides. EUP applications will be reviewed in compliance with the EUP regulations under 40 CFR Part 172. The registration, reregistration, and classification procedures of 40 CFR Part 162 will be followed for registration applications. Th e review process will contain the same major elements as those outlined previously for sma ll-scale field testing notifications (see Unit II.D.1.c). Briefly, this process involves scie ntific review and ri sk assessment by EPA scientists and, if appropriate, review and comment from other Federal agencies and independent expert consultants. Once the supporting data have been submitted, EPA has up to 120 days to review an EUP application and determine whether to grant a permit. Past experience indicates that the registration process for a new mi crobial pesticide may vary from 9 months to several years depending upon the particular product, its use pa ttern, and the completene ss of the registration package submitted to EPA. Both the EUP and registration process may provide an opportunity for public comment. For example, \u00a7 172.11 of the EUP regulations specifies that if an application may be of regional or national significance the Agency will announce receipt of th e application in the Federal Register. The announcement is accompanied by a descripti on of the experimental program and public comments are solicited. Similarly, \u00a7 162.6 of the registration regulations specifies that if a registration application relates to a new active ingr edient or a new use, notice of receipt of that application shall be published in the Federal Register with a request for public comment. Information on the submission is made available for public inspection. EPA has several regulatory options for responding to either an EUP or re gistration application. For example, after completing its review, the Ag ency may determine that the field test or registration poses no unreasonable risks to hum ans or the environment and may grant the application. Alternatively, EPA may conclude that some additional information or data are needed to assess the potential risks adequately. In this case, the application would be asked to provide the necessary data before EPA would deci de whether to grant the application. In other cases, the Agency may impose additional limitati ons or restrictions on the field test or registration to address a potential risk. Finally, EPA will deny t hose applications where it has determined that it has all the necessary data to complete a risk assessment and that the field test or registration would pose an unreasonable risk to humans or the environment, even if additional limits or restrictions are imposed. III. Applicability of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to Microbial Products A. Overview of This Unit As discussed in the December 84 notice (49 FR 50886), EPA will review certain microorganisms and uses of microorganisms under TSCA. Microorganisms and their DNA molecules are \"chemical substances\" under secti on 3 of TSCA, and thus are subj ect to all the provisions of TSCA, except to the extent they are manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce for use as pesticides, foods, food additives, drugs, cosm etics, and medical devices. For purposes of analysis and convenience of administeri ng TSCA, EPA has chosen to focus on the microorganism as the \"chemical substance.\" This unit explains the statutory requirements of TSCA as they apply to microorganisms. It begins by describing which microorganisms are w ithin the scope of TSCA and which are not. Following that are units describing five categorie s of microorganisms or uses of microorganisms that are or will be subject to reporting requirements under TSCA. B. Scope of TSCA Many organisms are not subject to TSCA requireme nts because of statutory exemptions; others will be exempt from certain TSCA requirements as a matter of regulatory policy. In general, the use of a microorganism determines whether it is subject to TSCA or to other laws. Many of the comments received by OTS indicated misunderstandings of TSCA's scope. Therefore, those organisms which are and are not subject to TSCA are described in this Unit. 1. Organisms not subject to TSCA\u2014 a. Microbes used as foods, food additives, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, and pesticides. Microorganisms are sometimes used directly as foods, food additives, drugs (including both human and animal vaccines), co smetics, medical devices, and pesticides. When microorganisms are used for these pur poses, they are explic itly excluded from TSCA and from the policies described in the TSCA portions of this notice (TSCA section 3(2)(B), 15 U.S.C. 2602(2)(B)). Microorganisms that are used as foods, food additives, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, and pesticides are regulated by the Food a nd Drug Administration (FDA), USDA, or the EPA Office of Pesticide Program s. Applicable requirements for pesticides are described in Unit II of this notice. Requirements fo r foods, food additives, drugs, cosmetics, and medical devices are described in the FDA a nd USDA notices in this Federal Register. b. Microbes used to produce foods, food additives, drugs, cosmetics, and medical devices. In addition to being used themselves for food, drug, and other purposes, microorganisms are often used to produce chemicals that are in turn used for such purposes. For reasons explained in the December 84 notice, microor ganisms will not be reviewed under TSCA when used to produce foods, food additives, drugs (including vaccines), cosmetics, or medical devices. Further information on th ese uses may be found in the FDA and USDA notices in this Federal Register. Microorganisms used in the production of ch emical end products other than foods, food additives, drugs (including vaccines), cosme tics, and medical devices are subject to TSCA. They are described in Unit III.B.3 below. 2. Plants and animals not subject to these polic ies. Plants and animals are not subject to the TECA policies in this notice, either as whole or ganisms or as in vitro cultures for the reasons set forth in the December 84 No tice. (Definitions of plants and animals for regulatory purposes are provided in Unit IV of this EPA not ice.) There are two excep tions to this general rule. First, if plant or animal gene se gments are intentionall y incorporated into microorganisms, the microorganisms that contain those plant or animal genes may be subject to TSCA, depending on how they are used (see Units III.B. 1 and 3). Second, a chemical extracted from a plant or animal may be subjec t to TSCA, again dependi ng on how it is used. The USDA and FDA notices in th is Federal Register contain information about regulations that apply to plants and animals. 3. Organisms subject to TSCA -- microorganisms used for purposes not excluded by law. With the exceptions described above, al l microorganisms produced for e nvironmental, industrial, or consumer uses are potentially regulable under TSCA. It is not po ssible to list all the applications that could be subject to TSCA b ecause many are yet to be developed. Some of the microorganisms that are expected in the near future and that would be subject to TSCA include microorganisms used in conversion of biomass for energy, pollutant degradation, enhanced oil recovery, metal extraction a nd concentration, and certain non-food and non- pesticidal agricultural applicati ons, such as nitrogen fixation. Microorganisms used in the production of a chem ical end product will be subject to TSCA if the end product is any chemical substance us ed for a purpose other than as a food, food additive, drug, cosmetic, or medical device. For example, microorganisms are subject to TSCA if they are used in the production of pesticides, fuels, solvents, dyes, cleansing agents, etc. TSCA jurisdiction over such microorgani sms, which may be used entirely in closed manufacturing systems, is consistent with TS CA coverage of conventional chemicals. For example, chemical intermediates -- even those used in closed systems -- fall under TSCA authority and are subject to PMN requirements if new (40 CFR Part 720). Similarly, as described in Unit III.C. 1 of this notice, \"n ew\" microorganisms used in chemical production are subject to PMN requirements. 4. Chemicals produced by microorganisms -- St atus under TSCA. Although the purpose of this notice is to provide information on the appli cability of TSCA to microorganisms, some readers may wish to obtain information on requi rements that apply to chemicals produced by microorganisms. For example, various prot eins and polysaccharide gums are produced by microorganisms and may be subject to TSCA , depending on how they are used (see Unit III.B.1). These chemicals produced by microorganisms are subject to the same requirements and procedures as chemicals produced by other mean s. Any special concerns pertaining to the microbial production method, such as the possibility of contaminants, will be considered during the review of the microorganisms used in producing the chemicals. This approach is explained in the December 84 notice at page 50890. C. Specific Requirements Under TSCA The fact that a microorganism is potentially subj ect to TSCA does not necessarily mean that it will be regulated under TSCA. The re st of this unit explains the sp ecific provisions that apply or will apply to various types of microorga nisms falling within TSCA's jurisdiction. In overview, microorganisms are (or will be) s ubject to TSCA requirements in the following manner: As of the date of this notice, microorganisms that are subject to TSCA and contain genetic material from dissimilar source organisms (i.e., or ganisms from different genera) are subject to PMN requirements. Microorganisms other than intergeneric comb inations that are subject to TSCA and are pathogenic or contain genetic mate rial from pathogens, will in th e future, if released into the environment, be subject to \"significant new use\" reporting requirements under TSCA section 5(a)(2). One exception is that agricultural uses of such microorganisms will be reviewed by USDA rather than EPA. EPA expects voluntary notification to begin imme diately for uses that will be subject to significant new use reporting requirements. The research and development exemption from PMN and significant new use notification requirements will be amended so that it no longe r applies to microorganisms released to the environment. EPA expects voluntary notific ation of such uses to begin immediately. EPA will issue a rule requiring manufacturers and importers to submit general information on environmental uses of microorganisms that are subject to TSCA but not otherwise subject to notification requirements, so that EP A can monitor environmental releases. All manufacturers, processors, and distributors of microorganisms subject to TSCA are reminded of the requirement to report any information on substantial risks under TSCA section 8(e). EPA is considering initiating rulemaking that would exempt from PMN requirements inter- generic microorganisms used solely in contained systems and never intenti onally released to the environment. 1. Premanufacture notification requirements\u2014 a. Overview. EPA has determined that any microorganisms th at are subject to TSCA (described in Unit III.B), and that through deliberate human inte rvention contain genetic material from dissimilar source organisms, are \"new\" and th erefore subject to PMN requirements of TSCA. This interpretation is effective as of the date of publica tion of this notice. Organisms are considered dissimilar for the purposes of this policy if they are from different genera. In the case of chemically synthesized genes, the Agency will follow the same principle, as clarified below in Unit IV . Detailed guidance on how to determine if organisms are from different genera is also provided in Unit IV. The agency is excluding certain inter-generic combinations from PMN requirements, i.e., those inter-generic combinations in which th e genetic material added to the recipient microorganism consists only of well-charact erized, non-coding regulat ory regions (see Unit IV). The resulting microorganisms do not posse ss new combinations of traits but rather exhibit quantitativ e changes in preexisting traits. EPA is leaving unanswered, for now, the ques tion of whether microorganisms containing genetic material from other microorganisms in the same genus (i.e., products of deliberate intra-generic combinations) and those which are developed from a single source microorganism (e.g., products of undirected mu tagenesis, microorganisms with deletions) should also be considered \"new.\" In the future, it is possible that EPA will decide that such microorganisms are \"new,\" but for now they are not subject to PMN requirements. b. Background. For purposes of administering TSCA, EPA must decide what constitutes a \"new\" microorganism which is subject to PMN requireme nts. As mentioned in the introduction to the EPA portion of this notice, EPA originally proposed a \"process-based\" approach to determining whether a microorganism is new. This approach stated that a microorganism would be considered new if significant human intervention had been us ed in developing it. For example, microorganisms altered by certain techniques -- such as recombinant DNA and cell fusion -- were presumed to be new because they involved significant human intervention. The question of which other techniques should be considered to produced new microorganisms was left open and comments were solicited. After reviewing the comments, EPA considered a number of alternative ways to define \"new\" microorganisms. These are described in the \"Response to Comments\" document available as background to this Federal Register notice. In choosing among the alternatives, EPA carefully considered the TSCA mandate to re view \"new\" substances. The Agency also considered related issues, for example, how well the options approximated risk (there was uncertainty with all the options in this resp ect) and how readily they could be implemented and enforced. c. Rationale. Having reviewed the TSCA section 5 PMN re quirements, the PMN regulations, the public comments, and the current state of science re garding genetic engineer ing, EPA has concluded that microorganisms resulting from intentiona l, inter-generic combinations of genetic material, except those in which the transferre d material is only a well-characterized, non- coding regulatory region, constitute new microor ganisms for purposes of PMN reporting. The reasons for this are set forth below. First, the Agency considered the regulatory pr ecedents established in compiling the inventory of existing chemical substances under section 8(b) of TSCA. Any chemical substance not on this inventory is \"new\" unde r section 5(a) of TSCA and is therefore subject to PMN requirements. Naturally occurring substances and substances derive d from nature with limited human intervention are not explicitly listed on the inventory but are considered implicitly to be on it, and thus are not \"new \" (see 40 CFR 710.4(b)). A more detailed explanation of the TSCA inventory and related issues is foun d in the December 84 notice at pages 50887-50888. Second, the Agency evaluated these regulatory preced ents in the light of scientific knowledge about genetic engineering and microorganisms found in nature. On this basis, EPA concluded that microorganisms found in nature and deve loped without any deliberate combination of genetic material are not new, because they occur naturally and are derived through limited human intervention. Furthermore, from a scie ntific standpoint, these microorganisms have a very low probability of exhibiting new combin ations of traits. Therefore, the Agency considers that from a legal and scientific st andpoint they must be considered naturally occurring (not new). Because such microorga nisms are naturally occurring, they are, as explained above, implicitly liste d on the TSCA chemical substan ces inventory and not subject to PMN requirements. Third, where genetic material has been comb ined among source organisms from different genera (inter-generic), the re sulting microorganisms should be considered \"new\" because of the degree of human intervention involve d, the significant like lihood of creating new combinations of traits, and the greater uncerta inty regarding the potential risks of such microorganisms. However, transfer of ge netic material consisting solely of well- characterized, non-coding regulator y regions is a special case. Where only regulatory material is transferred, no distinctly new combinations of traits are introduced; instead, existing traits in the receiving microorganisms are amplified or changed quantitatively. For this reason, EPA believes that microorganisms formed only through inter-generic transfer of well-characterized, non-coding regulat ory regions should not be co nsidered \"new\" under section 5 of TSCA. This is reflected in the defi nition of \"inter-gener ic\" found in Unit IV.A. It is possible to argue that some microorganisms formed through intra-generic combinations are products of significant human intervention and may exhibit new combinations of traits, and therefore that they should also be consider ed new. However, the Agency at this time believes that it is appropriate to exclude such microorganisms form its definition of \"new\" because distinctly new combinations of traits ar e unlikely to occur through transfers of genetic material among closely related organisms, becau se transfers among closely related organisms are more likely to occur in nature, and because the current state of taxonomy with regard to species designations is sufficiently unstable that it makes it difficult to include such microorganisms in a definition of \"new\" (the rati onale is found in Unit I.D.3.a). As explained previously, however, the Agency will continue to review the status of such microorganisms and may, in the future, determine that certain combinations among similar organisms should be considered new. In summary, EPA considers microorganisms delib erately formed to contain genetic material from different genera to be new, except wher e only well-characterized, non-coding regulatory regions are transferred. Conversely, intra-gene ric and nonengineered microbes are considered naturally occurring. These conc lusions are based on the TSCA section 5 mandate to review \"new\" substances, and they also reflect a numbe r of scientific considerations. Among these are (1) the Agency's concern that microorganisms formed with genetic material from different genera warrant regulatory review, because of th e inherent uncertainty about the characteristics and behavior of such microorganisms, (2) the observation that microorganisms from different genera are less likely to exchange genetic mate rial in nature than microorganisms that are more closely related, (3) the regulatory preceden t that significant human intervention creates new substances for purposes of PMN under TSCA section 5, and (4) the necessity of having a definition of \"new\" that can be readily interp reted and enforced given the current state of science. These scientific and legal issues are more fully described in Unit IV.A. d. How to comply with the PMN requirements for new microorganisms. The following requirements apply to \"new\" microorganisms pr oduced for uses subject to TSCA authority (see Unit III.B.1 and 3). Detailed criteria for determining whether a microbe meets the definition of \"new\" microorganism (i.e., whether it contains genetic material from organisms from different genera) may be found in Unit IV.A. Certain PMN policies in this noti ce are immediately effective. As of the date of publication of this notice, microorganisms that are bei ng manufactured or imported for any TSCA commercial purposes other than research a nd development (R&D) are subject to PMN requirements 90 days prior to manufacture or import. This requirement applies to both contained and environmental uses that have gone beyond R&D. The requirement is based on the current provisions of 40 CFR Part 720. The definition of R&D under these regulations is clarified in the Federal Regist er of April 22, 1986 (51 FR 15096). In addition, new microorganisms that are be ing manufactured or imported for R&D that involves environmental release will have to be re ported to EPA at least 90 days before such activities begin. This polic y will be implemented through amendments to 40 CFR 720 (explained fully in Unit II.C.3); in the m eantime, persons manufacturing or importing new microorganisms for R&D activitie s involving environmental releas e are expected to comply with this policy voluntarily. EPA believes that these are no manufacturers who are presently beyond the research and development stage with new microorganisms subj ect to TSCA. However, if any companies are now engaged in such activities, they should contact EPA and determine whether a PMN is necessary. If a company in this position contac ts EPA promptly, it will not be considered out of compliance with policy. Further info rmation on TSCA PMN requirements may be obtained from the TSCA Assist ance Office (address provided at the beginning of the EPA portion of this notice). (1) How to know if a microorganism is subject to PMN. As stated above, all microorganisms contai ning deliberate combinations of genetic material from organisms from different genera are new and subject to PMN. An exception to this policy is an inter-generic combinati on in which the genetic material added to the recipient microorganism consists only of well-characterized, non-coding regulatory regions. Unit IV.A of this notice contains detailed guidance that manufacturers should use to determine if their microorganisms meet this definition. Submitters should consult the Agency if they have any questions about how to determine if a microorganism contains genetic material from different genera. (2) PMN exemptions. EPA considers it a pr iority to exempt from PMN requirements new microorganisms that can be shown to meet the findings for exemption under TSCA section 5(h)(4). Further information on exemptions the Agency is considering may be found in Unit III.C.6 of this notice. (3) Submitting the PMN. EPA expects manufacturers and importers to contact EPA well in advance of PMN submission, to allow suffici ent time for prenotice consultation. These consultations will help the Agency and th e submitter anticipate potential problems and expedite the review. Information regarding new microorganisms should not be submitted on the standard PMN form, as this form is not applicable to microbial products. Instead, EPA and the submitter will discuss the level and types of information appropriate for the notice during prenotice consultations. The general kinds of information EPA expects to see in most submissions for microorganisms are de scribed in the next unit below. (4) What information to submit. Section 5( d)(1)(A) of TSCA specifies the information PMN submitters must provide in their notices, including information on production, workplace exposure, and release. In addition, under section 5(d)(1)(B) submitters must provide all test data related to the health and environmen tal effects of the new chemical substance in their possession or control. For more information on PMN requirements, persons should consult EPA's PMN rule (40 CFR Part 720). In general, information to assess a substance's potential risk should be de veloped in a step-wide fashion. PMN submitters should begin with publis hed literature on the source organisms, then move through laboratory, microc osm, growth chamber, and/or greenhouse studies that simulate as closely as possible the condi tions of the eventual use or environmental application. The remainder of this unit describes the types of information EPA expects submitters to provide in PMNs on new microorganisms. (a) Identifying the microorganism. PMN submitters must provide information that identifies microorganisms well enough to be listed on the TSCA chemical substance inventory. If the identity and/or use of the microorganism are claimed as confidential business information by the submitter, the PMN must also include a generic description of these items so that the information can be published in the Federal Register. Confidentia l submissions will be considered incomplete unless this generic information is included (see 40 CFR 720.65, 720.85, and 720.87). Once a new microorganism is actually manufactured or imported, it will be listed on the inventory and will be no longer subject to PMN requirements. (See 40 CFR 720.102 concerning submission of a Notice of Commen cement of Manufacture or Import.) EPA proposed an approach to inve ntory listings in a background document to the December 84 notice. The Agency received very few comments on this document, but those who commented stated that a general method for lis ting all microbes does not seem possible at this time. The Agency agrees and therefore intends to list microorganisms on the inventory on a case-by-case basis while developing more ge neral procedures for different classes of microorganisms, and gaining experience that will help in developing standard listings. For now, the inventory definition will usually incl ude the genus and speci es designations of source organisms and of the microorganism being reported, and other relevant phenotypic information such as nutritional and substrate requirements, proteins expressed, primary characteristics for which the microbe was engineer ed, and characteristics that are a typical for the species. To identify the microorganism, EPA is likely to require information on: i. Source organisms (e.g., taxonomy, source, reproductive cycle, and capacity for genetic transfer). ii. Methods used to manipulate source or ganisms genetically to obtain the resulting product (e.g., source and function of genetic ma terial to be combined; description of methods for vector construc tion and introduction, fusion of cells, injection of DNA, etc.). iii. The special functions obtained (e.g., new tr aits intended to be expressed; selection method; nature and amount of source genetic material remaining in the product microorganism; genetic stability of new trait). (b) Risk assessment information. Data required for conducting the risk assessment will vary according to the specifics of each case, but in general will fall into several major categories: Information on exposure, environmental fate, and human health and environmental effects. If the microorganisms will be produced in encl osed, commercial-scale facilities, or used solely in physically contained systems, the notice should include the following information: i. Production processes (e.g., culture conditions and require ments; sites, methods, and amounts of manufacture, processing, storag e, and shipment; volume, composition, and disposal of wastes). ii. Workplace exposure and worker practices (e.g., potential for exposure, worker protection practices, and equipment). iii. Containment and possible releases (e .g., potential sources and characteristics of releases, physical containment methods, emergency backup systems, monitoring, and detection methods in event of a release). In the case of small-scale field tests and other environmental releases, EPA expects that the submitter will provide information on: (A) Purpose and intended effect of application. (B) Site of application and surroundings, including geograp hic, physical, chemical, and biological features. (C) Numbers of microorganisms and methods of application. (D) Containment and mitigation measures (e.g., pr ocedures in event of accidental release, for emergency termination of the applicati on, and to reduce dispersal beyond the site). (E) Monitoring (e.g., detection procedures including their limits, sampling procedures). For field tests and other environmental releases, data on environmental fate and effects will be essential. In such cases, manufacturers should assume, in the absence of data to the contrary, that the microorganisms may present a risk because of their potential to reproduce and exhibit new traits. Therefore, EPA will e xpect manufacturers to provide test and other data demonstrating the microorganisms' safety. These data should include: (i) General background information on the s ource organism (e.g., habitat and geographic distribution, interactions w ith other organisms, involve ment in biological cycling processes, potential for gene tic exchange in nature). (ii) Test data on the new microorganism its elf, indicating its pot ential for survival, replication, dissemination, and genetic exchange with other organisms. For further guidance, manufacturers should refer to the \"Proposed Points to Consider for Environmental Testing of Microorganisms\" de veloped by the National Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee Working Group on Release into the Environment (Ref. 11). This document is particularly useful in developing data and information for submissions on small-scale field tests. While some points in this document relate solely to recombinant DNA techniques, most of the consider ations are relevant to enviro nmental tests of microorganisms regardless of the techniques involved in their production. In addition, the Agency has prepared a more detailed guidance documen t entitled \"Points to Consider in the Preparation and Submission of PMNs for Microorganisms.\" This document provides guidance on both environmental and indust rial applications of microorganisms and is available from the TSCA Assistance Office (s ee address at the beginning of this notice). At least three other documents will be useful to submitters. These are the \"EPA Pesticide Assessment Guidelines: Subdivision M\u2014Biorationa l Pesticides\" (Ref. 20), a National Science Foundation report titled \"The Suitability and App licability of Risk Assessment Methods for Environmental Applications of Biotechnology\" (Ref. 3), and a report by the Cornell Ecosystems Research Center titled \"Potenti al Impacts of Environmental Release of Biotechnology Products: Assessment, Regulation, and Research Needs (Ref. 9). e. The PMN review, All reviews of microorgani sms will follow established administrative steps that are the same for all substances subject to PMN review. First, within 5 days of receiving the PMN, EPA will issue an announcement in the Federal Register describing the submission. The announcement will include information on th e identity of the new microorganism, the type of use, occupational exposure, production vo lume, a summary of test data submitted in the notice, and the submitter's identity. It will have confidential business information deleted according to the manufacturer's instructi ons, although EPA will strongly encourage manufacturers to release as much information as possible. If ident ity and use are claimed confidential, the Agency will include a generi c description provided by the submitter. EPA will have 90 days to review the PMN (extendable to 180 days), during which time the microorganism cannot be manufactured or proc essed for purposes other than research and development. Within the review period, the Ag ency may take action under section 5(e) of TSCA to prohibit or limit the activities, pending receipt of more data, or under section 5(f) or 6 to prohibit or limit the activities if there is sufficient information to make an unreasonable risk finding. Alternatively, EPA may take no action. In this case, manufacture and use may begin without restriction. (1) Case-by-case assessments. Because of the very recent development of genetically engineered microorganisms for environmental use, there is little direct experience for conducting risk assessments on environmental releases of engi neered microorganisms. In the absence of such experience, the Agency will conduct case-by-case reviews by using information from various scientific disciplines and by directly considering the f eatures of specific ge netically engineered microorganisms and their uses. Many existing risk assessment approaches th at are used for nonengineered microorganisms will contribute to the analysis of risks of engi neered microbes in the environment. Some of these will be adopted with few if any changes, while others will requi re modifications to address special problems. EPA believes that standardized protocols and pr ocedures should be gradually blended with the case-by-case approach. As experience is gained, increasingly detailed guidance on routine testing and procedures can and will be developed. (2) Use of experts. Expert judgment will be critical in determining information needs, evaluating protocols for testing, and reviewing potential ri sks. Because of the range of expertise that may be required in any given case, EPA intends to supplement its staff expertise by usi ng experts from other government agencies, academia, and other indepe ndent sources. Persons will be specifically chosen for their knowledge and experience with organisms and uses related to the PMN under review. As announced in the December 84 notice (and furthe r described in Unit I of this notice), EPA is forming a biotechnology Science Advisory Committee to provide scientific advice and promote consistent review procedures. Many academic experts may have financial or contractual relationships with biotechnology companies. Using non-Agency experts to assi st in PMN reviews may therefore raise two potentially sensitive issues: Conflicts of interest and acce ss by non-Agency experts to confidential business information. To addre ss these issues, the EPA Office of Toxic Substances has developed special procedures to ensure that scientists contributing to biotechnology PMN reviews will not have conflicts of interest, and will have the necessary access to CBI to review the PMN without comp romising trade secrets or violating TSCA CBI procedures. A document describing these procedures will be placed in the public record for this policy statement. (3) Major parts of the review process. As stated earlier, EPA expects persons deve loping biotechnology products to engage in prenotice consultations with th e Agency. During these discussions, EPA and the consulting company can identify preliminary concerns by considering the source organisms and intended uses of the microorganism subject to PMN. Significant time may be saved later in the PMN process if these concerns are addressed before the PMN is submitted. Once the PMN is submitted, EPA will develo p hazard and exposure assessments based on information submitted in the PMN, other available information, and consultation with non- Agency experts. Reviewers will consider the types of issues and questions described here and in the various guidance documents on risk assessments for microorganisms. As appropriate, they may also consult with external scientific experts, and their analyses may be peer reviewed by the Agency's biotechnology Science Advisory Committee. As a risk/benefit statute, TSCA requires that benefits be estimated a nd considered in judging whether the risk may be unreasonable. While the risk assessments are being developed, Agency economists will estimate the benefits of the product based on information from the submitter, independent economic research, a nd consultation with non-Agency experts. Finally, EPA staff will prepare a summary of the risks and benefits to use in reaching regulatory decisions. (4) Public involvement in the review. EPA will issue for publication a section 5(d)(2 ) notice after receipt of a PMN for a new microorganism. EPA will also maintain a copy of the PMN, from which CBI has been deleted, in the OTS Public Information Office at the address listed in Unit VI of the EPA notice. EPA will welcome comments from interested members of the public on the PMN. The public is generally given 30 days to comm ent on a PMN after publication of the section 5(d)(2) notice. In addition to the normal procedures for public comment on PMNs, EPA intends that meetings of its biotechnology Science Advi sory Committee will be open to the public, although certain portions of mee tings may have to be closed to discuss CBI. EPA also intends to charter its committee to include representatives from the lay public. These features will help to ensu re that the public has acce ss to information about EPA biotechnology policie s and decisions. (5) Possible regulatory decisions. The Agency may come to one of three decisi ons at the conclusion of a particular PMN review: (a) There is sufficient information to de termine that the risks ar e reasonable, (b) there is sufficient information to determine that the risks are unreasonable, or (c) there is insufficient information to make a reasoned eval uation of risk, and the substance may present an unreasonable risk or there may be si gnificant or substantial exposure to it. Where the first decision is made, the Agency will notify the PMN submitter that the manufacture and use may proceed without restriction. In a ny event, unless the Agency notifies the company to the contrary before the end of the 90-day review period (with a possible 90-day extension), the submitter may begin to manufacture and use the organism. A decision that risks will be unreasonable leads to two regulat ory options. The Agency may require measures to reduce the risks to an accep table level as a condition of manufacture and use. Alternatively, the Agency may prohibit manufacture or use of the microorganism if there are no alternatives availabl e or practical to reduce the ri sk sufficiently. Such actions can be taken under TSCA section 5(f). If the information submitted w ith the PMN is insufficient fo r a reasoned evaluation, and EPA finds that the microorganism may present an unreasonable risk or that there may be significant or substantial human exposure to it, or substantia l environmental release, EPA may, under TSCA section 5(e), limit or prohibit the manufacture or use of the microorganism until sufficient data are submitted to th e Agency to evaluate the risks. 2. Significant new uses of microorganisms \u2014 a. Overview. EPA intends to supplement its PMN require ments by requiring persons to notify the Agency before they introduce pathogenic microorganisms (including microorganisms containing genetic material from pathogens) in to the environment. Notification will be required for new environmental applications of genetically engineered pathogens prior to their release in any amounts into the environment, while notification for nonengineered pathogens will be required at a somewhat later stage, prior to their introduction on more than 10 acres of land (or some equivalent meas urement standard in cases where acreage is not applicable, e.g. aquatic uses). If a pathogen used for agricultural purposes is subject to USDA review, it will not be subject to this polic y. Applicable definitions may be found in Unit IV. EPA intends to implement these notificati on requirements through a significant new use rule (SNUR) under TSCA section 5(a)(2). The public will have the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule, including its sc ope and possible categories that could be excluded from coverage. Until the rule is final, EPA expects persons introducing pathogens into the environment for non-agricultural new uses to report to EPA voluntarily. In the unlikely event that an imminent hazard would arise during this interi m period, the Agency c ould use its authority under section 7 of TSCA to im mediately limit or prohibit th e manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the hazardous product. b. SNUR background. Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use. The Agency must make this determination by rule, after consideration of a ll relevant factors, in cluding those listed in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B) of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or proce ss the substance for that use. Persons subject to a SNUR must comply with most of the same notice requirements and regulatory procedures as submitters of PMNs under section 5(a) of TSCA. EPA's review procedures and regulatory authority are th e same for SNUR notices as for PMNs. However, if EPA does not take action on a SN UR notice, section 5(g) of TSCA requires the Agency to explain in the Federal Register its reasons fo r not taking action. Procedures and requirements for PMN review ar e described above in Unit III.C.1. c. SNUR rationale. As explained in the December 84 notice, EPA recognizes that any approach to defining \"new\" microorganisms, including the one described in Unit III.C.1, excludes some types of microorganisms from PMN review and therefore may not address some significant potential risks. EPA believe s there is one currently identifiable category of microorganisms that is not being treated as \"new\" under TSCA at this time but that should be reviewed before environmental rel ease. That category includes pathogens and microorganisms that contain genetic material from pathogens (henceforth, both are referred to collectively as \"pathogens\"). As explained in more detail in Unit I, the Agency believes it is necessary to review pathogens released to the environment because of their ability to cause disease in microbes, plants, animals, and humans. EPA intends to take a slightly different regu latory approach with nonengineered pathogens. The Agency will not require SNUR reporting on the use of nonengineered pathogens until they are to be used on more than 10 acres of land, or some equivalent standard (to be determined) for uses where acreage is an inappropriate standard (e.g. aquatic or subterranean uses). The reason for this excep tion is explained in Un it I.D., \"Rationale for Approach.\" To avoid duplicative requirements with USDA, EPA will exclude pathogens used solely for agricultural purposes from the scope of its SNUR, USDA permits to use such microorganisms are mandatory, while EPA revi ew would be discretionary because these are not \"new\" microorganisms. However, new environmental applications of pathogens for non-agricultural purposes will be subject to EPA review as significant new uses, and will in some cases also be subject to USDA oversight (if they are plant or animal pests under the USDA definition). In such cases, USDA's review will primarily be for the purpose of detecting potential adverse agricultural effects, while EPA's review will focus on the potential non-agricultural impacts. See Unit I.E. for an explanation of how the agencies will work together to coordinate their review. EPA is considering whether it should also include provisions in the SNUR requiring notification prior to small-scale releases or commercial uses of other categories of microorganisms besides pathogens. For exam ple, some people have expressed concern over nonindigenous microorganisms, and ot hers have expressed concern over microorganisms that degrade structural component s of nature such as lignin and cellulose. Members of neither category are subject to PMN when the microorganisms involved are naturally occurring or intra-generic (not ne w), and they would not be subject to the provisions for pathogens desc ribed above. However, they may present certain risks because they are new to the environment in which they are used or because of their degradative capabilities. The literature contains much documen tation of the adverse effects that have occasionally been caused by nonindi genous microorganisms such as the chestnut blight fungus and Dutch Elm disease fungus. Th ere is, on the other hand, very little known about many degradative microorganisms and their potential for adve rse effects. The Agency will request comments on these c oncerns when it issues its proposed SNUR. d. Guidelines for voluntary compliance. The SNUR that EPA will propose will describe, in detail, the parsons who will be subject to the rule and the microorganisms and activities for which significant new use reporting will be required. In the meantime, EPA strongly encourages persons who are planning to manufacture, import, or process pathogenic microorganisms for non-agricultural, new enviro nmental uses, except those used solely for agricultural purposes, to report their activities to the Agency and to provide information similar to that required for a PMN for a new microorganism. For purposes of voluntary reporting, persons may use the following definitions and assumptions. These guidelines may be changed in the proposed and final forms of the SNUR. (1) How to know if a use would be considered a significant new use. For purposes of voluntary reporting, the Ag ency encourages people to be as comprehensive as possible and to consider that any new, non-agri cultural rele ase of a pathogen to the environment is appropriate to report. \"Environm ental release\" is defined in Unit IV.D, this definition should be used in the interim until the SNUR is final. Cases that may not be entirely clear, e.g., use in waste wate r treatment plants and use in mines or oil wells, should be re ported until the Agency provides further guidance. Many microorganisms that are pathogens or that contain genetic material from pathogens are being used in the environmen t already. For example, specific naturally occurring pathogens are used for waste treatment purposes an d are tested in non- contained experiments. These applications of these specific microorganisms cannot be considered significant \"new\" uses because they are ongoing. Therefore, persons now using pathogens in environmental applica tions will not be expected to notify the Agency of such uses of these pathogens, except for informational purposes (see Unit III.C.4). In developing the proposed and final rule, the Agency will have to determine exactly which types of uses should be considered si gnificant new uses, ta king into account that the purpose of the rule is to ensure the Agency has the opportunity to review releases of pathogens that could entail si gnificant exposure or risk to the environment or the public. Considerations relating to the appropria te scope of the rule will be discussed in the proposed SNUR, and the public will be invited to comment. (2) How to know if a micr oorganism is a pathogen. Unit IV.B of this notice cont ains the definition of \"pathogen\" that the Agency will use for purposes of administering TSCA and FIFRA, and provides guidance on how to determine if a microorganism is a pathogen. (3) How to know if a microorganism is genetically engineered. As discussed in Unit III.C.2.c, EPA will not require nonengineered pathogens to be reported until they are used on more than 10 ac res of land (or some equivalent standard, not yet determined, for uses where acreage is an inappropriate standard). For now, a pathogen should be considered nonengineered if there has be en no deliberate attempt to promote genetic changes. Any human intervention beyond removal from the environment and selection for the desired va riant populations should be considered to result in an engineered microorganism. (4) Submitting the significant new use notice. Persons subject to the SNUR will have to not ify the Agency at least 90 days prior to any new, non-agricultural use involving environmental release of engineered pathogens. The Agency will treat nonengi neered pathogens slightly differently; producers of nonengineered pathogens will be subject to significant new use notification 90 days prior to new uses invol ving environmental applications on more than 10 acres of land. Significant new use notifications for microorganisms should contain the same general types of information as PMN submissions for microorganisms. In all cases, SNUR no tice submitters should initiate prenotice consultations with EPA well in advance of the actual submission, to expedite the Agency's review of the notice. e. Significant new use notice review. EPA reviews of significant new uses of mi croorganisms will be conducted in a fashion similar to PMN reviews of microorganisms. The review must be completed in 90 days, extendable for good cause to 180 days. In conducting the review, EPA will use Agency and non-Agency scientists selected fo r their expertise on issues rele vant to the specific cases. The Agency recognizes that various environmenta l uses of different types of pathogens pose very different levels of potenti al risk to human health and th e environment. For example, risks should generally be lower when pathoge ns are applied in areas distant from host organisms; the manufacturer has used nonpat hogenic strains of a pathogenic species; transferred genes are for a trait not directly invo lved in pathogenicity; the pathogenic source organisms have very narrow host ranges; and pathogenic genes have been deleted. Because it recognizes these variations in risk, the Agency expects to subject some pathogenic microorganisms to more rigorous regulatory oversight than others. 3. Research and development (R&D) exemption\u2014 a. Overview. TSCA section 5(h)(3) exempts from PMN a nd SNUR notification requirements chemical substances manufactured in sma ll quantities solely for R&D. However, to ensure adequate review prior to environmental release, EPA intends to require persons developing \"new\" microorganisms and certain engineered pathoge ns to notify EPA prior to any research involving environmental release. This will be accomplished by amending the PMN rule (and possibly the general SNUR rules in 40 CFR Part 721) to specify th at field testing of microorganisms does not fall within the definitio n of \"small quantities\" for R&D. Until the necessary rule changes implementing this policy are final, EPA expects submitters to comply with this policy voluntarily. Notice subm itters are advised to consult the Agency if they are unsure whether a part icular test is subject. b. Background. As explained in the December 84 notice (at page 50891), section 5(h )(3) of TSCA exempts from PMN requirements new chemical substances produced \"only in small quantities solely for purposes of research and developm ent.\" (\"Small quantities\" must be defined by rule.) The same exemption applies to substanc es produced for significant new uses. If this exemption as now defined were applied to living microorganisms, many microorganisms would go unreviewed by EPA until perhaps ye ars after their initial testing in the environment. Because microorganisms can reproduce in the environment and have the potential to exhibit new traits, this has raised the question of whethe r these field tests for R&D purposes could present significan t risks that would go unreviewed. Because of this concern, an important issu e for EPA in implementing the biotechnology program has been whether to alter the R&D exemption of TSCA section 5 notice requirements in the case of living microorganism s. EPA requested and received substantial public comments on this issue, which it considered carefully in developing this policy. The comments and EPA's response to them are described in the EPA \"Response to Comments\" document, available as part of the public record of this EPA notice. c. Rationale. The PMN rule definition of \"small quantities\" for R&D has been appropriate for most chemicals subject to TSCA because of th e assumption that chemical R&D generally involves limited exposure and therefore limited ri sk. In the case of field tests involving living microorganisms, this assumption will not always apply. Microorganisms that survive may reproduce, potentially leading to si gnificant exposure and risks. Because of their ability to reproduce a nd therefore increase beyond the amount originally released, living microorganisms used in the environment cannot be considered to meet the commonly understood meaning of \"small quantities\" for research and development, and thus do not qualify for the exemption. d. Implementation. To implement the change in the R&D exemption, EPA intends to amend the PMN rule (40 CFR 720.3(cc) and 720.36) and possibly the SNUR general provisions in 40 CFR Part 720. The amendments will specify when a microorganism is considered not to qualify for the R&D exemption, and will provide enforceab le standards for that determination. Until the R&D rule amendments are final, EPA expects commercial researchers intending to release new, living microorganisms and engineered pathogens into the environment to report their activities to the Agency as explained in the units on PMN and SNUR notification (Units III. C.1 and 2). In addition, EPA strongl y encourages researchers, prior to the time of reporting, to main tain records regarding containm ent procedures used in their experiments. Researchers should use the definition of \"environmental release\" provided in Unit IV.D as a guide, ask EPA for further guidan ce if questions arise, and in general be as inclusive as possible in their estim ation of what should be reported. e. Noncommercial R&D. Noncommercial R&D is exempt from section 5 of TSCA under sec tion 5(g) and would therefore be exempt from PMN and SNUR requirements even under the proposed amendments. EPA has defined \"noncommercial\" for all chemical s ubstances subject to TSCA section 5 in a final rule published in the Federal Register of April 22, 1986 (51 FR 15096). As a general guide, R&D done by a co mmercial company should be considered commercial, and purely academic R&D should be considered noncommercial. For more specific guidance, the reader should examine th e definition of \"noncommercial\" in the final rule and the discussion of \" noncommercial\" in the proposed PMN rule revisions published in the Federal Register of December 27, 1984 (49 CFR 50208). Readers should also note that the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) and USDA Agriculture Biotechnology Recombinant DNA Advisory Co mmittee (ABRAC) have jurisdiction over many noncommercial R&D activities, specifica lly recombinant DNA experimentation at institutions that receive funds from NIH a nd USDA. Both of these committees encourage submission of experiments from other sources as well. 4. General information reporting requirements\u2014 a. Overview. EPA intends to collect general information prior to the environmental use of microorganisms that are subject to TSCA, but th at are not the subject of premanufacture or significant new use notification requirements. EPA will gather such information by means of a section 8(a) reporting rule. The inform ation EPA collects will primarily be used to monitor environmental uses of microorganism s, thus making the Agency aware of cases that may require special regulatory action under other TSCA authorities. It will also be used to help the Agency evaluate and modify the scope of its biotechnology programs over time. b. Section 8(a) background. Section 8(a) of TSCA authorizes EPA to issu e rules requiring manufacturers, importers and processors of specified chemical substances to submit information to the Agency. TSCA section 8(a)(2) authorizes the Agency to obtain a broad range of data, including information on chemical identity and struct ure, production, use, e xposure, disposal, and health and environmental effects. Small manufacturers, importers, and processors, as defined by EPA, are exempt from section 8( a) reporting and recordkeeping requirements, with certain statutory exceptions. c. Rationale for section 8(a) rule. As explained in the overview to the EPA por tion of this notice, the biotechnology review procedures described in this notice are intended to focus on the current areas of highest priority based on considerations of risk and on determinations about what makes a microorganism \"new.\" However, there is a rela tively high degree of scientific uncertainty involved in establishing these priorities at this early stage in the development of the biotechnology industry. The Agency cannot sa y definitively that all the microorganisms and uses that are not at this time subject to notification requirements will never need to be regulated or should never be subject to notification requirements in the future. EPA believes that TSCA section 8(a) is th e best mechanism available for determining whether specific microorganisms or categorie s of microorganisms not subject to PMN or SNUR notice requirements may need to be regulated. The Agency must be aware of how microorganisms are being used in the environment to fulfill its responsibility to identify and prevent important or immediate hazards th at might unexpectedly arise with specific uses. The section 8(a) repor ting with also provide EPA w ith necessary information to assess whether its overall prioriti es with regard to biotechno logy regulation have been, in fact, appropriately set and wh ether they should change over time. As was pointed out by many comments on the Agency's first proposed statement on biotechno logy, flexibility and incorporation of new information should be major components of any regulatory scheme. d. Implementation\u2014 (1) Who will have to report under section 8(a)? When promulgated, EPA intends for this rule to apply to manufacturers, importers, and processors of microorganisms that are subject to TSCA and to be released in the environment, but are not othe rwise reviewed under the PMN and SNUR policies described earlier. In other words, general informati on will be required pr ior to environmental releases of all microorganism s that are subject to TSCA and that are non-engineered pathogens, or that are intra-generic or naturally occurring non-pathogens. Although the rule will apply in general to the above groups, small manufacturers, importers, and processors are usually ex empt from section 8(a) reporting and recordkeeping requirements. EPA has establ ished general exemption standards for small manufacturers (40 CFR Part 704). The Agency will consider whether these standards should be retained or altered in some way to reflect considerations particular to the biotechnology industry. When EPA issues its notice of proposed rulemaking, the public will have an opportunity to comment on the question of who will have to report under the rule. (2) What information will have to be reported under section 8(a)? EPA is in the process of cons idering exactly what informati on it will propose to require on microbial products and uses under the secti on 8(a) reporting rule. In deciding what information should be reported on microorganisms, EPA will consider what information is necessary for the Agency to assess the safety of planned environmental releases, to evaluate its biotechnology regula tions over time, and to consider necessary and appropriate improvements. The Agency will also consider the economic impact of special information and whether the information is generally \" known to or reasonably ascertainable by\" potential respondents to the rule. 5. Reporting of information on substantial risks. All manufacturers, processors, and distributo rs of microbial products subject to TSCA, including those involved in rese arch and development, are reminded of their responsibility to notify EPA immediately of any new informati on which \"reasonably supports the conclusion that such substance or mixture presents a s ubstantial risk of injury to health or the environment\" (TSCA section 8(e)). Guidance on the section 8(e) re quirement was published in the Federal Register of March 16, 1978 (43 FR 11110). Manufacturers, processors, and distributors will find that this policy statement provides general gui dance on TSCA section 8(e) reporting, but it should not be considered exhaustive in terms of the types of information th at would reasonably support a conclusion of substantial risk. Specifically with regard to microorganisms, the types of information that should be reported include but are not limited to (1) pathogenicity to humans, plants, animals, or microbes, (2) sign ificant ability to displace other organisms in the intended use area, (3) significan t potential to transfer genetic material to other organisms, and (4) any other significant potential to cause harm to human health or the environment. Manufacturers, processors, and distributors s hould be vigilant a nd immediately report substantial risk information concer ning microorganisms subject to TSCA. 6. Exemptions from premanufacture notification requirements. Section 5(h)(4) of TSCA allows EPA, by rule, to exempt from PMN requirements chemical substances that it finds will not present unreasonable risks. EPA expects to use this authority, where appropriate, to reduce the burden of PMN reporting requirements. In its December 84 notice (at page 50891), EP A asked for comment on the issue of whether certain microorganisms or categories of microorganisms should be exempt from PMN requirements under the authority of section 5(h )(4) of TSCA. Ten res pondents stated that microorganisms used in closed systems should be exempt under the 5(h)(4) provision, although several specifically remarked that appr opriate biological a nd physical containment conditions should first be determined and met. Others suggested modifications to this approach, such as expedited reviews or reduced information requirements rather than outright exemption, or application of the exemption onl y to specific microorganisms or substances (e.g., E. coli. used in contained systems.). On e commenter stated that an exemption was not appropriate because there is no current Federal au thority to determine safety in the event of accidental release. Under TSCA, the PMN policy described in Unit III.C.1 extends to commercial-scale, closed system used of microorganisms as well as envi ronmental releases. Th e statute requires that all manufacturers of \"new\" substances must submit PMNs, regardless of whether they are used in contained facilities or open environments. Nonetheless, EPA believes that closed-system uses of new microorganisms will ofte n present lower risks than environmental releases of the same organisms. The containe d uses may therefore warrant a section 5(h)(4) exemption, and EPA is hereby announcing it s intent to pursue that possibility. Since the Agency does not yet have sufficient information to make the necessary finding under section 5(h)(4) that such activities \"will no t present an unreasonabl e risk of injury to human health or the environment,\" it is soliciti ng more data to support that finding in the case of closed system uses. The Agency would appreciate receiving data that would support an exemption either for all inter-generic microorgani sms used in closed systems, or for specific categories of such microbes. For example, a category that has been suggested for exemption is inter-generic combinations involving mi croorganisms that exchange DNA by known physiologic processes, and that are on the NIH RAC exchanger list. Th is possible exclusion is mentioned in the OSTP preamble published in this Federal Register. Information and data relevant to this issue shoul d be sent to EPA at th e address listed at the beginning of this notice. In addition to supporting the use of section 5(h)(4) exemptions, the Agency will try to identify categories of microorganisms that pos e lower risk even though they may not meet the necessary findings for exemption. In such cases, the Agency will consider reducing the burden of PMN reporting by lowering the info rmation requirements a ssociated with the PMN, and by conducting expedited reviews. Th e Agency requests any data or information that could be used to support ex emptions or expedited reviews. IV. Definitions of Terms for Regulatory Purposes As explained in the previous units of this notice, EPA intends at this time to focus its regulatory programs on microorganisms contai ning genetic material from dissimilar source organisms (defined as organisms from different genera ), pathogenic microorganisms, microorganisms containing genetic material from pathoge ns, nonindigenous microorganisms, and TSCA nonagricultural environmental applications. App licable requirements are described in Units II and III of this notice. The purpose of this unit is to provide detailed information on how a person should determine whether a specific product is a pathogen, contains ge netic material from a pathogen, contains genetic mate rial from organisms of different genera (intergeneric combination), is nonindigenous, is released to th e environment, or is used for nonagricultural TSCA purposes. A. How To Determine if a Product Is an Inter-Generic Combination For purposes of implementing its concept of \"new\" microorganisms, the Agency is defining \"new\" microorganisms as those formed by deliber ate combinations of genetic material from organisms of different genera. This standard is purposely based on the taxonom ic designations of microorganisms. While imperfect in many ways, taxonomy appears to provide the best available standard for \"dissimilarity\" among organisms, for the following reasons: 1. Although subject to periodic revision within the scientific commun ity, taxonomy is a common language used by scientists to describe how organisms are similar and dissimilar (Refs. 4, 18). 2. Taxonomy reflects the most recent scientific observations about phenotypic and genotypic differences between organisms. 3. Taxonomy provides a universally available point of reference that can be understood by industry and enforced by the Agency. 4. EPA expects microorganisms being used in biotechnology research and development will have or can be assigned clear taxonomic de signations; therefore, the use of taxonomic standards imposes few if and addi tional requirements on industry. 5. There is a significant admini strative advantage to independently established criteria such as taxonomic standards, because EPA will not have to create and maintain a separate set of criteria for regulatory purposes. The Agency expects all manufact urers to know or determine the currently accepted designations (genus, species) of the source organisms they have used in producing microbial products subject to FIFRA and TSCA. In addition, EPA expect s submitters to use taxonomic literature and taxonomic experts, if necessary, to determine th e correct identify of th eir microorganisms. A number of commenters on the December 84 notice stated that organisms manipulated by modern genetic engineering will in most cases already be well characterized. This fact should make implementation of this policy relatively easy in most cases. Excluded from this policy on intergeneric combinat ions are microorganisms that have resulted from the addition of inter-generic material th at is well-characterize d and contains only non- coding regulatory regions such as operators, prom oters, origins of replication, terminators, and ribosome binding regions. \"Well-characterized, non-coding regulatory regions\" means that the producer of the microorganism can document the following: a. The exact nucleotide base sequences of the regulatory re gion and any inserted flanking nucleotides. b. The regulatory region and any in serted flanking nucleotides do not code for protein, peptide, or functional RNA molecules. c. The regulatory region solely controls the activ ity of other regions that code for protein or peptide molecules or act as recognition sites for the initiation of nuc leic acid or protein synthesis. EPA emphasizes that this policy excludes only in ter-generic combinations that have resulted solely from the addition of well-characterized, non-coding regulatory regions. If the final microorganism contains any regions from organi sms of other genera that do not meet this restriction, such as coding regulatory regions or any poorly characterized regions, the microorganisms is considered new and does not come under the exclusion for regulatory regions discussed above. To document these features, EPA expects that comp anies will use sources such as citations to published scientific literature , copies of unpublished studies relied upon, or data from tests performed to determine th e above characteristics. If persons do not know the genera of particular organisms, they should consult standard sources such as the following: i. Bacteria (1) Skerman, V.B.D., V. McGowan, and P.H.A. Sneath. 1980.

If the taxonomic positions of source organisms ar e ambiguous or if the boundaries of a genus are in dispute, the Agency expects the subm itter to be aware of these controversies. Ambiguities at the species level or lower will not affect the FIFRA and TSCA policies. However, if the taxonomy at the genus level is controversial, such th at organisms may be considered by some to belong to the same genus and by others to belong to different genera, the submitter must comply with the applicable requirements of FIFRA or TSCA, or come to EPA for a case-specific determination (address pr ovided at the beginning of this notice). In general, submitters should expect that microorganisms will be considered inter-generic of the taxonomy of either source organism, at the genus level, is controversial. In the case of chemically synthesized genes, th e Agency will follow a similar principle. The genetic sequence of the synthesized gene may be identical to a sequence known to occur in an organism in the same genus as the reci pient microorganism will be considered intra- generic. However, the producer should be prepared to document how it made this determination. Conversely, the sequence of the synthesized gene may be different or not known to be identical to a sequence in the genus of the recipient microorganism. In this case, the resulting product will be considered inter-generic. EPA's definition of inter-generic combinations contains a standard of intent on the part of the manufacturer or producer. Inte r-generic combinations that o ccur as unintentional byproducts of microorganisms coming in contact with one a nother will not be consid ered subject to the provisions of TSCA and FIFRA that apply to inter-generic combinations. For example, inter-generic combinations may occur at very low frequencies if microorganisms from different genera are applied to the same plot of land, or are sold together as mixtures. Similarly, if manufacturers deve lop microorganisms that are natu rally infected with viruses, and if the developer did not intend to prom ote and did not provide conditions actively promoting the infection of the microorganisms with the naturally occurring viruses, then the microorganisms containing naturaly occurring inter-generic combina tions would not be considered inter-generic under the FIFRA and TSCA policies. On the other hand, if the manufacturer or producer intentionally provides conditions to promote genetic transfer, or if inter-generic microorganisms are primary components of a product or mixture, then the microorganisms will be considered inter-generic and subject to the applicable provisio ns of FIFRA and TSCA. Submitters should consult the Agency if they have any questions about these distinctions. B. How to Determine if a Product Is a Pathogen For the purposes of this policy, a pathogen is define d as a virus or organism [including its viruses and plasmids, if any) that has the ability to cause disease in other living organisms (i.e., humans, antimals, plants, or microorganisms). A disease is an abnormal physio logical function in an organism, occurring as a consequence of the activity of proliferating microorganisms directly associated with or infecting the host organism, or due to biologically active substances such as toxins, antibiotics, or growth regulators produ ced by a microorganism (Refs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 19). This policy is not meant to include such organisms as competitors or colonizers of the same substrates, commensalistic or mutualistic microor ganisms, or opportunistic pathogens. However, if a microorganism has more than one mechanism for affecting other organisms and one of these is pathogenicity, then the microorganism is considered to be a pathogen. A microorganism will be subject to EPA policies regarding pathogens if: 1. The organism belongs to a pathogenic species or to a species containing pathogenic strains, according to sources identified by EPA below, or from information known to the producer that suggests that the organism is a pathoge n; excepted are organism s belonging to a strain used for laboratory research or commercial purposes and generally recognized as non- pathogenic according to sources identified by EPA, or inform ation known to the producer and EPA; an example of a nonpathogenic strain of a pathogenic species is Escherichia coli K-12; examples of nonpathogenic spec ies are Bacillus subtilis, Lo catobacillus ac idophilus, and Saccharomyces species; or, 2. The organism has been derived from a pathogen or has been deliberately engineered such that it contains genetic material from a pathogeni c organism as defined in item 1, above. An exception to this requirement is a genetically engineered organism developed by transferring well-characterized, non-coding regulatory regions from a pathogenic donor to a nonpathogenic recipient. \"Well-characterized, non-coding regulatory region\" means that the producer of the microorganism can document the following: a. The exact nucleotide base sequences of the regulatory re gion and any inserted flanking nucleotides. b. The regulatory region and any in serted flanking nucleotides do not code for protein, peptide, or functional RNA molecules. c. The regulatory region solely control the activ ity of other regions that code for protein or peptide molecules or act as recognition sites for the initiation of nuc leic acid or protein synthesis. To document these items, EPA expects that comp anies will use sources such as citations to published scientific literature, copies of unpublished studies, or data from tests performed to determine the above characteristics. The Agency is excluding genetically engineered organisms containing ma terial from pathogens if the material transferred is from a pathogenic donor to a nonpathogenic r ecipient, and consists solely of well-characterized, non-codi ng regulatory regions. In this case, the transferred material does not code for traits directly associated with pathogenicity. The Agency believes that these organisms do not pose significant risks because they do not possess new combinations of traits or pathogenic traits, but instead exhi bit quantitative changes in preex isting traits in a nonpathogenic recipient. The Agency is excluding opportunistic pathogens for two reasons. First, in terms of risk priorities, outright pathogens are of significantly greater concern than or ganisms that would not act as pathogens except under unusual circumstances . Second, because of the very large number of microorganisms that could be considered to be opportunistic, th eir inclusion would result in an inappropriately restrictive policy. There are a number of standard sources that can be used to determine whether a microorganism belongs to a pathogenic species. EPA is compili ng a list of such sources, and is considering developing a list of pathogenic species, as part of future rulemaking activities. As interim guidance, persons should consider sources such as the following: (1) Anne, W., ed. 1980. Fish Diseases. Springer-Verlag, New York. (2) Anver, M.R. and C. Pond. 1984.

The Agency expects that producers will be sufficien tly familiar with the relevant literature and the species of the microorganisms under developmen t that the pathogenicity or lack of it will already be known. Therefore, the Agency does not believe that determining whether a microorganism belongs to a pathogenic species based on published sources will be burdensome. Where there is disagreement among sources abou t whether a strain belongs to a pathogenic species, the submitter must assume that it belongs to a pathogenic species, or come to EPA for a case-specific determination (address provided at the be ginning of this notice). As part of further rulemaking, the Agency plan s to develop a list of nonpathogenic strains of pathogenic species, in addition to E. coli K-12, th at will be exempt from Agency policies for pathogenic microorganisms. In th e interim, if a submitter is using a strain that belongs to a pathogenic species, except E. coli K-12, the subm itter should assume that it is pathogenic. Because of the pathogenic potential of most, if not all, viruses, and because the species concept does not generally apply in virus taxonomy, the Agency will consider any product that is or contains genetic material from a virus to be a pathogen. The Agency intends to update this guidance periodically, particularly th e list of publications. C. How To Determine if a Product Is a Nonindigenous Microorganism A microorganism will be considered nonindigenous to any one of the geographic areas listed below if it is isolated from outside that area: 1. The continental United States, including Al aska, and the immediatel y adjoining countries (i.e., Canada and Mexico). 2. The Hawaiian Islands. 3. The Caribbean Islands including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For example, a microorganism from Hawaii, deve loped for use as a microbial pesticide in the continental U.S., will be considered to be nonindi genous to the continental United States. Under FIFRA, the Agency would therefore be notified be fore initiation of small- scale field testing of the microbial pesticide in the continental U.S. In normal usage, nonindigenous organisms are gene rally considered to be naturally occurring organisms placed in environments where they are not native or have not evolved. This concept means that a microorganism could be considered nonindigenous to an ecosystem that is adjacent to the one in which it evolved, nonindigenous to ecosystems far removed, or even indigenous to nearby or far-removed ecosystems. This happens for a number of reasons such as the widely varying effects of geographic barriers as isolat ing mechanisms; microbial dispersal mechanisms; and the biological, chemical, and physical features shaping diffe rent environments. Given the complexity and impracticality of determining wh ether a particular microorganism is indigenous to a wide range of habitats that may exist with in regions and states, th e Agency has selected continental boundaries to describe geographic regions that are clearl y isolated and are easily used for administrative purposes. These boundaries will be used to determine whether a microorganism is nonindigenous and hence subjec t to particular provisions under FIFRA (see Unit II). D. How To Determine if a Product Is Released to the Environment In the future, it is likely that a definition of environmental rele ase will be developed. In the interim, the Agency's approach will focus on when a microorganism is considered to be contained rather than when it is released. A microorganism will be considered environmentally contained if the microorganism is used in a laboratory that complies with NIH RAC guidelines; or the microorganism is used in a contained greenhouse, fermented, or other contained stru cture. In general, \"contained greenhouse, fermented, or other contained structure\" means a bu ilding or structure that has a roof and walls. It should also have a ventilati on system to minimize microbial re lease to the outdoors, a system for sterilizing water runoff and wastes, and a system for restricting insects, if any of these are plausible routes for dissemination of microorga nisms. Experimenters should control pests, sterilize soil or other material containing microorganisms before di sposal or reuse, and generally limit access only to those persons who must have access for research purposes. E. How to Determine if a Product Is Used for Nonagricultural Purposes An agricultural use of a microorganism is any us e or application, the primary purpose of which is to produce, enhance, or cultivate plants or animals. The definition is not meant to include pesticides. F. Definition of Plants and Animals For the purposes of this EPA notice, plants are defined as multicellular organisms characterized by eukaryotic cell wells, photosynthetic ability, and embryonic development. Members include mosses, liverworts, and vascular plants (including most terrestrial crop plants). Animals are defined as multicellular organisms composed of eukaryotic cells with ingestive nutrition and lacking rigid cell walls and photosyn thetic ability. Members include coelenterates, flatworms, molluscs, segmented worms, arthropods, echinoderms, and vertebrates. V.

Introduction The USDA portion of the \"Proposal for a Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology\" (hereafter referred to as the December 3u, 1984 Notice) appeared at 49 FR 50897-50904. As a part of its policy perspective, USDA stated th at agriculture and forestry products developed by biotechnology will not diffe r fundamentally from conventional products and that the existing regulatory framewor k is adequate to regulate biotechnology. USDA has both research and regulatory respons ibilities for biotechnology activities. This document provides significant new information in both areas. Section II describes 1985 Federal Register notices concerning USDA policies and responsibilities for biotechnology. Included in this discussion is an explanation of the assignment of responsibilities within USDA for the oversight of USDA funded research and for the regulation of the products of biotechnology. An understanding of the way in which USDA has divi ded these responsibilitie s should prove helpful to those in the private sector seeking review and/or approval of bi otechnology applications. A new section III has been added describing USDA's policy for agricultural biotechnology research. USDA is publishing as a compani on document, USDA Guidelines for Biotechnology Research that will closely para llel the NIH Guidelines. The USDA guidelines will be issued under the authority of the F ood Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198). This Act amended section 1404(2) of the National Agriculture Research, Extens ion, and Teaching Policy Act (NARETPA). The Amendment gave the Secretary of Agriculture responsibility for establishing \"appropriate controls with re spect to the development and use of the application of biotechnology to agriculture.\" Al l USDA funded agriculture biotec hnology research or research conducted at an entity receiving USDA funds w ould be subject to the USDA Guidelines for Biotechnology Research unless the specific research project is supported by and subject to the guidelines or regulations of a nother Federal agency. These Gu idelines would encompass all phases of agricultural biotechnology research, i. e. (1) Contained laboratory experiments; (2) specialized isolation research (e.g., greenhouse, biotron); and (3) environmental research release (e.g., controlled and segregated field plots). USDA hopes that entities not required to comply with the Guidelines would voluntarily adhere to the requirements. To encourage compliance, USDA proposes to adopt the NIH policy of provi ding the researchers not required to comply with these Guidelines the opportunity to have their new biotechnology research proposals reviewed by USDA. Those entities covered by the USDA Guidelin es for Biotechnology Rese arch would also be required to comply with any applicable statutes such as those set forth in section IV of this document, and any regulatory issues thereunder. The Secretary of Agriculture has established an Office of Agriculture Biotechnology (OAB), which will have primary responsibility for implementing and coordinating the Department's policies and procedures pertaini ng to all facets of biotechnology. This in cludes the conduct of laboratory and field research, experimenta tion on biotechnology products prior to their commercialization, and all matters of oversight of biotechnology in agriculture. The new office will report to the Assistant Secretary for Scien ce and Education through the authority provided in the amendment to the Food Secu rity Act of 1985. The Assistant Secretary for Science and Education will seek to establ ish an Agriculture Biotechnology Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (ABRAC) and shall continue the respons ibilities for agriculture formerly handled by the NIH-RAC during the last 10 years. The OAB shall operate in a close parallel manner to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activi ties (ORDA) of the National In stitutes of Health. This includes the responsibilit y of the ABRAC and the implementa tion of the USDA Guidelines for Biotechnology Research. The NIH system is we ll respected both domestically and worldwide, and has achieved a high degree of efficiency in ac hieving broad confidence in the safety of new biological research conduc ted under its requirements. The OAB also will serve as a focal point fo r coordinating a National Biological Impact Assessment Program, which is to evaluate and m onitor the potential impacts of biotechnological processes and products on safety and the environment. Section IV contains USDA's re gulatory policy statements for ve terinary biological products, plants and plant products, meat a nd poultry products, and seeds. USDA stated in the December 31, 1984 Notice that while its existing regulatory framework is ad equate, it would constantly reevaluate its regulatory position and should additional regulatory measures become necessary, amend its regulations (49 FR 50904). For veterinary biologicals regulated under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act (VSTA), USDA has identifie d three categories which may be derived by recombinant DNA techniques or developed from hybridomas. The categories are based on biological characteristics and safety concerns, and are described fully in section IV(A). The first category consists of inactivated recombinant DNA- derived vaccines, bacter ins, bacterin-toxoids, virus subunits, or bacterial subunits, as well as monoclonal products. This category presents no new or unusual safety or environmental concerns . The second category includes those products containing live microorganisms that have been modified by the a ddition or deletion of one or more genes. Such products will be evaluated under current regul atory policies and procedures to assure that the addition or de letion of specific genetic inform ation does not impart increased virulence, pathogenicity, or surv ival advantages. The third category included products using live vectors to carry recombinant derived forei gn genes for immunizing antigens and/or other immune stimulants. Characterist ics of safety and transmission must be established fully before questions and concerns dealing with safety to hum ans, animals, and release into the environment can be answered and before such products can be considered for licensing . Section IV(A) also includes new information about revised USDA re view procedures for the importation of cell cultures and hybridomas. A brief discussion is included about the proposed regulations implementing the provisions of the amendments to the VSTA contained in the Food Security Act of 1985. For organisms and products derived by the techniques of genetic engineering, USDA is proposing new rules to regulate organisms which are plant pests or whic h there is reason to believe are plant pests. It is USDA's policy to regulate certain genetical ly engineered organisms if the donor, vector/vector agent, or recipient organism is a memb er of a group of organisms that are known to contain plant pests, or if based on experience, USDA determin es that a genetically engineered organism or product is a plant pest or if USDA has reason to believe that a genetically engineered organism or product is a plant pest. The proposed regulations are summarized in section IV(B). The USDA policy for regulating meat and poul try products and seeds derived through biotechnology remains substantially as stated in the December 31, 1984 Notice, and appears in section IV (C) and (D). A new section (V) has been added describing the sc ientific review mechanisms to be established by USDA to assist USDA Agencies in biotechno logy research and regulatory decision-making. USDA has established a Committee on Biotechno logy in Agriculture (CBA) chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Science and Education and the Assistant Secretary for Marketing and Inspection Services. A detailed summary of comments on the December 31, 1984 Notice and USDA responses appears as section VI. The comments are organi zed to conform to the form of the December 31, 1984 Notice, with general comments and responses on the USDA regulatory philosophy followed by comments and responses on specific aspects of USDA's regulatory structure. II. Notices Three Federal Register notices concerning the Depa rtment's biotechnology related activities have been published subsequent to public ation of the December 31, 1984 Notice. On July 19, 1985, a document amending the delegations of authority of USDA to assign responsibility for these Research and regulatory activities (7 CF R Part 2) was published in the Federal Register (50 FR 29367-29368). In this document, the Secretary of Agriculture delegated responsib ility to the Assistant Secretary for Marketing and Inspection Services to coordi nate the development and carrying out of all matters and functions pertaining to the Department's regulation of biotechnology and to act as liaison on all matters and functions pertaini ng to the regulation to biotechnology between agencies within the Department and between the Department and government and private organizations. These responsibilities were furt her delegated from the Assistant Secretary for Marketing and Inspection Services to the Admi nistrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Also in this document, the Secretary of Agricu lture delegated responsib ility to the Assistant Secretary for Science and Education to coordi nate the development a nd carrying out of all matters and functions pertaining to agricultural research invo lving biotechnology conducted or funded by the Department including the develo pment and implementation of guidelines for oversight of research activities, and to act as liaison on all matters and functions pertaining to agricultural research in biotechnology between ag encies within the Department and between the Department and other governmental, e ducational and private organizations.1 1 The Assistant Secretary for Science and Education oversees the research activities of the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the Cooperative State Research Service (CSRS), the Extension Service (ES), and the Office of Grants and Program Systems (OGPS). The Assistant Secretary for Marketing and Inspecting Services oversees the regulatory activities of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), which includes Veterina ry Services (VS) and Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ); the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS); and the Food Safety a nd Inspection Service (FSIS). The policies and procedures of these agencies for biotechnology were described in the US DA portion of the coordinated pol icy statement at 49 FR 50899- 50904 On September 23, 1985, USDA's APHIS published a not ice which contained its policy statement and requirements for the control and protection of documents that contain confidential business information concerning biotechnology and the veterinary biologics program (50 FR 38561- 38563). On November 14, 1985, the Office of Science an d Technology Policy published a notice in the Federal Register announcing the establishmen t of the Biotechnology Science Coordinating Committee (BSCC) (50 FR 47174-47195) . This Committee is to serve as an interagency forum for coordinating science issues related to research and commercial applications of biotechnology. The notice also stated that USDA will establ ish a Committee on Biotechnology in Agriculture (CBA) to assist in assuring that research and re gulatory decisions and ba sed on the best science available. III. USDA Research Policy Statement USDA supports research to promote and protect th e general health and we lfare of the people of the United States.2 Research program include: Studies on production of food and agricultural processing and marketing; identity and developm ent of new crop and animal sources of food, fiber, and energy; increased agricultural effi ciency and reduction of dependence on petroleum- based products; development of improved manageme nt and conservation of soil, water, forest, and range resources. The program s are fulfilled through State, Federal, and private industry cooperative efforts. 2 See Addendum for Research Legislative Authorities. In the areas of agricultural research relevant to biotechnology, many plant, animal, and microbial alterations have been developed for release through traditional genetic approaches such as mutagenesis and hybridization. In a complementary vein, beneficial in troduction of organisms from abroad have established a sound base for research and regulat ory oversight. The experience with these bases provides a substant ial knowledge base for co nducting evaluations of the safety and efficacy of biotechnology processes and products. USDA will evaluate the environmental impacts in the context of individual experiments that encompass the entire range of experimentation from contained facilities to open field testing. As knowledge and experience are gained, broadly a pplicable procedures and guidelines will be developed. Particular consideration will be given to the stability of engineered changes and the possibility that genetic elements might be tran sferred from one organism to another. Also important will be the development of data that will enable predictions of which organisms may become established in new ecosystems, and resulting environmental consequences. USDA considers products developed through biot echnological techniques as no different from those products resulting from research using conventional techniques providing appropriate research review is conducted with established protocols. Agricultural biotechnology research activities require appropriate review to avoid untoward e ffects on human health and the environment. USDA expects to rely on the existing network of scientific expertise in the agriculture research community. Thousands of plant selections, animal breeding lines, and microorganisms are tested annually at sites under varyi ng climatic conditions through th e Nation. This network of scientific expertise permits continual, open assessment of agricultural research and products of that research in the field. US DA has broad statutory authority to conduct and support research in wide ranging areas of agriculture. In addition to the authorities described in the matrix of Federal Laws related to biot echnology found in the Federal Re gister Notice of November 14, 1985 (50 FR 47174-47195) the Food Security Act of 1985 (Section 1404(2 ) of the National Agriculture Research, Extension, and Teachi ng Policy Act Amendments of 1985, Pub. L. No. 99-198), made the Secretary of Agriculture resp onsible for establishing \"appropriate controls with respect to the development and use of th e application of biotec hnology to agriculture.\" Through this authority, and pursuant to the Dele gation of Authority Pe rtaining to Biotechnology published in the Federal Register on July 19, 198 5 (50 FR 29367-68), the Assistant Secretary for Science and Education will complete developm ent of a national system of agricultural biotechnology research oversight in much the same manner that agriculture has been a part for the last 10 years th rough the NIH-RAC. The Assistant Secretary for Science and Educat ion has initiated the establishment of the Agriculture Biotechnology and Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (ABRAC), to be managed through an Office of Agriculture Bi otechnology (OAB) which is a parallel to the National Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (NIT-RAC) and Office of Recombinant DNA Activities (ORDA). The OAB w ill serve as the focal point for developing and coordinating USDA policies and activities pertaining to biotechnology research and will perform related interagency and public liaison functi ons. OAB will also assist in carrying out the responsibilities assigned to th e Assistant Secretary for Science and Education, including the development and implementation of policies and procedures, and guidelines for the conduct of laboratory and field research. All federally-funded agriculture biotechnology research or research conducted at an entity receiving USDA funds will be subject to the US DA Guidelines for Biotechnology Research, that are published as a companion document to this po licy statement, unless the specific research project is supported by and subject to the guidelines or regulations of a nother Federal agency. These Guidelines encompass the entire spectrum of degrees of containment in agricultural biotechnology research i.e.: (1) Contained labor atory experiments; (2) specialized isolation research (e.g., greenhouse, biotron); and (3) en vironmental research agricultural biotechnology release (e.g., controlled and segregated field plot s). Research investig ators not required to comply with USDA Guidelines will be encourag ed to follow these Guidelines. To assure consistency, USDA adopted the model establis hed by the NIH of providing such researchers with the opportunity to have their biotechnology research proposals reviewed as required by the Guidelines. The USDA Guidelines for Biotechnology Research require that research organization use the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) concept as established by NIH. This requirement assures that each research organi zation and its investigators empl oy a multidisciplinary team to assist in carrying out their res ponsibilities under the Guidelines. The IBC's, as described in the Guidelines, would consist of pers ons with relevant agricultural expertise in areas such as recombinant DNA technology, biolog ical safety, physical contai nment, and ecology. Requests for review beyond IBC should be sent to the Office of Agriculture Biotechnology (OAB) through the Assistant Secretary of Science and E ducation, Room 324-A, Administration Bldg., Washington, D.C. 20250. These Guidelines also would require complian ce with existing statutes of the USDA involving the movement of regulated organisms that require the issuance of a permit. The movement of microorganism injurious to pl ants and animals as well as the movement of certain non- indigenous plants and animals w ould continue to follow long-esta blished procedures for USDA approval. After review, a permit, if needed, may be issued that allows movement. It is the responsibility of the research sc ientists to obtain that permit. The Assistant Secretary for Science and Educat ion will complete establishment of a National Biological Impact Assessment Program (NBIAP ) as indicated in the USDA Guidelines for Biotechnology Research. NBIAP w ould serve to assist USDA in the evaluation and monitoring of biotechnology research and impact over time. Coordination of NBIAP will be provided through OAB. IV. USDA Regulatory Policy Statements The existing USDA regulatory authority for biotechnology was listed in the matrix of the December 31, 1984 Notice at 49 FR 50860-50874 a nd described in brief at 49 FR 50898-50899. The statutes considered most applicable to biotechnology app lications are the Virus-Serum- Toxin Act (VSTA) of 1913 (21 U.S.C. 151-158), the Federal Plant Pest Act (FPPA) of May 23, 1957 (7 U.S.C. 150aa-150jj), the Plant Quarantine Act (PQA) of August 20, 1912 (7 U.S.C. 151- 164, 166, 167), the Organic Act of September 21, 1944 (7 U.S.C. 147a), the Federal Noxious Weed Act (FNWA) of 1974 (7 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.) , the Federal Seed Act (FSA) (7 U.S.C. 551 et seq.), the Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) (7 U.S.C. 2321 et seq.), the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.). A. Veterinary Biological Products Under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act of 1913, 21 U.S.C. 151-158, the USDA exercises regulatory authority over all veterinary biologics imported in to the United States or shipped or delivered for shipment interstate. Recent amendments co ntained in the Food Security Act of 1985 have extended this authority to products which are shi pped intrastate or expor ted, and have given the Department additional enforcement mechanisms such as the power to detain and seize products. Under the VSTA, veterinary biologics may not be shipped or delivered for shipment if they are worthless, contaminated, dangerous, or harmful. Veterinary biological products must be prepared in a USDA-licensed establishment under regulations promulgate d by the Secretary of Agriculture. Those products which are imported into the United States must be imported under a permit issued by the Secretary. The pertinent re gulations for veterinary biologics are found in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 101 through 117. New regulations will be drafted to implement the provisions of the ame ndments to the VSTA. Such regulations will provide for a more comprehens ive regulatory scheme, including seizure and condemnation and detention procedures. They also will establish pr ocedures to be used in the issuance of special licenses and exemptions provided for by the legislative amendments. Veterinary biological products are defined in the governing re gulations, 9 CFR 101.2(w) as \"all viruses, serums, toxins, and analogous products of natural or synthetic origin, such as diagnostics, antitoxins, vaccines, live microorgani sms, killed microorganisms, and the antigenic or immunizing components of microorganisms inte nded for use in the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of diseases of animals.\" Licensing provisions for veterinary biological products and establ ishments are found in Part 102 of the USDA regulations (9 CFR Part 102). A product license requi res the satisfactory completion of various requirements to assure purity, safety, potency, and efficacy of the products. The specific requirements were discussed in the December 31, 1984 Notice at 49 FR 50899. Pursuant to \u00a7 103.3 (a) through (g) of the USDA regul ations, a person may be authorized to ship unlicensed biological products for the purpose of evaluating experiment al products by treating limited numbers of domestic animals if USDA de termines that the conditions under which the experiment is to be conducted are adequate to prevent spread of disease and approves the procedures set forth in the request for such authorization (9 CFR 103.3 (a)-(g)). Upon satisfactory completion of all requirements, including review and acceptance of labels, a U.S. Veterinary Biological Product License may be issued. The application of new biotechno logical procedures for the produc tion of veterinary biological products is expanding constant ly. For the purposes of li censing, biologics derived by recombinant DNA-techniques or developed from hybr idomas, may be classified into three broad categories. This division is ba sed upon the biological characterist ics of the new products and the safety concerns they present, and is wholly anal ogous to the approach used in other veterinary biologics. The first category includes inactivated recombin ant bacterial subunits. Th ese nonviable or killed products pose no risk to the environment and present no new or unus ual safety concerns. Monoclonal antibody (hybridoma) products used prophylactically, therapeu tically, or as componen ts of diagnostic kits also are included in this category. The second category includes those products cont aining live microorganisms that have been modified by the addition or deletion of one or more genes. Deleted genes may code for virulence, oncogenicity, enzyme activity, or other biochemical functions. Added genes may result in the expression of new immunizing antigens or the production of novel biochemical byproducts such as beta-galactosidase. Precautions mu st be exercised to assure that this addition or deletion of specific genetic information does not impart increased virulence, pathogenicity, or survival advantages in these organisms which are greater than those found in natural or wild-type forms. Modifications also must not impart undesirable ne w or increased adherence or invasion factors, colonization properties, or intrahos t survival factors. It is impor tant that genes added or deleted do not compromise the safety characteristics of the organisms. In most cases it is expected that they will be improved, and would therefore not pose any new threat to humans, other animal species, or to the environment. The genetic information to be added or de leted must consist of well-characterized DNA segments. Required licensing data may include base pair analysis, sequence information, restriction endonuclease sites, as well as phenotypic characterizati on of the altered organism. A comparison is also required to be made between the genetically engineered organism and the wild-type form with respect to biochemical pathways, virulence tr aits, or other factors affecting pathogenicity. The third category includes produc ts using live vectors to carr y recombinant-derived foreign genes that code for immunizing antigens and/or other immune stimulants. Live vectors may carry multiple recombinant-derived foreign genes since they can carry large quantities of new genetic information. They also are efficient at infecting and immunizing target animal species. These properties, for example, make vaccinia vi rus recombinants very popular subjects for vaccine development programs. Live vectors currently being eval uated by licensees, applicants, a nd other research organizations include vaccinia, bovine papill oma virus, adenoviruses, Simian Virus-40, and yeasts. Characteristics of safety and transmission must be examined before questions and concerns dealing with safety to humans, animals, and re lease into the environment can be answered and before such products can be considered for licensing. USDA will continue to avail its elf of additional expertise from the Public Health Service \"Interagency Group to Monitory Vaccine Development, Production, and Usage.\" This interagency committee will be utilized to consid er potential human health hazards from the use of veterinary biological products and to review issues such as those arising from the potential effect of organisms potentially path ogenic to people or animals. Veterinary biological products prepared usi ng modern biotechnological procedures such as recombinant DNA, chemical synthesis, or hybr idoma technology will be treated similarly to products prepared by conventional techniques. The unlimited number and kind of products that may result from these modern biotechnology procedures make it impossible to define all requirements in specific terms. Each product is evaluated individually to determine what will be necessary to establish its purity, safety, potency, and efficacy. Scientific considerations may dictate generic areas of c oncerns or the use of certain tests for specific situations. Special assays, preferably using in vitro methods, may be required for potency and stability determinations. Additional tests may be required to assure sa fety, especially when live microorganisms are present in the biological products. USDA is authorized to issue three types of permits for impor ting biological products into the United States (9 CFR 104.2). A separate United States Veterinary Biological Product permit is required for each shipment of biological product to be imported. Permits are required for imported biological pr oducts used for research and evaluation, distribution and sale, or transit shipment only. Requests for app lication (U.S. Form 14-5) should be submitted to the Veterinary Biologics Staff, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, Maryland 20782. To provide guidance to cu rrent or prospective manufacturers employing modern biotechnological methods, the fo llowing points are presented: 1. Recombinant DNA-Derived Products. Genetic information coding for a product of interest and other sequences not indigenous to the host are referred to as foreign DNA. Recombinant DNA technology encompasses the isolation, characteriza tion, and expression of foreign DNA in organisms or vectors. The specific cloned nucleotide segment coding fo r the desired product or other foreign DNA segments must be defined in data supporting each license application. These data must also include a description of the source of the DNA and the nucleotide sequence. A vector is a cloning vehicle wh ich provides a suitable origin of replication necessary for production of foreign DNA. Such replicons may be derived from plasmids, bacteriophages or viruses such as vaccinia, bovine papi llomavirus, adenoviruses, or SV-40. Production of functional gene products depends on the efficient expression of cloned DNA- vector complexes in suitable host organisms. Tissue culture cells, bacteria, yeasts, and virus cells may be used as hosts for replication of vectors. The mechanisms of transfer, the copy number, and the physical state of the constructed vector inside the host cell, integrated or extrachromosomal, must be described. USDA's licensing procedure for veterinary biological products derived from recombinant DNA involves a careful evaluation of each product on an indivi dual basis to assure purity, safety, potency, and efficacy. Scientific and safety considerations may require specific safeguards and procedures in some situations. The USDA strongly recommends that all applicants establish Institutional Biosafety Committees which follow applicable provisions of the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Re combinant DNA Molecules. USDA intends to propose guidelines which specifically relate to veterinary biological products. Amendments of the regulations and standards dealing with ve terinary biologics will also be considered. 2. Chemically Synthesized Antigens. When the product consists of chemically synthe sized polypeptides, the ap propriate amino acid sequences will mimic the antigenic site or epitope found in the native antigen where one exists. Procedures used to increase or prol ong an immune response, such as coupling to carrier proteins or addition of adjuvants, must also be descri bed. Immunological data derived from chemically synthesized peptides must be as definitive as those from natural antigens. 3. Monoclonal Antibody Products. The specificity and potency of monoclonal antibody will be comp ared with those of similar polyclonal antibody products where appropriate . The sensitivity and specificity of monoclonal antibody products used in diagnostic test kits and their potency characteristics when used therapeutically must be similar to conventional anti body. Monoclonal antibody must be derived from Master Cell Stocks whic h meet the applicable requirements of 9 CFR 113.52. In addition, as is currently required, a description of cell cloning procedures, preparation, and characterization of cell passages must also be provided. The Outline of Production must describe all pro cesses including scale-up, as cites fluid or cell culture supernatant prep aration, purification, concentration, and inactivation, Mouse colonies must be screened to demonstrate freedom from adventitious agents, espe cially those detected by the mouse antibody production (MAP) test. If the MAP test discloses the presence of adventitious agents, the product shall not be released unless in activation procedures approved by Veterinary Services have been performed a nd tests conducted to ensure proper application of the procedures. 4. Master Seeds. Bacterial or viral seed stocks used to prepare veterinary biological products must meet established procedures used to certif y Master Seeds for biological products. The Master Seed for recombinant DNA-derived products may consist of a plasmid or virus carrying the inserted gene. This constructed pl asmid is then introduced into the appropriate eukaryotic or prokaryotic expression system selected for vaccine production. Genomic DNA may also be transfected direc tly into a variety of mammalian cells. Alternatively, in such cases, the stable transfected cell could be considered as the Master Seed. The establishment of Master Seeds consisting of constructed plasmids or transfected cells requires submission of background information concerning the recombinant DNA procedures used to isolate, purify, and identify genetic material from one source and the modification used for inserting of this mate rial into a new host. Data fr om cloning, isolation, proliferation, and selection of genetica lly unique cells would be retained by licensed applicants. In order to characterize adequately the foreign DNA used to code for a particular antigen, the manufacturer must provide a nucleotide sequence analysis. Tissue culture-propagated cells from vertebra te animals used for vector propagation and antigen production must meet the requirements of 9 CFR 113.51 or 113.52. If a Master Seed has been accepted by Veterina ry Services for use in a licensed product, further genetic modifications may be approved with reduced requirements for additional host animal efficacy studies. Each Outline of Production must be prepared in accordance with 9 CFR 114.9. Outlines must include procedures to ensure consistency in production and recovery of specific antigenic material. Recovery procedures must include removal of excessive antibiotic levels (9 CFR 114.10) and undesirable fermentatio n byproducts such as excessi ve levels of bacterial endotoxins. Serial release tests for purity, safe ty, and potency will be required. In addition product characterization tests may be required to demonstrate consis tent gene expression. Organisms and Vectors Pursuant to the Act of February 2, 1903, (21 U. S.C. 111), and the VSTA, USDA has authority to issue such regulations and take such measur es as may be deemed proper to prevent the introduction or dissemination into the United St ates for the contagi on of any contagious, infectious, or communicable disease of animals a nd/or live poultry from a foreign country into the United States or from one State or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia to another. The importation into th e United States or interstate sh ipment of organisms and vectors is regulated under 9 CFR Part 122. Organisms and vectors are defined in 9 CFR 122.1 as entities which may introduce or disseminate any contagious or infectious disease of animals. Such substances may not be shipped interstate or impor ted without a permit. Permit applications must completely describe the substances, intended use, location of the permittee, and safeguards. A number of revised administrative and technical provisions have been instituted to expedite the USDA review and issuance of permits for impor tation or organisms and vectors which include cell cultures and hybridomas. No animal-origin bi ological materials, such as cell cultures, monoclonal antibodies, organisms, vectors, or re lated material, may be imported into the United States without a Veterinary Services (VS) Pe rmit (VS Form 16-3A). To obtain a permit, an application (VS Form 16-3) should be subm itted to: Import-Export Staff, Belcrest Road, Hy attsville, MD 20782. This is different from the permit required to import vete rinary biologics pursuant to Pa rt 104 of the USDA regulations governing such products (VS Form 14-5 and 14-6). Applicants must also complete the questionnaire entitled \"Importation In formation\" and submit it with their application. Based upon the information submitted by the applicant, a determination will be made if the material to be imported requi res safety testing to ensure it is free from livestock pathogens. Safety te sting is conducted at the Foreig n Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL), Plum Island, New York. Applicants will be advised if a safety test is requ ired and will be given an estimate of the cost for conducting the test. Applicants desiring to have material safety tested must enter into a Cooperative Trust Fund Agreement with APHIS, VS, and deposit in advance sufficient funds to cover the estimated cost. The Import-Export Animals and Products Staff will initiate the Cooperative Trust Fund Agreement. In order to expedite the procedure, VS may issue a permit for the material to be shipped to FADDL pe nding receipt of the funds and Cooperative Trust Fund Agreement. However, the signed Cooperative Agreement, plus the necessary funds, must be received by VS before tes ting can be scheduled at FADDL. Usually 60 to 90 days is needed for issuing a pe rmit for importing material to Plum Island, New York, the completion of safety tests, and the transf er of the imported material to the applicant. A minimum of four vials, each containing at least 1 million cells from a uniform lot, is required for the safety testing. When the test is completed and a determination made that the imported material is free from livestock pathogens, the remainder of the imported material is rele ased directly to the importer under conditions specified in the permit. If an importer wishes to import cell cultures and/or hybridoma cells on a regular basis, the applicant may enter into a con tinuous Cooperative Trust Fund Ag reement with VS and establish an escrow account to ensure that unnecessary delays will not occur due to insufficient funds. Each safety test utilizing susceptible host animals usually cost approximately $2,000 to $3,000. Sometimes it is possible to reduce th e cost by pooling samples in one host animal test. Scientists at FADDL developed in vitro safe ty tests to detect certain liv estock pathogens resulting in substantial cost savings for importers. The current cost of each in vitro test is approximately $500, depending upon the type of animal disease presen t in the country of or igin as well as the intended use of the imported material. Safety testing may not be required for some cell cultures imported for human diagnostic purposes and research. Examples of material which could enter without safety testing include cultured human bone marrow cells, amniocentesis samples, and cells imported for karyotype analysis. Applications for such cell cultures will be considered individually. Permit applications are evaluated by a new classifi cation scheme that correlates intended use of imported cell cultures with the level of safety testing conducted at FADDL. The following classification of cell cultures is ba sed on intended use and generally indicates the level of safety testing required. Class I Cell cultures to be used for the producti on of products such as vaccines, hormones, or other biologicals to be used in livestoc k, poultry, or for commercial distribution. Requirement: These cell cultures must be safety te sted at FADDL using susceptible host animals, approved in vitro test, an d/or laboratory animals. Class II Cell cultures to be used only for in vitro studies and not to be used in animals other than primates. Requirement: These cultures may not require safety testing. The material ma y be sent directly to the importer when no safety testing is requi red. The permit (VS Form 16-3A) will specify restrictions such as \"FOR IN VITRO LABORATORY TESTS: DO NOT INOCULATE INTO LIVESTOCK, BIRDS, OR LABORATORY ANIMALS.\" Cell cultures imported under permit which do not requi re a safety test may not be distributed to other laboratories without prio r approval from USDA, APHIS, VS. Applications for the distribution of imported material should be s ubmitted to the USDA, AP HIS, VS, Import-Export Staff, Organisms and Vectors. When appropriate, a review is conducted by th e Administrator's Parent Committee on Organisms and Vectors. Members of this committee have wide expertise in evaluating safety. Clearance may also require testing in high security faci lities at the Veterinary Services, FADDL, Plum Island, New York. B. Plants and Plant Products Pursuant to the authority granted by the Fe deral Plant Pest Act (FPPA) of May 23, 1957, as amended (7 U.S.C. 150 aa through 150 jj), and the Plant Quarantine Ac t (PQA) of August 20, 1912, as amended (7 U.S.C. 151 through 164, 166, and 167). USDA has regulatory authority over the movement into or within and through the United States of plants, plant products, plant pests, and any product or article which may contain a plant pest at the time of movement. These articles are regulated in order to prevent the introduction, spread, or establishment of plant pests new to or not widely prevalent in the United Stat es. The regulations implementing this statutory authority are found in 7 CFR Parts 300 through 399. \"Plant Pest,\" as defined by statute, means any living stage of any insects, mites, nematodes, slugs, snails, protozoa, or other invertebrate animals, bacteria, fungi, or parasitic plants or reproductive parts thereof, viruses, or any orga nisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing, or any infectious substances, which can directly or indirectly in jure or cause disease or damage in any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants (7 U.S.C. 150aa(c)). \"Movement,\" as defined by statute, means to shi p, deposit for transmission in the mail, otherwise offer for shipment, offer for entry, import, r eceive for transportati on, carry, or otherwise transport or move, or allow to be moved, by mail or otherwise (7 U.S.C. 150aa(g)). The current permit system requirements for the m ovement into or within and through the United States of plants, plant products, plant pests, and other articles regulated by FPPA and PQA were fully described in the December 31, 1984 Notice at 49 FR 50900-01. The procedures for issuing permits for the movement of plant pests were di scussed separately from plants, plant products and other articles which may contain plan t pests at 49 FR 50901-02. USDA regulates the importation of noxious weeds through a permit system similar to that established for plant pests. The existing regulations in 7 CFR Part 360 wh ich designate plants as noxious weeds and establish procedures for obtaining an im port permit were described at 49 FR 50902. Regulation of the Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering Which Are or Which There is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests The FPPA and PQA are applicable to the movement of plants, plant pro ducts, and other articles and plant pests developed through genetic engine ering if such plants, plant products, other articles, or plant pests present a risk of plan t pest introduction, spr ead, or establishment. Under the authority granted by the FPPA and P QA, USDA is proposing ne w regulations which would impose restrictions on the introduction of organisms and products altered or produced through genetic engineering which ar e plant pests or which there is reason to believe are plant pests. In accordance with th e provisions of the FPPA and PQA. US DA must determine the plant pest status of plants, plant products or articles to be moved into or within or through the United States. The evaluation process for determining what safeguards, if any, can be imposed which would allow the movement of the plant pest without risk that the plant pest would be disseminated were described in the D ecember 31, 1984 Notice at 49 FR 50901-02. For genetically engineered material from dissimilar source organisms (inter-g eneric combinations), the determination may be complex. Informa tion about genetically engineered organisms produced through the use of donor, vector/vector ag ent and recipient organisms that are from a list of known plant pests is needed in order that such organisms be properly regulated. During the past year, USDA has received permit a pplications to move genetically engineered organisms into or through the United States. USDA is confident that organisms altered through genetic engineering will play a ma jor role in increased plant yi eld and improved plant quality. However, a genetically engineered organism deri ved from organisms that are plant pests also presents a risk of plant pest introduction. The organisms themselves, the cultures in which they are transported, or their packaging may be c ontaminated with plant pathogens. Genetic alteration may create a plant pest new to and not wi despread in the United St ates. It is necessary, therefore, to establis h appropriate safeguards to preven t the introduction of genetically engineered organisms that pose a threat to agriculture. Other ge netically engineered organisms that are not plant pests or where there is no re ason to believe such organisms are plant pests would not be regulated. New data have to be required in order to properly evaluate permit applications for those organisms which are plant pests or which there is reason to believe are plant pests. A determination was made that additional data re quirements would be inco rporated into proposed regulations for those genetically engineered or ganisms which are of c oncern under the provisions of the FPPA and PQA. USDA is publishing as a companion document in the \"proposed rules section\" of this issue of the Federal Register its proposed regulations pertaining to organi sms and products altered or produced through genetic engineer ing which are on plant pests or which there is reason to believe are plant pests. The proposed regulations would establish a new pa rt entitled, \"Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering Which Are Plant Pests or Which There is Reason to Believe are Plant Pests\", in Title 7 of the Code of Regulations (7 CFR), pursuant to the authority of the FFPA, as ame nded (7 U.S.C. 150aa-150jj) and the PQA, as amended, (7 U.S.C. 151-164, 166, 167). Such proposed regulations would regulate the importation into and movement within and thro ugh the United States as well as prevent the release into the environment of certain orga nisms, or products altered or produced through genetic engineering, which are plant pests or whic h there is reason to believe are plant pests. The proposed regulations would restrict the \"i ntroduction\" of certain organisms and products altered or produced through genetic e ngineering, referred to as \"regulate articles.\" In this context, \"introduction\" means to move into the United States , to release into the environment, or to move interstate, or any attempt thereat.\" \"Release into the environment\" means \"use of a regulated article outside the constraints of physical confinement that ar e found in a laboratory, contained greenhouse, or fermenter or other contained structure.\" USDA's proposed regulations, which are designed to prevent the release into the environment of genetically engineered organisms which are plant pests or which there is reason to believe are plant pests are consistent with the legislative intent of the FPPA . The FPPA was enacted in 1957 and was intended as \"gap filing\" legislation fo r the purpose of protecti ng American agriculture against invasion by plant pests and diseases whic h are new to or not theretofore known to be widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States. The FPPA also provides USDA with authority to regulate insects or pests that might later be found to be injurious to cultivated crops. Th e release into the environment of a genetically engineered plant pest is tantamount to the introdu ction of a plant pest which is new to and not theretofore known to be widely prevalent within and throughout the United States and subject to regulation under the FPPA. It should be noted that \"regulated article\" would be defined as a ny organism or product altered or produced through genetic engineering, if the donor organism, recipient organism, or vector or vector agent belongs to a group of organisms designated by the proposed regulations as having plant pests or any organism or product which USDA determines is a plant pest or which there is reason to believe is a plant pest. Under US DA's proposed definition, certain microorganisms would be excluded if the recipient microorgani sm is non-pathogenic, is non-infectious, and otherwise not a plant pest, and resulted from th e addition of genetic material that is well characterized and contains only non-coding regulato ry regions. Restrictions would be required for regulated articles because they are plant pe sts, or because USDA has reason to believe they are plant pests. The proposed regulations would require that a person obtai n a permit prior to the introduction of a regulated arti cle and would list speci fic conditions required for the introduction of a regulated article. The regulated article could be introduced only if all conditions in the proposed regulations as well as all conditions specified on the permit were met. It is important to note that in considering whether a permit can be issued for the introduction of a genetically engineered organism, USDA will perform the same comprehensive analysis that is used in determining whether a permit can be issued for the movement of a \"conventional\" plant pest. Such assessment shall include an examination of the factors that were discussed in the December 31, 1984, Notice at 49 FR 50901-02 as part of the evaluation process for determining what safeguards can be imposed which would allow the movement of a plant pest without risk of dissemination. These factors are oriented to ward an examination of the ecological and environmental effects of a release of the geneti cally engineered organism or product into the environment. The proposed regulations also contain provisi ons for a certificate of exemption for those organisms or products altered or produced through genetic engineering that are not subject to the proposed regulations. A person se eking to introduce an exempt ar ticle could voluntarily request a certificate of exemption to facilitate the intr oduction of the organism or product. The proposed regulations provide a list of groups of organisms wh ich are plant pests or contain plant pests. If the donor, vector/vector agent, or recipient of the genetica lly engineered organism is derived from an organism on the list of organisms containing plant pests, such genetically engineered organism would be deemed a \"regulated article\". As defined in the proposed regulations, a plant pest includes microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses, and thus a \"regulated article\" may be a microorganism unless it meets the provisions for exclusion. It is important to note that in some instances certain microorganisms will be subject to joint regulation by USDA and EPA. USDA has jurisdiction over certain microorganisms under the FPPA and PQA if the mi croorganisms are a plant pest. EPA would have jurisdiction under the Toxic Substances Co ntrol Act (TSCA) if the microorganism is deemed to be a \"new\" microorganism or unde r the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended (FIFRA ) if the microorganism is to be used as a pesticide. Because each Agency has a different statutory mandate, ce rtain jurisdictional overlaps cannot be avoided. However, EPA and USDA will work cooperativel y and simultaneously in the evaluation of genetically engineered microorganisms that fa ll under the jurisdiction of both Agencies. To expedite the review of these microorganisms each Agency will appoint contact persons to coordinate the review to ensure data requests ar e not duplicated. The specifics of which microorganisms will be subject to dual Agency review, or primarily single Agency review, is set forth in the preamble of USDA 's proposed regulations being published as a companion document to this po licy statement. That document should be consulted for further information. A key to determining whether a genetically engineered organism will be regulated by USDA is the list of organisms containing plant pests that appears in \u00a7 340.2 in proposed Part 340. USDA acknowledges that this is not an exhaustive list, and that it does not attempt to list every pest species. Comments are welcome on the list as well as on other parts of the proposed regulations. In order to solicit as many comments as possible on the list and all other parts of the proposed regulations, USDA has scheduled public he arings in Washington, DC and Sacramento, California, during the 60-day comment period. Th e time and place of the public hearings as well as the address to send written comments is specif ied in the preamble to the proposed regulations. USDA believes that through the submission of detailed comments and full participation by public and private interests, USDA will be able to promulgate a final regulation that will prevent the introduction and dissemination of genetically engineered orga nisms which are plant pests or which there is reason to believe are plant pests, yet not impede the development of biotechnology. C. Meat and Poultry Products The Food and Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) is responsible for assuring the safety, wholesomeness, and proper labe ling of food products prepared from domestic livestock and poultry. The Federal Meat Insp ection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) require FSIS to inspect cattle, sheep, swine, goats, equines, poultry, and food products prepared from them which are intended for use as human food to assure th at they are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labe led, marked, and packaged. In spection under these statutes is mandatory. The cost of inspection, except for ov ertime and holiday inspection work, is required to be borne by the USDA. Food, animals and anim al products, other than those required to be inspected under the FMIA a nd PPIA, may be inspected under a voluntary, reimbursable inspection program established under th e Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. Within the framework of food safety statutes, FSIS has developed regulations for research on animals that are administered experimental an imal drugs, biologics, and pesticides (9 CFR 309.17 and 381.75). These regulations state that no an imal used in any research investigation involving an experimental biologica l product, drug, or chemical shall be eligible for slaughter at an official establishment unless certain conditio ns are met. These conditions include any of several different ways of demonstrating that the use of such biological product, drug, or chemical will not result in the products of such animals being adulterated. Products Subject to Review . FSIS anticipates that many food an imals which are subject to the new techniques of modern biotechnology will not differ substantially in appearance, behavior, or general health from currently inspected cattle, sheep, swine, goats, equines, and poultry. They would be subject to the same inspection procedures and regulations as traditionally inspected food animals. FSIS is aware that some geneti cally engineered animals, such as mosaics, chimeras, and some hybrids, may differ substantially from animals that are inspected currently under the FMIA and PPIA. If such animals are ever intended for use as human food and are presented for inspection at an official establishm ent, a decision would have to be made as to whether such animals were covered under the FMIA or PPIA, and if not, whether the FMIA and PPIA should be amended to require inspect ion of such animals and their products. Implementation of Review Authority . FSIS's approach toward the review of food animals resulting from the techniques of modern biotechno logy consists, in general, of two phases. The first, an experimental phase, focuses on the expe rimental aspects of vector administrative, gene transfer and gene expression. Si nce artificial vector s used in animal gene transfer may be considered as either animals drugs or animal biologics, their admini stration to food animals would be covered under the current regulations on animals used for research (9 CFR 309.17 and 381.75). The requirement that an animal carcass intended for use as human food not be adulterated may require that ce rtain phenotypic, biochemical, and microbiological parameters not be exceeded before the animal can be sla ughtered for human food. Depending on future developments, FSIS may amend the regulations (9 CFR 309.17 and 381.75) to provide further assurance that the products of animals genetically engineered by certai n techniques are not adulterated. The second phase would be carried out under existing regulations (9 CFR Parts 301 through 381) and would focus on the commercia l development, production, inspection and labeling of food animals and food animal products. D. Seeds The Federal Seed Act (FSA) (7 U.S.C. 1551 et se q.) defines USDA regulat ory authority over the importation and interstate shipment of agricultural and vegetable seeds. It does not apply to the production or intrastate distribution of seeds or to seeds other than agricultural or vegetable seeds (\"agricultural seeds\" are grass, forage, and field crop seeds). The FSA prohibits interstate shipment of seed th at contains noxious weed seeds at levels in violation of the laws of the State of destination or in excess of levels allowed by the Secretary of Agriculture. This provision applies primarily to seed adulterated with nox ious weed seed. In a few instances, however, States have determined that a particular variet y of agricultural or vegetable seed is itself a noxious weed. In thes e instances, FSA prohibits the interstate shipment of the seed into those States. The FSA also a llows the Secretary to prohibit the importation of agricultural and vegetable seed which is adulterate d with noxious weed seed or which is unfit for seeding purposes. The authority granted to the S ecretary by the FSA to prohibit the interstate shipment or importation of seeds which are found to be detrim ental to the agricultural interests of the United States applies to seeds genetica lly engineered with the modern biotechnology to the same extent as any other seeds. V. Scientific Review Mechanisms The manner in which both regulation and oversig ht of research in agriculture-related biotechnology evolves and is implemented in the United States will have a direct impact on the competitiveness of U.S. industry in both domes tic and world markets. Inconsistent or unnecessary procedures for regulation and research will place the U.S. scientific effort and U.S. producers at a substantial disadvantage. It also is important that safeguards be built into biotechnological research proce sses, and that releases be ba sed on careful evaluations while further experience is being gained. Therefore, USDA feels that such regulatory and research decisions must be based on th e best science available. While the responsibilities within USDA for biotec hnology reside with the A ssistant Secretary for Science and Education and the Assistant Secretar y for Marketing and Insp ection Services as the delegates of the Secretary of Ag riculture, in carrying out their re spective responsibilities based on the best science available, they would be able to take advantag e of the expertise and perspectives within the Federal Government through a committee to be called the Committee on Biotechnology in Agriculture (CBA). The CBA, to be chaired by these two Assistant Secretaries, will function both as a policy body in the USDA and a bridge between its research and regulating structures. Committee on Biotechnology in Agriculture The objectives of the CBA will include: To provide advice, when requested, on initia tives, proposals, and policy for agriculture- related regulation and research, and assist in the coor dination of these activities; To review scientific issues submitted by agencies within the Department; To assist in identifying data gaps for ba sic research in agricultural biotechnology; To foster public awareness of the scientific issues in biotechnology; and To provide Departmental support for participation in the FCCSET BSCC. USDA expects that the CBA also will utilize existing cooperativ e entities (e.g., other Federal agencies, universities, State regulatory officials, the public sector, and industry) to acquire, when necessary, information for addressing those issues submitted to it. Such entities, when requested, can provide technical support for sound regulatory and research decisions regarding the use of biotechnology in agriculture and forestry. Thes e entities offer a vast scientific resource upon which USDA can draw. VI. Summary of Comments USDA received the comments of one hundred-two (102) respondents, one-half of whom commented specifically on the USDA policy statem ent. Although USDA agencies considered all comments on the coordinated policy proposal, this response is confined to comments on the USDA portion of the notice. The two largest categories of respondents were business and academic, followed closely by associations representing these interests. Comments came in lesser numbers from environmental and public interest groups, indi viduals, law firms, and foreig n governments, as well as the National Institutes of Hea lth Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (NIH-RAC) and a member of the U.S. Congress The USDA response to the comments follows the fo rm of the original notice, with a discussion of comments on regulatory philosophy followed by a response to comments on the regulatory framework. Comments on the Nature of Products of Modern Biotechnology: Fourteen respondents stressed their agreement with th e USDA statement that \"agriculture and forestry products developed by modern biotechnology will not differ fundamentally from conventional products,\" while six commenters dissented. Three resp ondents felt that genetic engin eering across species barriers did create a potentially different product and the po ssibility of unique eco logical effects. Concern about the \"need for public trust\" and pub lic assurance on safety and ethical issues was stressed by three commenters. Seven respondents agreed with USDA that \"to date, no unique or safety problems have been associated with product s of genetic engineering,\" but four of the same commenters who view biotechnology products as fundamentally different from conventional products stressed that the potenti al exists for safety problems with biotechnology applications. Response: USDA recognizes the importance of eco logical effects and the need for developing procedures responsive to pub lic concerns about safety. Although USDA's regulatory philosophy remains as stated, additions to regulatory procedures are being proposed for genetically engineered plants and plant pr oducts and veterinary biologics produced by biotechnology (see sec tion IV). The previously disc ussed delegations of authority within USDA for biotechnology increase the effectiv eness of the administration of current and proposed regulatory procedures affecti ng the products of modern biotechnology. For veterinary biological products, USDA is curr ently developing additiona l procedures pursuant to the VSTA, as amended, for evaluating requests to conduct experimental field trials with live vectors containing genetically engineered organisms or to support product license applications. The procedures being developed consider the pa rental organism and the effect of the gene alteration on the genetic propert ies of the recipient, especial ly the survival, reproduction, and dispersal characteristics. A car eful analysis of the genetics , biology, and ecology of the wild- type and modified microorganisms will provide as reasonable prediction of the risks which might be associated with use of the altered organisms. USDA is proposing regulations pursuant to the Federal Plant Pest Act (FPPA) and the Plant Quarantine Act (PQA) for regulating the introduc tion of certain organisms of products thereof altered or produced through biotechnology which are plant pests or may become plant pests. This proposed rule should assist USDA in assessi ng the ecological effects of the release of such genetically engineered organisms into the environment. Guidelines for oversight of agricultural biot echnology research funded by USDA will be issued under the authority of the Food Security Act of 1985. USDA also is establishing scientific review mechanisms to assist in research and regulatory decisions (see section V). These proposed modifications in th e procedural framework are described as a part of the final policy statement for veterinary biologics, plants and plant products, research, and scientific review mechanisms. Comments of the Adequacy of Existing Authority: Thirteen commenters agreed with USDA that its existing regulatory framework is adequate fo r biotechnology applications, and nine favor the case-by-case approach under existin g authority. Five commenters fe lt that new legislation is or may be needed; two of the five oppose the case-by-case approach. Response: USDA has examined its statutory au thority for regulating biotechnology products and processes, and USDA agencies have processe d licensing and permit a pplications under the existing statutes. The existing au thority is considered adequate at this time. Established procedures, with the proposed modifications, can be adapted e ffectively to handle biotechnology applications. USDA is currently considering ge netic engineering applicat ions on a case-by-case basis using existing authority. Comments on Need for Procedures and Guidelines: Sixteen respondents commented that USDA had not outlined procedures for the review and approval of genetically engineered products. Twelve respondents stressed the need for flexibility, and six requested sunset provisions in USDA biotechnology regulations. Response: The USDA policy statement of Decem ber 31, 1984, did outline procedures currently used for the review and approval of certain gene tically engineered produ cts. In considering license applications for genetically engineered veterinary biologics, USDA follows the standards and procedures applicable to all such products found in \u00a7\u00a7 101-117 of the applicable regulations and standards (9 CFR 101-117). In the December 31, 1984 Notice, USDA offered supplementary guidelines for licensing such produc ts. New procedures are being developed to evaluate production and testi ng of veterinary biologics derived through use of genetic engineering techniques. The in formation needed for proper evaluation will depend on the parent organism and the effect of the ge ne alteration on the genetic properties of the recipient. A paper describing the USDA licensing policy for biologics produced by recombinant DNA technology was presented at the Joint International Associat ion of Biological Standardization/World Health Organization Symposium on \"Standardization and Control of Biologics Produced by Recombinant DNA Technology,\" Geneva, Switzerland, 1983 (published in Developments in Biological Standardization, V. 59, pp. 167-173, S. Korgel, Basel, 1985). The paper describes requirements for plasmid/vector characterization and stability, and correl ation to conventional Master Seed concepts, as well as methodology which can be used to monitor antigenic expression, concentration, purification, and stab ility testing during production and recovery. The movement of genetically engineered product s which are plant pests and present a risk of plant pest introduction or spread is regulat ed by 7 CFR 330.200 implemented pursuant to the FPPA and PQA. The movement of organisms and vectors which may cause disease in animals is regulated under 9 CFR Part 122. USDA realized that the statement left unanswe red some questions about the means for review and approval of various genetical ly engineered products. The pr oposed regulations described in section IV(B), implemented under the authority of the FPPA establish permit requirements for the \"introduction\" of organisms altered or produced by genetic engineering which are or may become plant pests. The regula tions would be flexible because organisms determined not to be plant pests would be exempt, and this category could be expanded in the future to include organisms whose plant pest status is currently uncertain and therefor e restricted. It is hoped that the discussion in section IV(B) of this policy statement answers any remaining questions about the review and approval procedures for such genetically engineered products. Comments on Confidential Business Information (CBI): Six commenters representing business and scientific interests expressed concern about the protect ion of \"confid ential business information\" in the USDA regulatory process wh ile two public interest groups stressed the \"public's right to know.\" Response: The USDA regulations implementing th e Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552) are found in 7 CFR 1.1-1.16. The FOIA provides that Federal agencies must make available to the public all record s not specifically exempt from di sclosure. Exemptions include \"trade secrets and commercial or financial inform ation.\" (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)). On September 23, 1985, USDA's APHIS issued a policy statement on the protection of priv ileged or confidential information (50 FR 38561-38563). This policy statemen t establishes requirem ents for the control and protection of documents received by APHIS that contain privileged or confidential business information concerning biotechnology and the vete rinary biologics progr am. The procedures established conform to the FOIA require ments for both protection and disclosure. Comments on Use of NIH Guidelines: Four re spondents questioned the US DA requirements that manufacturers of veterinary biological produc ts using recombinant DNA technology follow the National Institutes for Health Guidelines for Research Invol ving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines). One respondent thought US DA implied that all people \"who work with recombinant DNA plants\" would be required to co mply with the NIH Guidelines, and requested procedural guidelines for industry. Response: The USDA does not require that the ma nufacturers of veterina ry biological products or plant products of recombinant DNA technology follow the NIH Guidelines. However, USDA strongly recommends that all li cense applicants for veterinary biologics follow appropriate provisions of the NIH Guidelines, such as those regarding the establishment of an institutional biosafety committee. USDA intends to propose gui delines that will parallel closely the NIH Guidelines, and it intends to recommend strongly that entities not required to follow the USDA guidelines do so voluntarily. Comments on Importation of Cell-Lines: Th ree associations repr esenting biotechnology companies requested that USDA take steps to reduce delays in the clearance and testing procedures required for the importation of biot echnology-derived products and cell-lines. On February 12, 1985, the Association of Biotec hnology Companies (ABC) delivered a report on USDA importation quaran tine issues to the APHIS Parent Committee for Foreign Pathogens and Vectors. This report was an att achment to the ABC comment letter. Response: The USDA has instituted a number of re vised administrative an d technical provisions to expedite the issuance of permits for importation of organisms and vectors which include cell cultures and hybridomas. A supplementary qu estionnaire, designed to insure adequate information on cell cultures and products fr om recombinant DNA or hybridoma technologies, now accompanies each permit applica tion. Applicants are advised whet her or not a safety test is required and a cost estimate is given. Safety testing may be conducted concurrently with the administrative review of the pe rmit application, but only at APHIS' Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL) at Plum Island, New York. New te st procedures have reduced the cost of safety testing, and the cost per sa mple can be further reduced by conducting a safety test with pooled samples. Permit applications are evaluated using a new classification scheme that equates intended use of imported cell cultures with the level of safety testing required at FADDL. Class I cell cultures, employed in th e preparation of products such as enzymes, vaccines, or hormones for commercial use, are su bject to complete safety testing. Class II cell cultures, used only for in vitro studies and not to be used in animals other than primates, are subject to a lesser degree of testing. Comments on Risk Analysis: Seven respondents discussed the issue of risk assessment or risk/benefit analysis of biotechnology applications. Comm ents varied from a recommendation that \"standard risk assessment methodologies\" be adopted by all agencies to a warning against attempting to regulate the \"hypothetical and imag inary \"potential' dange rs\" of recombinant DNA techniques. Response: The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) applies to USDA actions. The \"APHIS Guidelines Concerning Implementati on of NEPA Procedures \" (44 FR 50381, August 28, 1979) would be used to make an environm ental assessment or environmental impact statement of the effects of a pr oposed release of a genetically engineered organism regulated pursuant to the VSTA, the FPPA and PQA, and re lated statutes. A formal risk management procedure based on a wide variety of safety concep ts will be used to evaluate systematically proposed releases. The information required by any new regulations promulgated under the FPPA and PQA would be used to prepare the environmental assessment for release of a genetically engineered product which is a plant pest or may become a plant pest. In normal husbandry and laboratory practices, veterinary biologi cal products normally are not considered to be released into the environment. In the event that a c onventionally prepared or recombinant derived product would be considered to be released into the environment, the issuance of a license or impor t permit would require complia nce with procedures being developed and interagency approval. The proced ures under development consider the parental organism and the effect on the gene alteration on the genetic properties of the recipient, especially the survival, reproducti on and dispersal characteristics. Safety, ethics, and policy issues in agricultural biot echnology research will be overseen by the Committee on Biotechnology in Ag riculture (CBA) and such s upporting technical advisory groups as may be established by the USDA agencies. Currently, all USDA and USDA- sponsored research involving recombinant DNA must be cleared prior to initiation for compliance with the NIH Guidelines. Comments on Jurisdiction: The potential for ove rlapping jurisdiction in the policy notice drew the largest number of comments. Eighteen re spondents pointed out that both USDA and EPA propose to regulate agricultural microorganisms. Respondents representing the interests of the veterinary biologics industry contended that a jurisdictiona l dispute between USDA and FDA delayed the approval of bovine interferon. Wh ile generally supporting the concept of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between US DA and FDA to resolve jurisdictional disputes, one respondent challenged the legality of the MOU, noting that it contains the statement that \"animal biological products gene rally act through a speci fic immune process,\" while USDA's current regulations do not restrict its jurisdiction to products operating through such a mechanism of action. Industry respondents al so pointed out that the intrastate producer of veterinary biologics is not regulated by USDA . Two firms and one industry association urged prompt Federal oversight action so that States do not act independently to regulate biotechnology products. Response: USDA agrees that there is the poten tial for overlapping jurisdiction among the Federal agencies involved in regulating biotechnology products. USDA and EPA representatives have discussed jurisdiction over ge netic engineering ap plications since 1983. USDA and EPA have begun to establish a regulatory procedure for reviewing certain submissions of genetically engineered microorganism appli cations, a procedure which has re sulted in joint consultation on several proposals for rel ease into the environment of organi sms altered by genetic engineering. For veterinary biologics regul ated under the VSTA, use of procedures currently under development will increase USDA effectiveness in evaluating biotechnology license and product applications. The MOU between USDA and FD A was published on June 8, 1982, in an attempt to resolve the issue of new products which fall into the questionable definitional area between animal drugs regulated by FDA and animal biol ogics regulated by USDA. An interpretation by some that the term animal biologics only include s substances that act through a specific immune process has resulted in some c onfusion. There is nothing in US DA's current regulations or law which restricts its jurisd iction to products acting solely th rough this mechanism of action, and because of this fact, the memorandum qualifies its reference to specific immune process by the word \"generally.\" Although efforts will be made to clarify the issue further, it should be noted that there appears to be little uncertainty about whether a particul ar product is a veterinary drug or biologic. The Food Security Act of 1985 contains amendments to the VSTA that extend USDA's jurisdiction to veterinary biologi cs which are shipped intrastate or exported. The provisions of the amendments are discussed more fully in Section IV. Comments on the National Biological Impact Assessment Program (NBIAP): Seven respondents commented on the NBIAP, the proposal by the Nati onal Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges (NASULGC) for establishing a program to assess ge netically engineered organisms before they are released into the en vironment. Three commenters -- a member of Congress, a spokesperson for a biotechnology firm, and an officer of an environmental organization -- posed questions about the propos al. The questions concerned the NBIAP's statutory or regulatory status; its relation to other USDA agency operations and other Federal agency operations; the processes of risk assessm ent to be used; its adequacy to review an increasing volume of products; and the appropria teness of biohazard committees as vehicles for review of commercial processes and products . Four respondents representing NASULGC institutions endorsed the proposal stating the view that the agri cultural research community has the capability to develop guidelines and a ssess impacts of biotechnology research and commercial products. The major goal of the prog ram was thought to be insuring the safety of society and the environment. Response: NBIAP is a scientific advisory syst em that would be available to the Assistant Secretary for Science and Education. By this system the USDA can draw upon the best experience available from scientis ts in universities, Federal labor atories, and industry to help assess the risks involved in the processes and products from RDNA work in biotechnology. NBIAP shall act in an advisory capacity and is in no direct way a part of the formal approval process. It is available to provide as sessment, but is not a mandatory process. Comments on Definitions, Terms, and Data Requirements: Five respondents recommended changes in the definitions, terms, data requirement s or classification used by USDA in the notice. Each recommendation is discussed below. Two respondents commented on the USDA statement of licensing policy for veterinary biologics produced by modern biotechnical methods at 49 FR 50899-50900. Under the heading \"1. Recombinant DNA-Derived Products,\" a manufacture r of veterinary biologics questioned the need to provide the entire nuc leotide sequence of a foreign DNA being cloned into a vector. It is USDA's position that in order to characte rize adequately the foreign DNA used to code a particular antigen, the manufact urer should provide a nucleot ide sequence analysis. The construction of the vector used for expression of the cloned nucleotide sequence also should include source and function of the component parts of the vector , i.e., origin of replication, antibiotic resistance genes, promot er, enhancers, etc. The manufact urer also questioned the data requirement under the heading \"2. Chemically S ynthesized Antigens\" concerning the persistence of the immune response following ad ministration of the synthetic peptide. The USDA feels that a major concern with the use of synthetic peptides is the devel opment persistence of the immune response. USDA does not intend to require more st ringent efficacy data th an that necessary to support a veterinary biologic license application employing natural antigens. However, immunological data derived from chemically synthesized peptides must be as definitive as the serological response from natural or nonsynthetic antig ens. With respect to the next sentence in the policy statement, an individual respondent proposed a change from the term \"antibody response\" to \"immune response.\" It is true that the term used in the sentence \"Procedures used to increase or prolong an antibody response . . .\" is somewhat limiting and can create confusion between B-cell and T-cell response. Therefor e, the recommendation to replace \"antibody response\" with the term \"immune response\" with the term \"immune response\" is accepted, since both T-cell responses as well as T- cell/B-cell inter actions would be included in the statement. On the subject of plants and plant pests, a pl ant pathologist commented on the references to Pseudomonas syringae as plant pathogens under the heading \"ice nucleation negative bacteria\" at 49 FR 50902. The respondent noted that none of the strains of Ps eudomonas syringae currently proposed for use are plant pathogens and that it would be more co rrect to call P. syringae plant- associated bacteria, some of which are pathogens. USDA will clarify future references to these organisms as the respondent suggests. Accord ing to current practice, and under the proposed FPPA regulations, an applicant for a USDA permit to import or move Pseudomonas syringae would be required to submit da ta to show whether of not the strain was a plant pest. Addendum\u2014Research Legislative Authorities The USDA is authorized under its Organic Act (7 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) an d other legislation to conduct and support research in wide ranging areas of agriculture. Examples of such other laws include: The Alcohol Fuels Research (7 U.S.C. 3154); the National Latex Commercialization and Economic Development Act (7 U.S.C. 178-178n); th e Animal Health and Disease Research Act (7 U.S.C. 3195); Special Research Grants (7 U.S.C. 450i(c)); Aquaculture Act (16 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.); the Cotton Research and Prom otion Act (7 U.S.C. 2101 et seq.); the Potato Research Information Act (7 U.S.C. 2611-2627); the Egg Research and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 701 et seq.); the Beef Research and Information Act (7 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.); the Wheat and Wheat Foods Research and Nutritio n Education Act (7 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.); the Animal Cancer Research Act (7 U.S.C. 3901 et seq.); the Floral Research and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.); and th e Forest Research Assistance Act (16 U.S.C. 582a-582a-7). DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Occupational Safety and Health Administration AGENCY: Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Labor. Agency Guidelines on Biotechnology ACTION: Announcement of guidelines on occupati onal safety and health in the field of biotechnology. SUMMARY: OSHA has reviewed its responsibilities under the Occ upational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) as they relate to the protection of the safety and health of workers in the rapidly developi ng field of biotechnology. Section 8 of the Act authorizes OSHA to inspect workplaces including laboratories a nd places of employment relating to biotechnology. Section 5(a)(1) of the Act requires that each employer furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of empl oyment which are free from rec ognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause deat h or serious physical harm. OSHA has determined that this general duty clau se, together with seve ral specific standards, currently provides and adequate and enforceable ba sis for protection of the safety and health of employees in the field of biotechnology. No additional regulation of workplaces using biotechnology appears to be needed at this time , or since no hazards from biotechnology per se have been identified. However, if any of the new biotechno logy processes cause hazardous working conditions that result in a significant risk of death or serious harm to workers, OSHA will consider regulating unless the worker expos ure is effectively controlled under current OSHA standards or another agency has exercised its authority over health and safety matters for those working conditions. Guidelines contained in this notice are provided to: (1) Clarify the relationship of the existing statute to the field of biotechnology, and (2) reiterate commonly employed laboratory safety practices. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James F. Foster, Director, Office of Information and Consumer Affairs, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Room N-3637, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue , NW., Washington, DC 20210. Telephone (202) 523-8151. A. Background The Occupational Safety and Health Admini stration (OSHA) publishe d an announcement of guidelines on occupational safety and health in the Federal Register, Volume 50, Number 71, page 14483, April 12, 1985 with a request for public comment. All comments received supported the statement although the National Ins titute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended increased surveillance because their research indicat ed gaps in current knowledge. Biotechnology is the application of biological systems and organi sms to technical and industrial processes. The technologies employed in this area include, but are not limited to: (1) Classical genetic selection and/or breeding for purposes such as developing bakers yeast, conventional fermentation and vaccine development; (2) The direct in vitro modification of genetic material, e.g., recombinant DA or gene splicing; and, (3) Other novel techniques for modifying geneti c material of living or ganisms, e.g., cell fusion and hybridoma technology. Modern biotechnology is analogous to other conv entional industrial processes and has great potential benefit to society and wide applicati on to numerous industries. It is considered by some to have economic potential comparable to the microprocessor industry. Genetic engineering has a wide spectrum of applicati ons of commercial importance, but many such applications are in the early st ages of development or have b een expressed only as concepts. The Occupational Safety and Hea lth Act of 1970 (OSH Act) grants the Secretary of Labor broad power to require employers to provide a safe and healthful workplace for their employees. Where other Federal agencies exercise their statut ory authority to prescrib e or enforce standards or regulations affecting occupati onal safety or health, OSHA is preempted by section 4(b)(1) of the Act. Section 5(a)(1) of the Act requires employers to furnish their employees with a workplace \"free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.\" Section 5(a)(2) requires employers to comply with safety and health standards set by the Secretary. The Secretary in establishing standa rds to deal with toxic materials and harmful physical agents is required by the OSH Act to \"set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available eviden ce, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional cap acity even if such empl oyee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his wo rking life\" (section 8(b)(5)). Under a recent Supreme Court decision permanen t standards can be promulgated only upon a finding by the Secretary that the standard is reason ably necessary to remedy a significant risk of material health impairment. Finally, emergenc y temporary standards may be promulgated only upon a finding that employees are \"exposed to grave danger.\" (section 8(c)(1).) In view of the statutory criter ia briefly outlined above and the currently known hazards from biotechnology processes there does not appear to be a need for new OSHA regulations. Furthermore, the biotechnology processes, whethe r present in laboratories, pilot projects or industrial plants, usually involve conventional chemicals and pro cesses that are already covered by OSHA regulations. These conventional processes use solvents or products, some of which may be toxic or dangerous to employee health in certain dosages over certain periods of time. The potentially hazardous character of some aspects of biotechnology is primarily from the chemicals used and not the biotec hnology products. Therefore, th e regulations that effectively regulate chemical exposures will us ually ensure that biohazards too will be controlled. However, when a process employing biotech nology alone or in combinati on with conventional chemicals and technology presents a significant hazard to employees which cannot be dealt with by existing standards or the general duty clause, OSHA w ill consider regulating in order to protect employees health. Increased industrial hygiene m onitoring and medical surv eillance will help to assure worker protection. At this time, no new regulations that would specifically cover biohazards are warranted. OSHA endorses the BSCC definitions of \"intergeneric (new) organism\" and \"pathogen\" found in the preamble, believing they describe the microorganism appropriate for review when environmental or agricultural ap plications of microor ganisms are contemplated. For contained commercial manufacturing processe s, these definitions may also properly exclude from review certain microorganisms of known low risk. OSHA is committed to the policy described in the section entitled \"International Aspects\" in the Office of Science and Technology Policy Genera l Preamble, published in today's Federal Register. B. Guidelines As stated above, section 5(a) of the OSH Act requires that each employer: (1) Shall furnish to each of his employees em ployment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees; (2) Shall comply with occupational safety and health standards under this Act. Specific standards which ma y be applicable include: Specific air contaminants (29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart Z). Access to employee exposure and medical records (29 CFR 1910.20). Hazard communication (29 CFR 1910.1200). Exposure to toxic chemicals in laboratories (currently in draft and under development). Respiratory protection (29 CFR 191 0.134) (currently being updated). Safety standards of a general nature, for ex ample, general envir onmental, walking and working surfaces, fire protection, compressed gase s, electrical safety, and material handling and storage contained in 29 CFR Part 1910 Subparts J, D, E and L, H, S and N). Effective biological safety and health programs ha ve been operative in a variety of laboratories for many years. Motivation and critical judgment ar e necessary in addition to specific safety and health knowledge to ensure protection of personnel, the public and the environment. All personnel directly involved in bi otechnological projects should r eceive adequate instruction so that the potential biohazards can be understood and appreciated. Emergency plans should be formulated for each project where the chemical s used or biotechnical product produced pose a potential safety or health hazard. The plans should describe the procedures to be followed if an accident contaminates personnel or workplaces. If a research group is working with a known pathogen for which an effective vaccine is available, employees should be immunized, as appropriate. Before biotechnological work is undertaken, it is important that management determine the potential hazards involved and the precautions to be taken. Program and support staff should then be advised of the real and potential hazards. Staff should be instructed and trained in the protection and techniques require d to ensure safety and in the procedures for dealing with accidentally created hazards. Document 53 of 62.
