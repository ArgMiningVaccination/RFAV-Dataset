We know that a strong immune system helps keep us healthy. Physically, the immune system protects the body against disease, infection, and other potentially harmful substances. When functioning properly, the immune system distinguishes a variety of threats, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Key players in the immune system are white blood cells called lymphocytes, which include B-cells and T-cells, and leukocytes, which include macrophages and natural killer cells. Scientists have found that our immune system also has a special partnership with our microbiome. Symbiotic microbes that exist in our gut can stimulate the immune system and teach it where and how to act. In return, the immune system helps maintain the symbiotic relationship between the microbes and our body. When the alliance between the immune system and microbiota is healthy, both work together to protect the body from harmful bacteria and viruses. A common misconception about the immune system is that it shields us from unwanted energies and experiences. But that is the work of the pericardium system, an energetic system that has a physical counterpart\u2014namely the pericardium\u2014a membrane that protects the heart. The pericardium system shields us from unwanted energies that threaten to enter our lives and our body. The immune system protects us by neutralizing, disabling, dismembering, or deactivating harmful and unwanted energies and substances that have penetrated the shielding. They're now something we have to deal with directly, and the immune system helps us do that. Neither the pericardium system nor the immune system is limited to the physical body. The aura is a key player in our physical body's defense. The various layers of the aura are like a series of walls that surround the castle. These layers, which correspond to the subtle bodies\u2014namely the emotional, memory, and mental bodies\u2014also act as filters. They help determine which experiences to call into your life and which to deflect. The aura helps protect us from non-physical threats. The energetic pericardium system provides a shield against negative thoughts and emotions of others. The energetic immune system helps disable and remove unwanted, foreign, and unnecessary energies and experiences including negative thoughts and emotions that may have intruded into your space. In this way, your immune system works to keep you healthy energetically as well as physically. In the emotional body, the immune system protects us from other people's adverse emotions. In the memory body, the system guards us from buying into versions of the past that don't feel authentic. We each need to accept our past so that we can preserve the wisdom gained from our previous experiences. In the mental body, the immune system helps prevent us from succumbing to the effects of negative thoughts, as well as various potentially harmful energies in the environment. Healing Gemstones for the Immune System If you'd like to give your immune system energetic support, working with its vitalizing gemstones is an excellent way to do so. The two gemstones associated with this system are symbiotic Bloodstone and Red Coral. [Bloodstone vitalizes the immune system by supporting important immune-regulating factors in the bloodstream and normalizing body ecology. This vitalizes the microbiota and also helps them resonate with immune system cells so they can work better together.](https://gemstonetherapyinstitute.org/product/bloodstone-red-coral-necklace/) Normalizing body ecology may seem like a trivial contribution for protection against all the potential negativity in the world. But when harmony exists within the body, it's more likely to exist outside of it too. In addition, as our inner ecology detoxifies and achieves greater health, our connection with Earth evolves. This makes available to us a vast amount of resources our planet can provide energetically that make us stronger and ultimately less susceptible to harmful influences. Normalizing body ecology also supports nutrient absorption in the digestive system and toxin removal in the eliminatory system. It supports the immune system by clarifying the identity of your own unique vibrations so that foreign ones can be more easily identified. Red Coral nourishes the body's powerhouse, which is our underlying energetic source of strength and protection. This powerhouse is also known as the \"hara,\" which means \"ocean of energy.\" It is the center of chi, or life energy, in the body. Our powerhouse generates the movement of all energy in the body, including the chakra vortexes, central chakra channel, and meridians. It also fortifies and regenerates the aura\u2014the true first line of defense for our body. By strengthening these energy flows, Red Coral energy allows you to enjoy life at a new and higher level of vibration and health. Not coincidentally, Red Coral also comes from the ocean. We purchase it from responsible harvesters in the Mediterranean and use as little as we possibly can. Red Coral's energy has an affinity with the mitochondria, which are responsible for providing energy to the cells. Red Coral can also help increase the flow of molecular-level energies, which tend to slow down with age and environmental stress. What Does It Mean to Normalize Body Ecology? The human body carries millions of microorganisms that thrive in our body. Growing evidence\u2014from both scientific and energetic research\u2014shows that imbalances in their communities can result in symptoms we associate with cold, flu, and other upsets\u2014without the influence of an outside pathogen. Correcting imbalances can take a great deal of energy because it requires a change in the inherent patterns and trends that put these symbiotic partners out of balance. We need to shift the direction our body has been going in. Making those changes can draw reserves from our powerhouse, which is why we incorporate symbiotic Red Coral with Bloodstone. Benefits of Wearing Bloodstone & Red Coral Together, Bloodstone and Red Coral are an effective gemstone formula for vitalizing all aspects of the immune system. Wearing [Bloodstone & Red Coral](https://gemstonetherapyinstitute.org/product/bloodstone-red-coral-necklace/) can help your body find internal balance and harmony. This supports the body's immune resources, which helps normalize body ecology. Your own unique vibrations become clearer and more well-defined. Your connection to the earth gets stronger. As a result, you'll be less susceptible to foreign threats and harmful influences. Wear Bloodstone & Red Coral when you want to help your body release toxins, deflect infection, or ward off potential threats; rally your body's own resources to help get rid of unwanted energies; and support your body's healthy molecular processes. By balancing body ecology, these gemstones can also aid in the correction of chronic metabolic imbalances from an energetic perspective. These include physical imbalances such as those that involve pH and electrolyte levels, hormones, and other biochemicals. Next time you find yourself in need of immune support, try wearing a Bloodstone & Red Coral necklace for its many healing benefits. You'll need to wear it over the course of several months for best effects. Wearing these gemstones not only helps you feel better and stay healthy but can also protect you from threats you might not even be aware are there. By giving you the inner fortitude you need, Bloodstone & Red Coral can help you feel less vulnerable to outside influences and more equipped to thrive in a challenging world. What Is Therapeutic-Quality Bloodstone? [Individual spheres of Bloodstone are of therapeutic quality when they have a deep forest green color with splotches of red. It is extremely difficult to get Bloodstone that is purely green with red markings. Most of it is riddled with white dots or clouds, which dulls the gems' effects. You can imagine our excitement when we received a parcel that had a significant amount of stones we liked. Of course, we inspected each and every bead, culling the ones with poorly shaped drill holes, dents, white spots, and those devoid of red.](https://gemstonetherapyinstitute.org/product/bloodstone-red-coral-necklace/) Every single sphere in our Bloodstone necklaces has at least some red in it. The highest quality beads have a greater quantity of red with a sharper contrast. The higher the amount of red in the stones, the better the gems activate the molecular level. "}
