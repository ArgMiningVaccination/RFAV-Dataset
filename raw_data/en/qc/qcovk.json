They engage with male and female Indigenous homeless clients to secure housing, develop a crisis plan, access services, and foster a greater sense of cultural awareness. Housing Support Services Support for our clients doesn't stop once they've transitioned to permanent housing. Our Housing Aftercare and Big-Eya-Waah-Anduyaun programs have teams of dedicated workers that offer a wide range of support from eviction prevention and housing maintenance to mental and physical health, community integration, spiritual needs, and general support. The overall goal of these programs is to ensure that homeless individuals effectively transition into housing and build their stability by addressing all elements of their health and well-being using an indigenous approach. Mino Kaanjigoowin: Changing My Direction In Life Mino Kaanjigoowin means finding the good to change yourself or your direction in life. This intensive program helps clients with severe mental illness or addiction issues. From a holistic perspective, we meet the men where they're at, weaving in connection to culture and spirituality through the Medicine Wheel teachings to support them along their path. As with all Na-Me-Res programs, we help men find housing and create a life with the right direction. Auduzhe Mino Nesewinong Auduzhe Mino Nesewinong means place of healthy breathing.

NILO - Native Inmate Liasion Officers The NILO program provides outreach support to indigenous men who are incarcerated. Our liaison officers visit inmates to provide counseling, cultural connection, and support. It is an essential service for clients to provide resources for education, employment, housing, health, or other needs following their release. Cultural and spiritual resources include healing and wellness activities such as sweat lodge ceremonies, healing circles, smudging, and drumming. This ensures indigenous men have the same access afforded to other faith groups. The program also delivers indigenous cultural training for prison staff to foster greater understanding.

It helps clients develop the life skills needed to maintain stable housing, find employment and build community.

Ngim Kowa Njichaag: Reclaiming My Spirit The Ngim Kowa Njichaag program aims to assist all Na-Me-Res clients in claiming their culture, identity, role, and responsibilities. Re-connecting with their culture is vital for our clients. It helps them increase self-esteem, find community and meet their goals. All ceremonies are provided in a healing environment and facilitated by an Oshkabaywis (spiritual helper.) Medicine Wheel Garden The Medicine Wheel Garden is Toronto's first Aboriginal community garden. It began in 2013 when Elder Jacqui Lavalley named this green space \"Mashkikii;aki'ing\" (Medicine Earth). It is a one-of-a-kind sacred space that gives the men of the Apaenmowineen program an opportunity to learn more about gardening and Aboriginal medicinal plants. It nurtures teamwork, healthy living, and employment skills. They also reap the rewards of their hard work as the harvested plants and vegetables are used for cooking healthy meals for the Na-Me-Res residences. Growth in this garden comes not only from the plants but also from the participants' hearts. The Espaniel/Menzies Education Fund The Espaniel/Menzies Education Fund offers an annual bursary to two Indigenous men to help them further their education through secondary, post-secondary, or apprenticeship programs. These $500 awards can be used towards school-related expenses such as tuition, books, supplies, or transportation.
