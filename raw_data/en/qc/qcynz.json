Waitemata District Health Board (DHB) Community Alcohol and Drug Service (CADS) Pregnancy and Parenting Servic e (PPS) provides an intensive assertive outreach case coordination service for parents of children aged under three -years -old and pregnant women who are experiencing problems with alcohol and other drugs that are poorly connected to health and social servi ces. HPA commissioned an independent process evaluation in order to understand more about the PPS model and explore considerations for service replication in other regions. Findings are summarised in this report. PPS aims to reduc e harm and improv e the wellbeing of children by addressing the needs of parents and working to strengthen the family environment. The service is targeted at families experiencing multiple and complex issues related to, for example , alcohol and other drugs, stigma, mental and physi cal health, pregnancy, poverty, parenting, family violence and abuse including child neglect and abuse, custody issues, fear of involvement with child welfare agencies and criminal involvement ( Community Alcohol and Drug Service [ CADS ], 2013). PPS is deliv ered by a 5-Full Time Equivalent (FTE) team of nurses and a part -time peer support worker, supported by a team leader, a part -time psychiatrist (.2FTE) and a part-time psychologist (.2FTE). The team is expanding and will include other disciplines in future . , being 54% of the client group for the 2012 -2014 period. A key rationale in providing this resource intensive service is the emerging evidence indicating that the best return on investment comes from early intervention i.e. under five years. Evaluation findings suggest that the PPS model of service provides an example of a promising approach to red ucing harm for children at risk and supporting equity of access to addiction treatment. Findings indicate that PPS is operating as intended and is successfully reaching and engaging the intended target audience. The service objectives and approach align wi th Government goals and are underpinned by available evidence. In consideration of replicating the PPS approach , the identified key success factors and challenges summarised below will need to be accounted for. Key factors linked to the success of PPS in clude: An evidence -based service objective : PPS aims to prevent and reduce harm to children aged under three -years -old. There is evidence to support early intervention with infants and children u ' environment . 8 Effective en gagement of the target client group: u u u u u who are not otherwise accessing CADS or any other alcohol and other drug (AOD) service . The PPS model . Critical aspec ts of the PPS model include: a service philosophy/principles : Incorporating a strengths focus, a non - stigmatising approach and a broad scope encompassing multiple complex issues accessibility is enabled; 3 9% of PPS clients self -refer assertive outreach : An assertive outreach approach supports accessibility and ongoing engagement; approximately 50% of clients are engaged for 6 - 18 months and a further 30% for longer intensive case management , open ended, provided to a capped caseload . This enables clients and families to make real gains robust risk management combined with a team approach . PPS multi - disciplinary team meeting and clear risk assessment and management processes are key mechanisms within the model strong effective relationships with other services : the PPS model relies on this aspect of service delivery. Professional Workforce and robust organisational infrastructure . PPS is provided by a professional workforce supported by strong leadership and sited within a robust organisation where senior mana gers support and advocate for the service to ensure it is sustained. Key challenges in providing a PPS type service include: Recruitment and lead in time : Recruiting staff who can work across the broad scope of PPS is challenging and the time needed to ge t staff up to full speed must be accounted for. Staff support and development : Robust staff support, supervision and training mechanisms are required. Systems must prioritise staff health and safety. Capacity : Making best use of limited service capacity r equires active ongoing management to ensure that the service is provided to those who need it in sufficient intensity and duration to effect change. Inclusion of , or access to peer - support in the disengagement/discharge phase can assist this. Overheads: Inefficiency arises from having a small mobile team covering a wide geographical area. This challenge is likely to apply anywhere in New Zealand. Time intensive risk management practices are a further essential overhead to factor in. While the costs were ac knowledged, the requirements of having a co - located team and time -intensive risk management practices were consistently emphasised. Locating the service with in an organisational ' ' : A service such as PPS needs to sit within a strong organisation. Given the broad scope of the service , locating it within a non -addiction service could work provided the home organisation supports the broad scope and the clients are well supported to address their AOD related issues . 9 Key informants universally support the development of PPS -type services in areas of high need. The experience that has accrued from Waitemata DHB CADS PPS provides a useful blueprint for a promising model. The lessons learned and the expertise now available within CADS could provide invaluable support for further development. 10 INTRODUCTION Reducing harm for children affected by parental addiction and reducing unequal access to addiction services are key priorities for HPA . HPA is interested in how specialist services can better meet the needs of pregnant women facing multiple issues including family violence, addiction, health issues , including those related to antenatal care, inadequate housing and lack of social support. Waitemat a DHB CADS provides an Auckland -based outreach PPS service for parents of children under the age of three and pregnant women who are poorly connected to health and social services and who are experiencing problems with alcohol and other drugs . The aim of PPS is to reduce risk and improve outcomes for the children. PPS is the only service of its kind in New Zealand and the PPS model of service is viewed by many stakeholders as gold standard. The service covers a wide geographical area in the Auckland metropolitan region covering the resident populations of Waitemata D HB, Auckland DHB and Counties Manukau DHB which cov er approximately 1,415,550 people as at the 2013 Census (Statistics New Zealand, 2013) . PPS provides case consultation, coordination and case management services to approximately 100 clients per year. HPA commissioned Health and Safety Developments to undertake a process evaluation1 of PPS in order to understand more about the service model, identify implementation successes and challenges , and explore considerations for service replication in other regions . The evaluation took place during the period from November 2014 to March 2015. 1 A process evaluation is being undertaken on the understanding that an outcomes evaluation of PPS is int ended in the 11 EVALUATION OBJECTIVE S AND PROCESSES The evaluation objectives are to identify: core service components and delivery mechanisms of PPS key service implementation successes and challenges considerations for service replication into other regions. Evaluation processes included: Review of key documentation: R elevant documentation on the development of the service and current operations was sourced in discussion with the PPS clinical team leader and CADS senior management. Documents were reviewed , and relevant content or reference to this is summarised in this report. Key informant interviews: A ll PPS staff, relevant CADS senior staff and a wide range of external stakeholder represe ntatives were invited via email to contribute to the evaluation by participating in a one on one interview. Informed consent procedures were followed with those who elected to participate. A written summary of the interview was provided to each participant to verify accuracy and comprehensiveness. Interview results were analysed for key themes which are summarised in this report. Analysis of relevant service data: D ata pertaining to the client population and service utilisation was sourced via Waitemata DHB . Key points from the analysis are outlined in this report. RESULTS Data obtained Data were obtained as follows: A total of 17 key informant interviews were undertaken, 12 of these were with PPS team members, CA DS senior staff and senior management (referr ed to in this report as CADS key informant s). Seven professional ext ernal stakeholders were interviewed (referred to as external key informant s) representing the following services and roles that interface with PPS: DHB maternal mental health service . Comm unity -based parent education and support service . Child Youth and Family Service . Community health service working mainly with Pasifika families . DHB midwifery advisor . Community -based co -existing disorders service . M community development serv ice. 12 PPS data for 2012 -2014 were provided by CADS for new, exit, and entry clients for each annual period. Data include demographic characteristics, referral sources, diagnostic information, episodes of care and discharge information. Documentation: Documents provided by CADS were reviewed for the evaluation . These included: Client Pathway Pregnancy & Parental Service - CADS. (Waitemata District Health Board, 2013) Ministry of Health and Waitemata DHB Service Agreement (Ministry of Health, CADS WDHB Soci al Bond Pilot Response Form December 2013. Ministry of Health Registration of Interest For Service Outcomes and Service Provi ders(Community Alcohol and Drug Service, 2013) Parental Alcohol and Drug Service : Its History and Future Vision (Community Alcohol and Drug Service, 2013) Initial Proposal for the Establishment of a Specialist Pregnancy Support Team with Auckland Regional Alcohol & Drug Services (Cavanagh, 2000) 13 THE PPS SERVICE: COR E COMPONENTS AND DEL IVERY MECHANISMS As noted above, PPS is an Aucklan d-based outreach service for parents of children under the age of three and pregnant women who are poorly connected to health and social services and who are experiencing problems with alcohol and other drugs. The aim of the service is to reduce risk and i mprove outcomes for the children. As noted in CADS documentation: The focus on infants under the age of three is informed by research which states that eighty percent of a child's core brain function develops in the first three years of life and that the environments the infants are raised in will impact on how they develop essential social and psychological abilities to be successful later in life and as adults. (CADS, 2013 ,p.4) The following service specifications from the National Service Specification Framework apply to PPS: Tier 1 Mental Health and A ddiction. Tier 2 Addiction S ervices. Tier 3 Community Based Alcohol and Drug Services. PPS is delivered by a 5 -Full Time Equivalent ( FTE) team of clinicians (nurses ) and a part - time peer support worker, s upported by a team leader, a part -time psychiatrist (.2FTE) and a part-time psychologist (.2FTE) .2 The service operates five days per week, Monday to Friday, 0830 -1700 hours. The team services approximately 100 clients per year and approximately 10% of these may be offered peer support. PRACTICE PRINCIPLES Practice principles on which the service is based are: provid ing services in a flexible, non -judgemental and client -focused way supporting parents and u self efficacy, empowerment and recovery adhering to , and implementing the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi using a harm reduction approach utilising a strengths/resilience -based model practising from a social justice perspective and working wit hin a bio/psycho/social/spiritual model improving outcomes for the unborn child and children. 2 During this evaluation PPS was poised to undergo a period of significant growth. The evaluation has focussed on PPS up to the end of 2014 . 14 INTERVENTIONS PPS nurse clinicians work with a capped caseload of up to 12 clients and their families providing the following : assertive outreach /client engagem ent assessment and management of biopsychosocial risk areas for parents and children . comprehensive assessment and interventions including treating or referring for treatment of alcohol and other drug abuse or dependence; reducing substance abuse impact on pregnancy, connecting pregnant women with antenatal care, improving infant parenting skills, including infant attachment and lactation; preventing infant ill -health including Sudden Unexpected Death of an Infant (SUDI) Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders and Shaken Baby Syndrome; addressing domestic violence; improving general parenting skills; promoting early childhood education; improving mental health; addressing cognitive impairment and physical problems; addressing child care and protection and custod y issues; addressing criminal involvement and other legal issues; working inclusively with family, u and significant others . interventions addressing gambling and nicotine use including Nicotine Replacement Therapy using the Quit Card system. formul ation and treatment planning with regular comprehensive multi -disciplinary team review s of goals, treatment and risk management . long term case management including overall responsibility for coordinating the care that clients receive, organising regular stakeholder meetings, following up with services on agreed interventions and working with clients to facilitate their engagement with other services and to develop sustainable support networks . supporting the links between clients and services by referral or liaison; u ; u ' complex needs through advice, education, advocacy and de -stigmatisation of this group. implementing key psychosocial strategies focused on reducing substance abuse and fam ily violence, improving problem -solving skills, and improving infant care and parental skills. planned discharge, including transfer of care to other agencies and local community support. The PPS psychiatrist provides: client assessment and pharmacolo gical interventions (as needed for clients not involved with mental health services) including referral for those who need mental health services consultation for PPS clinicians support/expertise with regards to team reviews of client risk and treatment (s ee MDT review below) consultation and liaison with mental health services. The PPS psychologist provides: 15 client assessments and interventions consultation for PPS clinicians with treatment planning and psychosocial interventions support/expertise with r egards to team reviews of client risk and treatment (see Multi -Disciplinary Team ( MDT ) review below). The peer support worker : models positive recovery to enhance clients ' self-efficacy supports clients to engage with the wider community, and support clie nts through regular peer groups. Figure 1 below sets out a detailed summary of the key areas which PPS addresses and specifies the outcomes sought in each of these areas. Within these key areas, the service is tailored to the needs of the clients and their children (born and unborn). Accordingly the duration of involvement with PPS varies from client to client. 16 Figure 1. PPS Model3 3 CADS , 201 3:20 17 KEY COMPONENTS OF PPS CLINICAL PATHWAY Clients are referred to PPS via multiple4 avenues including se lf-referral ( 39% of PPS clients self-refer). Self-referral clients have typically heard about the service through friends or family members who have previously been clients. Following referral , an assertive outreach approach is taken as required with the a im of engaging the client and undertaking an assessment to determine the services (including PPS service) required. Once the client is engaged , an assessment (generally undertaken in the community by two PPS clinician s as a safety measure ) occurs within the first two face -to-face contacts. The PPS standard assessment form guides the assessment process. The outcome of the assessment is a negotiated goal plan (PPS Goal Plan)5, developed in collaboration with the client. The goal plan is reviewed at each con tact and is reviewed by the whole team at the MDT meeting not less than three -monthly (see below MDT review) . Typically clients need services from a variety of agencies and PPS takes an overall coordination and monitoring role within a framework of providi ng active ongoing support and education. T ' u PPS Client Pathway states that discharge occurs when goals have been achieved or when the client indicates they do not want further contact with the service. An ov erview of the PPS clinical pathway is shown in Figure 2 Appendix 1. PEER SUPPORT Peer support is a supplementary service within PPS offered to clients where there is an identified need. Typically this occurs when clients have been engaged with a PPS clinic ian for an extended period and are within three to six months from discharge due to having progressed towards their goals . PPS peer s upport aims are: clients experience increased self esteem clients are supported to connect and engage with the wider commun ity clients are supported to disengage with PPS (discharge planning). 4 Referrers include lead maternity carers, hospital social workers, mental health services, Child Youth and Family and non - government organisations. 5 Further information on PPS forms including risk summary and goal planning forms can be obtained from CADS PPS Team Leader. 490670v6 18 MDT REVIEW PPS holds an MDT meeting weekly to provide team input and oversight for all PPS clients. Reviews are undertaken as follows: After initial assessment and not less than three monthly thereafter. Before discharge (planned or unplanned). At the request of the client or clinician. T u ' be tracked by reading the MDT form, risk summary and goal plans. RISK MANAGEMENT AND RISK R EVIEW MEETING Risk identification, monitoring and management are key focus es in the service. The team attend s a weekly risk review meeting where all new or increased risk is presented and discussed. The Client Pathway Pregnancy & Parental Service - CADS (Waitemata District Health, 2013 ) stipulates that: clients are reviewed at the risk meeting if they did not attend (DNA) or cancel led three appointments clients are reviewed at the risk meeting if there has been no contact for six weeks or if there are concern s regarding lack of contact prior to six weeks plans resulting from the risk review meeting are documented on the risk summary. MORNING RISK CHECK -IN MEETING In addition to the risk management and risk review meeting , the team begin s each morning with a ri sk check -in meeting. If any risks are identified the team devise s a management plan. FLEXI -FUND The service administers a small flexi -fund of $10,000 per annum. The fund is used to support a need linked to ' u benefits. 490670v6 19 HOW AND WHY PPS WAS DEVELOPED Service documents and information from key informants indicate that PPS was initiated in 2000 , prompted by an initial proposal from a clinician based in the Auckland Regional Methadone Service (Cavanagh, 2000). The proposal put forward a rationale based on international data suggesting the likelihood of a large untreated population of at risk women and children in Auckland. The proposal and other early documentation6 indicated that there was a need to reach pregnan t women who were using substances in ways that put children at risk, and specifically to address: poor identification of pregnant or parenting women with substance use issues multiple barriers to accessing treatment including lack of transport and childcar e and lack of information about treatment options poor retention in treatment attributed to stigma and uncoordinated services. Initially the proposed service was aimed at developing a pregnancy specialist service providing case management support for CADS services and education and liaison for professionals (CADS and external). CADS succeeded in g aining funding for the service and the PPS7 start-up team comprised two clinicians and one team leader8. CADS grew the team over time to the current 5FTE in the PP S team by re-allocating resources within the organisation. CADS had internal strategy of allocating resources to front line and this helped to grow the service. CADS key informant As the service evolved , the focus shifted to providing more direct access a nd case management services to clients , referring clients to other CADS services and other AOD treatment services for their addiction -related treatment needs. This represented a n important change of pathway, in that PPS began to access clients that were hi gh risk and who were not accessing CADS services, rather than accessing clients already engaged with CADS. The PPS model has been refined over time and has been informed by some key reports and examples of similar services . The report on the investigatio n into the death of Riri -o-te-Rangi (James) Whakaruru, written by the Office of the Commissioner for Children in 2000 was formative for PPS . This report among other things made a strong recommendation for improved communication and coordination of services where there was an identified risk to children. The PPS model has also been informed by North American approaches, namely the Parent Child Assistance Programme (PCAP), Seattle USA and The Sheway Programme, Vancouver Canada. For example: 6 Including a response to an RFP presented to the Health Funding Authority (no date) 7 The service was originally named the Parental Alcohol and Drug Service. 8 A further two clinicians were located in within Te Atea Marino and Tupu services. 490670v6 20 New model was i nformed in part by international models - Parent Child Assistance Programme (PCAP) Seattle USA; The Sheway Programme, Vancouver Canada an example of a home based service. CADS key informant A CADS literature review entitled Parental Alcohol and Drug Servic e: Its History and Future Vision (n.d.) undertaken by CAD S early in the life of PPS refers to an evaluation report on the Sheway outreach programme as an example of emerging best practice . The Sheway project evaluation report (Poole, 2000) indicated that t he Sheway service was successfully engaging women experiencing a range of complex and serious health and social issues, engaging them in pre and postnatal care and helping them in relation to a range of issues .This achiev ed particular success in the areas of housing stability, nutrition and retaining care of their children. PPS has been informed by the Sheway model in terms of the overall approach and utilises some of the tools and processes developed by Sheway. This was noted by CADS key informants as a pr oviding a key foundation for PPS, for example: Access to a model - that has been inspirational. PPS has taken ownership of the model and they have built a profile. The model has provided a framework for the work of the service, recognition and validation; enabled the service to consolidate. CADS key informant Staff who have been involved with PPS over a long time commented that the service has evolved with a view to continuous improvement . BROAD INDIC ATORS OF EFFECTIVENES S To date CADS has relied on broad indicators to gauge the effectiveness of PPS in reducing the harm to children (A formal outcomes evaluation of PPS is in the planning stage). PPS and CADS manage rs monitor events within the client population such as shaken babies and other serious injurie s and deaths resulting from abuse and SUDI . As an example, approximately 10 years ago four babies from PPS families died within a period of a less than one year. While a review confirmed that this rate of infant death was within the expected range for the client population , PPS sought to improve practices in educating clients on SUDI and shaken babies. As part of this , two educational resources were developed specifically for PPS, 'Safe Sleep for Baby ' and 'Never Shake a Baby '9. These are now used routinely . There has been one infant death in the subsequent 10 -year period. The following comment illustrates how indicators are used: We look at statistics for broad indicators of success - for example: SUDI; domestic violence; children killed by caregivers. Whe n we look at rates of death and injury in our client group , the absence of these is a good indicator that our service is working. Typically we would expect to see certain levels or instances of these [poor] outcomes in our client group. The indicators are rough - we want to make intergenerational 9 An electronic copy of these resources can be obtained from CA DS PPS . 490670v6 21 change and we have no way yet of measuring whether we are making a difference to that. We are working on developing an outcomes measurement tool. CADS key informant RATIONALE FOR INVESTMENT IN EARLY INTERVENTION PPS is a resource intensive service. For example, approximately 100 clients (and their families) access PPS annually and based on most recent information this is at a cost of approximately $1.8million.10 Recognition of the importance of investing in early int ervention for under three -year-olds is a key driver . For example: The service is important - this target group is an important group for the sector to invest in. We've had it wrong for a long time - we have made a big investment in adults who often have en trenched problems; there is very modest return for society. There is growing argument that the best return on investment is early intervention i.e. 0 - 5 years. CADS key informant CADS management acknowledge d that the decision to invest in a low -volume hi gh-intensity service has to be defendable. They draw on supporting evidence and not e that the PPS model aligns well with government policy in the area of vulnerable children. For example, the White Paper on Vulnerable Children : Volume I states that: We nee d to find, assess, and connect the most vulnerable children to services earlier and better. (Ministry of Social Development, 2012, p 9) The White P aper u k \" u - \" approaches which are broad and flexibl e and can respond effectively to the wide range of related factors that can affect child development. CADS key informants pointed to the work of James Heckman (2015) , Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago and an internationally recognised exp ert in economics of human development. H k ' support of the economic benefits of investment in the well -being of children in the 0 -3 age group. Critically the evidence supports the cost benefit of investing in earl y intervention for children rather than in rehabilitation services later in life. A key message is the importance of focusing on the family environment in which the child is situated, utilising home visits and focusing on the quality of paren ting. PPS refl ects much of this . The following comment is typical : Strong focus on preventing further harm particularly for the 0 - 3 group. It is the right approach for working with families with complex needs. Children are at risk of brain damage, violence, trauma an d death - this service works to prevent those things; 10 Based on contract price for the 2014 - 2015 contract extension of PPS which indicates the cost of 6FTE across PPS roles (Email from CADS Regional Manager to Ministry of Health, December 2014) . 490670v6 22 keep kids in homes and take kids out of the home if it becomes untenable for them to stay. CADS key informant New Zealand research, specifically the Dunedin Study11 was also cited by CADS key informants as evidence that supports the PPS approach, particularly in relation to the positive outcomes that can ensue from modifying the environment in which children are developing. Modifying the environment in a positive way remains the key for influencing how people's lives turn out...... The environment is where the action is. (Poulton, 2008 , p.5) 11 See: The Dunedin Study . Available at: http://dunedinstudy.otago.ac.nz 490670v6 23 PPS CLIENT GROUP Data , information from documentation and comment from CADS and external stakeholders have been compiled and analysed to provide a profile of the clien t group served by PPS. THE TARGET GROUP The client group that PPS serves is described as having: .... multiple complex and interacting issues which include: medical complications related to mother and infant health, mental health and substance abuse or depen dence disorders, personality disorders, cognitive impairments, history of suicide and self -harm attempts, history of childhood neglect or abuse, low educational achievements, history of domestic violence and poverty, lack of adequate housing, current and p ast criminal charges, current and past child protection agency involvement, history of poor service uptake (including maternity services) or multi -generational dysfunctional family patterns . The male partners of the clients of this service have similar is sues, their legal issues often involving charges relating to violent crime and drug convictions . (CADS , 2013, p. 5) The service is targeted at those who are not well engaged with services for a number of reasons including AOD issues, mental health issues, poverty, limited access to transport, lack of childcare, fear of stigma and judgement and fear of involvement with child welfare agencies (CADS, 2013) . Key informants confirm that this is the group that PPS is serving, for example: PPS manage s the most co mplex end of the spectrum - involved with CYFS, women with high levels of distress; a high risk area. External key informant PPS CLIENT DEMOGRAPH ICS Data pertaining to PPS clients for 2012, 2013 and 2014 calendar years show that PPS has seen a total of 11 9, 129 and 140 clients per year respectively, a total of 388 clients. All clients but one were female. The majority of clients predictably fall within the child -bearing age range; 55% of clients were aged between 21 to 30 years with a further 34% being age d 31 to 40 years. Numbers of clients aged between 13 to 20 are small (20 in total over three years) with an average of 5% of the total client group being in this age bracket . Similarly those aged over 40 years represent an average of 6% of the client group over three years (23 clients in total). This is shown in Chart 1 below. 490670v6 24 Chart 1. PPS clients by age, 2012 -2014 , being 54% of the client group for the 2012 to 2014 period. The next largest group is NZ European/Pa k T k (3%), Samoan (1%) and Other (2%). This is shown in Chart 2 below. Chart 2. PPS clients by ethnicity, 2012 -2014 Most PPS clients live in areas with a high dep rivation index.12 In the 2012 to 2014 period 79% of clients lived in areas with a decile rating of 6 or grea ter with 32% living in a decile 10 area (the highest level of deprivation). Data are shown in Chart 3 below. 12 The New Zealand Deprivation Index is a measure of the level of socioeconomic deprivation in small geograph ic areas . The index ranges from 1 to 10. A score of 1 indicates that people are living in the least deprived 10 percent (decile) of New Zealand. A score of 10 indicates that people are living in the most deprived 10 percent . The deprivation index uses Census data for car and telephone access; receipt of means -tested benefits; unemployment; ho usehold income; sole parenting; educational qualifications; home ownership and home living space. Salmond et al. 2007 cited Island Maori Niuean Other 490670v6 25 Chart 3. % PPS clients by deprivation index, 2012 -2014 ISSUES EXPERIENCED B Y PPS CLIENTS There is very limited quantitative data on the nature of the issues experienced by PPS clients. All of the key informants (internal and external to CADS) spoke of the complexity and severity of the issu es which most clients are experiencing which bring them into contact with PPS. The following comments provide examples: ....the families can be all over the place. External key informant PPS is working with a clientele wh o have a high profile; risk of death, neglect of children, violence etc; there is potential for things to go very badly.....[The] focus is on multiple issues; complexity not necessarily acuity. CADS key informant PPS works on overcoming the barriers that the clients face, for example, transport, physical health, housing, justice issues, custody issues, violence; history of abuse. External key informant Key informants note family and nau relationship issues, including child safety and other parenting issu es and family violence issues and trauma (current and historic al) as being highly prevalent. An estimated 20 notifications per annum are made by PPS to Child Youth and Family Services. The following comments are indicative of some of the issues is very hard to know that sometimes your client cannot parent their child and you are part of the team decision to remove the child from the home. This is a hard thing to sit with. CADS key informant Ninety percent of our clients have a history of t rauma and abuse; we are often working alongside the perpetrators - there is a lot of family violence among the client group. CADS key informant [A challenge can be]......getting up to speed in the role - working with domestic violence; working with the risk in volved with AOD and child protection; the legal stuff - the FGC (family group conference), Family Court, lawyers, trespass order, custody issues, protection order - you have to understand all of these things. CADS key informant Domestic violence is a big f ocus, so staff need good knowledge of working with this. CADS key informant Limited a vailable data indicate that approximately 27% PPS clients ( 68 of 250 clients seen in the period 2012 to 2014 for whom data was available ) had contact with a mental health service. No specifics about the nature or duration of this contact were able to be accessed . PPS SERVICE ACCESS AND UTILISATI ON PPS service access and utilisation are outlined in the section below. Referral source Data for the period 2012 to 2014 show that over the three -year period 39% of PPS clients self-referred, making this the largest referral source category. A further 27% of clients are referred from within CADS. There is a large group, comprising 19% of all referrals, for whom the referral source is not specified. Other referral source categories are small with 5% being referred by Child Youth and Family Services, 3% from hospitals, 2% by lead maternity carers, 2% from other addiction services. Referrals from other groups comprise 1% or less. Results are shown in Chart 4 below. 490670v6 27 Chart 4. PPS referral sources, 2012 -2014 Appointment counts Data show that between 50 to 58% of clients who exit ed treatment 2012 -2014 received more than 21 appointments with PPS. The range for those receiving 10 -20 appointm ents was 16 to 21%. A range of 25 to 28% received 1 to 9 appointments. This demonstrates that a majority of clients are well engaged with PPS. Data are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1. No. of appointments per client for exit* clients 2012, 2013, 2014 2012 2013 9 14 34 7 11 14 42 11 6 11 39 clients are those who exited the service in the years 2012 - 2014. Appointment a ttendance rates Appointment attendance rates for clients exiting the service indicate that rates of attendance are high, between 77% and 82% over a three -year period. Again these data indicate a high level of engagement and support the effectiveness of th e assertive outreach approach. Data are shown in Table 2 below. Table 2.

Case coordination activities such as telephone cal ls, meetings with other u service and typically include work aimed at linking clients and u to services and groups as well as advocacy -related activities. This is a critical aspect of th (pysch) CYFS/CPS GP Hospital LMC 490670v6 28 Period of engagement Exit client data shown in Chart 5 below provide an indication of the expected periods of engagement for PPS clients. Data are fairly consistent across the three -year period and indicate that approximately 20% of clients are engaged for up to six months, a further 25% for up to 12 months and a further 25% for up to 18 months. Approximately 15% remain engaged for up to 24 months, with the rest staying engaged longer. Chart 5. PPS exit clients period of engagement, 2012, 2013, 2014 Reasons for discharge Data regarding reasons for discharge show that for the period 2012 to 2014 64% of those leaving PPS had completed treatment and 2% were transferred to another team or service provider. Just 14% are recorded as having an unplan ned discharge. For the remaining 20% (8 ) ' ' ( ) no data recorded (6%). This indicates that the majority of PPS clients have planned discharges on completion of treatment. Chart 6. Exit clients reasons for discharge, 2012 - 60% 70% Treatment completed Transferred to other Team Unplanned discharge Not specified Other No data 490670v6 29 STRENGTHS OF PPS There was a high level of agreement among stakeholders regarding the strengths of the service. Key themes are summarised below. SERVICE PHILOSOPHY , PRINCIPLES AND SER VICE OBJECTIVE Key informants consistently commented that the philosophy and principles that guide PPS are a key strength, emphasising that these support the service in achieving the objective of a positive outcome for the child. This objective is always paramount and guides all clinical decisions. For example: There is a clear objective of getting the best outcomes for at risk children - this is a very 'helpful compass' for clinical decision -making. The target group is the parents but the objective relates to children . CADS key informant A strength is the 'obsessive' focus on care and safety for children. CADS key informant Key questions consistently asked about practice are : \"Is this improving parenting\" and \"how will this improve outcomes for this child?\" CADS key in formant Viewing the client as a parent, within the social context of family and u relationships was noted as a key strength and , by some , as being somewhat unique to PPS as an addiction service. For example: PPS focus es on the relationship with the mother and the baby and supporting that relationship. Other addiction services including CADS services , don't have the capacity to do that - they work with the mother only not the relationship between the mother and baby. External key informant Got to hav e respect for culture; got to understand where the family fits in. CADS key informant PPS work s with the parent, recognise the 'mum' - accept and understand that the mum has responsibility for her kids. External key informant Additionally there is a strong u u u . This means that PPS is k u u u u . For example: The 'client' can become a lot of people ....partners, extended family etc.... so the caseload can be quite b ig. CADS key informant 490670v6 30 A focus on strengths13 and recovery and a strong non -stimatising, non -judgemental philosophy were highlighted by those both internal and external to CADS as critical to engaging and successfully working with PPS clients. The underpinn ing social justice principle was highlighted as being significant. For example: The peer team at [my service] like s working with PPS because the PPS clinical staff are very recovery focused. External key informant They go into homes. Don't wear a uniform. Sit and talk, listen to the women, really listen and don't patronise them. The women tell them stuff. They look at where to from here - they seem to have a very good procedure for that. External key informant The service is strengths -based, we don't judge the clients, they are already judged by so many others. CADS key informant There is a strong spirit of social justice in the team. There is a sense that everyone is striving for fairness. CADS key informant THE MODEL OF SERVICE The PPS model with its clea r target, wide scope and considerable flexibility was consistently noted as a key strength . The flexibility and scope of the service (referred to by some as ' k ') allow PPS to focus on what is important to the client which assists engagement and supports clients to achieve positive changes in their lives and the lives of their children. For example: They have a very genuine interest in helping the mothers with addiction or whatever they need. External key informant 'Can do' approach . Help wi th whatever - housing, courses, meetings etc. ..... They think outside the square. External key informant PPS works on overcoming the barriers that the clients face - e.g. transport, physical health, housing, justice issues, custody issues, violence; history of abuse. External key informant Flexibility of approach applies not just at the client interface but also in broader aspects of service operation for example: PPS gets involved in broad initiatives aimed at improving child health and safety. For example we are Pe -pi Pod distributors; we are starting to provide a Circle of Security 13 The following tools are used to support a strengths -based approach : Strengths cards ; Strengths profile ; Difference game (from the Parent -Child Assistance Program) and the Recovery capital tool . 490670v6 31 Programme (attachment programme). We are also involved in forums such as Te Aka Ora forum and COPMIA (Children of Parents with Mental Health and Addiction) advisory groups. CAD S key informant Critical aspects of the model identified by key informants included : the assertive outreach approach with a focus on engagement and intensive follow -up comprehensive intervention which is not time limited capped caseloads (approximately 12 families) supporting both of the above. CADS key informants consistently emphasised that the PPS model is built around the importance of engageme nt and that considerable effort and time are given to engaging clients in the service and remaining engaged wi th them . Clients are seen in the environment of their choice, typically this is at their home. Many attempts can be made to see a client before an assessment is completed and many attempts are made to re -engage clients who disengage in an unplanned way. The legitimising of this investment of resource is seen as key to PPS success in engaging a client group that is \" \" For example: Assertive outreach: includes going to the home, working intensively to build rapport and engag e people, hanging in there for as long as needed and providing practical help (this last aspect is very important). For some women this means that they make significant changes over the time that the service is involved. CADS key informant Outreach: we ta ke the time to engage clients. That process is seen as a legitimate part of the job. If you have to get in the car and go out to Manurewa to try to see a client that you can't get hold of that is not questioned, it's accepted. CADS key informant Outreach : this was huge; not the three strikes approach which most services have; clients really appreciated not being given up on ...... CADS key informant PPS work s in people's homes, in the community, not just in the office. You get a much better idea about what is going on with the client e.g. you can see the broken window. It is easier for people to be honest. External key informant Intensive assertive outreach: We go to them. Once we have the initial consent to contact we do a fair bit of chasing. We stay enga ged. CADS key informant 490670v6 32 The outreach approach was noted as being helpful with and Pacific clients, for example: The team doesn't engage all ori and Pacific clients but generally the assertive outreach approach seems to work well with ori and Pacific clients. CADS key informant Engage the clients; seem good across all c ultures; observe the protocols and have cultural sensitivity. External key informant CASE COORDINATION AND WORKING WELL WIT H OTHER SERVICES PPS clients generally need input from a range of services and coordinating this and working with other agencies is a key aspect of the PPS model. Many key informants commented on the importance of case coordination and noted that PPS do es this well. Coordination: this was very important; if we didn't do it a lot of things would go pear shaped. Services tend to work in isolation. CADS key informant We are very careful with our consent systems so that we are able to communicate with other services - there is heaps of paperwork. CADS key informant [Staff are] well connected to the community - they connect their clients to the right resources. Staff are expert in doing this. They know the community. Again you don't get that in CADS [other services]. External key informant The importance of developing and maintaining strong and effective relationships with other services was highlighted by all. For example: To work well with other services you have to be non -judgmental and diplomatic - it is the same as working with the clients in some ways. PPS does that well. We all had a genuine passion for the work and respect for ot hers. CADS key informant Staff have a sophisticated way of looking at and working with all of the issues that the clients may face. This includes handling significant tensions , for example, making CYF notifications while still keeping the client engaged; learning to navigate the inadequacies of CYF sometimes. CADS key informant PPS has high quality staff. They build relationships with stakeholders; don't judge the other services; present a balanced view of other services, including CYFS, to the client. Th ey don't try to exclude CYFS. Some services advocate so hard for the parents that this can overshadow the needs of the child; PPS doesn't do that. External key informant 490670v6 33 Really good with communication when co -working, also very prepared to look at 'who can do what' depending on what the client needs. Good at sharing information, for example, when a client was really hard to get hold of [the PPS nurse] knew her well, knew the family, knew where it was safe to see her etc. This helped us work with the client. External key informant STRONG ORGANISATIONA L INFRASTRUCTURE PPS sits within a large government health organisation. CADS key informants noted this as a key strength of the service, citing the robust management and clinical systems which exist within CAD S as essential to support the work of PPS. For example: CADS infrastructure has been helpful. PPS was set up in the context of a very well established service. CADS key informant The importance of attending to the managerial aspects of the service was noted by many, with strong management being cited as a key strength. For example: The governance model [is a strength] - strong clinical leadership and strong management. The senior managers have become businessmen; they wear a strong business hat. This is v ery important for sustaining and growi ng the service. CADS key informant It was noted that PPS is a somewhat unique service within the context of more traditional addiction treatment and that it falls to management to justify the approach in terms of effec tiveness and cost effectiveness (i.e. the value in taking a holistic approach and of investing in early intervention for under three -year olds) to ensure that the resources are there to sustain the service . For example: There is tension between running CAD S units which see 10,000 people per annum and running PPS which has an intense resource allocation for 100 clients per annum. CADS key informant Service advocacy is necessary. The team serves a small number of marginalised people, [there is a] high leve l of stigma for the clientele - hard to generate empathy for this client group. CADS key informant A further related point was the ability within CADS to link to the wider workforce, such as psychiatrist and psychologist input (beyond the small FTE alloca tion to PPS) and workforce development systems such as strong supervision systems. For example: Robust supervision arrangements: supervision is a priority, group supervision is provided and now there is a new clinical nurse specialist role to support the t eam. CADS key informant 490670v6 34 Staff support includes regular supervision, training opportunities, and opportunities to be involved in projects that give a break from client work, i.e. representing the service in vulnerable women's forums, doing service presenta tions to various organisations. Regular teaching/service presentation slots with midwifery and nursing students. Also teaching re garding AOD use in relation to pregnancy and parenting to various organisations. CADS key informant RISK MANAGEMENT SYST EM All CADS key informants noted the PPS risk management system as a strength of the service . The clear and comprehensive risk management approach in CADS was consistently noted as crucial to the effective and safe functioning of PPS. There is wide acknowledgem ent of the risks that must be identified and managed in delivering PPS. As noted above , this is reflected in the PPS client pathway , which includes continuous risk identification, monitoring and management by the clinician with structured input and oversig ht of the whole team. Documentation via the risk summary is an important mechanism of the system. CADS key informants also commented that these systems are of necessity , demanding and time consuming. For example: Our risk management systems are clear and e ffective - we assess risk of self - harm/suicide; harm to others - especially kids; harm from others - often the partner; medical/psychiatric status; pregnancy and substance use. We flag and review clients that disengage e .g. if not seen for six weeks or if DNA three times. (Likely to increase efforts at contact ). CADS key informant Flexibility of what the service can offer - skilled knowledgeable staff; solid systems - otherwise the service would be unsafe. There is a strong service and professional framewo rk; clear risk management. CADS key informant The MDT manages risk [via the MDT meeting]: we always look at the risk issues first and also every client is reviewed three -monthly. It is an opportunity to contain and share the issues; exchange ideas. It is a very long meeting and can be hard; people can get defensive; there is challenge sometimes regarding approaches etc. CADS key informant Things get done properly - good systems and accountability. I like that way of working. But it is time -consuming. Ou r notes are over the top - but that is not just our service, that is all services. CADS key informant The willingness of PPS to manage risk was noted as a stand out strength of the service by one external key informant: [They] manage the most complex end of the spectrum - involved with CYFS, women with high levels of distress; a high risk area - PPS acknowledge the risk and even when it is very high they 'do the right thing' - a lot of services would not take on the risk. External key informant 490670v6 35 Risk to st aff is also accounted for in PPS systems. Initial assessments are generally carried out in pairs and there are systems for reporting in to ensure that the service has knowledge of where staff are while they are working. In some circumstances staff safety c an be under threat, usually from the partner of a client. In these circumstances staff security is a priority. For example: We arrange special security measures if there is any suggestion that staff may be at risk. CADS key informant THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE STAFF AND THE SERVICE Staff are universally regarded as skilled, knowledgeable and experienced. CADS as an organi sation provides a structured approach and a professional framework . For example: They are very professional but this is not a barrier. Th e women trust them. Most of the women are ori and the nurses are Pakeha but it seems to work. They [the nurses] have an understanding and a willingness. External key informant They are all health professionals so that probably makes it easier. External key informant Staff are a strength. Extremely hard working; have a passion for the job - they are there because they want to be there. They really understand the issues. External key informant A high standard of professionalism is needed - the team is working with a very marginalised, stigmatised group. They have to be able to engage other services and advocate for the clients. This takes skill. CADS key informant STRONG CONSISTENT LE ADERSHIP Internal and external key informants noted that the leadership in PPS and CADS support the practice of the team. [The] team leader has given a lot of consideration to the leadership of the service. CADS key informant Having a dedicated team leader who has had ongoing commitment to the service has played a large part in the success of the service; having a good leader who stays around seems to be a feature in common with other successful smaller services in CADS. T he team leader is a strategic thinker who is also practical; no nonsense; takes the lead; reflects on wha t is happening and on their own leadership. Has knowledge of the clients. With a small team this seems to be do -able. CADS key informant 490670v6 36 Excellent manager, realistic, quick to respond and very knowledgeable. External key informant TEAM APPROACH A cohesiv e team approach is considered essential to provide a sustainable service and to ensure safety. The MDT meeting was noted by many as providing a key mechanism for implementing the team approach. For example: The MDT is one mechanism for keeping the objectiv e clear. All work comes under the eyes of the team, everyone has a voice; the team members remind each other of the objective. CADS key informant Overall the MDT provides support, a sounding board and a range of perspectives. CADS key informant Team supp ort is very good - this is the key to it. The MDT is a strength (although too long), everyone is acknowledged in the process. CADS key informant The challenges in a strong team approach were also noted. There is a requirement that individual clinicians wi ll follow the direction of the team and this at times presents issues and threatens professional autonomy. Team approach. Really important but need to guard against micro management. Collegial relationships were great and helped to sustain us in the work. CADS key informant You have to do what the team directs and that can be hard. CADS key informant PEER SUPPORT The peer support component of PPS was noted by many as a very useful addition to the clinical service and a key strength of the service . Peer s upport adds to the continuum of service; validates the centrality of the client. PPS has always been an innovative service, CADS consumer aspect is strong and the right person emerged. Potentially peer support could be provided externally to the team, prov ided there was a strong relationship with the peer support service. CADS key informant Peer support is a very important voice in the team; has been a fantastic addition. CADS key informant 490670v6 37 FLEXI -FUND Access to the flexi-fund was noted as a strength by som e key informants. As noted above this provides an additional resource to support clients with their goals and is used to support the purchase of items or services that will provide ongoing benefit to the client. For example : PPS has a flexi -fund. Usually o ther services look to us for funds when needed. External key informant 490670v6 38 CHALLENGES IN PROVID ING PPS Key informants were asked to comment on the challenges of providing PPS. Key themes are summarised below. CAPACITY OF A SMALL TEAM The limited capacity i nherent in such a small service was acknowledged by most key informants. In simple ter ms, this means there is more demand than supply which can put pressure on the service as a whole . A small team is also vulnerable to being reliant on individuals e .g. those in management roles . Additionally staff absences and vacancies can have a big impact in further limit ing capacity. The following comments provide examples: Insufficient capacity in the service [is a challenge]. There is a lot to do, you have to juggle things constantly, keep track and worry if you may have lost track or missed something. Not sure how sustainable that is. CADS key informant Sometimes the capacity of the service is overestimated by stakeholders. There can be an expectation that the serv ice can see more people and/or respond more immediately. Important to keep stakeholders informed and manage expectations. CADS key informant Wish there were more of them in the Auckland region. Appreciate when they are on board. Celebrate when they get ne w roles (like peer support role) but also know that they need more resources to do their work. External key informant Some also noted that it can be a challenge for a small team not to become too insular. Small team and strong systems - good but it can ge t a bit dark, intense and inflexible. CADS key informant Being a small team there is a risk that it can become insular; developing a \"siege mentality\" and overworking are risks - you need to guard against that happening. Staff members get to see other ser vices and interface with the paradigms of other services so that helps. CADS key informant Linked to capacity is the inefficiency of a small team providing service over a large geographical area which means that a lot of staff time is spent travelling . Clinicians have to build a vast knowledge of networks in multiple localities and it is not possible to run client groups because clients are not located within a manageable area. While this was noted by many as a challenge and in some respects a limitation, it was also stressed that a cohesive team is essential and that having a fragmented team (e.g. single clinicians attached to 490670v6 39 community AOD or mental health teams) would create increased risk for all parties, increased stress for clinicians and a less susta inable service overall. Being a mobile team there are some overheads in terms of travel and building up networks. CADS key informant Being regional there is some inefficiency, a lot of driving and it limits the group work that can be done because the cl ients are so spread out. CADS key informant The team is small and has to cover a huge area . External key informant It is important to have a team to support the team approach. It would not work if the team was broken up or fragmented....single staff positi ons sitting in AOD teams. CADS key informant Many also noted that alongside the challenge s there are advantages in having a small team in terms of the ability to develop and maintain shared understanding of the approach, consistent ways of working and effe ctive team communication. For example: The team is small and while this means it can coalesce really well, it is vulnerable for example when there are resignations. CADS key informant RECRUITMENT AND LONG LEAD -IN TIME It was noted that r ecruiting and suppo rting staff who are able to work across the broad scope of the service is challenging. A number of CADS and external key informants commented that \"you have to recruit the right people \". CADS key informants at both managerial and clinician level noted that it takes up to a year for team members \" u u \" their role \" \" Depending on the level of staff turnover 'u ' this needs to be factored in to service capacity expectations. For example: Finding the workforce [can be a challenge]. I f you want to run a professional service you have to find professionals who want to work in this area; P PS has been delivered by nurses , we are about to bro aden out. Other professionals can deliver this service, it depends on how you do the work. CADS key informant [Staff] have to link with a huge number of services; it can take a long time to bring new staff up to speed. CADS key informant Getting up to sp eed in the role - working with domestic violence; working with the risk involved with AOD and child protection; the legal stuff - the F amily Group 490670v6 40 Conference , Family Court, lawyers, trespass order s, custody issues, protection order s - you have to understan d all of these things. CADS key informant STRESSFUL AND CHALLENGING ROLES Many commented that PPS work can be stressful . Many stakeholders noted the level of clinical risk that the team carries (see also below organisational risks) . This requires ongoing active management. For example: High level of stress in the role; dealing with children and their safety - it can get too much. The clients can be very hard. CADS key informant Supporting the nurses [is a challenge]: it's important to build resilience, st aff members need a supervisor and a problem solver, they hear a lot of traumatising stories. CADS key informant Linked to this , many (both CADS and external) noted the tensions inherent in the child protection aspect of the service where the interests of the child may conflict with the interests of the mother and clinicians must act to ensure the well -being of the child and at the same time make every effort to keep the mother engaged in the service. PPS has developed expertise in managing this tension, ho wever it was noted consistently as a challenge. For example: Have to make the hard calls based on the best interests of the child and at the same time keep the client engaged. CADS key informant We focus on the child and sometimes have to take a hard line on that. Other services, including CADS services sometimes, don't necessarily understand. There needs to be more information , education and promotion about the service to help other services understand our role. CADS key informant We do a lot of things t hat the client does not want or like, but they stay engaged. It is all about trust and transparency, about being trustworthy. CADS key informant Working with family violence was consistently noted as both a stressful and necessary component of the role. A number of CADS key informants noted that training and support in this area of work is essential and emphasised the importance of risk management and a team approach as mechanisms for mitigating both the risk and the stress inherent in the work. Very impor tant to have training in working with domestic violence. CADS key informant 490670v6 41 ORGANISATIONAL RISKS CADS key informants note d that there are organisational risks in running a service like PPS. Most acknowledged that there is a high risk that things might go w rong and a high risk of poor outcome s if things are not done well. There are also risks in being reliant on other agencies to do their part and having limited control over this. Th ese point s link back to the importance of developing strong and effective re lationships with other services. For example: There are some risks in running a service like PPS: Failure - risk of being unsustainable; ineffective. Political - high risk population; potential for fatality; mistakes can be made; negative consequences for doing something 'not well' can be big. Staff safety - needs to be managed, for example, no details on electoral role; relationship with Police is important, good to ensure Police are aware of the service; mostly the families are well known to them. CADS k ey informant You are dependent on other agencies - you don't have any authority over them; you don't hold their budget - it is all about influence and working relationships. It is important to contain the caseloads to enable this to work. CADS key informa nt A NON -TRADITIONAL ADDICTIO N SERVICE As noted above , PPS is not a traditional addiction service and the challenges of advocating for the ongoing provision of this service have already been noted. It is importa nt to underscore this challenge and the impor tance of organisational support for the approach. For example: There needs to be a wide organisational tolerance for working holistically. A lot of what PPS provides does not look like a typical clinical intervention. The perspective is different. CADS key informant 490670v6 42 CONSIDERATIONS IN REPLICATING THE PPS APPROACH Comment from key informants raised a number of themes relevant to consideration regarding the possibility of replicating the PPS approach in other locations. These are set out below. THE MAKE -UP O F THE TEAM As noted , up until December 2014 PPS has employed clinicians with nursing qualifications (albeit with differing experience in a wide range of clinical contexts) . Most key informants speculated that while this has been effective for PPS there is likely to be some benefit in having other disciplines represented, particularly in view of t he very broad scope of the role and at the time of the evaluation , PPS was in the process of recruiting clinicians from other disciplines.14 For example: Other prof essionals can deliver this service, it depends on how you do the work. CADS key informant Has been nurses ...... I was always big on this - now I can see advantages and disadvantages. CADS key informant Nursing professional framework - strong boundaries. In t he set up it was good to have all nurses; it is also good to have multiple perspectives. CADS key informant The thing is that no one professional group has the full range of expertise to work with this group. \"You don't come ready to do the job.\" The expe rtise has to build. The staffing has to be flexible, multi -disciplinary - good at working with complexity; good at priority setting. CADS key informant Some added a note of caution regarding introducing non -nursing personnel, mainly in relation to coveri ng the more medical aspects of the role, stating that nurses pick up issues that others may not know to look for. For example: With OTs [ Occupational Therapist s] and SWs [Social Worker s] - they still need a bit of a medical bent; need to know what to look for. CADS key informant The inclusion of a social worker was viewed by many as likely to provide additional benefit, and similarly an occupational therapist. The potential to include other disciplines such as counsellors and youth workers was discussed by some. The value in expanding the psychology role was also noted . 14 A PPS Social Worker Position Description is provided in Appendix 2. 490670v6 43 Both CADS and external key informants commented that there is likely to be value in having a broader cultural representation within the team. Would be great to have a ori and a Pacific clinician in the team to add the broader perspective to the team. CADS key informant It would be great to have some ori nurses in the team. External key informant Consider the best way to ensure ori perspectives are included in th e service delivery - PPS works closely with ori services; there may be other ways. CADS key informant Some raised the idea that employing men might bring balance to the team and assist in engaging fathers in the service. For example: ....some gender bala nce might be a good thing, although it is hard to know whether a male would be as effective in this role. CADS key informant Could be great to have some male team members; might attract more fathers to access the service. CADS key informant DOES A SERVIC E LIKE PPS NECESSARI LY SIT WITHIN AN ADDICTION TREATMENT SERVICE SPECTRUM Given the wide holistic scope of PPS , key informants were asked to comment on whether or not a service like PPS needs to sit within the addiction treatment spectrum. Views on this were mixed. Some commented that the service could sit within mental health or another sector provided there was high tolerance for a holistic approach and a low level of stigmatising views in regard to the client group , particularly in relation to substance use. For example: There is low stigma/low judgement of this client group within the organisation - this is very important. CADS key informant Service could sit in a non -addiction service setting. AOD is a small part of what PPS does, however the clients a re definitely AOD clients. CADS key informant Others thought the AOD focus was important given the risks to children that can be associated with parental AOD use and for this reason clinicians must have the skills to identify AOD issues and support AOD r ecovery . For example: 490670v6 44 The focus on addiction is important; big risk factor for children; really valuable to work with that lens/focus. CADS key informant UNIVERSAL SUPPORT FO R DEVELOPING SERVICE S LIKE PPS IN OTHER AREAS All key informants are in favour of more PPS -like services being offered in other parts of New Zealand, particularly in areas of high socio -economic deprivation. The service is seen as filling a gap for a high risk group of women and children who more often than not do not access addiction t reatment or other services that could assist. For example: Roll it out in big centres and large towns; focus on high deprivation areas; use CADS team leader as a consultant to support the set up. CADS key informant The pressure to engage this client grou p will not go away. We need to create ways of doing it on a larger scale. CADS key informant Amazing service should be in every DHB. External key informant 100% support services being developed in other areas. Need to be situated in areas where there is high unemployment; focused on clients that are hard to reach . Definitely need more services like PPS with clinical focus - they make the clinical palatable to the clients. External key informant Absolutely support more services like PPS being developed - in the community, in people's homes. External key informant 490670v6 45 DISCUSSION In my role I have passion in wanting to help; I work to understand where the person is coming from, offer strategies and choices - nothing is forced; you can't bring a social servic e mentality; have to bring heart to the job; never give up, be consistent, let the client know \"you are not a waste of time \". CADS key informant The quote above captures the essence of the overall PPS approach. PPS provides an intensive outreach service which consistently focuses on the wellbeing of children while addressing the needs of parents and working to strengthen the home environment. Central to the approach is the unwavering focus on engaging the client and staying engaged. This is a key feature inherent in the model of service that sets PPS apart from many other services that do not have such a mandate. The information summarised in this report suggests that the PPS model of service provides an example of a promising approach to reducing harm for children at risk and supporting equity of access to addiction treatment. Findings indicate that PPS is operating as intended and is successfully reaching and engaging the intended target audience. The service objectives and approach align with Government goals for improved outcomes for children and a multi - T u ' investing in early intervention is underpinned by available evidence. The planned outcomes evaluation will provide further info rmation regarding the areas in which PPS is most effective, however on the basis of the information available at present a number of conclusions may be drawn as outlined below. CORE COMPONENTS LINK ED TO SUCCESS The following components of the PPS service h ave been identified as being linked to the success of the service and would need to be incorporated into service development in other areas if this is to take place. 1. An evidence -based service objective . PPS is aimed at preventing and reducing harm to chil dren aged under three -years -old. This objective aligns with Government priorities and investment in this group is well supported by available evidence. 2. Engaging the target client group . The service is engaging clients living in low decile areas who are fa cing multiple issues; it is engaging a high number of M ori women. Additionally PPS is engaging a significant group who are not accessing CADS (only 24% of PPS referrals are from CADS). 490670v6 46 3. The PPS model . Critical aspects of the PPS model have been identified as follows: Service philosophy /principles : Incorporate a strengths focus, support a non-stigmatising approach and mandate a holistic service scope (i.e. broad enough to encompass multiple complex issues). Accessibility is enabled and barriers to entry are minimal; 3 9% of PPS clients self -refer. Assertive outr each: Supports accessibility and engagement. Engagement is approached from both the client and service perspective, i.e. the model enables clie nt engagement and supports the clinicians to stay engaged with the client. Intensive case management : Open ended, provided to a capped caseload. This enables the client and service to work on a range of typically long standing issues and to make real gains. Robust risk management combined with a team approach. The MDT meeting and clear risk assessment and management processes support both risk management and a team approach . Strong effective relationships with other services: the PPS model relies on this aspect of service delivery. 4. Workforce and infrastructure . PPS is provided by a professional workforce supported b y strong leadership and sited within a robust organisation where senior managers support and advocate for the service to ensure it is sustained . The professionalism within the PPS approach is evident at all levels and this appears to allow the service to w eather the challenges and to provide a credible and sustainable service . LESSONS LEARNED FROM CHALLENGES AND CONSI DERATIONS FOR REPLICATION OF P PS There are lessons to be learned from the key challenges which have been identified. These would require cons ideration and careful management in the development of any PPS type service. Key challenges include: Recruitment and lead in time : As noted , recruiting and supporting staff who are able to work across the broad scope of the service is challenging and there has to be a level of tolerance in terms of staff getting up to full speed in their roles. In the set up phase of a service like 490670v6 47 PPS this would be exacerbated as the team would all be new and the service profile would take time to establish. Staff support and development : :Linked to the above , it is essential to build robust staff support mechanisms into the service. There are risks for professionals in working to the very edges of their professional scope, something that is inherent in this model where ex pertise across a wide range of issues is required . It is vital to ensure staff members receive appropriate training and ongoing support. Family violence and child protection were identified as key areas where staff are likely to need ongoing training. Addi tionally there are evident stressors in working with trauma, violence, abuse etc. Careful recruitment, a team approach, professional supervision and supportive and accessible leadership help to mitigate the needs. Systems are required to prevent staff from personal risk and to enable them to intervene if risk presents . Capacity : An intensive service model is relatively costly and is therefore typically limited in capacity. The PPS experience reflects this. Making best use of limited service capacity require s active ongoing management to ensure that the service is provided to those who need it in sufficient intensity and duration to effect change . This must be balanc ed with the ongoing demand . Feedback suggests that active and regular review processes and communication about service scope and capacity with referrers help to mitigate limited capacity. The addition of a peer support component to actively support the disengagement/discharge phase of intervention can also help with this. As noted, while PPS has a peer s upport worke r on the team, this could be managed in partnership with an external peer support service (where this is available). Overheads: Inefficiency arises from having a small mobile team covering a wide geographical area. This is something that is likely to be faced by any service set up in New Zealand and is something which many key informants spoke of as inevitab le. No solutions to this emerged from the evaluation. Similarly the time intensive risk management practices were also highlighted as a necessary overhead. While the costs were acknowledged, the requirements of having a co -located team and time -intensive risk management practices were consistently emphasised. ' ' : This evaluation highlights the importance of placing a service such as PPS within a strong organisation. While there were mixed views on whether the larger organisation needs to be an addiction service, all feedback suggests that a PPS - type service needs a home organisation rather than being a st and-alone service. A key need is for the home organisation to be supportive of the service approach and able to ensure that clients are well supported to address their alcohol and other drug related issues. 490670v6 48 REFERENCES Cavanagh, B.
