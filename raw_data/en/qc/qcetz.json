It's very scary and isolating xx Dear Vita I was delighted to find Vita magazine. It's so lovely to have a magazine aimed at people who have faced the adversity of breast cancer (just like me) and have positive stories, tips and understanding. I love it! I was diagnosed with breast cancer last July. At 37 with two young children and an active lifestyle the news came like a bolt from the blue and it shattered our secure day-to-day lives. After two operations, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, my aggressive treatments have now come to an end after what seems like a very long road. As my six-year-old said: 'It seems like a lot of trouble for a little lump Mummy'. I can't think of a better way to put it myself! My husband and I are now making plans for the future again. I believe my attitude to life has changed. I'm trying to use the perspective that results from having a life-threatening illness in a positive way. I'll worry about things if and when they happen and make our days full of fun, happiness and giggles. KathyDear Vita I picked up your magazine while waiting to be seen by my consultant at St James's Hospital in Leeds. I have breast cancer and am about to undergo a lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy. There are some good hints and tips and true-life stories and I really enjoyed reading it. Many thanks HellenDear Vita I was recently awaiting an appointment at The Macmillan Centre in Dumfries to see a psychologist to discuss my concerns after finishing my breast cancer treatment. While sitting there I picked up an issue of Vita magazine. I felt that it was there just waiting for me to pick it up, as some of the stories there could have been me. It helped me so much just reading it that I just had the one appointment with the counsellor, as I didn't feel the need to talk to her further. This is a wonderful magazine and I wish more people going through breast cancer knew about it. Thank you.

I did a regular 'learn-to-row' course and liked it. I've tried tennis, swimming and jogging in the past but didn't really like it or wouldn't go. With rowing you have to go or there's a spare place in the boat and everyone will be really mad with you! What do you feel are the benefits of rowing for people who've had breast cancer? C It's an endurance sport but you can adapt it to your fitness. It's social, it's outside, it's interesting and it's different every time. Any exercise that's regular and gets your heart rate going a little is really beneficial. You can see how you're improving and it's quite easy to learn. A It doesn't rely heavily on rhythmic breathing, which some exercise does. You can concentrate on your core muscles, your legs and your arms.Christina von Hodenberg ( c ) and Ann Hallwood ( a) found ro wing a great exercise following treatment for breast cancer. They want to offer other people who have had cancer the chance to learn to row with Row to Health.Is there anything people need to be careful of? C People need to be at least three months past initial treatment before starting our course and if people are unsure they should check with their doctor. You need to be able to swim as that's a safety issue. A I had a reconstruction using a back muscle so I've got one less muscle on that side and it took a while for it to settle down after surgery. In reality, I don't feel any weaker on that side. Do you know of other courses like this one? C I came across one in Canada. British Rowing has been keen to promote rowing to more people. Most local rowing clubs run learn-to-row courses. You don't have to be particularly fit, tall, or young to take up rowing. What would you say to people thinking of rowing after breast cancer? C It's a nice sport. It's always coached and the coach helps you pace it, get to new levels or just get technically better. A You can do it at different levels, which people might not know about before they look into it. You can take it up recreationally, dip in and out and build up your fitness.

C It was my idea and then for a while I didn't do anything about it. But I did talk with others in the squad about it. The general idea was to help people recover because it had really helped me. How did you feel about starting/restarting rowing after breast cancer? A I rowed before but stopped for a year while I was having treatment. I was a bit nervous about coming back, but when I did I thought: 'I wish I'd started earlier'. It's great to just do something different to the rest of your life, something just for you away from other concerns. C I went to a Younger Women's Forum about a year after my diagnosis and I met someone there who had always been a rower and who really loved it. www.vita.org.uk | 9Real lives The One-to-One Support service can put you in touch with a trained volunteer with a similar experience to you www.breastcancercare.org.uk/breast-cancer-services frames\u00a9iStockphoto.com/Nastco After her own diagnosis, Farhana Alam was keen to get the subject of breast cancer out in the open and make other British Asian women more breast aware. 'Breast cancer is a disease like any other and definitely not something to be embarrassed about.'Breaking the taboo As a Pakistani Muslim woman, talking about breasts is often considered taboo in our community as it's such a private part of the body. After my own experience of breast cancer I wanted to raise awareness in the British Asian community that breast cancer is a disease like any other and definitely not something to be embarrassed about. I was diagnosed two years ago, after noticing a lump while breastfeeding, just a few weeks before my 30th birthday. My little girl Noor had just turned one and I had been on maternity leave for a year from my PhD in Linguistics. The news came as a huge shock especially as I had just resumed my studies and was still coping with having a baby. I had been solely breastfeeding Noor and I thought the lump was just a blocked milk duct. Cancer was not even on my radar as I had always been fit and healthy throughout my life. Seeking out support My treatment plan started straight away, and it was just scan after scan, appointment after appointment. I remember thinking: 'I'm going to die from this'. I was even more distraught when the doctors said I had to stop feeding Noor immediately. I didn't have any of the risk factors and I kept thinking: 'why me?'. I wanted to be able to talk to someone from the same faith and cultural background to help answer my questions from that perspective. I contacted Breast Cancer Care about my diagnosis and they were a huge support in many ways. I wish I could have talked more openly to my family and friends but I didn't feel able to in the early stages. I just felt too shy.getting through treatment I had the works: six months of chemotherapy, mastectomy with breast reconstruction, radiotherapy, breast reduction, more upcoming cosmetic surgeries and ongoing medication. It feels like a never-ending process, but every time I feel low, I take comfort in the fact that I'm still here, breathing, and especially for Noor. I've also taken much solace in considering God's greater plan for me. Side effects from treatment have been so hard and tiring, but my parents have been great, especially my mum, who's inspired me and given me so much strength. After my treatment, I became a model in Breast Cancer Care's Scottish fashion show to raise awareness in the Asian community. I received a Facebook message from a woman very much like me who'd read my newspaper article about the show, and it's comforting to think that I've been able to help someone in the same position. My family and friends nominated me for the Scottish Asian Women's Awards and I won in the category, Achievement Against All Odds. It was really humbling. a new normal The thought is always there that the cancer might come back, but for now I'm hopefully cancer free and back to 'normal' - whatever that 'new normal' may be. Being back at university now and engaging in feel-good activities helps me feel like I'm part of the world again. I'm not defined by my cancer, but I am someone who's been through tribulation, yet come out the other side - stronger, wiser and, importantly for me, closer to my faith than ever before. 10 | www.vita.org.ukReal lives MoVIN gon up 'I met so many new people along the way and made friendships that will last forever.' I remember that day so clearly. I was absolutely terrified but was trying to 'be brave' because everybody had told me I should be. I hate that expression, it implies that I had a choice in whether or not to have chemotherapy, and realistically I didn't. So there I was, sat in the chair in the chemotherapy unit with tears pouring silently down my face, unable to even squeeze out words in response to the nurse, petrified and just wanting to run away and hide. The fear was so real I could have touched it. My lovely partner sat with me, held my hand, and spoke for me because I couldn't speak. Later that day I was very ill and eventually ended up on the chemotherapy ward for a couple of days while they sorted out my anti-sickness drugs, but I have to say that first day was the worst of it for me. Supporting each other Time went on. I had five more doses of chemotherapy. I lost my hair and my eyebrows, and spent a fair amount of time lolling on the sofa with very little energy, though I still managed to get out and walk the dog, doing what I could to find some sense of normality. Through all that I had my friends on the Breast Cancer Care Discussion Forum watching over me, encouraging me, offering tips, sharing stories about the silly things people said, sharing good news and bad. I wasn't on my own, I had support from people a bit further on than I was, and shared worries with those at the same stage of treatment. After chemotherapy I had four weeks of radiotherapy. That was all through the school holidays so all I managed for a holiday that year was a couple of weekends away. I also had Herceptin every three weeks for a year, and started on tamoxifen, which I am still taking. I got to know the nurses in the chemotherapy unit, and apologised to the poor nurse who'd had to syringe in the poisons as I cried that first time. restoring my identity My hair started to grow back. It felt like I'd been bald forever, so I was delighted when someone who hadn't known about my cancer asked what had made me cut my long hair. Result! I didn't look Former Vita cover star Jenny Richards reflects on her journey two years on from chemotherapy. like I had a cancer hairdo! If I had, I'm sure I would have just got the awkward, pitying, horrified look that I'd had so often. Another step further along the road, pushing the trauma of diagnosis and treatment further into the past. I met so many new people along the way and made friendships that will last forever, because we have shared the most difficult of times with each other. Sadly those difficult times included saying goodbye to other friends whose cancer took them from us far too early, but along with the tears we shared laughter, cups of tea and adventures. Two years on, I have a lot to be grateful for. As I sit here this evening I am grateful for the love and support I had from my friends, my GP , my wonderful surgeon, the oncology team, the lovely nurses at the hospital, and my wonderful family. And from Breast Cancer Care. Without it I wouldn't have met the amazing group of women who helped me through.

'Creative writing meets life coaching for mothers' was the full name of this course. Wearing my black baker's cap to hide my few remaining strands of hair, I was a mum with two delightful teenage children but I had many reasons to be sitting in this warm space on a chilly November Friday in Dartington Village Hall. A childhood of voracious reading had left me longing to write material of my own. It seemed like such a huge task. I marvelled at authors who could organise so many words into thrilling tales. I had always been busy - with family, my full-time job at the Health Protection Agency, life. There didn't seem the opportunity to justify putting aside time to develop this skill and indulge an unexplored passion. this is my time Now was my moment. I'd just started an 18-week course of chemotherapy following my lumpectomy and was looking for a distraction from the treatment. Just attending each session looked like it might be a challenge. I did manage to make it to all nine writing sessions, and with a huge sense of satisfaction. The course gave me real focus and I produced a reasonable piece of writing each week. I was determined to explore my own personal story: the process of cancer and cure that I suddenly found myself in and to think more deeply about my mother's similar experience. This was a great chance to discover myself and to try to express fears and anxieties as well as positive After her diagnosis Tatiana Cant decided it was time to stop putting off something she'd always wanted to do and signed up for a creative writing course. insights into how much I value my family and what's really important in life. Friday feelings My chemo sessions were also on Fridays after my writing and somehow the timing worked out and I just about had energy for everything. Twice I had to make an extra trip into Torbay Hospital early Friday morning for extra blood tests to check my levels before treatment. But still I managed to show up in time for a pre-writing coffee, and on Good Friday hot cross buns and Easter eggs.All the mums in the group were supportive and loving, and with their own hurtful issues to resolve. We soon became very close and felt safe sharing intimate feelings. We all enjoyed the Write this way 'We all enjoyed the freedom and power of releasing some of these troubles.' freedom and power of releasing some of these troubles. In fact we bonded so well that we didn't want the course to end so we've arranged some extra follow-up sessions to let us continue sharing our journeys a little longer.

For more information on courses in your area, see page 25. 12 | www.vita.org.uk Healthy living Let'sgooutside Getting outside in the fresh air a few times a week can boost your mood and may improve your health, as a lex Shore explains.So many of us spend much of our time indoors these days, whether behind a desk at work, on a treadmill at the gym or in front of the TV. Yet stepping outdoors can be rewarding. If you've been diagnosed with breast cancer, you'll have heard about possible treatment side effects, such as weight gain, fatigue and insomnia, and leaving the house on some days can feel like a struggle both physically and emotionally, particularly during your treatment. But there's evidence to suggest that going outdoors, even for just a little while, to take part in some kind of physical activity can improve your mood and health. According to researchers at the University of Essex, these benefits are seen when people take just five minutes of 'green exercise' every day - that's any kind of physical activity you do in the presence of nature. go back to nature Carly Wood, Research Officer in Sports and Exercise Science from the University of Essex, told Vita: 'Being outside in nature is important for both physical and mental health. 'People who spend time in natural environments have increased levels of self-esteem and energy, fewer feelings of fatigue and overall a better sense of wellbeing.' The effects of a natural environment can be particularly beneficial for patients in hospital or with an illness: 'It can help people to be more resilient to physical illness; access to outdoor environments can help people to feel more relaxed and able to cope.' Vitamin D A recent report by the Mental Health Foundation highlights that it's the combination of being in nature and being physically active that appears to bring about such a positive effect. For example, going for a brisk walk is an excellent form of exercise, which can stimulate bone growth and strength. At the same time, the exposure to natural light will help to balance serotonin levels, a hormone which can improve low mood, and reduce the amount of melatonin that the body produces, helping you to get a better night's sleep. Just 15 to 20 minutes of sun every day during the summer can provide enough vitamin D for the year in those aged up to 70. Vitamin D is essential for the absorption of minerals and vitamins, such as calcium which is particularly good for bones.spring foliage\u00a9iStockphoto.com/bgfoto, swimmer\u00a9iStockphoto.com/microgen www.vita.org.uk | 13 Healthy living enter the dragon Louisa Balderson was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 and had 12 months of treatment. Knowing that staying active was important to her recovery, she started with gentle walking, but soon felt that she wanted to do something more challenging. After hearing about dragonboat racing, she went to an event to find out more, and was immediately hooked. Now, she is a patron of Paddlers for Life, a UK-based charity for cancer survivors, particularly breast cancer. The idea behind dragonboat racing is simple: it's a team sport offering the opportunity to spend time outside with people who have gone through similar experiences with breast cancer. Louisa says: 'It's a chance to build confidence in what you can and can't do. Treatment is a hugely sensory experience - you become hyper-aware of your body. 'When you're sitting in the boat, it's about connecting with whatever is around you. You get to witness the landscape changing, which really takes you out of yourself. 'There's a great deal of camaraderie and strength in the boat - it can be quite emotional.' Women taking part in dragonboat racing can get fit, make friends and have a lot of fun, and all in the naturally beautiful setting of Windermere in the Lake District. Being so exposed to the elements might not be everyone's cup of tea, but Louisa feels that she gains something just by being outdoors: '...even if all you do is step through your front door, feel the wind on your face, listen to the birds sing, just feel what it's like to be with what's around you.'

To find out more about Best Foot Forward call 0845 077 1893 or email bestfootforward@breastcancercare.org.uk I was a keen swimmer before my mastectomy in April 2007. I purchased a mastectomy swimsuit and hoped to return to the pool soon after. Unfortunately it wasn't as easy as I'd hoped. I was worried what people would think of my changed body image, what would happen if the prosthesis fell into the pool? As well as this, because of a lack of movement in my left arm following surgery, I needed assistance changing from my partner. On entering the water I had a massive grin on my face. All the fears of how people were going to react had vanished. I wanted to help others overcome the fears I had encountered and in October 2010 I launched Swimming After Surgery (SAS). Swimming can help improve movement in arms and shoulders after treatment for breast cancer as well helping with lymphoedema.

Gareth Fletcher's tips should help ensure your trip goes as smoothly as possible. Pack up yourYour health If you're travelling abroad, having breast cancer won't necessarily affect your plans. But there are some things you may need to think about in advance. It's a good idea to check with your specialist team that you're fit to travel, especially if you're still having treatment. Insure and go? Travel insurance is essential if you're going abroad, but some people have difficulty getting insurance if they've been diagnosed with breast cancer. Those who are able to get travel insurance usually face higher premiums. Some insurers may not insure you for medical treatment related to your cancer. Others may require a letter from your hospital team or GP confirming that you're fit to travel. However, if you're having trouble finding suitable insurance, there are companies that specialise in policies for people with existing medical conditions like cancer. Medication It may seem obvious, but if you're taking medication, such as tamoxifen, it's important to pack enough to last your whole trip, plus a bit extra in case of any delays. It's best to pack medication in your hand luggage in case any checked-in baggage is delayed or lost. And keep the drugs in their original packaging. come fly with me It's safe to fly with a prosthesis as aircraft cabins are pressurised.

Lymphoedema If you have lymphoedema, there's no reason why you can't enjoy a holiday, but you may need to take extra care. For example, if you've been fitted with a compression garment, you should wear it during your journey, and keep your hand baggage light and try to carry it on your back rather than your shoulder. Catrin Lewis, 51, from Cardiff has travelled widely despite having lymphoedema. 'Initially I was worried about travelling because I was bitten by an insect, through my lymphoedema sleeve, in Majorca, and I got an infection as a result. But luckily I managed to get antibiotics and everything was fine. Now my GP prescribes antibiotics to take with me, and I always take insect repellent too. 'I try to book an aisle seat on the plane so I can easily exercise my affected arm during the flight. And if I'm going somewhere hot, I carry a water spray so I can keep my arm cool.' Jane Humphrey, 61, from Ceredigion has been on holiday twice since her treatment finished in December 2011. 'The only issue happened in Tunisia, when an airport official questioned me about the box I keep my prosthesis in,' says Jane. 'But I managed to explain what it was. It wasn't embarrassing - I'm used to talking about it. I haven't had any other problems.' Sun care Taking care in the sun is important for everyone. But some chemotherapy drugs can make your skin more sensitive to sun. And if you've had radiotherapy, the skin in the treatment area can stay sensitive for several years. Cover up with a sun screen that has a high sun protection factor (SPF). Vaccinations If you're going somewhere that requires vaccinations, discuss your plans with your specialist team first. Live vaccinations - including yellow fever and tuberculosis - are not recommended during chemotherapy or for six months after. This is because they contain tiny amounts of live virus or bacteria and could cause serious infections. Inactivated vaccines - such as diphtheria and tetanus - are safe after treatment, but may be less effective if you have a weakened immune system. This may be the case in the first six months after chemotherapy. travelling without fear Jane believes that people's fears about travelling if they've had breast cancer shouldn't put them off having a holiday. 'I got travel insurance with no problem,' she says. 'I've been through an airport scanner but wasn't asked about my prosthesis, and nobody's ever queried my medication, which I carry in my hand luggage.' Jane is currently looking forward to her next holiday in Turkey. 'If anyone's thinking of going on holiday but is worried that having breast cancer may affect this, I'd say just go for it - I can really recommend it.'16 | www.vita.org.uk Media matters Blogger spotlight Breast Cancer Care's booklets on all aspects of breast cancer and its treatment are available free from www.breastcancercare.org.uk or by calling the Helpline on 0808 800 6000.

I was diagnosed with primary breast cancer nearly eight years ago and was not really given much information relating to secondaries. I was just told by my breast care nurses that if I have anything that bothered me like persistent pain, that I should come to them straight away. Personally, regarding booklets and information I ignore most things on secondaries as it frightens me so much but I am aware of it and know to get help for anything I am unsure about, but I won't read any information on it.When I was going through primary treatment, like the majority of people diagnosed for the first time, I shoved the idea of secondaries to the back of my mind. I was paranoid at every little niggle, and definitely fretted about it spreading, but I preferred not to read up about it. It was mentioned a bit in the literature I received but I didn't tend to read those bits. I definitely absorbed some information as time went on about it - it being incurable for instance, but it was only after my own secondary diagnosis that I truly started understanding the complexities and differences in treatments and options available. It's so different to primary diagnosis, which is why hospitals need to offer better care and support to people going through this. I received a secondary diagnosis in July 2011 and was given very little information. I knew what secondary breast cancer meant so understood the implications but I was appalled that no breast care nurse was informed about me or present at my appointment. No Breast Cancer Care information was offered at the appointment, nor psychological support. theknowledge At the end of treatment for primary breast cancer, you may want to put your experience behind you and try to put thoughts of breast cancer to the back of your mind. You may not want to think about the possibility of your breast cancer returning or spreading, but it's important that you're aware of the possible symptoms. It's difficult to list all the symptoms of secondary breast cancer but any symptoms which don't improve over several weeks and have no obvious cause need to be checked out by your specialist or breast care nurse. Many of the symptoms listed may be the same as those of other conditions such as flu or a chest infection, but go and see your doctor anyway.Symptoms you may want to report Pain in the back or hips that does not improve with painkillers and which is often worse at night. Unexplained weight loss and a loss of appetite. A constant feeling of nausea. Discomfort or swelling under the ribs or across the upper abdomen. Feeling constantly tir ed. A dry cough or a feeling of breathlessness. Sever e headaches.During treatment for primary breast cancer, did you want to know about the signs and symptoms of secondary breast cancer? Or did you just not want to know? Two women share their views. blackboard\u00a9iStockphoto.com/raywoo Hot topic18 | www.vita.org.ukYour questions answered Breast Cancer Care's experts answer questions on breast cancer and its treatment. It's best to talk to your specialist to see what they advise. Complementary therapies, particularly herbal remedies, are a difficult area as there is often very little reliable evidence to guide how they are used. The evidence that does exist is conflicting and confusing. Some women choose to take black cohosh to help with menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, and some report finding it helpful. However, there is not enough supporting evidence at the moment to recommend its use. There are also concerns that because it's a herbal remedy it's not subject to the same stringent checks regarding content and dose that are applied to conventional medicines. Menopausal symptoms can be a real problem for many women with breast cancer. Some women have pre-existing menopausal symptoms and many others will develop these as a result of breast cancer treatment. Because it's not fully understood how black cohosh works, and because we don't know how it may interact with the breast cancer itself, or breast cancer treatment, specialists will often recommend that women stop using it. You might want to read our booklet Complementary therapies for more information. I'd also suggest you read our Menopausal symptoms and breast cancer booklet for tips on managing menopausal symptoms.As you may be aware, there is some evidence that suggests that older women are more likely to receive non-standard treatment for breast cancer. It's a difficult area because older people are under-represented in clinical trials, meaning that there is often a lack of research data to support treatment decisions in this group. However, a 2011 quality standard from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states: 'People with early invasive breast cancer, irrespective of age, are offered surgery, radiotherapy and appropriate systemic therapy, unless significant co-morbidity precludes it.' What this means is that treatment recommendations should be based on giving your mum the best possible management of her breast cancer, but taking into account her general health, any existing medical conditions and Ask a expertbreast cancer I've been taking the herbal remedy black cohosh for six months as I've found it makes my hot flushes a bit better. I've recently been diagnosed with breast cancer - should I stop taking it? My mother has been diagnosed with breast cancer. She's 82 and I'm worried they won't give her as much treatment as they would a younger woman. She's fit and well otherwise, and I want to make sure she has the best possible treatment. her own preferences. You may want to ask your mum if you can attend her next appointment with her specialist so that you can ask any questions you have directly. This might not be possible because of location or time pressures but it might help reassure you that she is getting the care she should. There are several other issues relating to breast cancer and older women including awareness of cancer risk, uptake of breast screening and delays in seeking a diagnosis. Breast Cancer Care has worked with other breast cancer charities to inform a parliamentary inquiry into the care and treatment of older people with breast cancer being held by an All Party Parliamentary Group (see page 20). Our website has more about this, and you may want to read a copy of our policy briefing paper Improving the Outcomes and Experiences of Older Women with Breast Cancer. www.vita.org.uk | 19 expert eye Answering your practical and financial questionsYour questions answered Tubular breast cancer is quite rare, accounting for about 2% of all breast cancers. It is so-called because the cells look tube-like when viewed under the microscope. Tubular breast cancer can occur alongside other types of breast cancer, or can be present on its own (pure tubular). Particularly if it is not mixed with other types of breast cancer, people diagnosed with tubular breast cancer generally have a very good prognosis (outlook). Tubular breast cancers tend to be low grade (this is the system used to classify cancer cells according to how different they are to Many people have mixed feelings when they finish treatment. On one hand you may be pleased to finish treatment, especially if you had unpleasant side effects to manage. But treatment can feel like a 'safety net' and it can be really unsettling when the hospital appointments stop, or you no longer have the feeling that you are doing something positive to treat the cancer. The treatments you have had alongside surgery (for example radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy or targeted therapy) will all reduce the risk of a cancer recurring, not just while you are taking them but also for many years. Be kind to yourself: you have been through treatment for breast cancer and after this experience it's natural that you need time to adjust. You can call our Helpline to talk through how you are feeling and put you in touch with other forms of support such as our I'm told I have tubular breast cancer. What does this mean? I'm just finishing treatment for breast cancer and I expected to feel relieved. Instead I feel very low and frightened about stopping treatment. Is this normal?

Although you're probably craving pretty, delicate lingerie, you'll find the security a well-fitting mastectomy bra can give will not only look good but also help build your confidence. Always try to have a specialist mastectomy bra fitting so that you know your prosthesis and bra are the correct size. Once you have these basics in place you can experiment a little. Avoid skimpy bras that are plunging or low cut, as the cup needs enough capacity for the pocket to comfortably hold a prosthesis. Clever design features used by mastectomy bra designers help make bras functional but pretty. Lacy bras lined with nude fabrics help to achieve the lace show-through effect without exposing the tone difference between your breast and prosthesis. Cup seams can also give the illusion of a plunging neckline. Although it's more difficult than popping to your local shops, there are lots of lingerie boutiques around the country as well as specialist mail order companies who only supply mastectomy wear.

Tubular breast cancer is treated in the same way as other types of breast cancer. Surgery is often the first treatment, usually followed by radiotherapy if breast-conserving surgery has been performed. Additional (adjuvant) treatment will depend on other features of the cancer such as whether it is oestrogen receptor positive (stimulated by the hormone oestrogen). If the cancer is found to be oestrogen receptor positive them hormone therapy is usually offered. Treatments such as chemotherapy and targeted therapies are not commonly required.

The risk of breast cancer increases with age and currently a third of all breast cancers occur in women aged 70 and over. More than half of breast cancer deaths in the UK are in women over 70 and most men who develop breast cancer in England are over 60. And yet evidence suggests that older patients don't always receive the same level of treatment and care as their younger counterparts. An All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Breast Cancer wants to change that. The APPG on Breast Cancer is a cross-party group of MPs and peers that's holding a parliamentary inquiry into issues faced by older people affected by breast cancer. The APPG on Breast Cancer believes all people affected by breast cancer should be able to access the services, treatments and care that will benefit them most regardless of their age. Breakthrough Breast Cancer, who administers the APPG on Breast Cancer, is coordinating the inquiry with support from Breast Cancer Care and Breast Cancer Campaign. Improving access This inquiry wants to pinpoint the barriers to older people accessing treatments and services, and help older patientsfor Action The risk of breast cancer increases with age, but there are worries that treatment of older patients isn't always as good as it could be. We look at what's being done to change that. uncover models of good practice. The inquiry has the backing of the Prime Minister. Steve Brine MP , who is the APPG member leading the inquiry, says: 'Age should not figure in the treatment and care that breast cancer patients get. All people affected by breast cancer should have access to the treatment, services and care that will benefit them most regardless of their age. The recommendations from our inquiry will help make sure this becomes a reality.' During April, members of the APPG on Breast Cancer were joined by other parliamentary champions including Paul Burstow MP and Baroness Sally Greengross to hear evidence from a number of experts and patients, including Health Minister Anna Soubry MP , at a series of public sessions in Westminster. They also heard from patient advocates including one of our One-to-One Support volunteers, Judy Dadswell. Baroness Joan Bakewell - patron of Breast Cancer Care - has also been supporting this work. the case for improvement The oral evidence session and written submissions including research studies will help the inquiry panel of MPs and peers make recommendations to address the issues facing older people affected by breast cancer. A report is due in July putting forward these key recommendations to the government, the Department of Health, the NHS and other groups. www.vita.org.uk | 21 Good food Shake up your BBQ this summer with some exciting vegetarian options. 500g/1lb sweet potatoes, peeled250g pack large flat mushrooms, sliced1 red pepper, deseeded and cut into chunks1 red onion, sliced2 unpeeled garlic sugar1 (95g) salad leavessalt and ground black pepper 1 Preheat the oven to 200C/ Fan 180C/Gas Mark 6.

Here she talks us through the make-up trends for autumn 2013 and offers her top tips. I love the Breast Cancer Care fashion show because we create a red carpet experience for all of our beautiful models giving them a day of full on glamour. Every year we incorporate the make-up trends of the season. This autumn will be no different. I love that The Show is held at this time of the year when make-up really makes a statement. (For ticket information for The Show see box below.) Autumn heralds new make-up shades and trends. One of the keys trends is the new smoky eye. New because we are using colour instead of just black, new because it's a softer smoky eye, new because the colours are metallic and new because no longer are we seeing only one part of the face emphasised. Lips and eyes get equal billing, plus a flush to the cheeks. Choosing the right shade and the right amount of shimmer is key to looking sensational. styleMake up trends for autumn 2013 catwalk To help complete your smoky eye look, here's some tips for defining brows and using false lashes. eyebrows Eyebrows really define and accent the face even without make-up. So the right shape is essential. If eyebrows have been over plucked in the past or have disappeared because of treatment for breast cancer, they won't always grow back neatly, don't despair! Here are the products and techniques you need to define even the sparsest of brows. 1 Using the brush end of a double-ended brow brush, start by brushing the eyebrows down. Dip the edge of the angled end of the brush in some brow powder or use a brow powder pencil to etch the colour lightly along the top of the brows.2 Brush eyebrows back and you'll see an immediate difference. You can now fill in the gaps from underneath using the same technique. If you have a large gap or scar to contend with then either use a brow wax or a brow pencil. 3 Complete the brows, whether natural or filled-in, with a brush of brow gel to seal. False lashes Seven easy steps to great looking lashes: 1 First apply your eye make-up including your mascara, even if you only have a few lashes. 2 Don't forget to curl your lashes. False lashes always have a curl if you don't curl your own ones they will stick out under your false ones and your eyes will look odd. 3 Remove the lashes gently from the packet, pulling from the outer corners. Place them against your eyelids to Tickets for The Breast Cancer Care Shows in London, Glasgow and Cardiff are on sale now.
