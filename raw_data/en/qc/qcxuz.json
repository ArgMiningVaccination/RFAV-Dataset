These methods will found direct translations into clinical practice, for instance in the diagnosis and intervention of a variety of brain disorders. Although epilepsy and migraine constitute our primary focuses of attention, other brain disorders (e.g., Alzheimer Disease and Autism) will be included later on in our portfolio. For each disorder, our research focused on three major areas: a) abnormalities of the cortical microcircuits, b) the biophysics of the neurovascular decoupling and c) genetic imprints by inflammatory processes. These three areas of interest are linked via Biophysical Models developed in the lab. Members from the NMD lab evaluate their methods using pre-clinical models (i.e. rodents) of each brain disorder and, in collaborations with local hospitals, translate them into the clinical field. In the NMD lab, two groundbreaking techniques have been developed. The first one is a high-resolution 3D silicon-based probe (Neuronexus Tech) and the second one is an EEG mini-cap both for electrophysiological recordings at different brain scales (Cortech Solutions). These techniques are combined with both standard observation modalities and computational models for mesoscopic phenomena in the cerebral cortex. |[https://nmd.fiu.edu/](https://nmd.fiu.edu/) |Either MATLAB programming, willing to perform neurosurgery in rodents, or data mining | |Tonette S.

His research recently took him to remote corners of the two ends of the Himalaya in India. He is proposing a new model for the evolution of collisional mountain belts like the Himalaya that looks into the pre-collisional extension as the driving force for the metamorphism, sedimentation and early magmatism of such collisional mountain belts.||No earlier research experience is needed for the mentees although the prospective candidate should be a science major, preferably with some geology and/or chemistry background. Most of the work involves basic geologic lab practices, compiling and plotting data along with some optional advanced work on sophisticated lab equipment like Electron Microprobe and Mass spectrometers. Students might have to travel to University of Florida facilities at Gainesville for some of the work. | |Dionne Stephens||Arts, Sciences and Education||Psychology||Psychology and African Diaspora Studies||305-348-1809||DM 203||stephens@fiu.edu||Sexual risk taking, health disparities, racial/ ethnic minority women, sexual/ dating scripts, and identity development.||Library research, running experiments, entering data, transcription, preparing conference presentations, and recruitment of research sites. | |Philip Stoddard||Arts, Sciences and Education||Biological Sciences||Biology||305-348-0378||AHC1 219C||stoddard@fiu.edu||Animal behavior endocrinology.

We collaborate on a range of projects in areas such as engineering design education: Through this work, my team and I are trying to understand how to improve design education for engineers both by understanding what happens in the classroom now and what engineers experience in industry. educational change at Hispanic-Serving Institutions: Many of the projects we work on focus on students and instructors at Hispanic-Serving Institutions, like FIU. One project, for instance, is exploring how to better support lecturers within engineering departments at HSIs who are trying to improve student learning and the student experience in their courses. graduate engineering education: Graduate students are often an underrepresented group within educational research. Given that some will become faculty members, they are also a critical part of how we might bring about educational change within engineering. Thus, I have a few upcoming projects that are examining the experiences of graduate students in engineering.||Enthusiasm for exploring and enhancing engineering education. Passion and patience for learning new research methods. Desire to collaborate with others to learn and conduct research. Researchers in this group use both qualitative (e.g., interviews, analysis of documents/text) and quantitative (e.g., surveys, statistical analysis) research methods. In addition, we do a lot of reading of research articles to learn more about previous research and to help us better explore our areas of interest. | |Jacob David Sudol||Communication, Architecture + The Arts||School of Music||Music Technology and composition||305-348-0109||WPAC 145B||jsudol@fiu.edu||Music technology, psychoacoustics, and music composition.||Library and online research, and developing hardware, software, creative projects, and cultural studies (particularly East Asian culture). | |Michael Sukop||Arts, Sciences and Education||Earth and Environment||Hydrogeology||305-348-3117||PC 326||sukopm@fiu.edu||Computer modeling of fluids, chemicals, and heat; developing graphical user interfaces for computer models; laboratory measurements of effective porosity in carbonate rocks.||Library research, computer modeling, computer code development, laboratory and field work. | |Ruimin Sun||Engineering and Computing||School of Computing and Information Sciences||Cybersecurity||305-348-7984||CASE 317||rsun@fiu.edu||Computer security,| machine learning, model privacy, embedded devices, and PLC security |Required: | 1.
