This study examined people's general views of vaccination, the way they received i nformation and cultural factors' impact on vaccination hesitancy, criticism and acceptance. The goals of the study were to find out how culture affected vaccination decision - making and what beliefs shaped people's vaccination perception. Understanding of what different beliefs and cultural factors dictate vaccination hesitancy will help to develop a more effective vaccination education to the patients in the future. The literature review was written as part of the thesis. The data for the thesis w as collec ted from scholarly sources and evidence -based articles relevant to the topic. The study approach was a qualitative method to understand the topic, reasonings and consequences better. The data was analysed by using an inductive content analysis. The results of the study showed that beliefs and culture did have an impact on how people view vaccination. This could be seen in vaccination coverage, expressed opinions in the findings and certain vaccine's uptake. Cultural perspectives and beliefs on vaccination were formed from many reasonings , such as mass information, negative side effects of the vaccines, lack of trust toward the authorities and public health's stance. Thus, health care provider s need to create an open and respectful conversation with the patients.

Introduction While vaccination is considered and recognized as one of the most successful medical inventions, the perception of its safety has been slowly changing in the recent years. A growing number of people have started to be come more hesitant to tak e vaccines and question their effects. The phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy i s caused by several beliefs and factors influenc ing individual decision-making. (Dube et al. 2013.) Vaccination remains as a largely accepted public health me thod despite the rising critical attitude . Global vaccination coverage has stayed in a satisfactory level and the uptake of new vaccines have increas ed. During 2019, about 125 WHO's member states reached 90% of diphtheria -tetanus -pertussis vaccine (DTP3) coverage and 8 5% of the infants received doses of this same vaccine to protect them against serious and fatal diseases . The u ptake of new vaccines and following the vaccination program mes have saved millions of lives, prevented deaths, and lowered mortality rate caused by many infectious diseases. (Dube et al. 2013; WHO 2020.) However, v accination acceptance should not be considered as an obvious feature of all communities . As a result of globalization, beliefs , cultures and media environments affect people in different countries quicker than before (Dube et al. 2013) . This thesis aims to find out what beliefs have impacted people's perspective on vaccination and how culture affects decision -making of vaccination . The purpose of the thesis is to offer information to health care providers and nursing students to recognize culture's role in vaccination situations. 2 2. Vaccination in Finland 2.1 Vaccination Vaccination is an important and effective method in health care that offers prevention and protection against infectious diseases. Vaccines are made from viral vector s, nucleic acid s, fragments, weakened or killed micro -organism s that stimulate the body's own immune system to fight off the infection. A vaccinated person develops a specific protection against future contact of the same disease due to the body's immunological memory that triggers a quick response to the presence of a pathogen. (Olson et al. 2020.) The effectiveness of the vaccin e is based on the active substance, which is called an antigen. An antigen is used to teach the body's defense system to recognize and protect against pathogens, which are micro -organisms that cause the disease. An tigens trigger the body to make antibodies and cause immunity to either one or multiple, similar types of pathogens . Some vaccines , such as tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccines provide protection against a toxin produced by a pathogen. Protection is based on the toxoids in the vaccine, which are harmless bacterial toxins. Toxoids help the body to produce antibodies that block the effects of the toxins . Additionally , vaccines contain sugars, salts, amino acids and adjuvants that are needed to provide and maintain a suitable composition or to improve the shelf life and efficacy of the vaccine. (Elonsalo 2016; THL 2020 a.) Because of the vaccine effectiveness, many major diseases, such as measles, mumps and poliomyelitis have become controllable . Smallpox and rubella used to be common diseases, but they are currently extinct in Finland due to immunization. As a result, complications caused by these diseases, su ch as polio -induced paralysis, measles -related encephalitis, developmental disability in a fetus by rubella, and deafness by mumps have also been eliminated. (THL 2019a; Olson et al. 2020.) Since vaccine -preventable diseases have become rare, it is easy to think that vaccines are unnecessary. When people have not experienced these diseases or the complications, they do not understand to fear them. There are concrete incidents of the benefits and importance of vaccines. For example, the introduction of MMR v accination in 1982 almost entirely eradicated measles from Finland by the mid -1990s. If no one were vaccinated, everyone would get sick since measles virus was one of the most contagious viruses. Lumio (2019) states that 97% of children should be vaccinate d to keep measles gone. Additionally , MMR vaccinations prevent many cases of pneumonia, febrile convulsions, encephalitis, and a few deaths each year in Finland . (Lumio 2019; THL 2019b.) 3 Vaccin es offer several benefits at individual, community and societal levels. The usage of national vaccination programme has freed health care resources to treat and prevent other diseases too instead of only focusing on infectious diseases. Getting vaccinated is also cheaper than paying for health care costs caused by preventable diseases. (THL 2019a.) 2.2 National vaccination programme in Finland The purpose of the national vaccination programme is to protect the citizens from diseases preventable by vaccines. In Finland, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health makes decisions concerning the vaccination programme along with the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) , who also monitor s the preventable diseases . The municipalities are responsible for arranging the vaccination. Additionally, s chool health care services and health care centers give vaccines included in Finland's national vaccination programme free of charge. (Ministry of Social Affairs and Health 2013 ; THL 2020b .) There are 16 vaccines in the Finnish vaccination programme (see A ppendix 1) . The programme is divided into two sections, children's and adult's vaccination , but t here are also vaccines specifically for risk groups . Vaccine s are schedule d in careful consideration of health care resources, maturity of the recipient's defen se system and risk of illness . While vaccination is not compulsory, over 90% of the Finnish parents still vaccinate their children. (Ministry of Social Affairs and Health 2013 ; THL 2020 b.) Children and adolescents can get vaccination against 13 different diseases and their long- term harmful effects . The f irst vaccines are already given to a few months old baby and the amount increases as the child grows up. Children aged 10 -12 years are offered injections of HPV vaccin es to protect again st cancers related to cervical and vaginal areas. Adults have the responsibility to take care that their vaccine shots against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough , and two MMR vaccine shots against measles, rubella and mumps are up to date . (THL 2021a.) Vaccination schedule offers proper protection at the right time and avoids possible adverse effects. The F innish national vaccination programme is affected by several factors: adverse effects , changes in risk groups , severity and incidence of the disease, vaccine development and protection by the vaccines . This means that the vaccination programme can be corrected and changed to fit the standard of the s afety and effectiveness. The e xperts choose the vaccines after careful consideration and proper evaluation of the effects . (THL 2020 b.) 4 2.3 Vaccination coverage amongst children in Finland Vaccination coverage means that a certain amount of people in a population have been vaccinated against infectious diseases. When the vaccination coverage is high, some diseases become rare or non -existent due to less opportunity of spreading and more people having protection against them. If the vaccination coverage drops low, these diseases would become common again and cause outbreaks . The small amount of vaccinated people would not be able to protect unvaccinated people with herd immunity anymore . (THL 2020 c.) There are small variation s between different region s and vaccines, but overall v accination coverage amongst children in Finland is very high. Over 98% Finnish children born in 2017 have received vaccine s protecting them from diphtheria, whooping cough, polio, tetanus and Hib diseases (see Appendix 2) . MMR vaccine has been given to about 96% of the infants and t hree out of five municipalities have at least 95% of the vaccine coverage . There is also a high percent age of children vaccinated against pneumococcal, rotavirus and chickenpox . (THL 2020 d.) High vaccination coverage shows that most Finns trust vaccinations and how Finnish health care system is implementing them . Not only is i t culturally accept ed feat in maintaining health , but Finns generally have an optimistic attitude and outlook toward s vaccines. With the way Finnish health care system has been built, vaccination is easily accessible for everyone who needs it . Vaccine s in the national programme are free since they are financed from the government budget . (THL 2020b ; THL 2020 d.) Generally, Finnish parents have been protecting their children well through vaccination. Only 1% of children under school age and 0.6% of school -aged children have not received basic vaccinations from the national vaccination programme . It is important for health care provider s to keep building and amplifying trust in vaccination. (THL 2020 d.) 3. Vaccine hesitancy and beliefs 3.1 Vaccine hesitancy In 2019, World Health Organization stated that vaccine hesitancy is one of the ten global health threats. Vaccine hesitancy is described as the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines . Vaccine -hesitant individuals form a heterogenous group : some accept or choose selectively vaccines while b eing significant ly concerned and others refuse or delay vaccination s purposely . (Dube et al. 2013 ; WHO 2019 .) Attitudes related to vaccine hesitancy range from full acceptance to total refusal . It is essential to remember that people's attitudes and opinions do not only fall into two 5 categories, but vary according to time, place and vaccine. The definition of vaccine hesitancy has also been examined through three Cs: Complacency, Convenience, and Confidence. This highlights that ideological vaccination hesitancy explains only part of non -vaccination. There may be practical reasons behind the hesitancy. (Sivel\u00e4 et al. 2018.) Anti-vaccine in this context means opposing the use of vaccines. Anti -vaccine movement and vaccine hesitanc y can be related to each other and include a wide variety of different practices. While s ome vaccine -critical patients still take recommended vaccinations, others refuse all vaccines. Anti-vaccine attitudes stem from background factors, such as certain view of individualism and hierarchy, disgust, resistance and conspiracy theories. (Merriam - Webste r 2005 ; V\u00e4liverronen et al. 2020 .) Additionally, it has been estimated that specifically after H1N1 influenza pandemic, vaccination attitudes have become more critical due to narcolepsy cases. H1N1 pandemic (more known as \"swine flu pandemic \") in 2009 -2010 and narcolepsy cases following vaccinations caused a stir in Finland. The narcolepsy epidemic was undeniably due to 2009 Pandemrix vaccines. Since m ost of the patients were minors and young adults, conversation about vaccine's adverse effects and disadvantages became a long-lasting topic in media. However, it is good to remember that so-called ideological opposition and negative attitudes towards vaccin es have already existed since the early days of vaccination. (V\u00e4liverronen et al. 2020; Lumio 2021 .) 3.1.1 Parental vaccine hesitancy Despite of Finland having an overall high vaccination coverage, health care providers and politicians have become more worried about the difference in vaccination coverage in different regions . There were a few measles cases in Pohjanmaa in 2018. Lower vaccination coverage in some regions were interpreted as criticism, hesitancy and mistrust towards vaccines. About 30 -40% Finnish parents accept vaccination without questioning, 25 -30% accept vaccination carefully, 20 -30% are hesitant, 2 -27% are sel ective or have delayed vaccination, and under 2% have refused vaccination. (Puumalainen et al. 2015; Nurmi et al 2019.) Child health center is an important part of the Finnish health care system that is responsible for vaccinating infants and toddlers. Since children's vaccination has been strongly integrated into the system 's practice, parents do not necessarily refus e childhood vaccines . Hence, it is important to note that vaccine criticism does not always reflect directly in vaccination behavior . All parents a llowing their children to be vaccinated are not necessarily 6 pro-vaccine either. Instead , there are other forms of silent resistance and resentment towards the health care system. (Nurmi et al. 2019; V\u00e4liverronen et al. 2020.) There are many reasons for parental vaccine hesitancy. Some parents disagree with severity of certain diseases like measles and chickenpox and feel lik e it is exaggerated by health care providers to get people vaccinated. It is quite common that many Finnish parents encourage their children to play with children infected with chickenpox to get the disease instead of getting vaccinated. Feelings of vaccin es being unnecessary if there is a lack of exposure or parents experiencing these diseases themselves with mild symptoms have caused them to be come more cautious and hesitant towards vaccination. Parents also feel like the risk of getting complications fro m the vaccine -preventable diseases are low if the diseases are treated well enough. (Nurmi et al. 2019.) There is also a difference between normal everyday thoughts and scientific thinking, especially when it comes to identification of risks, alternative care methods and lifestyle practices. Vaccine -hesitant parents might distant themselves from health care system's recommended care practices due to perceived unfairness in the use of power and authority by health care providers when it comes to influencing vaccination decision -making. Parents want to make the best conscious decision for their child ren without outside interference. (Nurmi et al. 2019.) Some parents' growing vaccine hesitancy ha s stemmed specifically from the child health center v isits. Parents feel like the child health center's workers are pressuring, scaring and threatening them about vaccination. This ma kes them question the pro viders ' abilities and the obtained information - leading then to vaccine refusal or delay. Also, c ommotion caused by Pandemrix vaccine led to many parents becoming selective and hesitant towards vaccines, especially newer ones since they fear the repetition of the narcolepsy incident . (Nurmi et al. 2019.) Since v accination has a major role in the Finnish health care and culture , people tend to judge and blame parents who do not vaccinate their children . They see it as an irresponsible act. Anti-vaccination parents hide to avoid being controlled and restricted by peer pressure, health care provider's disapproval and public criticism. Therefore, h ealth care provider s need to recognize different influences and perspectives in vaccination decision -making , and support immunization policies' acceptance amongst the public with evidence -based information. Finding out common beliefs built within the society helps to understand wh y some parents have decided to get their children vaccinated and some not. (History of Vaccines 2018; Nurmi et al. 2019. ) 7 3.2 Vaccination beliefs and misconceptions Vaccine hesitancy is often based on various misconceptions and beliefs. A common vaccination belief is about the need for vaccines, as some people believe that adequate hygiene and good nutrition are sufficient to control diseases. While improved hygiene and nutrition ha ve helped to lower the number of diseases, there are still plenty of other diseases left that are undependable o n these factors. Vaccination is the only effective protection against these diseases. (Hermanson 2019.) Some individuals believe that vaccines are not effective because people can still get sick despite being vaccinated . It is important to remember that while no vaccine offer s 100% protection , most of the vaccination recipients do develop a strong immunity that also shield other vaccinated people who have not developed a proper protection . Also, in an epidemic situation, unvaccinated people have the biggest risk of getting the disease. (Hermanson 2019.) It is also a common misconception that vaccines contain harmful substances that cause chronic diseases such as autism, MS, diabetes and various allergies. No scientific evidence support s this claim. There are only a small number of adjuvants in the vaccine s, and they rarely cause a ny problem s. People get bigger amounts of aluminum and formaldehyde from the environment. Additionally, t here is no scientific support of alternative care choices being better options than vaccines in protecting from vaccine -preventable diseases . (Hermanson 2019 .) A challenge that health care provider s face is that all opinions, beliefs and misconceptions, regardles s of the knowledge base, are strongly displayed through social media. Petri Ruutu, a docent of medicine, considers it important that health care providers actively participate in social media forums ' vaccination discussions to dispel inaccurate beliefs of vaccination. (Ruutu 2018 .) 4. Cultural aspects 4.1 Cultural view on vaccination Culture plays a significant role in a person's identity . It shapes the way people think, talk and act. Many opinions are based on beliefs built within an individual's own culture and environmental factors. Sometimes, t he society's stance clashes with people's beliefs and stirs arguments . Vaccination is one of th ose topics that has caused intense public discussions and speculations due to several beliefs , attitudes and feelings surrounding it. 8 Cultural perspective s on vaccination come from politics , religion, distrust and public health care's stance . (The History of Vaccines 201 8.) Certain religion or family's beliefs affect vaccination perception by preferring alternative choices instead of getting vaccinated. There are beliefs of the body being pure so inserting substances in it might be tainting instead of healing. People believe that sickness should be healed by God so the re is no need for any kind of medical intervention. For example, the Catholic Church understands the importance of vaccines in protection but prioritizes alternative choices since some vaccines are made from using aborted fetuses' cells. (The History of Va ccines 2018.) Politics has also affected the way people perceive vaccination. Concepts such as individual rights and protec tion of the public's health are not always in harmony with each other. For example, in the United States, the state laws require mandatory vaccination to children in order to enter school . The U.S. law has a strong preference for vaccination, but its culture also has a solid emphasis on individuality and freedom of choices . This clash has led people to question the morality of compulsory vaccination and view some vaccines as a threat. People feel like their auton omies are being disregarded if they do not exercise their right to protect themselves by not getting vaccinated . (The History of Vaccines 2018 .) Public health care should try to balance both group needs and individual rights, but it is not easy to achieve that. Public health care regulations seek to protect the population , so it sometimes contradicts with individual stances in order to shield a large group of people. Prominent debates between individuals and public health raise tension . (The History of Vaccines 2018.) The government and p ublic health care can shape cultural viewpoints more positively with medical evidence, patient education and results of centuries -long vaccinations, but there is also a rising problem of people being more distrusting towards their own health care providers and politicians. Some communities have been affected by racism, which has caused suspicion of the vaccine s. For example, African Americans' mistrust towards public health interventions was caused by denial of treatment opportunities. Certain countries in Asia and Africa do not trust vaccination due to beliefs of vaccines being weapons to harm non-Western people. Lack of trustworthy sources, living in an unsafe area, and experiencing negative cultural characteristics can lead to various conspiracy theories and concerns amongst the people. (The History of Vaccines 2018.) In Europe, the controversy of Oxford -AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine causing thrombosis has been shared rapidly . People have been scared to get the vaccine due to the possible side effect of this vaccine brand . This ha s led to widespread of distrust and suspicion of 9 vaccine safety. The controversy blew up to the point where dozens of European countries decided to take the vaccine off the market temporarily . Finland decided to only vaccinate over 65 years old people with AstraZeneca. Despite this decision and European Medicines agency (European Union's drug regulator) statement of the vaccine not being linked to overall risk of thrombosis , many people remained worried and hesitant . THL (2021 b) states that t he incidence of thrombosis by AstraZeneca in Europe is estimated to be about 1/100 000 amongst the vaccinated people. While young age seems to be a predisposing factor to a higher thrombosis risk, the risk is still extremely rare. (The Economist 2021; T HL 2021b.) While some countries remain uncertain about vaccination and their own health care system, Finnish society and culture is built around trust within the national institutions, health care authorities and experts . Not only do Finns belie ve that vaccin es are part of health protection , but it is also a social norm that everyone gets vaccinated. Minority of Finnish people favor voluntary vaccination since vaccination acceptance has been so deeply integrated in the culture. Vaccination becoming a social norm increases vaccination acceptance: immunization feels like an individual responsibility and duty for people to protect each other and maintain herd immunity. This kind of standard behavior leads to people following the majority's vaccination habit since it feels like a normal thing that everyone does . (Dube et al. 2013; V\u00e4liverronen et al. 2020.) 4.2 Health care providers and cultural competence The concept of cultural competence means respecting people from all cultural backgrounds and ensuring safe, non -judgmental atmosphere . The cultural competence of professionals consists of cultural awareness, knowledge, skills, encounters and motivation. It is important to remember some of these features when meeting patients from different cu ltures. Health care provider s should respect the difference, be open and interested in other cultures, consider the individual needs, be flexible and ask the patient about their own values and culture. (THL 2021c.) In the context of vaccination, encountering a patient from another culture requires cultural competence from a health care p rovider : organization of different services and making the m accessible in order to fulfill the needs of people with different cultural backgrounds. Culture affects p atient s' vaccination decision -making so the health care provider must have the ability to accept different cultural needs and customs. On the other hand, the health care provider should be able to share evidence -based information to the patient regardless of cultural background. (THL 2021c.) 10 5. Health care provider 's role in vaccination A health care provider is a person who has obtained the right to practice or a license to practice under the Health Care Professionals Act . This person has the right to use the professional title of a health care professional , which is provided by the regulation. Based on the Health Care Professionals Act, doctor s, dentist s, pharmacist s, psychologist s, speech therapist s, nutritionist s, registered nurse s, midwi ves, public health nurse s, physiotherapist s, laboratory nurse s, radiologist s, dental hygienist s, occupational therapist s, optician s and dental technician s are considered as health care pro vider s. (Valvira 2015; Terveyskirjasto 2016 .) THL (2020) states that vaccine can only be given as an injection by a doctor , a suitably trained registered nurse, public health nurse , midwife , or a paramedic who is licensed as a nurse. The nationwide vaccination competence training package is used in almost all universities of applied sciences, where people can study to become a registered nurse, public health nurse, midwife, or paramedic. Completion of the competence training prepares the new worker for high -quality work and for proper planning, organization and implementation of vaccination activities. Therefore, the training package indirectly increases the citizens' access to evidence -based inform ation of vaccination. It also supports the implementation of the national vaccination program. (THL 2020 e.) Health care providers have a key position in reducing vaccine hesitation and resistance. They have been trained to face doubting patients and relaying correct vaccination information while minding own personal attitude and the tone of delivering knowledge. Maintaining and strengthening confidence in vaccination through research -based interventions is part of health care providers ' role. With thorough communication and educatio n, it is possible to influenc e the patient's view o n vaccination. Instead of direct prompts, a conversational and listening approach creates motivation and positivity towards vaccinations. (Sivel\u00e4 et al . 2018 ; Hurmekoski 2020. ) By asking and listening, the health care provider can figure out what causes have influenced the patient's vaccination decision . The d ecision might be based on misconceptions that can be corrected . It could also be based on certain religious or ideological values. Although, it is important for the health care provider to note that sometimes correcting an incorrect information of vaccination c ould feed the patient's distrust . Especially , since social media, network search tools and algorithms tend to increase the visibility of certain vaccination topics. Negative attitudes towards vaccines spread easily and stay trending for a long time. Thus, the health care provider should acknowledge different personalities ' influence in decision -making and adapt the vaccination education to fit eac h individual case . The basis 11 for all vaccination communication and education is that the health care provider is aware of the diseases that can be prevented by vaccinations, their complications, vaccines, and the side effects of vaccinations. (Str\u00f6mberg & Leino 2005 ; Sivel\u00e4 et al . 2018 .) Additionally, health care providers go through ethical perspectives in their daily work on vaccination and working with families. How to maintain the vaccination coverage and build confidence for existing vaccines and new vaccines? Also, at what stage is it a case of child abuse if the child does not receive the needed vaccines and becomes seriously ill? (Hurmekoski 2020 .) 6. Aims, purpose and research questions The aims of th is thesis are to find out how culture impacts vaccination decision -making and what beliefs affect people's way of perceiving vaccination through a literature review. The purpose of this thesis is to help nurs ing students and health care providers to recogni ze common beliefs and understand culture's role in vaccination. By finding out cultural influences and general attitudes to vaccination, the results can be utilized to increase awareness of cultural impact on vaccination and decision -making. Research quest ions of the thesis are the following: 1. What is health care provider's role in immunization? 2. What beliefs cause vaccination hesitancy? 3. How does culture affect vaccination decision -making? 7. Implementation and methology 7.1 Literature review Literature review is important for identifying previous studies, explainable trends and questions requiring more research. It provides theoretical foundation and contributes to collected knowledge by creating new theories. (Lau & Kuziemsky 2016.) There are three literature review types: descriptive, systematic and meta -analysis. The descriptive literature review was used in th e thesi s. The goal was to gather information and share results from previous studies of cultural aspects and beliefs influencing vaccination with the help of the literature review . The d escriptive li terature review introduces an opportunity to show selected , published data with different perspectives , key concepts and theories of the known information. It presents overall conclusion s of the findings . (Salminen 2011; Lau & Kuziemsky 2016. ) 12 The d escriptive literature review can be described as an overview without precise rules. While t he collected data is broad and relevant , it still answers the specific topic's research questions . The d escriptive review explains what is currently known about the researched phenomenon by describ ing the previous findings . The choice of material is not limited by methodological rules and the research questions are looser than in for example, meta - analysis. (Salminen 2011 ; Lau & Kuziemsky 2016. ) The d escriptive literature review can be categorized into two categories, narrative and integrative review. This thesis use d the narrative review. Methodologically it is the lightest form of literature review , which gives a broad picture of the research subject , its history and development. The n arrative review aims to make a description of the phenomenon and its results easy to read by making inconsiste nt information organized and c omprehensible . The narrative review can be further d ivided into three implementation methods: editorial, commentary and overview. This thesis used narrative overview, which summarizes previous studies. (Salminen 2011.) The d escriptive literature review is base d around research questions . It displays qualitative and descriptive answer through chosen data. The review is defined by four stages, which are formulation of research questions, data selection, description creation and observation of the produced result. (Kangasniemi et al. 2013.) Formulating research questions is an important first step. Research questions are essential for guiding the review methodology of searching a certain the type of information, selecting relevant literature and analy zing data content . After assessing quality of the studies and choosing a suitable material based on research questions , the extracted information is compared, organized , summarized and presented in a way that it provides qualitative and descriptive answer to the research questions. (Lau & Kuziemsky 2016.) 7.2 Data search and collection Previous scientific research on the subject was used as a material for the literature review. The materials selected for the literature review were found in PubMed, EBSCO - Academic Search Elite and Cochrane Library database s. Google Scholar was also used to manually search for studies . The search for suitable material s and retrieval started from the summer of 2020 onwards. Initial prewriting and drafting w ere also done during the same summer. The actual information retrieval along with writing , revision and editing were done mostly from the spring of 2021 onwards after becoming familiar with the research articles . As the thesis progressed, 13 manual search also helped to board the research and writing by complement ing the information retrieved from the databases . The words used for in formation retrieval were formed based on the research questions. Overall, s earch words include vaccination, vaccine hesitancy, anti -vaccine, cultural, beliefs, education , health care provider , nurse and combinations of those. Boolean search operator s AND and OR were applied to discover the results of data that are related to the topic. Search words used specifically in PubMed were vaccine hesitanc y AND health care provider, vaccine hesitancy, anti -vaccine, cultural AND vaccination decisions, covid -19 AND attitudes AND values , nurs AND vaccination. Results were limited from 20 09 to 2021 , which showed total of 829 findings . From the results , 13 articles were selecte d. The chosen articles were in English and full text free for access . The i nformation was searched from EBSCO with search words, such as vaccination AND belief s, vaccination AND hesitancy AND nurse . Results were limited from 2017 to 2021. From 131 results, two articles in English and full texts were chosen. The used search words from C ochrane Library were vaccination AND education OR communication. Out of 13 results, two article s in English and in full te xts were selected to be usable . Results were limited from 2015 to 2021. Google Scholar offered 993 article s with the year limitation from 2020 to 2021 and with the search words of anti -vaccine attitudes. Only one article was selected since it fits with the topic the well. Table 1 summarizes the search words used in the databases, the delimitations, and the results obtaine d. There were plenty of search results . First, it was inspected if the materials shown in the search by title corresponded well to the topic of the work. Based on the study summary, it was concluded whether the study was suitable for the work to answer the research questions. Finally, the study was looked at as a whole and the final choice was made to include the material if it met the inclusion criteria. A total of 1 8 materials from the databases were selected for the literature review. Appendix 3 describes the selected articles.

Searched databases The included studies were selected by using the inclusion and exclusion criteria . This happened by reading the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the studies. The inclusion criteria were the year of publication from 2009 to 2021, either Finnish or English language , the whole text had to be available, and the article had to a nswer the research question. The material was collected mainly based on the newest and most up -to-date data, so that the information was current, reliable and evidence -based. One older work from 2009 was used as a material since the data was written cohesively in one article and the essential information had not changed drastically . The knowledge of the older study was compared to the newer studies , where the information was scattered in different article pieces , to make sure that it was still up-to-date with the topic . Publications that did not answer the research questions, were published before 200 9, the text was not fully available, or it was in other language than English or Finnish were not included . Inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in table 2.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria 7.3 Content analysis Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze and interpret data. Content analysis is a research method that is objective and systematic in qua ntifying and describin g phenomen on. The goal is to get not only condensed , but also a broad description of the phenomena to make it more understandable . With the help of th is method, it is possible to make inferences from data in order to provide facts, new insights, knowledge and interpretation . It is also possible to clarify the phenomenon further by making conceptual maps, categories and conceptual system . (Elo & Kyng\u00e4s 2007.) There are no specific rule s for analyzing data, but the essential feature of content analysis is that words of the text are classified to smaller content categories. Content analysis is also divided into inductive and deductive analys es. Inductive content analysis was used in this thesis. Since the aim was to be familiar with the written content, the selected material was read through multiple times to understand the insights and theories. In an inductive approach, specific matters are first observed and then combined into a more general statement. (Elo & Kyng\u00e4s 2007.) The inductive content analysis process has three phases: open coding, creating categories and abstraction. In open coding, headings and notes are written down while reading through the text s that fit the research topic and answered the research questions . This helps to generate categories , describe and simplify the most important aspects of the content. The next step is to group data into lists of categories under higher order headings . Through interpretation and comparison to see the similarity and dissimilarity of the data , it is then decided which related findings will belong together in a particular category . The c oncepts are divided into upper and lower categories. Abstraction means the general description of the research topic through categories. (Elo & Kyng\u00e4s 2007.) For this work, a total of 18 articles were selected from four databases and by a manual search . With the help of inductive content analysis , the notes were first written down in order to form categories . The higher o rder headings, simplified phrases, the sub category and the upper category were created. The findings were compared together before listing data under the categories. The sub categor y include d categorie s, such as attitudes, religion, politics, 16 public health c are, cross -culture, fear, effecti veness, misconception, parental concern, internet influence, child health center, communication , lack of information, information , and trust. Simplified phrases from data were grouped in a way that the conte nts fit together in a particular category . For example, phrases such as \"anxiety\" and \"difficulty to find reliable sources \" were put under lack of information - category since they fit into this category the most . Based on the sub categories, the main themes were created to answer the thesis questions . Those themes were cultural factors, beliefs, vaccine hesitancy and patient education. Appendix 4 shows an example of inductive analysis content. 8. Results 8.1 Health care provider 's role in patient education Health care pr oviders , especially nurses, are mostly responsible of administering vaccinations. They have an important role to play in the implementation of national vaccination programmes and in maintaining high vaccine coverage. The negative attitude towards vaccinations is mainly due to the lack of awareness, in which case the health care provider must be able to provide reliable and up -to-date information in a way that suits the patient. In the context of vaccination, the key elemen ts of patient education are trust, health provider -patient relationship and communication. (Di Pietro et al. 2017.) Those health care providers who are vaccinated themselves are more likely to recommend vaccination to their patients. Some of the health car e providers believe that them personally being vaccinated could also create a reassuring example to patients. Most of the Finnish health care providers trust the benefits and safety of the vaccines. However, some health care providers perceive the opposite and are less willing to recommend vaccines to the patients. This brings up an ethical issue as the health care provid ers are often in a key role in patient's vaccination decisions and keeping the vaccination coverage high. (Paterson et al. 2016; Karlsson et al. 2019.) The lack of information has caused anxiety to the parents, and they wanted more information related to vaccination than they were provided. Parents would have wanted information about vaccination benefits and side effects clearly and simply. They felt like the health care providers were an important source of information for them. This highlights the fact that providing proper information for parents to acquire knowledge about vaccination is essen tial in order to reduc e vaccine hesitancy. The way in which the information is provided is equally as important. (Kestenbaum et al. 2015 ; Ames et al. 2017 .) Kaufman et al. (2020) states that face -to-face meetings for providing information and educating the parents about early childhood vaccination have enhanced children's 17 vaccination status. There has also been presumably light improvement on parents ' knowledg e and understanding of vaccination , and the intention to vaccinate. Face -to face meetings for educating people about vaccination are effective , especially when it comes to easing the communication and improving the exchange of information. It is good for the health care provider and the client to see each other since using verbal and non -verbal communication, such as body language and facial expressions, makes it easier to respond to the client's feelings and concerns. The review shows that it is important to not only provide facts but also listen and pay attention to the client's concerns to change the negative attitudes and reduce anxiety. (Kaufman et al. 2020.) Motivational interview has been proven to be an effective technique on vaccine hesitancy. It has resulted to a decrease in parents' vaccine hesitancy and increased growth in infants' vaccine status. A motivational interview is a collaboration with a client by interviewing. The purpose of the motivational interview is to strengthen a person's own motivation in relation to a particular issue. The motivational interview encourages the person to consider their own reasons for change in an open and accepting atmosphere. (Gagneur 2020. ) Motivationa l interviewing includes creating a partnership and trust, processes to promote the movement towards the objectives and using motivational interviewing skills to attend the specific concerns related to vaccination. Motivational interviewing skills include t he use of open -ended questions to avoid doubts, affirmation to highlight strengths and reflective listening. The i nformation is provided by using the elicit -share -elicit -technique , where the patient's baseline for a specific topic is asked first , and then supplemented with evidence - based information in a simple way. Lastly, the patient's understanding is ensured. Motivational interview is a good tool for addressing vaccine hesitancy, because it provides knowledge about the patients ' beliefs without them fe eling judged. The e ducational session in motivational interviewing is designed regarding the patient's individual needs, concerns or questions, which improves their motivation to vaccinate. (Gagneur 2020. ) Active listening of the patient's fears and concerns helps the health care provider to understand and respond to the roots of the issue. Providing empathy, openness and non - judging attitude build trust with the patient and make them more willing to listen and receive information. Health care provide rs also need to have a lot of knowledge about vaccines to be able to share information and explain about the vaccine's purpose, efficacy, safety, and the possible side effects. Health care provider s should provide a situation where the patient is in the be st position to choose wisely regarding the vaccination. (Di Pietro et al. 2017; Possenti 2019.) 18 Health care providers are the most trusted source and influencers regarding the vaccination and thus, play a great role in vaccination decisions. However, the capacity and confidence are on ordeal due to time constricts and increase d amount s of vaccine -hesitant patients. Health care providers need more tools and training to face and answer the patients' questions and concerns. (Paterson et al. 2016) 8.2 Knowle dge and beliefs toward s vaccination Vaccines cause a lot of debates and involve different kinds of beliefs and misinformation. Plenty of people believe strongly in vaccination but there are also opposition towards it. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy and refusal differ according to cultural and geographical contexts. Vaccine safety controversies have led to lack of trust in vaccinations, concerns of adverse events and adjuvants, and misconception. However, the scientific evidence on the benefits of vaccines is indisputable. Health care providers are key influencers in decision - making, so it is important that they recognize people's beliefs and attitudes towards vaccinations in order to provide suitable information with scientific evidence. (Geoghegan et al. 2020.) Potential causes for vaccine hes itancy are usually complex since m any cultural, social, political and personal factors influence decision -making . Past negative experiences, friends' opinions, access to information , values and religious background lead to universally c ommon beliefs that cause vaccine hesitancy. F or example , beliefs of immune system overload from overexposure and dishonesty from vaccine industry and health care system cause fear and conflicting feelings. (Succi 2018.) Concerns about vaccine safety, side -effects and components of the vaccine can stem from difficulty of accessing health care services and vaccination programmes. For example, Irish Travellers experience inequality in registration with family doctors and lac k of culturally sensitive immunization services. Misconceptions can be born from lack of information, low education opportunities and discrimination, marginalization , or stigmatization of a minority group . Other cultural differences such as language barrier, low social status and religion also contribute to misconceptions . (Fournet et al. 2018.) Some anthroposophists (members of spiritual movement) think that breastfeeding and safe environment where mothers stay home build sufficient immune system for the children to fight against infectious diseases without vaccines. In addition, some of those parents think that pediatric diseases are necessary for their child's development. Vaccine preventable diseases are dangerous and cause a great deal o f unnecessary suffering. For example, 19 measles is the most dangerous for small children, which highlights the need of MMR vaccination. (Fournet et al. 2018.) At times, there are also rumors going on that some vaccines are linked to serious chronic diseases. One of the most common belief is that vaccinations cause autism, diabetes or allergies. Any evidence -based research data does not support this claim. The mechan isms behind the origins of these diseases are not precisely known so it is easy for people to link the disease s to the vaccines. For example, autism is blamed on vaccinations because the symptoms of autism often occur at the same time as most countries give MMR vaccination to children. However, anyone can get these chronic diseases regardless of whether they have been vaccinated or not. (Geoghegan et al. 2020.) The link between mumps, measles and rubella vaccine and pediatric autism was brought up years after the Lancet published a study by Andrew Wakefield in 1998. According to the study, the vaccine was associated with autism spect rum disorders. This led to the decline of vaccination support and the incidence of measles cases increased. Allegations of an association between the MMR vaccine and pediatric autism have been found to be false by large studies. Even though Wakefield's res earch has been shown to be thoroughly untrue and it has already been retracted due to the misrepresentation of data, the article led to a broad media coverage. Fear of autism is still today many people's reason for vaccine refusal. (Geoghegan et al 2020.) Since some parts of Europe do not belie ve in MMR vaccination protection, there ha ve been sporadic outbreaks thorough years . There was a rubella outbreak in 2004 within an under - vaccinated religious community in the Netherlands, which then spread to Canada. This same under -vaccinated group has also caused two measles outbreaks in 2013 and 2014 with 2700 reported cases. There is a suspicion that non -vaccinated individuals in various groups in Europe share a common cultural and spiritual belief that God has send an outbreak for a reason and one should put trust in God instead of opposing the will. Since many of these groups live separately from the general population, they believe that vaccination is not necessary due to low exposure. There are also fear s and anxieties regarding MMR vaccination due to talks about adverse effects and injection of foreign substances from the media. (Fournet et al. 2018.) Many people believe that vaccin es include toxic substances. Usually, vaccines contain a small amount of aluminum, which improves the effectiveness of the vaccine by stimulating the immune system's response to the vaccine's antigens. In many of vaccines, such as hepatitis A and B, the antig ens are attached to aluminum salts. Compared to the environmental exposure, the amount of aluminum present in vaccines is so small that it does 20 not cause a safety concern . A person gets aluminum much more from room air, food and drinks. There have been studies about infants' exposure to aluminum and the results have shown that the cumulative amount of aluminum from breast milk and infant formula is bigger than from vaccines . Mercury has also been used as a preservative in vaccines in the past . Due to certain forms of mercury being known as toxic, people have had concerns about its safety in vaccines. However, the mercury used in in the vaccines, ethylmercury, is not neurotoxic and does not accumulate in the body. Ethylmercury also breaks down v ery quickly in the body. (Geoghegan et al. 2020.) Certain vaccines, such as rubella and hepatitis A, are manufactured in a way that they use human embryo cell lines. These vaccines contain residual DNA, which has caused concerns of the exposure being dange rous to the body. However, it is important to know that the minimal amount of DNA is fragmented and cannot attach itself into a new genome that easily. There is no real safety hazard to vaccine recipients. (Geoghegan et al. 2020.) There is also a common be lief, especially amongst new parents , that the sheer number of vaccines overload the children's immune system. However, all data refutes the concept that vaccines weaken the immune system. The body's defense system begins to develop early on, and the vaccination schedule is timed in a way tha t it takes into consideration the timing of vaccination effectiveness, maternal antibody and susceptibility of the disease. Thus, the combination of vaccines does not burden the child. (Geoghegan et al. 2020.) Vaccinations have visibly changed the world be cause they have saved lives and continue to do so. Despite this, vaccines continue to share a lot of opinions, create fears and uncertainties as well as rumors and different beliefs. Many p eople have difficulties in distinguishing evidence -based data from incorrect information. This is one of the reasons why misunderstandings arise. When co nsidering the rare side effects of vaccines, it is important to compare the risk of a side effect occurring and the risk of disease occurring if the vaccine is not given. Positive beliefs, such as vaccines having more benefits than risks, vaccines being ef fective and safe, and vaccines protecting the community, lead to a high percentage of people taking vaccination. (Dube at al. 2013; Geoghegan et al. 2020 .) 8.3 The growing vaccine hesitancy amongst parents One of the many challenges that health care pro viders encounter are new parents expressing concern and reluctance in vaccinating their children. Since the number of vaccine -hesitant parents have been rising recently , parental vaccine hesitancy is starting to become a public health concern . The less vac cinated children, the more increase in disease outbreaks and epidemics. Hence, i t is important to observe general characteristics of 21 vaccine -hesitant parents : similar ity in individual determinants and psychosocial factors tend to show the same vaccination beliefs. Lack of awareness, self -estimation and satisfaction in information are also associated with both vaccination refusal and acceptance. (Dube et al. 2013 ; Olson et al. 2020.) Parents' beliefs of vaccines dictate their decision to accept, delay or refuse the vaccin es offered to their children. In the US study, a large portion of parents share the same views regarding health. For example, vaccination is unnecessary with good hygiene and habits, vaccine substances are unsafe and cause autism or multiple sclerosis , and the immune system gets overloaded from the vaccines. CDC National Immunization Survey data from 2020 shows that more than one -third of U.S children below one -year-olds were not vaccinated according to the childhood vaccination schedule. Vaccines can be seen as something as disturbing rather than boosting for the child's immune system. A Dutch survey discovered that many parents thought that children were over -vaccinated and that vaccines interfered with natural development. (Dube et al. 2013; Olson et al 2020.) Additionally, religious leaders have an influence in parents' vaccination decision -making. The idea of vaccination and religion being incompatible with each other dates back to the introduction of vaccines. Since moral convictions and religious beliefs play a part in overall view of health and immunity , it is not uncommon for parents to opposit e vaccination due to the preference of natural immunity instead of \"artificial\" methods . Health care provider s need to take parents' mental barriers into consideration when examining the ir risk perception and vaccination behavior. In the end, both childhood immunization and vaccination decision - making are based on parents' perceived benefit to the child. (Dube et al. 2013 ; Olson et al 2020 .) Concern based on parental instinct also spreads easily from one parent to another. Parents like to share experiences, beliefs and advice with each other in different outlets. New, confused parents who seek information through traditional media outlets and social media are exposed to misleading information . They usually end up trusting other parents with the same concern rather than scientifically proven information that lacks emotional aspects and parental views. Since misconceptions spread fast, vaccine -hesitant parents might believe that there are effective alternatives to vaccines and seek guidance from alternative medicine practitioners . Parental concern, internet influence, and the new experience as first -time parents can cause quite a stir in vaccine acceptance. With evidence -based information being buried under controversies, vaccination programmes and health care providers' communication methods suffer. (Olson et al. 2020.) 22 Besides few cases, patient -provider relationship and health care provider's attitude and knowledge towards vaccination are the main reasons for parents accepting a vaccine for their children. Trust is also an important factor since it is linked with parents' risk perception and decision -making . The less trust in the health care provider, the more likely is the parents' refusal for vaccination. Some parents' vaccination hesitancy is not due to vaccine safety, but how much authority the health care system has over people : parents might have had negative e xperiences with vaccine providers and felt like they were being pressured to get childhood vaccines . This has led to mistrust towards the public health care system and child's incomplete vaccination . There is also mistrust towards medical science's research and pharmaceutical industry 's real intention . (Dube et al. 2013 ; Olson et al. 2020. ) The growing vaccine hesitancy amongst parents have led to some of them delaying their children's vaccination. Since many parents have not received proper vaccination education, they end up beli eving misinformation about MMR and DTP vaccines causing immune overload . Thus, t hey might try to avoid official vaccination schedule by following own \"alternative vaccination schedule\" . Doubtful parents feel unsupported by health care providers and want to delay certain vaccines as long as possible to avoid adverse event s. Although, this ends up increas ing the time of the child being unprotected . (Dube et al. 2013; Succi 2018.) The reasons behind vaccine hesitancy are complicated. All personal factors, such as doubts, concerns and fears over adverse events and mistrust about the need of the vaccines, vaccin e efficacy and safety, impact heavily parents' decision -making. Since hesitant parents tend to share the same views of modern medication's effectiveness and preventive measures, the importance of health care provider's role in being a guiding figure and sharing reliable resources increases . (Succi 2018.) 8.4 Cultural factors in vaccination decision -making People generally know that the vaccine's purpose is to protect them from vaccine - preventable disease and death. Although, t his fact alone does not push people to get vaccinated. Many factors contribute to vaccination decision -making. Social, cultural, scientific and temporal trends have strong impacts on how people view va ccination (Poland et al. 2009) . Health care pro viders have an important role in guiding the patient with the best decision. Their knowledge and attitudes are important determinants f or vaccine uptake. Even though health care pro viders generally encourage vaccination, there are some vaccine -hesitant individuals in the field too. For example, some professionals are reluctant to take seasonal 23 influenza vaccines. Many nurses rely on their autonom ies to protect themselves from peer pressure and trust traditional health beliefs rather than evidence -based medicine in vaccination decision -making. A common belief in workplace culture is that healthy lifestyle and natural immune system is enough to protect from influenza. ( Dube et. al 2013; Pless et. al 2017.) While nurses might not express their opinions to the clients openly, beliefs circulating within the workplace can affect other professionals' views on influenza vaccines. This can lead to them conforming to workplace culture by changing the ir vaccination attitude, behavior and decision -making. It becomes a problem if the general public notices health care provider s' changing attitude towards certain vaccines. Rejection of influenza vaccines might cause people to question other vaccines too and lose their trust in vaccination overall. To empower the nurses to take influenza vaccines, there needs to be more promotion of decision -making skills, teaching of evidence -based decision -making in workplace and a training programme . (Pless et al. 2017 .) Health care providers are not the only ones relying on their peers. Many vaccine -hesitant individuals search the internet to help them with their dilemma. If they want to confirm or debunk their fears, many global networks offer personal experiences and opinions. If an individual wants to find a link between MMR vaccination and autism by Googling, about only 51% of the websi tes provide correct information of false association. The anti-vaccine culture paired with media -based consumerism have a negative effect on population -level health. In the UK, the rumor about measles vaccine having an association with autism led to actual population -level decrease in vaccine use. There was a period of resurgence of measles - related hospitalization and deaths. (Poland et al. 2009; Dube et al. 2013.) Since people consume internet as a source of information where all texts are seen as equally credible, expertise does not really matter anymore. People have moved from evidence -based to media -based medicine. Anti -vaccine websites argue against vaccination usefulness and safety with different conspiracy theories. They will appeal with emotional aspects like personal stories of vaccine damage. The websites also use fake experts and purposively show texts that only support their own agenda while discrediting opposite views. This kind of domineering presence can be convincing to unsuspecting people who are genuinely struggling with vaccination decision -making. Many non -official websites seem trustworthy with their immaculate wording, but in reality, they are often misleading and manipulative. (Poland et al. 2009; Dube et al. 2013.) Whitehead and Perry ( 2020) report that cultural factors such as politics and religion are associated with anti -vaccine attitudes. Their findings reveal that Christian nationalism and 24 political conservatism show belief in parents' being ultimate authority figures to vaccination decision -making for their children and skepticism towards drug companies and doctors. Religious and political conservatism prefer individualist and hierarchical thinking instead of trusting science. (Whitehead & Perry 2020.) Anti-vaccine culture holds man y negative beliefs of vaccination. The most common ones are about doctors and drug companies not being honest about risks and side -effects, vaccines giving autism, parents having the right to decide for their children, vaccines not protecting from dangerou s diseases, and children getting too many vaccines. Former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has a significant political and cultural influence on people, has made comments against COVID -19 vaccination, which has increased an anti -vaccine discussion in the U.S. Cultural beliefs and an influential political character together affect significantly decision -making and vaccination uptake. (Whitehead & Perry 2020.) The public health care also influences vaccination decision -making. A recent example of individual right and public health care's clash would be how COVID -19 vaccines have been viewed in the United States. The U.S. citizens generally value individual freedom and the right to control own choices without interference . Thus, w ith public health authorities and political officials working together to dismantle the pandemic and urging people to get vaccinated , the citizens feel like the response to COVID -19 has become too politicized . People feel like their individual rights are being violated with the possibility of tampered COVID -19 information by political interference in health care settings . Public health agencies' credibility has lowered due to distrust . There are also beliefs of the government requiring personal information for the vaccine and experimenting on people . There is no confidence and trust in vaccine safety since people do not feel respected . Therefore , it is important for the p ublic health care authorities to develop and implement programmes that focus on spreading informed decision -making to increase vaccination acceptance and collaborating with the communities to show their trustworthiness. (Salmon et al. 2021.) To conclude , it is crucial to understand culture's effect in vaccination decision -making . Cultural ideologies promote views and beliefs in a way that they affect significantly general population 's attitudes on vaccination. Acknowledging possible barriers , attitudes and negative consequences that stem from an environmental culture helps to find even more effective response to strengthen vaccination decision -making. ( Whitehead & Perry 2020.) 25 8.5 Cross -cultural differences There is a difference in influenza vaccine coverage between countries and age groups, which suggests that cultural -specific factors are associated with household members' vaccination decisions. (Taylor et al. 2015.) Household members are very diverse people wit h different vaccine opinions. Some are more supportive of vaccination than others. Close contacts and different vaccination behaviors raise the probability of contracting a contagious pathogen. The members might also affect each other's thinking and behavi or with direct or indirect influence since environmental determinants and similar opinions dictate vaccination uptake. The findings express that understanding cultural factors and clustering vaccine opinions within households will help the public health to improve ways of controlling influenza epidemics in the future. (Taylor et al. 2015.) Eastern cultures tend to be more collectivist ic while western cultures are more individualistic. Individualistic culture encourages autonomy and making own decisions. Therefore, eastern people are more influenced by the household than western people. In addition, age plays a factor in how much influenc e it holds in eastern and western cultures. For example, eastern people's culture emphasizes on the importance of the elderly members. In western countries, age stratification places older people lower than younger adults. This means that western household members do not necessarily rely on elderly people in decision -making . In eastern countries, elderly people have more status and power than younger people, so they impact the younger household members' vaccination decisions strongly . Direct influence , such as advising someone to get vaccinated , affects vaccination uptake in several countries. (Taylor et al. 2015.) Public health acting directly by promoting influenza vaccination, for example, through advertising campaigns, helps the households who are ag ainst vaccines to be more informed about the benefits of the vaccination. When the message of public health reaches the target audience, it indirectly reaches the household s through individuals who deliver the messages to the members. For example, the UK's public health's indirect communication of influenza vaccination programme for children reached the parents, who showed strong support towards it. Parental awareness and giving advice to older teens were critical for the programme's success. While this was success in a western country, this was not the case in an eastern country. For example, public health messages that promoted advising the Japanese elderly population about the influenza vaccine fell short due to reluctance to advice elders in the eastern culture. Younger household members were more li kely to 26 receive the advice rather than elderly household members. Cultural differences attributed to cross -national differences in willingness to advise household members. (Taylor et al. 2015.) There are two plausible explanations for the east -west differe nces in vaccination. First, giving advice to another person shows that the advisor cares about them. Despite assumptions, eastern countries hold more negative views and attitudes towards their elderly household members than western countries. This could ex plain why there is a lack of advice -giving to elderly people in certain eastern countries compared to western countries. Secondly, Asians seem to be more dutiful and respectful towards their elderly members than their western counterparts. Therefore, due t o this cultural feat, younger household members do not engage in advice -giving, an expression that could unintentionally imply more power and status than the elder ly person. These features might contribute to smaller influenza vaccination uptake in eastern countries. (Taylor et al. 2015.) The differen ce in advice -giving based on environment's cultural norms, ages between the household members and cultural dimensions cause difficulty in unifying all household members. Diverse views and attitudes lead to clustering of different vaccination behavi ors and decision -making. Hence, in order to enhance trust in vaccination and increase the uptake in households , campaigns should aim for their strategies and messages to be more culture -specific . (Taylor et al. 2015.) 27 9. Conclusion Based on the results of this thesis, it can be concluded that decision -making related to vaccination is a complex phenomenon. Many different factors lead to beliefs as well as misunderstandings that influence patients' decision -making. The thesis revealed that many beliefs are due to fear and lack of trust . People easily draw conclusions about vaccinations based on information spread on social media, among other things, because they are unable to distinguish between evidence -based information and false information . Moreover, the results of this thesis showed that beliefs are influenced by cultural, social, and political factors. Based on the research results, it can be noted that culture plays a role in vaccine uptake. Cultural factors, such as norms , values and behavior , shape people's attitudes and might be partially a reason why anti-vaccine culture has been on a rise recently . In addition, vaccina tion decisio n-making is guided by autonomy , religion, experiences , political authorities and campaigns. In general , it can be stated that health care providers play a big role in maintaining vaccine coverage since patients perceive them as a reliable source of information . Based on the results of the study, patients felt that they had received too little information about vaccinations : they wanted a clear information about the benefits as well as the disadvantages. With the growing number of anti -vaccine patients, it would be important to be able to meet their needs properly in vaccination guidance. 28 10. Discussion 10.1 Review of thesis results The aim of this thesis was to discover and describe how culture influences the vaccination decision and what beliefs affect people's perception of vaccination. The research questions of this thesis are: \"What is the health care provider's role in immunization?\", \"What beliefs cause vaccination hesitancy?\" and \"How does culture affect vaccination decision -making?\" . The aims of the work were fulfilled, and the answer s to the research qu estions could be deduced from the results of the literature review. The results are viewed from the perspective of the research questions . Health care providers are generally trusted in vaccine matters . Still , many patients feel like they do not receive enough information to be able to make vaccination decisions . Patients want truthful information about both the benefits and possible harms of vaccinations. (Ames et al. 2017 .) With the growing number of vaccine -hesitant patients , health care p roviders are required to have vaccine expertise as well as tools for proper and respectful vaccination guidance. It is important that patients receive reliable information from health care providers and do not draw their own conclusions from, for example , the incorrect texts on social media. Dube et al. (20 13) and Poland et al. (2009) agree that media -based consumerism has been a tre nd worthy to acknowledge since it affect s vaccination views . Many individuals rely on their peers and seek guidance from the internet where all kinds of information about the vaccin es are visible. Dube et al. (20 13) also highlights that a nti-vaccine websites often use personal stories about vaccination to appeal to people's emotions. These websites rely on personal aspects and hoaxing tactics t o gain trust and drive attentio n away from authorit y websites that actually contain evidence -based information . Thus, it is essential for health care provider s to understand the media's role and impact on vaccination attitudes and address the patients ' concerns by providing reliable sources . There are many ways to provide vaccination guidance. F ace-to-face meetings and motivational interviews have been proven to be effective. Those techniques increase the ability of health care providers to provide reliable information to patients, which leads to a reduction in anxiety . Both face -to-face meetings and the use of motivational interviews improve patients' motivation to be vaccinate d. (Kaufman et al. 2020 ; Gagneur 2020 .) In vaccination guidance, it is important that it is designed for a specific patient because everyone has different needs and concerns. Karlsson et al. (2019) and Pless et. al (2017 ) emphasize that health care providers' own opinions do have an impact in their willingness to 29 recommend vaccinations to the patients. In addition, t here is an ethical aspect to who is responsible for a child that becomes ill from a vaccine -preventable disease in a case where parents have not received enough information from the health care provider. Most of the selected articles brought out similar beliefs about vaccination that can be explained by fear and lack of information. Beliefs related to vaccin ation include the harmful substances in vaccin es, the fear of immune system overload , and the connection of vaccin es to chronic diseases , such as the link between MMR vaccine and pediatric autism , which has been proved to be untrue ( Geoghegan et al. 2020 ). Fournet et al. 2018 also states that some parents think that vaccine -preventable diseases are good for children and therefore, vaccines are not necessary. The a rticles also commen ted that patients' decision to not vaccinate was often based on some specific reason , such as discrimination, negative previous experiences, or rumors. Beliefs and d eficiencies in scientific data are not the only reason s for vaccination criticism. Dube et al. (2013) and Succi (2018) emphasize that in addition to personal opinions , there are cultural factors such as religious, social and political reasons behind the vaccine hesitancy . For example, Christian nationalism and political conservatism support autonomy in vaccination decision -making as well as doubts a gainst pharmaceutical companies and the health care system . In addition, individuals with a lot of cultural and political power can easily affect people's vaccination decision -making, such as the former U.S. President Donald Trump, who commented on COVID -19 vaccination and influenced the recent COVID -19 anti- vaccine movement. (Whitehead & Perry 2020 .) Many cultural characteristics affect the decision -making of vaccin ation. Salmon et al. (2021) comments that for example, the U.S. citizens value individual freedom and the right to control their own choices . Hence, they have become more hesitant to get vaccinated due to political interference . The U.S. citizens feel like the government is intervening with their individual freedom and forcing them to get vaccinated instead of respecting their decisions and choices . This affects negatively in the decision -making of vaccination and how the vaccination is viewed . Also, according to Taylor et al. (2015), western cultures are more individualistic while eastern cultures tend to be more collectivistic . This influences the attitudes towards autonomy , the peer effect on one's own behavior , and thought s about vaccination. Several environmental factors in culture affect directly and indirectly vaccination opinions and vaccination uptake. Taylor et al. (2015) continues to state that age and valuation of the elderly people are indirect cultural influence s on vaccination decision -making in households . 30 The results summarize th e importance of health care provider's role in vaccination education and in giving advice based on environment's cultural factors. Since beliefs and culture together have an effect on the view and decision -making of vaccination , it is important to address doubts, concerns and fears related to vaccines in order to guide the patients to make the most suitable choice for them. 10.2 Ethics and reliability The purpose of r esearch ethics is to cover ethical viewpoints related to research. It refers to an action that is ethically responsible in research while preventing fraud and dishonesty. Research in tegrity focuses on honesty when adopting research activities. (TENK 2012.) The research for this thesis has been conducted according to the responsible conduct of research. The study uses appropriate research methods, such as citing other researchers while publishing the results, using information accurately and presenting scientific knowledge in an open and responsible fashion. There was no need to consider ethical aspects of acquiring research permits since the thesis relied on literature review instead of external participants. (TENK 2012.) The data was searched and gathered from credible databases and mostly up-to-date sources . For example, Google Scholar, PudMed and Cochrane library were utilized for their trustworthiness . Few o lder works were also selected since the information was found to be in a more coherent format than in some more recent works. The consistency , reliability and validity of the information were checked to be in effect when compared to other newer studies . Otherwise, during data search, the aim was to find the most recent information that answered the research questions and opened the topic further for the readers . Data search and collection w ere done attentively for a long period in order to get answers for the research questions. After the materials had been read multiple times to select the most fitting information for the topic , the key concepts were written down and used in content analysis to form categories in order to further analyze and interpret the data reliably. Also, to increase the reliability of th is thesis, Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools were used to assess the research quality. The JBI has formed 13 tools in which systematic reviews (Appendix 5), text and opinion writings (Appendix 6) , qualitative research (Appendix 7), and analytical cross -sectional studies (Appendix 8) were u sed on this thesis ' literature review materials . JBI critical appraisal tool contains questions about methodological choices and short multiple -choice answers to these questions . Not only does the tool evaluate methodological quality, but it also determines the possibility of addressed bias in the study's analysis, conduct and design. Research studies are included based on 31 the answers. (Luciani et al. 2019 ; JBI 2020 .) Two appraisers were involved in examining the studies selected for inclusion. In qualitative studies, quality assessment scores were calculated on a scale of 1 -10, in cross -sectional studies on a scale of 1-8, in systematic reviews on a scale of 1-11, and in text and opinion papers on a scale of 1-6. The criterion was scored in a way that if the criterion was met, one point was awarded. No points were awarded if the cri terion was not met, if the situation was unclear , or if the criterion was not applicable. The s cores were added up according to the fulfillment of the criteria. In the quality assessment, the aim was to obtain as high score as possible for each study to ensure a high level of quality . The minimum percent age of the score was about 60%, which was considered sufficient enough for inclusi on. The q uality assessment was performed separately , and the scores were compared with each other. In studies where the scoring was unclear , re-evalua tion was done . The re were little dissenting opinions and an agreement on quality scoring was reached by discussing and evaluating together . For the quality assessment, a total of 18 studies were selected and assessed . The scores of the quality assessment are presented in the Appendix 9. 10.3 Further research Since the thesis results showed the importance of health care providers' role in vaccination education, it would be good to study the health care providers' experiences of their own vaccination skills in further studies. How they encounter specifically vaccine -critical pe ople and how their vaccination skills could be developed further to make the discussion about vaccination more open and trust -inspiring for the patients. Further review should also focus on how health care providers should address the patients' beliefs and cultural backgrounds when they plan and personalize individual vaccination education. 32 List of references Ames, H., Glenton, C. & Lewin, S. 2017.
