Recent research has shown that singing bowls help to shift the brainwaves out of the beta and into the more relaxed alpha and deeply rejuvenating theta brainwave states, while also having a calming effect on our nervous system. Other studies have shown that the sounds of nature - such as the ocean, rain, bird songs, etc... - are also very helpful in allowing a person to relax; attain a state of increased calmness; reduce levels of anxiety, stress &/or anger. Bringing these peaceful sounds together, these tracks will help you access a natural serenity & achieve a greater sense of calm, peace, and well-being.
