One homeopath, in his eagerness to justify his claim that 'homeopathy is spiritual healing', quoted recently from hahnemann on my facebook page as follows: \"Homeopathy is a spiritual art of healing.The physician must be a Holy channel for the flow of the divine grace transmit through him to the sick\"- HAHNEMANN. I am not sure whether hahnemann had ever said so or not. Had he actually said so, I would say it is the most unscientific statement hahnemann would have ever made. How can any body claiming to be a 'physician' say that he is a \"holy channel\" for \"flow of the divine grace transmit through him to the sick\"? If it is only a matter of \"divine grace\", why should hahnemann do all these drug provings, potentizations and experiments with 'drugs'? I prefer to stay away from those \"spiritual homeopaths\" who claim claiming to be healing with \"divine grace\" and \"spiritual energy\", since the language of science is beyong the reach of their comprehension. I have nothing to discuss or argue with them. A physician is not expected to be a 'spiritual healer'. Let the religious people do that job. Actually, a 'physician' starts to talk about 'spiritual healing' when he fails as a 'physician'. Homeopathy is essentially a form of 'drug therapy'. It has nothing to do with 'spiritual healing'. Homeopathy should be understood, explained and practiced as a scientific medicine. If your selection of 'similimum' went wrong, you cannot cure the patient, how much \"divine grace\" you \"transmit to the sick\". Do you claim that NUX, SULPH or LYCO are different forms of 'divine grace' you transmit? 'Homeopathy is spiritual healing'- this theory is intentionally propagated world over by proponents of diverse colors of occult and pseudo-scientific practices destroying the scientific credentials of homeopathy. By this act, these people are gravely alienating homeopathy from mainstream scientific knowledge system. Along with homeopathic practice, these people are actually doing spiritual healing, psychic healing, Therapeutic touch, Healing Touch, Esoteric healing, Magnetic healing, Qigong healing, Reiki, Pranic healing, Crystal healing, distant healing, intercessionary prayer, Acupuncture, biofield energy healing,spiritual healing, contact healing, distant healing and various other occult practices. They prefer to call themselves as CAM practitioners. That is why they want to include homeopathy in the category of 'energy medicine', and try to explain homeopathy in that terms. These people propagate hair transmission, telephone transmission, photo transmission, mp3 file transmission, telepathy, radionics, dowsing, spiritual homeopathy and such things in the name of homeopathy. The dangerous thing is, these people have great influence and dominance in international homeopathic community. They appear as 'representatives' and 'advocates' of homeopathy! SPIRITUAL HEALING holds the belief that a healer can channel healing energy into the person seeking help by different methods: hands-on, hands-off, and distant (or absent) where the patient and healer are in different locations. There are various schools of SPIRITUAL HEALING. It is known as biofield energy healing, spiritual healing, contact healing, distant healing, therapeutic touch, Reiki etc. SPIRITUAL HEALING is largely non-denominational: practitioners do not see traditional religious faith as a prerequisite for effecting a cure. Faith healing, by contrast, takes place within a religious context. Since homeopathy uses DRUGS, when you say 'homeopathy is spiritual healing', you seem to mean that homeopathic drugs contain 'spiritual energy' acting 'dynamically', rather than any sort of 'material' active principles. By 'dynamic action', it is meant that the therapeutic actions happens without involvement any 'material' agents. Do you consider homeopathic drugs as 'immaterial'? If homeopathic drugs act 'dynamically', it should be capable of acting from a distance, without any material or physical contact with our body. Then, why you ask the patients to take 'medicines' by mouth? You could have asked the patient to keep the drugs at a distance from body, and allow it to act 'dynamically'! We cannot call something a 'medicine', if it does not contain any 'material'substance. The term 'medicine' refers to something 'material'. Any 'substance', whether medicine or not, is always 'material'. If something is 'immaterial', it cannot be called a 'medicinal substance'! It is a fact that highly potentized homeopathic drugs do not contain any molecule of 'original' drug substances. But that does not mean those preparations are 'immaterial' or 'spiritual'. Actually, our drugs contain 'molecular imprints' of original drug molecules. Molecular imprints are 'material'. They are supramolecular formations of water and ethyl alcohol molecules, into which the spacial conformations of individual drug molecules are engraved as nanocavities. These nanocavities or molecular imprints are the active principles of potentized drugs, which act as artificial binding sites for pathogenic molecules having conformational affinity. It is obvious that there is nothing 'immaterial' or 'spiritual' in the therapeutic actions of potentized drugs. There is no any 'spiritual healing' involved in homeopathy. "}
