The act removes the limitation that a child be a victim of an enumerated sexual offense for the child's name and identify ing information to be deleted from a criminal justice record released to the public. The act also requires that the name and identify ing information of a child who witnesses a criminal offense be deleted from criminal justice records released to the public. The act specifies that these deletion requirements do not apply to criminal justice records that solely involve traffic offenses. The act establishes a good cause exception that allows a person to petition a district court for the disclosure of the name and identify ing information of a child witness or child victim. The person seeking disclosure must establish good cause for disclosure at a hearing conducted after the child victim, child witness, or their respective legal guardian receives notice. Good cause means a finding that the person seeking disclosure has established that the public interest in accessing the child victim' s or child witness' s name and identify ing information substantially outweig hs the harm to the privacy interest of the child victim, child witness, or their respective leg al guardian. The law previously required a criminal justice agency to make the notation \"CHILD VICTIM\" on a criminal justice record involving a child victim when the child victim' s name is disclosed during proceeding s related to the criminal justice record or when the child victim or child victim' s guardian requests the notation. The act requires that a criminal justice agency make the notation \"CHILD WITNESS\" on a criminal justice record involving a child witness under the same circumstances.

Currently , the state and several state enterprises impose fees on retail sales of taxable tang ible personal property delivered by motor vehicle to a location in the state. These fees are collectively known as the retail delivery fee (RDF ), and a retailer who makes a retail delivery is required to add the RDF to the price of the retail delivery , collect it from the purchaser, and pay the RDF revenue to the department of revenu e (department), which distributes the revenue to the appropriate cash funds. The department generally administers the RDF in the same manner as the state sales and use tax. The act modifies this administration by permitting a retailer to pay the RDF on behalf of the purchaser. I f the retailer elects to pay the RDF , then the retailer is: !Not required to add the RDF to the price of the retail delivery , separately itemiz e the RDF , or collect the RDF from the purchase r, who is not liable or the amount nor eligible for a refund of an erroneously paid RDF ; and !Required to remit the RDF on the date that would be required if the RDF had been received from the purchaser on the date of the retail delivery . The department is required to waive any processing costs for a retailer' s electronic payment by automated clearing house (ACH) debit of the RDF if the charg es would exceed the amount of the RDF revenue being remitted. The act creates an exemption from the RDF for a retail delivery by a qualified business, which is a business that has $500,000 or less of retail sales in the prior y ear or is new, that applies retroactively to when RDF s were first imposed. A purchaser is not eligible for a refund of any RDF that is collected and remitted to the department by a qualified business prior to the effective date of the act. The act also creates a primary definition for \"retail delivery \" that is cross-referenced in other RDF provisions, and related to this chang e, a definition of \"retail sale\" is repealed where the cross reference makes it unnecessary .

At the same time, the general assembly also adopted a prevailing wage law (prevailing wage law) that requires any contractor who is awarded a contract for a public project by an agency of government for $500,000 or more and that does not include federal money , and any subcontractors working on the public project, to pay their employ ees a prevailing wag e at weekly intervals. The act creates a new categ ory of public projects defined as \"energ y sector public works projects\" , and requires these projects to comply with the requirements of the apprenticeship 2023 DIGEST 140 GOV ERNM ENT - STATEutiliz ation law and the prevailing wage law. An \"energ y sector public works project\" is any project that: !Has the purpose of generating , transmitting , or distributing electricity or natural gas to provide energ y to Colorado individual consumers and businesses, is built by or for a public utility , and is funded in whole or in part by the state or utility customer funding ; or !Has the purpose of generating or distributing electricity or natural gas for the purpose of providing energ y to Colorado individual consumers and businesses from utility customer funding as approved by a cooperative electric association. With certain exceptions, the act requires that a contract between public utilities, cooperative electric associations, or independent power produce rs and lead contractors for an energ y sector public works project include provisions that expressly require that all work performed under the contract comply with the apprenticeship utiliz ation law and the state prevailing wage law if the project is an electric power generation project with a nameplate generation capacity of one megawatt or higher or if the project is a project other than an electric power generation project with a total cost of one million dollars or more. All contracts with subcontractors on the project are also required to include such provisions. If the contract for an energ y sector public works project does not include such provisions, the project will not be eligible to receive state funding or to receive requir ed authoriz ations or approvals from the public utilities commission (PUC). For projects funded in whole or in part by the state, the requirements to comply with the apprenticeship utiliz ation law and the prevailing wage law apply only when the project is a power generation project with a nameplate generation capacity of one megawatt or higher or an energ y storag e system with an energ y rating of one megawatt of powe r capacity or 4 megawatt hours of useable energ y capacity or higher and the aggregated public assistance from the state is $500,000 or more. For other projects, the apprenticeship utiliz ation law and the prevailing wage law apply only when the total project cost is one million dollars or more and the aggregated public assistance from the state, funding from a public utility , or funding from a cooperative electric association is $500,000 or more. The requirements to comply with the apprenticeship utiliz ation law and the prevailing wage law do not apply to a project that is covered by a project labor agreement, work on an energ y sector public works project performed by employ ees of a utility company , work on an energ y sector public works project put out to bid on or after January 1, 2024, that is qualified for and claims the increased federal production tax credit or investment tax credit amount by having satisfied federal \"Inflation Reduction Act\" requirements, a utility-incentiviz ed demand-side manag ement electrificat ion program, a utility or state-funded building energ y efficiency program, service agreements that were entered into on or before March 1, 2023, projects that involve an electric distribution line with a specified capacity , and projects that involve pipelines with a specified minimum y ield streng th. The lead contractor for an energ y sector public works project is required to prepare certified payroll records for workers directly employ ed by the contractor, obtain certified payroll records from all contractors and subcontractors on the project, and submit the records to the public utility or other owner of the energ y sector public works project weekly . The lead contractor is also required to 2023 DIGEST 141 GOV ERNM ENT - STATEprepare a quarterly craft labor certification that attests that the lead contractor and all subcontractors are compliant with the apprenticeship utiliz ation law and the prevailing wage law. The public utility , cooperative electric association, independent power producer, or other owner of an energy sector public works project is required to maintain the records for all craft labor certifications and is required to either provide copies quarterly to the department of labor and employ ment or require the lead contractor to provide such copies. The state auditor' s office is required to conduct an audit of the PUC' s approval of energy sector public works projects no later than January 1, 2029, and at least 5 years thereafter. The purpose of the audit is to establish oversig ht and accountability for compliance with the \"best value\" employ ment metrics for electric resources acquisition and the employ ment, training, wage, and apprenticeship requirements specified in the act. Violations of the requirements for energ y sector public works project contracts are subject to the penalties described in the apprenticeship utiliz ation law and the prevailing wag e law. In lieu of compliance with the apprenticeship utiliz ation law and the prevailing wage law, a public utility , cooperative electric association, or independent power producer may incorporate a project labor agreement requirement for an energ y sector public works project. The PUC is prohibited from deny ing approval of an energ y sector public works project solely because it uses a project labor ag reement. The act specifies which provisions of the apprenticeship utiliz ation law for public projects apply to energ y sector public works projects. Regarding \"best value\" employ ment metrics that the PUC is required to consider when it evaluates electric resource acquisitions and requests for certificates of public convenience and necessity for construction or expansion of generating facilities, the act requires the PUC to promulg ate rules requiring utilities, when submitting annual progress reports for an electric resource acquisition, to collect and provide to the PUC information concerning the implementation of \"best value\" employ ment metrics and requires the PUC to report annually to committees of reference of the g eneral assembly concerning the information that is reported. The act adds enforcement mechanisms for the existing mechanical, electrical, and plumbing apprenticeship utiliz ation requirements for gas demand-side manag ement projects and beneficial electrification projects. In addition, the act requires that projects undertaken pursuant to specified existing state laws comply with the state mechanical, electrical, and plumbing apprenticeship utiliz ation law and the state prevailing wag e law. For the 2023-24 state fiscal year, the act appropriates $108,401 from the general fund to the department of labor and employment for use by the division of labor standards and statistics to implement the act.

Specifically , the commission is grante d the exclusive authority to regulate operations (deep geothermal operations) for the ex ploration for or production of: !An allocated g eothermal resource; or !A geothermal resource that is deeper than 2,500 feet below the surface. The state engineer retains the exclusive authority to regulate operations that are not deep geothermal operations (shallow g eothermal operations). Prior to obtaining a permit from the commission to construct a well for deep geothermal operations, the applicant must provide evidence of any applicable siting application to the local government with jurisdiction over the deep geothermal operations, including the disposition of the application, unless the local government does not regulate the siting of such operations. Upon request by a local government, the commission is also required to provide technical support to the local government concerning implementation of the commission' s rules regarding deep geothermal operations. The commission and the state engineer may each adopt rules for the assessment of fees for the processing and granting of a permit to construct a well for deep geothermal operations or shallow geothermal operations, as applicable. Any fees collected by the commission will be deposited by the state treasurer into the fund. Current law requires the operator of a well, prior to the production of geothermal fluid from the well, to obtain a permit from the state eng ineer. Section 9: !Bifurcates the issuance of different types of use permits by the state engineer between permits for the use of geothermal resources that are not allocated resources and permits for the use of allocated geothermal resources (collectively , use permits); and !Requires the state engineer to only issue a use permit for allocated geothermal resources after a determination that any associated geothermal fluid is nontributary groundwater (nontributary determination). Section 9 also allows the state engineer to adopt rules for the administration of use permits and the issuance of nontributary determinations. Current law allows the state engineer to adopt procedures that establish geothe rmal manag ement districts for the manag ement of g eothermal operations within the district. Section 10 limits the scope of geothermal manag ement districts to distributed geothermal resources. The state engineer is also required to notify the commission of any application for a geothermal manag ement district that is anticipated to affect deep g eothermal operations. Section 11 allows the commission to adopt procedures by rule to establish geothermal resource units for allocated g eothermal resources. Section 13 grants the commission the ex clusive authority to regulate any intrastate facility that stores natural gas in an underg round facility not subject to regulation by the public utilities commission (UNGS facility ). If the commission submits a certification to, or enters into an agreement with, the federal secretary of transportation pursuant to applicable federal law, any rules regulating UNGS facilities must be at least as string ent as the applicable federal requirements. 2023 DIGEST 249 NATURA L RESOURCE SIf a UNGS facility is proposed to be sited in an area that would affect a disproportionately impacted community , the commission must evaluate and address impacts from the UNGS facility .

The act chang es how pass-throug h entities may elect to pay taxes, specifies how to report and account for adjustments to federal taxable income, and chang es the due date for filing a C-corporation income tax return. Partnerships and S corporations (pass-throug h entities) have had 3 options for ensuring that the income taxes owed by nonresident owners will be paid. Pass-throug h entities have been able to file a composite return on behalf of these owners, withhold an estimated tax payment, or collect and file an agreement that the owner will file a separate return. F or income tax years beginning on and after January 1, 2024, section 1 of the act consolidates the composite return and withholding options and clarifies the calculation of the required pay ment. Section 2 adopts the multistate tax commission' s model statute for reporting adjustments to federal taxable income.

The concurrent resolution submits a constitutional amendment to the voters of the state at the 2024 general election that will, if approved, expand eligibility for the exemption by allowing a veteran who has individual unemploy ability status, as determined by the U.S. department of veterans affairs, to claim the exemption. In most cases, to have individual unemploy ability status, a veteran must be unable to keep a steady job because the veteran either has at least one service-connected disability rated at 60% or more disabling or has 2 or more service-connected disabilities with at least one disability rated at 40% or more disabling and a combined rating of 70% or more disabling . To conform to the existing public policy of the state that \"people first language\" be used in new or amended legislation that refers to persons with disabilities, the concurrent resolution also chang es the ex isting defined term \" disabled veteran\" to \"veteran with a disability \". 2023 DIGEST 312 CONCURRE NT RESOLUT IONSSUBJECT INDEX SB indicates a Senate Bill HB indicates a House Bill SCR indicates a Senate Concurrent Resolution HCR indicates a House Concurrent Resolution V indicates a bill which was vetoed by the Governor and not overridden by the General Assem bly Bill No. Page No. Adm inistrative Rule Review Continuation of 2022 rules of executive agencies. ...................
