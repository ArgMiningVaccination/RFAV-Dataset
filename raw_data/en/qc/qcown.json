The following strategies can help an individual achieve appropriate intakes of vitamins and minerals: Choosing a variety of foods from all four food groups of Canada's Food Guide every day and eating the recommended number of servings from each food group every day. Choosing meals that include at least three of the four food groups. For adults: Eating three regular meals, and snacks if needed, throughout the day . For children: Providing three regular meals and two to three snacks every day. Provide snacks that include foods from Canada's Food Guide. Considering taking a vitamin or mineral supplement if you are not meeting the recommended number of servings of each food group from Canada's Food Guide. Ask for advice from your physician or health care provider. The fol lowing people need to take vitamin or mineral supplements: o Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or who could become pregnant, need a multivitamin containing folic acid and vitamin B 12 every day. o Pregnant women need to ensure that their multivitamin contains iron. o Refer to the guideline Calcium and Vitamin D for recommendations about vitamin D supplementation Recogniz ing that single -nutrient supplements carry a hi gher risk of adverse reactions. Seek referral to a physician or Registered Dietitian if you are considering taking one. Notifying your physician or Registered Dietitian if you take a multivitamin- mineral, herbal or any other type of nutrition supplement. Asking your physician for a referral to a Registered Dietitian if you have questions about nutrition supplements or are wondering if you need one. Note: For recommendations and discussion about calcium and vitamin D refer to the Guideline: Calcium and Vitamin D Health Benefits Vitamins and m inerals are essential for many biochemical and physiologic functions in our bodies . Vitamins and minerals do not provide calories ; rather, they work with each other and with other essential nutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fats) to start (or \"trigger\") many chemical processes for grow th, maintena nce of well-being, and possibly, prevent ion of disease .1 Appropriate intake of vitamins and minerals : Helps maintain normal metabolic functions ( e.g. energy production, hormone synthesis) .1,2,3 Prevents or repair s damage to cells and tissues .

Vitamins are fat -soluble or water -soluble organic compounds essential for normal biochemical and physiological functions. Vitamins are multi -functional. They may serve as structural components in the body, act as co- enzymes in multipl e metabolic pathways, and/or act as antioxidants .1,2,5 For optimal health, we require the following 5 Water -soluble vitamins: Pantothenic acid Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)* * Of the vitamins, the one s indicated (*) are a common concern throughout life and will be discussed in this guideline. What is a mineral? Minerals are inorganic elements that are essential to body function s such as maint enance of acid-base balance, normal hemoglobin levels and osmotic pressure. Minerals are components of vitamins, hormones, enzymes and many stable complexes in bone and tissu es. 1,2,5 For optimal health, we require the * Of the minerals listed , the ones indicated (*) are of concern throughout the life cycle; these ones will be discussed in this guideline.

These include the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), Adequate Intake (AI), and Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for vitamins and minerals . DRIs are the amounts needed to prevent deficiencies and reduce risk of developmental abnor malities and chronic diseases. Most vitamin and mineral recommended values are reported as a RDA . The RDA is intended to be used as a goal for daily intake by individuals , as this value estimates an intake level that is sufficient to m eet the requirement of 97 to 98% of healthy individual s. However, when there is insufficient scientific evidence to establish a RDA , an Adequate Intake (AI) is provided instead. Adequate Intake is expected to meet or exceed the required amount needed to maintain a defined nutritional state in an apparently healthy population without causing adverse health effects. Nutrition Guideline Vitamins and Minerals Applicable to: Nurses, Physicians and Other Health Professionals For Professional Reference Only January 2013 Page 3.2. 5.7 Nutrition Guideline Vitamins and Minerals The UL is the maximum amount of a nutrient an individual can take that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects for most people. In general, the RDA, AI and UL values for vitamins and minerals changes throughout the life cycle. The following tables list the DRI s (RDA or AI) and UL of the vitamins and minerals in the body : Note: For recommendations and discussion about calcium and vitamin D refer to the Nutrition Guideline: Calcium and Vitamin D Nutrition Guideline Vitamins and Minerals Applicable to: Nurses, Physicians, and Other Health Professionals For Professional Reference Only January 2013 Page 3.2. 5.8 Nutrition Guideline Vitamins and Minerals Dietary Reference Intake Table for Vitamins A, C, E, K, Thiamin, Riboflavin and Niacin19,20,21 Life Stage Group Vit A (\u00b5g/d) DRI UL DRI UL Children 1-3 y 300 600 15 400 6 200 30 ND 0.5 ND 0.5 ND 6 10 4-8 y 400 900 25 650 7 300 55 ND 0.6 ND 0.6 ND 8 15 Males 9-13 y 600 1700 45 1200 11 600 60 ND 0.9 ND 0.9 ND 12 20 14-18 y 900 2800 75 1800 15 800 75 ND 1.2 ND 1.3 ND 16 30 19-50 y 900 3000 90 2000 15 1000 120 ND 1.2 ND 1.3 ND 16 35 >50 y 900 3000 90 2000 15 1000 120 ND 1.2 ND 1.3 ND 16 35 Females 9-13 y 600 1700 45 1200 11 600 60 ND 0.9 ND 0.9 ND 12 20 14-18 y 700 2800 65 1800 15 800 75 ND 1.0 ND 1.0 ND 14 30 19-50 y 700 3000 75 2000 15 1000 90 ND 1.1 ND 1.1 ND 14 35 >50 y 700 3000 75 2000 15 1000 90 ND 1.1 ND 1.1 ND 14 35 Pregnanc y <18 y 750 2800 80 1800 15 800 75 ND 1.4 ND 1.4 ND 18 30 19-50 y 770 3000 85 2000 15 1000 90 ND 1.4 ND 1.4 ND 18 35 Lactatio n <18 y 1200 2800 115 1800 19 800 75 ND 1.4 ND 1.6 ND 17 30 19-50 y 1300 3000 120 2000 19 1000 90 ND 1.4 ND 1.6 ND 17 35 ND = No data available; insufficient scientific evidence available to establish a value.

No, individuals cannot get as many nutrients from supplements as from food. Vitamin and mineral requirements for an individual depend on many factors , including the individual's medical status, age, gender, body size, and activity level . Eating a variety of foods within each of Canada's Food Guide's four food groups will help most people get the nut rients they need from food. Choos e meals that include at least three of the four food groups.24 For adults: Eat three regular meals, and snacks if needed, throughout the day. For children: Provide three regular meals and two to three snacks every day. Provide snacks that include foods from Canada's Food Guide.25,26 Eating a wide variety food from the Food Guide provides many nutrients, phytonutrient s, energy or carbohydrates, protein, essential fats, and fibre that are not available in any mineral or vitamin pill. Phyto nutrients occur naturally in vegetables , fruits , and whole grains . Some function as antioxidants which help maintain health and prevent chronic disease. 27,28 Refer to Guidelines: General Healthy Eating For Children and Adults ; Planning Healthy Meals and Snacks; Vegetable and Fruit Intake When should an individual take a vitamin and/or mineral supplement? Individuals can generally meet their vitamin and mineral needs by following Canada's Food Guide healthy eating guidelines. H owever, there are cases when supplements are needed. Vitamin D There is recent evidence that vitamin D defi ciency exists in some Canadians, partly because of low levels of sun exposure . 29 As well, it is widely agreed that consuming adequate amounts of vitamin D from dietary sources is difficult.29,30 In view of low levels of vitamin D intake from food and probable low levels from sun exposure, Nutrition Services, Alberta Health Services recommends that healthy individuals include food sources of vitamin D in their diet, and supplement their intake. For complete vitamin D recommendations refer to the Calcium and Vitamin D Nutrition G uideline. Othe r nutrients Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or who could become pregnant should take a daily multivitamin supplement containing 400 mcg (0.4 mg) of folic acid , and also contains vitamin B 12.31 Pregnant women should also ensure their daily multivitamin supplement contains 16 to 20 mg of iron.32 The individuals listed below should talk to a physician or Registered Dietitian about whether or not they need to take a vitamin and mineral supplement: Adults over the age of 50 years - should take 400 IU of vitamin D daily;3 however, additional vitamin D and vitamin B 12,33,34 may also be needed. Individuals who avoid whole food groups of Canada's Food Guide.28,29 Nutrition Guideline Vitamins and Minerals Applicable to: Nurses, Physicians and Other Health Professionals For Professional Reference Only January 2013 Page 3.2. 5.11 Nutrition Guideline Vitamins and Minerals Vegetarians who do not eat any animal foods.29 Smokers .29 Individuals who drink alcohol in high amounts Individuals with a medical concern that increases their nutrient needs or decreases their nutrient intake. 28,29 Individuals should check with their health care provider before taking any vitamin or mineral supplements, especially when combining them with medic ations , or substituting them for foods. For specific dietary advice, consult a Registered Dietitian. Refer to Guidelines : Calcium and Vitamin D ; Iron; Vegetarian Eating; Seniors Health Overview ; Pregnancy ; General Healthy Eating for Children and Adults Are there any potential risks associated with taking vitamin and mineral supplements? Although supplementation of certain vitamins and minerals might be helpful for some individuals , there are circumstances when these pi lls may pose risks. Taking a combination of vitamin and mineral supplements, using these products together with medicine, or substituting them in place of prescribed medicines could lead to harmful, even life- threatening results. Furthermore, individuals taking vitamin and/or mineral supplement s may unknowingly exceed the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) recommendations, leading to toxicity and associated harmful effects. 6,28 Calcium There have been questions about a possible link between calcium supplements and an increased risk of heart disease for adults ( 19 years). Data from some clinical trials suggest that calcium supplementation (1000mg/day) may modestly increase the risk of cardiovascular events .5,35,36,37, 38,39 There does not seem to be a risk or concern with calcium from food sources.38 Health risks are associated with intakes either below or above the RDA.36,37 Adults should aim for a total calcium intake from food sources that meets the RDA for their age and gender (see the Recommendations section above). T hose people unable to meet their calcium requirements with dietary sources should discuss supplement use with thei r health care provider. Tips to follow when considering taking a vitamin and/or mineral or multivitamin/mineral supplement: Individuals should check with their health care provider before taking any vitamin or mineral supplements, especially when combi ning with medicine, or substituting them for foods. Individuals should recognize that single- nutrient supplements carry a higher risk of adverse reactions and seek referral to a physician or Registered Dietitian if considering taking one. Individuals should work with their qualified health professional (physician, dietitian or pharmacist) to make certain the vitamin and/or mineral supplement does not exceed the UL and cause health problems. Individuals need to always let their physician and other healt h professionals know about the vitamins, minerals, botanicals, and other products they are taking, especially before surgery or other medical treatments , or if they have other medical conditions . Nutrition Guideline Vitamins and Minerals Applicable to: Nurses, Physicians and Other Health Professionals For Professional Reference Only January 2013 Page 3.2. 5.12 Nutrition Guideline Vitamins and Minerals Vitamin and mineral supplements can be especially harmful for children and should be kept out of their reach at all times. Vitamin and mineral supplements are not intended to treat, diagnose, alleviate, prevent, or cure disease. Vitamin and mineral supplements cannot replace the variety of foods important to a heal thful diet. Individuals should not self -diagnose any health condition; they need to work with their health care providers to determine how best to achieve optimal health. What should an individual look for in a vitamin and mineral supplement? If an indi vidual, in consultation with their healthcare provider, has decided to take a single or multivitamin and/or mineral supplement, they should follow the tips below for buying and taking supplements: Make sure that the vitamin and mineral pill has a Drug Identification Number (DIN) or Natural Product Number (NPN),40 or Homeopathic Medicine Number ( DIN-HM).41 This means that Health Canada has approved the product. Ask a pharmacist which multivitamin or vitamin and miner al pills are good choices. Store brands or generic pills are fine to use.30 Check the expiry date on the bottle. Don't take pills that are past the expiry date. Read labels to make sure you aren't allergic to any of the ingredients. Ask the pharmacist when not sure. Take only th e dose stated on the label. More is not better.30 Are there any handouts on vitamins and minerals that I can use with my client s? Refer to approved provincial Alberta Health Services bariatric nutrition handouts to support patient education.
