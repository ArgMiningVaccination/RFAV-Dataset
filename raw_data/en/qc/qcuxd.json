The focus of the DTFP was on enhancing the systems of services for people with substance use problems in Canada, emphasizing three broad target areas for investment: implementation of evidence based practices; strengthening evaluation and performance measurement; and knowledge exchange. Each province and territory was invited to submit proposals for system enhancement. The Ontario submission included the present project, the objectives being to assess the acceptability and utility of a new common package of screening and assessment tools and procedures for addictions treatment services in Ontario. The selection and pilot testing of these various screening and assessment tools was to culminate in a set of recommendations going forward to refresh or replace the current set of tools known as Admission and Discharge Criteria and Assessment Tools (ADAT). The project built upon other work undertaken for the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MoHLTC) in the past few years on screening and assessment tools and processes in Ontario. This included an evaluation of the ADAT tools and related processes by Rush and Martin (2006). This evaluation called for a refresh or, if needed, a full replacement of the ADAT tools based on the feedback received. The screening and assessment procedure implemented in this study is based on the framework for the stages of client engagement across screening, assessment and recovery monitoring developed by Rush and Castel (2011). In this framework, the process of screening and assessment is divided into the following stages: Stage 1 and Stage 2 Screening, and Stage 1 and Stage 2 Assessment. The staged approach works to ensure a progressive and efficient use of screening and assessment resources to guide treatment planning and eventually, recovery monitoring. In the current project, the scope of the implemented procedure included the two stages of screening and the first stage of assessment in the framework. Stage 2 Assessment was not implemented in the project because this more complex and longer duration 12 assessment process was seen as more agencydependent and not feasible or appropriate to standardize across the treatment system. In addition, the twostage screening process focused on screening for mental health challenges in light of the present decade of research and development related to cooccurring disorders among clients with substance use problems. A broad range of stakeholders were engaged in the project via a Program Advisory Committee and Working Group. Partners included the MoHLTC, specialized mental health and substance use agencies (directors, managers, clinicians and researchers), Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs), and consumer representatives. These stakeholders informed all stages of the decisionmaking related to the selection of the tools and pilot sites, procedures for implementation, results interpretation, and wider dissemination of project findings and the final recommendations. Tools and Study Processes The selection of the staged approach screening and assessment tools involved several steps, the first being a comprehensive literature review that evaluated screening and assessment tools used in mental health and/or addiction settings. The project team also conducted an environmental scan in Ontario to obtain a provincewide perspective on the current practices and tools used for standardized screening and assessment in publiclyfunded addiction agencies. As a result of this literature review and environmental scan, a list of potential screening and assessment tools, and the criteria for selecting the tools for pilot testing, were summarized and presented to the Advisory Committee and Working Group for a final decision. The screening tools endorsed by the Advisory Committee and Working Group for this project included one stage1 screening tool and three stage2 screening tools for mental disorders. The stage1 screening tool for the project was the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Short Screener (GAIN Q3 - SS) - CAMHmodified. This brief screening tool is a modified version from the original GAINSS developed by Chestnut Health Systems. The tool is used to quickly and accurately identify clients that require a more thorough assessment on 13 potential problem areas. There were two options for stage2 mental health screening tools for adults (age of 18 yrs+) in the project: the Modified Mini Screener (MMS) and the Psychiatric diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ); and one option for adolescents (age of 12 - 17 yrs): the Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT). The assessment tool selected for pilot testing in this project was the GAINQuick 3 Motivational Interviewing (GAINQ3 MI). This is a multipurpose, targeted assessment tool used to identify and address a wide range of life problems among both adolescents (age of 12 - 17 yrs) and adults (age of 18 yrs+) in diverse treatment settings and designed to facilitate client placement in the appropriate level of care. In the case of individuals whose results indicate mild problems, the MI component of the tool provides methods to conduct a brief intervention based on the principles of motivational interviewing. This tool is valid and reliable and is also designed to work as a baseline assessment for its sister tool, the GAINQ3 Standard, for detecting change in the many life areas assessed in recovery monitoring. Following the selection of GAINQ3MI, an Ontario version of the instrument, and accompanying electronic platform (GAIN ABS), was developed in collaboration with the Drug and Alcohol Treatment Information Systems (DATIS) and the instrument developer, Chestnut Health Systems. The GAIN Assessment Building System (ABS) is now fully integrated with Catalyst. Five publiclyfunded Ontariobased addiction agencies of various geographic locations, sizes and service types participated in this project and piloted the use of tools and process of staged approach to screening and assessment. Agency staff and clinicians were involved in data collection after obtaining appropriate training related to the administration of the study tools and the data collection procedures. Clients seeking help for their substance use problems from the five participating agencies across Ontario were approached for participation in the project. Following consent and completion of the existing mandatory assessment package by the MoHLTC, the recruited clients underwent the staged process of screening and assessment. Specifically, this process involved 14 beginning with the brief GAINSS and followed by one of three more comprehensive screening tools (PDSQ, MMS or the POSIT) if screened positive on the GAINSS for internalizing mental health disorders, and then followed by the GAINQ3 MI which was intended for treatment placement matching. The feasibility of the tools and process for the staged approach to screening and assessment was evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The project conducted statistical analyses on a list of technical indicators. Multiple types of feedback were received from agency representatives using the various tools including log books during implementation, an online survey and focus group discussions. Clients' feedback was reported indirectly through clinicians. Results and Feedback Data collection occurred between June 2012 and March 2013. In total, 234 clients were enrolled into the Best Practice Screening and Assessment Project. The focus of the analyses was on a combined sample of two pilot sites that made up about 90% of our total study sample. Of the 200 clients included in the analyses, 187 completed a GAINSS. About 90% of those completing a GAINSS screened positive for internalizing mental disorder based on a cutoff score of 2 and went on to complete stage2 screening. The GAINSS took 8 minutes on average (slightly longer than reported by the test developers) but this improves with experience. The follow up PDSQ took on average about 18 minutes (about the same as advertised) and was seen as comprehensive, easy to score and useful. The Modified Mini Screener took much less time (about 6 minutes on average), and was also positively viewed in terms of supporting mental health followup and referrals. The main limitation reported for the MMS was in the wording (many conditions lumped together) and the skip patterns that were said to be confusing for some clients. We did receive not much feedback on the use of the POSIT with younger clients other than an overriding concern, that with youth in particular, the use of structured screening tools can negatively impact building rapport with those presenting for help. 15 Among the 200 clients in the sample, 148 completed the GAIN Q3 MI. The average time of administration time for the assessment tool was 60 minutes, although the project team considers that this was significantly influenced by the newness of the tool, as well as challenges with the ABS computer system. That said, it is not unreasonable to expect an assessment process for the purpose of \"placement matching\" to be in this range of completion time and, with larger scale implementation and appropriate training and technical supports, completion times for the GAINQ3 MI would be expected in the 45 minute range, on average. Overall, the feedback on the tool emphasized the comprehensiveness and high quality of the information, the value of the many reports being generated and the close relationship of the information and reports to individualized treatment planning. It is particularly noteworthy that the two sites with the most clients recruited for the project, and therefore the most experienced with the GAINQ3, have chosen to continue the use of the staged protocol and the Q3. The reasons cited included the high quality of the information and its perceived value in advocating for funding and for services for clients, in particular mental health services for clients with cooccurring disorders. The overall feedback about the staged approach to screening and assessment was very positive. It showed that the staged approach was seen as an efficient way to proceed through a screening process (i.e. longer tools held in reserve until needed) and provided good coverage of both substance use and mental health issues. In particular, the strength of the information on mental health was highly valued and improved referrals to required services. The staged approach was also seen as well linked conceptually to both treatment planning and subsequent recovery monitoring. Challenges noted with the overall staged approach were the perceived redundancy in some of the tools (e.g., the GAIN SS and the GAINQ3 MI which also includes the screening items) and the need for a well established response protocol to be in place so as to facilitate concrete referrals and followup. 16 Limitations There are, however, a few limitations of the project to consider along with the results and recommendations. Importantly, the tools were not administered under \"routine\" conditions because of other procedures related to the parallel outcome (e.g. provision of detailed locator information for followup purpose) project and other required procedures, such as the parallel administration of the ADAT tools. Also, selfselection of clients into the study resulted in a sample that is somewhat older, more stable and less severe than the total population of the pilot agencies or the community treatment population in the province. The project also lacked a residential treatment service or residential withdrawal management service among the pilot agencies and included only one youth service with a strong outreach component. Lastly, because staff of many of the pilot agencies are wellinformed and experienced users of ADAT and the use of evidence based practices, our study results may not be representative of that to be obtained in wider piloting and implementation efforts. Recommendations and Next Steps In conclusion, the project team with the endorsement of the Program Advisory Committee and Working Group strongly recommend the piloted staged approach to screening and assessment as a replacement for the ADAT tools. There is also a keen interest among stakeholders in the addiction sector (and beyond) to replace the ADAT with the Ontario GAIN Q3MI instrument. Our specific recommendation is for the development of a provincial Implementation plan capitalizing on resources available in the budget of the 201314 renewed Ontario DTFP projects. To date, discussions and planning regarding provincial rollout of the GAINQ3 within the Ontario addiction system, as well as how the GAINQ3 MI may integrate with other provincial initiatives, such as the Integrated Assessment Record (IAR), the Ontario Common Assessment of Need (OCAN), have been in the context of the Program Advisory Committee discussions. It is proposed that a formal implementation committee be established, and implementation experts include representatives from the MoHLTC, LHINs, relevant provincial initiatives, and addiction agencies. This will ensure that planning is comprehensive, inclusive and integrated. 17 Other next steps for the project in 201314 include incorporation of the Substance Use (SU) Grids for the GAINQ3 MI assessment, and availabilities of additional clinical reports in ABS. The French translation work of the GAINQ3 MI Ontario version is also in process. The project team is also evaluating the use of technology for selfadministration of the screening and assessment tools. A consultation process with First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit stakeholders to explore the potential for cultural adaptation of screening, assessment and outcomeoriented tools, has also been initiated by the project team. Additional analyses and publication of the screening and assessment data collected in the pilot are also underway. To conclude, it is valuable to note the implications of NOT acting on the results of the pilot work reported on here, and in parallel with the recovery monitoring project. These implications include: the continued lack of uptodate, evidence based screening and assessment tools in the province which then results in poor decisionmaking for client placement and, therefore, inappropriate and inefficient use of our current resources that depend on proper client placement. together with the lack of outcome data, there will remain a lack of information by which to create an Ontariobased business case for investment in our addiction services. a significant missed opportunity to use Federal DTFP funding for moving forward with a stakeholder informed implementation plan in this fiscal year. Clearly there are significant implications of not moving this work forward past the pilot stage and into implementation planning. 18 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Client assessment is a commonly accepted function within addiction treatment systems, the essential purpose being to identify client strengths and needs and, in consultation with the client (and often with significant others) develop an individualized treatment and support plan (Miller, 2006). Despite the critical importance of client screening and assessment in the addiction field, treatment systems have some distance to go in identifying and adopting efficient screening and assessment measures and processes. Hilton (2011) recently reviewed the many measurement challenges in the area of addiction service delivery. He eloquently summarized both the current inefficiencies intake, screening and assessment processes at the program level, including the unnecessary burden being placed on clients, and pointed to evidence that this burden contributes to premature drop out from treatment and, in turn, poor treatment outcome. Thus, research and development related to client assessment in addiction services is direly needed. At a system level, the assessment function may be centralized whereby clients go through a central intake and assessment process through which they are referred or \"matched\" to the level of care that fits their needs and strengths profile (Institute of Medicine, 1990; Schippers, Schramade, & Walburg, 2002). This phase of assessment can be termed \"placement matching\" (Gastfriend et al., 2000) This centralized assessment and referral model was widely implemented in the late 1970's to early 1980's in Ontario through specialized centres intended to serve as the hub of the local treatment network (Ogborne, Rush, & Dwyer, 1985). However, these assessment and referral services eventually evolved into a provincial network of community treatment programs offering nonresidential addiction services in conjunction with comprehensive assessment. This evolution was due in large part to the limited supply of such treatment options in the province to which clients could be referred. Although the assessment centres evolved into community treatment agencies, they did have a lasting impact on how client assessment would eventually be implemented in the Ontario treatment system. Many 19 continue to play a critical and central role in the assessment and referral of people with substance use problems in their jurisdiction. In Ontario, the concept of centralized assessment was replaced with a set of common assessment instruments and client placement protocols that all specialized addiction programs funded by the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MoHLTC) were expected to use. Thus, rather than centralize the assessment function at a common point of intake, assessment was distributed across the system with a common set of tools. The common assessment package was known as the Admission and Discharge Criteria and Assessment Tools (ADAT) (Cross & SibleyBowers, 2002). One important consideration at the time was to select tools that would provide a baseline against which future outcomes could be determined, for example, having at least some of the assessment measures to be sensitive to change over time with repeat administration at followup intervals. The central idea, however, was to provide a more comprehensive and accessible treatment \"system\" whereby presenting clients would be engaged in similar assessment and treatment matching processes regardless of where they entered the treatment network, and be directed to the service(s) best suited to their profile of strengths and needs. This was deemed to be preferable to assuming that the program or service through which they entered the network was best suited to meet their treatment needs. The client's detailed assessment and treatment planning was expected to occur at the destination program or service following this initial assessment. This second phase of assessment for treatment planning has since been termed \"modality matching\" (Gastfriend et al., 2000). The provincial project to select and implement the common assessment tools and related processes was led by the former Addiction Research Foundation, one of the founding organizations for the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). There was also strong support from a working group comprised of representatives of the Ontario addiction treatment system and the MoHLTC. Ontario's youth addiction services subsequently adapted the tools and client placement protocol for youth who are accessing their services. Significant training efforts 20 were mounted to support the dissemination and use of the tools and the crosswalk to the client decisionmaking process (e.g. the ADAT decision tree). These training efforts continue today, organized through CAMH, and using experienced trainers who were involved in the early development of the provincial ADAT project. There are currently webbased and facetoface training opportunities, and to date approximately 1500 clinicians and therapists have been trained on the ADAT tools. Due to demand for using the assessment tools and processes outside the addiction specific agencies for which they were originally intended, training has been given to probation and parole officers, managers and staff of Ontario Works programs across Ontario, as well as to several managers and staff of First Nations addiction programs and other professionals. In 2006, the MoHLTC commissioned an evaluation of the ADAT tools and related processes (Rush & Martin, 2006). The results of the evaluation pointed to several positive features of the provincial implementation and application of the assessment tools as well as to significant areas for improvement. Findings highlighted the considerable variability in the tools actually offered to clients and the overall length of time for completing an assessment in conjunction with other assessment instruments. This variability seemed to stem from fundamentally different views of the nature and purpose of client \"assessment\" itself, namely whether assessment was to provide enough information to adequately refer the person into the proper level of care for more detailed information gathering and treatment planning (i.e., placement matching) or whether the initial assessment with the tools (and other measures) was itself intended to yield that very detailed treatment plan (i.e., modality matching). The evaluation also showed that the ADAT assessment tools were frequently completed after the referral decision had already been made, in particular to residential treatment since the completion of the ADAT tools was a requirement. This in effect became a way of fast tracking the client into residential treatment in many parts of the province. Evaluation results showed that for many of Ontario's addiction programs the completion of the common assessment tools had become a pro forma exercise, rather than a rational, evidence informed basis for referral 21 decisions and treatment planning. A major recommendation emanating from the evaluation report was for a thorough review of the assessment tools and discharge criteria. Another important contextual factor in developing the present project was the considerable research and development over the past decade in the area of cooccurring mental and substance use disorders, and in particular work related to the more effective and earlier identification of individuals with cooccurring disorders in mental health, addictions and other types of settings. The seminal Canadian report on concurrent disorders (Health Canada, 2001), a more recent update (Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, 2009), and other international reviews, have advocated for universal screening of mental disorders in addiction services and for substance use disorders in mental health services. As a response to this, system planners and managers of addiction programs in Ontario have been very active in selecting and implementing screening tools into their treatment systems and services (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 2008). The GAINShort Screener (GAINSS) (Dennis, Chan, & Funk, 2006; Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Coordinating Centre [GAINCC], 2013), in particular, has been well received and widely implemented in Ontario due to its utility in mental health as well as addiction and other settings, its brevity, low cost, utility as an outcome measure, and the supporting validation data that extends to age 12.1 Ontario researchers also undertook validation studies of various screening tools in Ontario addiction treatment settings with positive results obtained for the GAINSS (Rush, Castel, Brands, Toneatto, & Veldhuizen, 2013). A major research synthesis was also undertaken of screening tools for children and adolescents and the GAINSS emerged as one of the bestsupported options for this younger population (Rush, Castel, Somers, Duncan & Brown, 2009). In sum, the work on screening for concurrent disorders has evolved to the point where a review of Ontario's assessment tools and processes must include screening within its scope. An integrated view of screening, assessment and recovery monitoring is articulated by Rush and Castel (2011) and is represented in Figure 1 1 The original validation data of the GAINSS extended to the lower age limit of 10. However, experience in the National DTFP project led by Gloria Chaim and Joanna Henderson that involved a network of youth serving agencies suggested that tool is better suited for youth 12 years of age and up. 22 below. Details on the client recovery monitoring project are provided in a separate but related report (Rush et al., 2013b). In this framework, the process of screening and assessment is divided into the following stages: Stage 1 and Stage 2 Screening, and Stage 1 and Stage 2 Assessment (Rush & Castel, 2011). The staged approach works to ensure a progressive and efficient use of screening and assessment resources to guide treatment planning and eventually, recovery monitoring. The main benefit of using a stepped approach in screening is through sequential case finding, as both clinician and client time can be saved by reserving the more resourceintensive screening and assessment tools for those who score above the cutoff on briefer, more economical screening tools. Recovery monitoring is also greatly facilitated by choosing both screening and assessment tools that can reliably and validly assess change over time. The flow and linkage across the stages of client engagement is the framework on which this project was based. The definitions of screening and assessment, including the distinct stages, are provided below. Figure 1. Framework for the Stages of Client Engagement across Screening, Assessment and Recovery Monitoring 1 adapted from Rush and Castel (2011) 1.1 DEFINITIONS Screening is the use of evidence based procedures and tools to identify individuals with problems, or those who are at risk for developing problems. It is intended to be an efficient way of raising a \"red flag\" about the possibility of a particular disorder or problem area and thereby setting the stage for a subsequent, more detailed assessment with a definite view to service planning and delivery (Rush & Castel, 2011). Screening is conceptualized as involving two distinct stages: 23 24 Stage 1 Screening is based on Case Finding: clients are screened to determine the possibility of the person having any disorder/problem or broad group of disorders/problem areas. Stage 2 Screening is based on more comprehensive screening for Case Definition: more specific and typically longer tools are used to tentatively identify one or more specific disorders or problem areas. Assessment involves a more extensive and individualized identification of mental health and substance use strengths and needs of people whose screening results warrant future investigation (Rush & Castel, 2011) Assessment is also conceptualized as involving two stages: Stage 1 Assessment involves the process of information gathering and placement (i.e., placement matching ): information is gathered for the purpose of understanding. Clients are administered a tool that captures information required for brief intervention or more targeted referral for more detailed assessment and treatment planning. Stage 2 Assessment involves diagnosis and treatment planning (i.e., modality matching ): the purpose is to classify and implement evidencebased treatment and support protocols specific to particular disorders or problem areas. Clients are administered tools that identify and describe common problem areas and strengths, and how they are interrelated. Information collected needs to be adequate for diagnosis and treatment planning and additional referral. 1.2 THE DRUG TREATMENT FUNDING PROGRAM (DTFP) In 2007, the Canadian federal government introduced the National AntiDrug Strategy to focus efforts on reducing the demand for, and supply of, illicit drugs; as well as to address the crime associated with illegal drugs. The National AntiDrug Strategy emphasized the need for effective treatment services to better manage the illicit drug problem when it occurs, and to help those in need. The need to make improvements at the level of the treatment system 25 emerged as a priority for action based on countrywide consultations and national level studies on treatment needs and gaps carried out in support of the development of the National Anti Drug Strategy. These studies demonstrated the need for systemic change to move treatment systems toward more evidenceinformed practices, while also increasing systems' capacity to evaluate practices for their efficiency and effectiveness (Health Canada, 2008). In response to these findings, the Drug Treatment Funding Program (DTFP)2 was announced in 2008, providing new, fiveyear, timelimited funding (20082013)3 to assist provincial and territorial governments in addressing critical treatment needs in three investment areas (Health Canada, 2008): 1) Implementation of evidence informed practice Although evidence informed practices are to optimize treatment exist, and are continually being developed, many do not easily find their way into service delivery. Evidence informed practice is based on interventions that effectively integrate the best research evidence with clinical expertise, cultural competence and the values of the persons receiving the services. These interventions have evidence showing improved outcomes for families, clients, and/or communities. 2) Strengthening evaluation and performance measurement - Performance measurement and evaluation activities across jurisdictions are limited. While all jurisdictions collect, manage and analyze performance information pertaining to their treatment services and programs, the type and nature of data collected, as well as the approach to data collection and analysis varies considerably. This strategic investment area strengthens evaluation and performance measurement capacity and activities. 3) Knowledge exchange This investment area is an essential element of work undertaken in investment areas #1 and #2. Knowledge exchange activities can include such things as 2 Reoriented funding from Health Canada's Alcohol and Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation Program, effective April 2008 3 Timelines varied across provinces and territories depending on the release of funds; Ontario's projects received funding for 19 months of work (April 2011 - March, 2013). 26 mentoring and the provision of technical expertise; mechanisms that develop and/or enhance knowledge sharing and dissemination of lessons learned from communities of practice in the uptake of best practices and in performance measurement/evaluation; and activities that can effectively reach health professionals within organizations and service sectors to increase their awareness and participation in knowledge exchange activities across the continuum of treatment services. Each province and territory was invited to submit proposals for system enhancement. The Ontario submission included the work that is the focus of this report, namely a review of Ontario's screening and assessment tools and processes within addiction treatment services, falling under the first DTFP investment area (implementation of evidenceinformed practice). Another related project that is the subject of a separate report is the development and pilot testing of a provincial recovery monitoring system. It is important to highlight the significant delay that occurred between the broader Ontario proposal development and actual funding. Funding was eventually approved in April of 2011 and the DTFP national funding ended in March 2013; thus Ontario effectively lost over two years of project time. This has had significant implications for both the screening and assessment tools project and the recovery monitoring project. Specifically, for the review of screening and assessment tools, the original proposal called for the provincial implementation of a new suite of tools and processes but due to time restrictions, the implementation phase had to be removed from the project work plan. The project, therefore, focused on the review and selection of a new set of tools and the pilot testing of these tools and processes in a small number (five) of addiction agencies. The recovery monitoring project was pilot tested in the same five addiction agencies, since the system that is envisaged in the future is an integrated screening, assessment, withintreatment and follow up recovery monitoring system, grounded in the conceptual framework articulated in Figure 1. 1.3 PROJECT OBJECTIVES It is important to understand that the project engaging these five pilot sites was not about the evaluation of the treatments that they offered, but rather the evaluation of the new 27 screening and assessment tools and related client placement processes. These goals are reflected in the following objective statements: 1. To assess the acceptability and utility of a new, common package of screening and assessment tools and procedures for addictions treatment services in Ontario. 2. To recommend new screening and assessment tools and processes going forward. 28 2.0 METHODS 2.1 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN This feasibility study was conducted from June 2012 to March 2013 and involved the piloting of evidenceinformed tools and processes appropriate for screening and assessment in Ontario's addictions treatment services. Ethics approval was obtained from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and OttawaCarleton Research Advisory Committee. The screening and assessment procedure implemented in this study is based on the framework for the stages of client engagement across screening, assessment and recovery monitoring developed by Rush and Castel (2011) and shown in Figure 1. Specifically, the scope of the implemented procedure included the two stages of screening and the first stage of assessment in the framework. Stage 2 Assessment was not implemented in the study because this more complex and longer duration assessment process was seen as more agency dependent and not feasible or appropriate to standardize across the treatment system Clients seeking help for their substance use problems4 from five addiction treatment agencies across Ontario were approached for participation in the project. Following consent and completion of the existing mandatory assessment package by the MoHLTC, the recruited clients underwent the staged process of screening and assessment and including the baseline assessment tool: Global Appraisal of Individual Needs - Quick 3 Motivational Interviewing (GAINQ3 MI). 2.2 STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS A broad range of stakeholders were engaged in the planning stages via an overall Program Advisory Committee and a Working Group specific to this project (see Appendix 1 for the Terms of Reference). Collaborators included relevant CAMH clinical programs, Addictions 4 People seeking help specifically for gamblingrelated problems or process addictions such as video gaming or sex addiction were not included. 29 and Mental Health Ontario5, the MoHLTC, Local Health Integration Networks (LHIN), specialized mental health and addiction agencies (directors, managers, clinicians, researchers), and a consumer representative. Stakeholders informed key decisions regarding the selection of tools, pilot sites and procedures for implementation. Members continued to be involved in the implementation stage, some by participating as pilot sites and others through an advisory function. In the later stages, this group of stakeholders also informed analysis/interpretation of the evaluation feedback and offered many suggestions for next steps for both continued testing and provincial implementation. The group also reviewed and approved all recommendations emanating from this and other related DTFP projects (recovery monitoring; client perception of care; and costing of substance use services). 2.3 ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN In September 2011, all publiclyfunded addiction treatment agencies in Ontario, identified by contact information provided by ConnexOntario, were approached to participate in an online survey. The goal was to obtain a provincewide perspective on the current practices and tools used for screening and assessment. Of the 190 contacted agencies, 53 agencies responded, from which 14 of these agencies had multiple programs that respond to the survey. In total, 82 different programs from the 53 agencies completed the survey. Of the 82 programs, 97% reported administering a screening tool and 65% reported using more than one tool. Although the response rate was somewhat low the Program Advisory Committee endorsed the findings as likely to be representative of the situation across the Ontario treatment system. The most commonly used screening tools included the GAINSS, some components of the ADAT package such as the Behavioural and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS32); and others (e.g., Ontario Common Assessment of Need (OCAN), most of the tools being clinicianadministered. Staff reported mainly positive experiences using screening tools; for example, they indicated that the existing tools were helpful in building stronger rapport with clients and identifying clients' needs. Some limitations were also noted, particularly in terms of problems with literacy, 5 Addictions Ontario and Ontario Federation of Community Mental Health and Addiction Programs merged into a new organization as of 2012, now called Addictions and Mental Health Ontario. 30 comprehension issues for younger clients, lack of cultural sensitivity, and repetitiveness of the tools. Of all programs surveyed, 91% reported administering assessment tools to clients. The main tools used included ADAT (vast majority), GAINSS, OCAN and homegrown instruments. Similar to the screening tools, most of the assessment tools were clinicianadministered, and on average, an assessment was said to take about 70 minutes to complete. Many positive comments were offered about ADAT including the fact that the tools were helpful in enriching conversations between clients and clinicians, and provided some useful information treatment planning and referral. Limitations were similar to those cited for screening tools. The most important finding was that the majority of participants were generally confused regarding the definitions of screening and assessment, thus echoing the results of the earlier evaluation of ADAT (Rush & martin, 2006). For example, GAINSS, ADAT and OCAN were identified by participants as both screening and assessment tools. The results, therefore, highlighted the need for systemwide promotion of screening and assessment as distinct processes, with staged components. This finding was essential in guiding our decisionmaking process around tool selection and pilot implementation. 2.4 SELECTION OF TOOLS 2.4.1 Site Visit to Chestnut Health Systems - GAIN Coordinating Centre While waiting for project funding, members of the research team and various stakeholders visited Chestnut Health Systems in Illinois to obtain information and updates on the development of the GAIN screening and assessment tools, as well as to attain firsthand knowledge of how training on GAIN administration is conducted. The team was impressed with the progressive suite of tools (GAIN family of instruments) developed by Chestnut Health Systems that not only supports a number of treatment practices from initial screening to treatment planning (e.g., GAINSS, GAINQ3 and GAINI) but is also suitable for use with both adolescents and adults from varied populations and in different levels of care. The information 31 obtained by the visiting team was subsequently conveyed to the Advisory Committee group members. 2.4.2 Literature Review and Tool Selection Criteria As a first step, existing research regarding screening and assessment tools was reviewed. This review included: 1. The evaluation of the ADAT tools and related processes (Rush & Martin, 2006). 2. Validation studies of various screening and assessment tools in Ontario addiction treatment settings (Rush et al., 2013a) and elsewhere. 3. A major research synthesis of screening tools for children and adolescents (Rush et al., 2009). These reviews provided a shortlist of evidence based/informed tools available. The shortlist was supplemented by additional tools identified through a search of relevant research databases (e.g., PubMed, Medline). A table was then developed which included key aspects of interest related to the review (e.g., instrument psychometric properties of the instruments, populations with which the tools were validated, administration time, cost, etc.). The research literature was then examined again to populate the relevant details for each identified screening/assessment tool. The results of the review were examined by the Working Group to identify any gaps, for example, tools not included, review criteria, etc. (see Appendix 2 for final summary table). In the end, a shortlist of tools was presented to the Working Group for final selection based on the relative weight of each of the selection criteria. The tool selection criteria were developed based on the findings of the environmental scan, a preliminary review of the literature, and the expertise of our Working Group. The selected tools were expected to meet the following criteria: Link to treatment planning (i.e, placement matching but not modality matching) Low demands on time for administration Low or no cost Sensitive to change over time 32 Good psychometric properties Population, i.e., valid for a wide age range and for different gender/ethnic groups Flexible modes of administration Easy to build into treatment process and agency \"flow\" Minimal training requirements Availability in multiple languages 2.5 MEASURES 2.5.1 Selected Tools for the Staged Approach to Screening and Assessment Stage 1 Screener: Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Short Screener (GAINSS) - CAMH modified The GAINSS is a brief, 35 minute screening tool comprised of 20 items divided into four subscales. This tool can either be clinician or selfadministered, completed via paper and pencil or electronically, and is used to quickly and accurately identify clients that require a more thorough assessment. The instrument is comprised of 5 items on internalizing disorders; 5 items on externalizing disorders; 5 items on substance use problems; and 5 items on crime/violence problems. A modified version of the GAINSS that includes 7 additional items was administered in this study. This modified version was developed by CAMH (with permission from Chestnut Health Systems) and is widely used across Ontario. It is endorsed by, and available on, the Chestnut Health Systems' website (www.chestnut.org ). The 7 supplementary items cover eating disorders (2), traumatic experiences (1), psychotic symptoms (2) and problem gambling (2) (Cormier, 2011). Note that the 7 CAMH added items have not been validated as an index. . All items are scored using an ordinal scale of the last occurrence of the events/symptoms. The GAINSS (CAMHmodified) is available in French (validated), is low cost ($100 site license per agency for five years of unlimited use of paper assessments of GAIN family of instruments. and appropriate for use in a wide age range 33 (12 years and older), and has been shown to have excellent psychometric properties (Dennis et al., 2008). The GAINSS (CAMHmodified) tool is included in Appendix 3.6 Stage 2 Screener: Modified Mini Screener (MMS) The MMS is a 22item tool that covers 11 disorders in three areas. It is clinician administered and takes approximately 15 minutes to complete, and less than 5 minutes to score. The MMS has been validated for use in different ethnic groups and in a variety of settings, including corrections, shelters, outreach programs and substance use treatment services. The MMS uses a dichotomous yes/no scale and the time period for reporting ranges from lifetime to the past two weeks. The three areas covered by the MMS include anxiety/mood disorders, trauma/PTSD, and nonaffective psychoses. The scoring of the MMS is additive, where every 'yes' answer receives a score of 1. The MMS is available for use at no cost, has been validated for a number of populations and in different settings, and is appropriate for clients 18 years and older. The instrument has good sensitivity (63% - 82%), specificity (61% 83%) and overall 75%) Haugland, Lin, Bertollo, & McCorry, 2008). Stage 2 Screener: Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ) The PDSQ is a 126item tool that covers 13 of the most common DSM IV disorders. The tool generally takes 1520 minutes to complete, is selfadministered or clinicianadministered via paper and pencil, and is appropriate for use in adults ages 18 and up (Zimmerman & Chelminski, 2006). A payperuse cost is associated with the PDSQ approximately $2 per client when the cost of the instrument, manual, scoring sheets, etc. are all factored in). The instrument uses a dichotomous yes/no scale, and the time period for reporting varies by item set, with time ranges from the past two weeks to six months. The disorders covered by the PDSQ include: mood (major depressive disorder); anxiety (posttraumatic stress disorder); psychosis; disorders; eating disorders; and somatization disorders. The PDSQ has undergone extensive psychometric testing including 6 Chestnut Health Systems is expected to release a new version of the GAINSS in 2013, which includes three additional items, one of which is a CAMH supplementary item. 34 assessments of reliability and validity (Zimmerman and Chelminski, 2006; Zimmerman and Mattia , 2001), as well as validation in a large Ontario substance abuse treatment sample (Rush et al., 2013a). Stage 2 Screener: Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT) The POSIT is a 139item tool and used for younger participants in the study (aged 12 to 17). The POSIT is a valid and reliable instrument designed to identify potential problem areas that require further indepth assessment (McLaney , Boca & Babor , 1994). Specifically, it was developed to identify problems and potential treatment or service needs in 10 areas including substance abuse, mental and physical health, and social relations. It is validated for adolescents 12 through 19 years of age with 5th grade reading level and widely used in the United States. The POSIT takes approximately 2030 minutes to administer and 25 minutes to score. The tool can be administered by paper, computer, or audiotape. There is no cost for the use of the tool. Stage 1 Assessment: Global Appraisal of Individual NeedsQuick 3 (GAINQ3) - Motivational Interviewing (MI) The GAINQ3 is a multipurpose, targeted assessment tool used to identify and address a wide range of life problems among both adolescents (age of 12 - 17 yrs) and adults (age of 18 yrs+) in diverse settings (GAIN Coordinating Center, 2013). The overall aim of the GAINQ3 is to fairly quickly sort individuals into three groups: a) those who do not appear to have problems in need of attention, b) those who appear to have mild problems that can be addressed in a brief intervention, and c) those whose results indicate the need for a more detailed assessment and/or specialized treatment. Thus, it is designed specifically for placement matching. In the case of individuals whose results indicate mild problems, the GAINQ3 provides methods to conduct a brief intervention based on the principles of motivational interviewing. Domains covered in the GAINQ3 include school problems, work problems, physical health, sources of stress, risk behaviours for infectious diseases, mental health, substance use, crime and violence and life satisfaction. The GAINQ3 is part of an integrated family of instruments, and is 35 embedded within the larger GAIN Initial (GAINI), which is a much longer standardized clinical assessment tool used for diagnosis, placement and treatment planning (i.e., modality matching). The GAINQ3 MI includes items that focus on individuals' behaviours during the past 90 days, as well as a set of items for each domain that ask about individuals' reasons and readiness to change behaviours. The instruments were interviewer administered both electronically and via paper and pencil. The average time of administration for the GAINQ3 MI is reported by Chestnut Health as 45 minutes. Furthermore, there is a substantial body of evidence regarding the tool's psychometric properties (GAINCC, 2013a), and the existing database compiled by other users can be used for the purposes of further benchmarking and research. Some of the items in GAINQ3 MI, particularly questions related to demographics and terms for some government and community services, are appropriate only to the U.S. setting. With the support of Chestnut Health Systems, we developed an Ontario version of the GAINQ3 MI (see Appendix 4) 7in order to increase the tool's relevance to the provincial context. We also worked with a group from Quebec to standardize the revisions across Quebec and Ontario to the extent possible. For more details, refer to the section below regarding GAIN revisions and the Assessment Building System (ABS). In sum, this tool was selected for pilot testing because it met most of the criteria outlined above, and received overwhelming support from the Advisory Committee/Working Group. 2.5.2 Current Assessment Package Admission and Discharge Criteria and Assessment Tools (ADAT): The ADAT is a MoHLTC package of tools mandated for all publiclyfunded addiction service programs. It is comprised of eight assessment tools intended to identify the most appropriate level and intensity of care for a client entering Ontario's addictions treatment system (i.e, placement matching). The results of the eight tools map onto a decisiontree for the 7 The version in the Appendix is that used in the pilot testing. Note that further revisions to the tool have been made since the pilot testing and this work continues. Please contact the authors for the most recent version.of the GAIN- Q3 MI. 36 purposes of client placement according to level of care (e.g., home or residential withdrawal management; community or residential treatment). As both the ADAT and the GAINQ3 MI were required for the pilot testing process the Drug History Questionnaire (DHQ) was not employed in order to decrease redundancy with the GAINQ3 MI. A brief description of the remaining 7 ADAT tools is provided below: Adverse Consequences of Substance Use (AC): This 8item tool was developed to help determine a client's level of functioning in three main areas: medical/psychiatric; emotional/behavioural; and barriers/resources. There are no published psychometric properties associated with this tool, as the main purpose of this tool was said to be to develop an overall clinical profile. The AC questions cover a time range from ever in the client's life to the past 90 days, and the tool takes approximately 10 minutes to complete (Cross & Sibley, 2010). Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES): This 19item instrument measures an adult client's readiness for change in three categories: ambivalence, recognition, and taking steps. The testretest reliability is good, with scores of 0.83, 0.94 and 0.93, respectively (Miller & Tonigan, 1996). The SOCRATES can be completed via paper and pencil, and can be either clinician or selfadministered. The measures are scored using a 5point Likert scale and the tool can be completed in 10 minutes (Cross & Sibley, 2010). Treatment Entry Questionnaire (TEQ) : This instrument is used to measure an adult client's motivation to enter substance use treatment (Wild, 1995). The TEQ has 12items that measure three types of motivation: internal positive; internal negative; and external coercion. These 3 measures are scored on a 7point Likert scale, and have respective alpha scores of 0.78, 0.80 and 0.82 (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Knowledge Exchange, 2009). The tool is selfadministered via pencil and paper, and can be completed in 10 minutes (Cross & Sibley, 2010). 37 Perceived Social Support (PSS) : The PSS is a 14item instrument that assesses the quality of a client's relationship with family and friends (Rice & Longabaugh, 1996).).The tool is appropriate for adults, takes approximately two minutes to complete by pencil and paper, and is selfadministered. The instrument measures a client's support system in two categories: family and friends, using a trichotomous scale. The PSS also has good internal consistency for both the family and friends categories, with alpha scores of 0.85 and 0.81, respectively (Cross & Sibley, 2010). Drug Taking Confidence Questionnaire (DTCQ8: Alcohol and DTCQ 8: Drugs) : These are two separate measures, the former for alcohol and the latter for drugs (Sklar & Turner, 1999). Both DTCQ8 instruments are eight items in length and used to provide a summary of a client's perceived ability to resist using drugs and alcohol in two classes of situations: personal situations and situations involving others. The measures are scored on a 6point rating scale. This instrument is appropriate for adults, can be clinician or selfadministered via paper and pencil or electronically, and takes approximately 5 minutes to complete (Cross & Sibley, 2010). Behavioural and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS32): The BASIS 32 is a 32item tool used to measure the level of difficulty in various areas of the client's life functioning, within the past seven days. The instrument is appropriate for adults and adolescents, can be clinician or selfadministered via paper and pencil, and takes approximately 10 minutes to complete (Eisen, 1995). The questions measure: relation to self/others; daily living functional skills; depression/anxiety; impulsive/addictive behaviour; and psychosis. These measures are scored on a 5point Likert scale. The BASIS 32 has good reliability and validity, with testretest scores ranging from 0.650.81 and an internal consistency of 0.89 (Eisen, Wilcox, Leff, Schaefer, & Culhane, 1999). Health Screening Form : This counsellor administered form is used to record medical history only, and is not used as a screening or assessment tool (Cross & Sibley, 2010). 38 2.6 PILOT SITES Five pilot sites participated in this study. The sites, described in detail below, were selected to represent a diversity of addiction agencies in Ontario, and thus include a range of programs and clientele8. Pilot sites were selected based on the following criteria: Geographic location - rural/urban, north/south Size - ranging in size from small, singleprogram sites to multi program sites Client flow - covering a range of internal client flow processes Program type - a range of program types (e.g., community withdrawal management, community based treatment) Populations served - targeting youth (12 years of age and older) and/or adults Staff and clinicians at the pilot agencies were involved in data collection, and obtained appropriate training related to the administration of the tools. Each pilot site also selected one staff member to serve in the role of Study Lead. This position involved certain responsibilities; for example, Study Leads were required to complete the TriCouncil Policy Statement 2 ethics module; store study recruitment materials and hard copies of study data securely; serve as the central point of contact (i.e., liaise between the project coordinators and all the staff at the agency); encourage feedback from staff related to the project;, and provide assistance on scheduling study visits for monitoring purposes. Service contracts were developed with the pilot agencies outlining agreements related to roles, responsibilities, and requirements. As all of the pilot sites provide more than one program/service those to be included in the pilot were negotiated at the outset and outlined in the service contracts. 8 At the outset, a shortterm residential treatment program joined the project, but eventually withdrew for internal reasons unrelated to the project. 39 Addiction Services of Thames Valley (ADSTV) Addiction Services of Thames Valley is a community based service, operating in co operation with local addiction and health care agencies, through the Southwest LHIN . There are eight programs that are operated by ADSTV, and through these programs, ADSTV offers assessment, counselling, support, education, employment and housing services for a wide diversity of individuals involved with substance abuse or gambling problems. They offer services in London, Strathroy (Middlesex), St. Thomas (Elgin), Woodstock, Ingersoll and Tillsonburg (Oxford). All ADSTV programs, except for those related to education participated in our pilot. http://adstv.on.ca/ Rideauwood Addiction and Family Service Founded in 1976, Rideauwood Addiction and Family Service is a registered charity serving adults, adolescents and family members in Eastern Ontario. They provide non residential, group and individual treatment, public education, training and consultation. Rideauwood also has an extensive volunteer program that provides essential services to the agency. For the pilot, only the schoolbased program and the agencybased youth program participated in the study. http://www.rideauwood.org/ Four Counties Addiction Services Team (Fourcast) Fourcast is a community addiction treatment agency offering professional counselling services for anyone concerned about substance use or problem gambling, whether for themselves or for others. The goal of Fourcast is to support clients by empowering them to make their own choices in an open, nonjudgmental atmosphere, with a focus on encouraging positive change. Fourcast provides initial assessment and treatment planning services, as well as community addiction treatment programs in the counties of Peterborough, Northumberland, Haliburton and the City of Kawartha Lakes. The pilot tools and procedures were implemented in all of these programs/services. http://www.fourcast.ca/ 40 Addictions Centre (Hastings/Prince Edward Counties) The Addictions Centre (Hastings/Prince Edward Counties) offers standardized addiction assessment and outpatient counselling (community treatment services) for individuals 16 years of age or older who are concerned with their substance use or gambling problems. The Centre also provides short term residential addiction treatment for men at a different site. The pilot tools and procedures were implemented in all of the services, except for the residential program. http://www.addictionscentre.ca/ Manitoulin Community Withdrawal Management Services Manitoulin Health Centre includes two hospitals that serve the Manitoulin region. Manitoulin Community Withdrawal Management Services (MCWMS), a program of Manitoulin Health Centre provides support to clients voluntarily withdrawing from alcohol and/or other drugs. Clients may be residing at their home, the home of a significant other, or in another safe setting. MCWMS staff members also provide information and assistance to guide the support provider(s) supervising the \"inhome\" care. MCWMS offers three main components in managing withdrawal: intake and assessment, withdrawal management, and continuing care. Assessment/treatment planning services and case management are also available. http://www.manitoulinheal thcentre.com/news/154/ 2.7 STUDY PARTICIPANTS Participants of the project were clients aged 12 or older, presenting for screening and assessment at one of the five pilot agencies across Ontario. Only clients who were in the intake stages of treatment, and not currently receiving treatment services at the pilot agency, were eligible to participate. An exception was made for Rideauwood, as counsellors indicated that clients in the schoolbased programs were typically not ready to complete assessment tools, prior to treatment sessions. As such, they were hesitant to approach new clients for participation in our study. In order to address this issue, we asked counsellors at Rideauwood to recruit clients who were in the intake stages of treatment and those whom they had been counselling for one month or longer. Clients included in the study were presenting for a 41 substance use problem, clinically stable, had consented to participate, were able to speak and understand English and showed no evidence of cognitive impairment based on a structured, validated scale assessing this domain (Katzman et al., 1983). Clients were not reimbursed for their participation. The purpose of this project was to determine the feasibility of implementing the tools and procedures piloted in this study across all addictions agencies in Ontario. Since clients are not paid for receiving addictions treatment in Ontario or being followed up9, doing so in our pilot would possibly overestimate the feasibility of our approach (i.e., in terms of participation rates). 2.8 QUANTITATIVE DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES The data collection period began midJune, 2012 (mid September, 2012 for Rideauwood Addiction and Family Service) and extended through March, 2013 to allow for at least two months of client recruitment and six months of recovery monitoring (both within and post intake). For sites that had started data collection in June 2012, the recruitment period was extended until the end of September, 2012 to ensure adequate time to obtain a reasonable sample size for analysis purposes. The recruitment period was also extended for Rideauwood (ending early December, 2012). All of the project tools, with the exception of GAINQ3MI, were administered via paper and pencil at particular time points as summarized in Table 1. It was recommended that agency staff administer the GAINQ3MI electronically, as reports could only be generated for this tool by using the GAIN ABS platform. The majority of GAINQ3MI assessments were administered electronically. However, in the instances where this was not possible, the tool was administered by clinicians via paper and pencil and then subsequently entered into the GAIN ABS platform. 9 It is important to re-emphasize that this project focused on screening and assessment was implemented in concert with the evaluation of the recovery monitoring protocol and, therefore employed one set of inclusion/exclusion criteria and one consent form. The protocol did not provide for payment of clients for their participation in order to fully support feasibility assessment for provincial scale-up. 42 Agency staff were required to administer the project tools in addition to the common assessment tools (ADAT) that they were already using for their clients (excluding the DHQ). This would allow for feedback on the comparative advantages and disadvantages of the new tools over the original ADAT tools. The ADAT package was administered to clients before they were asked to participate in this study and to complete a new set of screening and assessment tools. In this way, we were able to minimize interruptions or disturbances to the usual intake/assessment processes and client flow within each pilot agency. Table 1. Summary of baseline data collection activities Instrument Screening & Assessment Global Appraisal of Individual Needs-Short Screener (GAIN SS) - CAMH modified Stage 1 Screener 18 years of age and over Modified Mini Screener (MMS) OR Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ) 1217 years of age Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT) Stage 2 Screener Global Appraisal of Individual Needs-Quick3 (GAINQ3) - MI Stage 1 Assessment 2.8.1 Recruitment and Consent Process Clients admitted to addictions treatment services routinely undergo screening and assessment. Potential participants were approached by trained staff involved in the intake and assessment function at each pilot agency once some or all of the ADAT tools (less the DHQ) were administered. The recruitment process was typically initiated during the client's second visit, at which time they were provided with a description of the pilot project via a Letter of Information and Consent to Participate form. For clients under 16 years of age, an assent form 43 was provided and consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians. After providing informed consent/assent, clients' cognitive competence was assessed using the GAIN Cognitive Impairment Screener. Eligible clients were informed that their participation in this study was completely voluntary and that they could refuse to join the study or withdraw from it at any time without having any impact on their current or future services. They were also informed that in the event they decide to leave the study, they would have the right to allow or restrict the use of data that was collected from them up until withdrawal. Clients were, however, asked to provide reasons for refusal or withdrawal, as this would provide information about potential biases in the sample and contribute to the assessment of the feasibility for scaleup across Ontario. 2.8.2 Screening and Assessment At intake, recruited clients were administered the Stage 1 Screener (GAINSS) by a trained clinician at the pilot site. This \"case finding\" stage was followed by the administration of the Stage 2 Screener, based on the results of the Stage 1 Screener, and for which there were two options for clients 18 years of age and up (MMS and PDSQ). At the outset of the project the pilot agencies were given the opportunity to review both options and select the instrument that best fit their clients' \"case definition\". The distribution of the Stage 2 Screeners was kept even among the sites to allow for a better comparison. For clients 1217, pilot sites administered the POSIT as the Stage 2 Screener. The Stage 1 Assessment tool (GAINQ3) was administered by the treating clinician at the beginning of the assessment phase. All clinicians at the pilot sites received training in the administration and interpretation of the new tools (see also section 3.3.2 for more details). 44 3.0 PILOT SITE ENGAGEMENT, TRAINING AND MONITORING OF PROCEDURES 3.1 ENGAGEMENT OF PILOT SITES In February 2012, initial visits were made to all of the pilot agencies by key members of the team (project lead, project scientist, and research coordinator). The goals of these \"engagement\" visits were to: introduce the research team and meet all of the staff share information regarding the background of DTFP and introduce the project learn more about agencyspecific processes review next steps prior to training and pilot launch The oneday visits informed the finalization of the pilot protocol and facilitated the building of relationships prior to training and launch. 3.2 TRAINING OF PILOT AGENCY STAFF Agency staff members participating in the pilot project were trained on the implementation of project processes and administration of project tools. They also underwent formal training and a certification process to administer the GAINQ3 instruments as recommended by Chestnut Health Systems to ensure the validity and reliability of assessment results. The GAINQ3 training is detailed in Section 4.1.3. Members of the DTFP research team visited the sites in May 2012 (August 2012 for Rideauwood) to provide training to all participating staff. The 1.5 day training provided information regarding the rationale, protocol, and procedures to administer and interpret the study tools. Specifically, the training reviewed the: process of recruiting eligible clients, obtaining study participant consent and gathering locator information for followup procedures; pilot tools, and the procedures for administering, scoring and interpreting the tools method for liaising with the followup staff to locate clients for 3 and 6month interviews; and 45 returntotreatment protocol Participants in the training were provided with detailed training manuals which included: training slides laminated flowcharts outlining in detail the various components of the protocol consent, assent and withdrawal forms study eligibility checklists a copy of each of the tools to be piloted information on ethics project administration materials contact information for the DTFP Project Team, Study Leads and GAIN trainers A mix of clinicians and administration staff from each of the pilot sites were present at the training session (Table 2).

Almost all of the participants stated that they had a good understanding of the purpose, various project processes, and project tools at the end of training. After the training visits, the DTFP research team followed up with participants to review any sections of the training that needed further clarification. 3.3 DEVELOPING AN ONTARIO VERSION OF THE GAIN Q3 3.3.1 GAIN Revisions and Assessment Building System (ABS) System Following the selection of the GAINQ3 instruments, the Advisory Committee and Working Group recommended revisions to \"Canadianize\" the language from the U.S. developed instrument, and in collaboration with a treatment research group in Quebec heavily invested in the use of the GAIN tools in Quebec treatment agencies. Proposed revisions were vetted through an extensive consultation process. For example, items related to ethnicity/cultural background and sexual orientation were reviewed with colleagues within CAMH who have expertise in the area of health equity and with colleagues within the Drug and Alcohol Treatment Information System (DATIS) to ensure consistency with mandatory reporting elements within the Ontario addiction sector.10 Further edits and additions were also required to reflect the Ontario context, most notably the addition of questions related to trauma and adjustments in language to reflect a harm reduction philosophy and approach. Additional items from the larger GAINI instrument were also added (e.g., housing status, living environment, barriers to treatment and physical health) so as to better crosswalk with existing ADAT admission and discharge criteria. Relevant changes were also reflected in the GAIN Recommendation and Referral Summary (GRRS), which is automatically generated based on responses inputted into the GAIN ABS system (a web 10 DATIS contributes to the understanding and enhancement of problem gambling and addiction treatment in the Province of Ontario through the ongoing development and maintenance of a comprehensive, provincewide client information system (http://www.datis.ca/aboutus_mission.php ). 47 based application that allows the GAIN family of instruments to be administered and summarized by computer). All revisions to the instrument and GRRS were reviewed by a sub group of the project's Working Group, comprised of individuals with extensive experience with addictions treatment service delivery and with the ADAT admission and discharge criteria. Refer to Appendix 5 for an itemized list of changes to both the GAINQ3 instrument and the GRRS Treatment Planning and Placement Statements. A parallel process involved the integration of the GAIN ABS system into the Catalyst software. Catalyst is a browserbased computer application, managed by DATIS, which houses clientlevel clinical and administrative data for MoHLTCfunded addictions agencies in Ontario. Following negotiations with Chestnut Health Systems, the GAIN ABS application and database were hosted in Catalyst via encrypted web service connections and housed in a secure server located in Toronto, Ontario. Support staff at Chestnut Health Systems have remote access to the server system to upload patches and modifications (including the revised GAINQ3 instruments and report templates) to the GAIN ABS platform as needed. For the purposes of the pilot, only the GAINQ3MI was mounted onto the Catalyst ABS system11. 3.3.2 GAIN Training Formal training and certification to administer the GAINQ3 instruments is required by Chest Health Systems to ensure the validity and the reliability of the assessment results. As such, a trainthetrainer model was used for the purposes of the project whereby between one and three staff from each of the pilot agencies, as well as one member from the research team (henceforth called \"Local Trainers\") attended a 4day training delivered by Chestnut Health Systems in Illinois, U.S.. The training included presentations; smallgroup work with hands on practice administering the GAIN Initial (GAINI); a workshop to practice identifying and clarifying inconsistent responses; information about the Administration Quality Assurance (A QA) process; an overview of the GAINgenerated clinical reports; discussions regarding using 11 The GAINSS (CAMHmodified) was subsequently mounted in ABS postdata collection. 48 the GAIN to guide diagnosis and treatment planning; a demonstration of the GAIN ABS online version of the instrument; data management information; and an opportunity for trainees to make their first submissions toward GAIN Administration Certification. Local Trainers were then expected to return to their agencies and submit taped sessions of their administration of the GAINI with clients until they demonstrated the requirements for Administrative Certification. The next phase, Local Trainer certification, required Local Trainers to train up to five staff at their agencies to administer the GAINI, provide feedback and recommendations, conduct ongoing quality assurance, and recommend them for Administration Certification. The Local Trainers received continued support from the AQA Team for a total of six months to achieve both Administration and Local Trainer Certification. Once certified to train on the GAINI, Local Trainers are then considered certified to also train on the shorter assessments, including the GAINQ3, which they did for all clinical staff at the pilot agency. The DTFP research team Local Trainer also provided supplementary training to the agency pilot sites on the GAIN ABS system via a one hour demonstrative webinar, modeled on the monthly trainings provided by Chestnut Health Systems. DATIS issued passwords to all agency staff in order to provide access to the ABS system. As with the larger Catalyst system, agencies were only permitted access to view data from GAIN assessments administered at their agency. 3.4 MONITORING OF PROCEDURES AND DATA QUALITY 3.4.1 Monitoring Visits and Support to Pilot Sites During recruitment, research staff conducted site visits to review implementation of the study protocol, requirements for storage of study files, and overall status of project implementation. This was done in part to ensure the integrity of the implementation of the protocol, but also to ensure all requirements were being met for potential audit of the project by the CAMH Research Ethics Board. In general, once a pilot site had recruited approximately five participants, members of the research staff initiated visits to the agency. If there were no issues identified then the research team returned at the end of the study recruitment period. If 49 a pilot site was experiencing issues with any aspect of the project implementation, then the research team returned to the site as often as needed. During the site visits, all studyrelated materials were photocopied and brought back to CAMH for data entry by members of the research team. Site visits also included a debriefing with the Study Leads regarding any outstanding scheduling and procedural issues. Prior to data entry, research staff checked all study documents for missing data or inconsistencies, and followed up with Study Leads to make needed corrections. Throughout the duration of the pilot, considerable support was provided to the participating staff at the agencies. This included a weekly email to all Study Leads, in which we provided an update on the project (e.g., recruitment numbers, issues identified in other sites, as well as reminders on key aspects of the protocol. Members of the research team were available to discuss any aspect of the project with Study Leads, either over the telephone or via email. Every attempt was made to facilitate the pilot process for the agencies so as to reduce the burden on clinical staff. 3.4.2 Data Storage and Central Database Development A unique identifier (alphanumeric code) was assigned to each participant. The key to the unique ID numbers was kept in a password protected excel file, which could only be accessed by the Study Leads and the research coordinator. Occasionally, access was granted to other members of the research team for the purpose of data entry. All completed study tools were stored in clients' clinical files at the pilot sites in order for clinicians to use the information in treatment planning. In order to truly assess the usefulness and feasibility of the tools for treatment planning, clinicians were permitted to send summaries and reports generated from the study tools to outside agencies for the purpose of client referrals. This was necessary as agency staff often need to show proof or provide a reason as to why a client was being referred to a particular program. All recruitment and consent material, including the Locator Form, were kept in a locked filing cabinet that remained at each site in a research file (separate from the study tools). 50 All photocopied study material (except for the consent/assent forms and locator forms) that were brought back to CAMH were immediately deidentified, that is, clients' names were removed and replaced with their unique identifiers. Client files were stored in locked filing cabinets at CAMH. A master database for entering all of the study data (except for the GAIN Q3MI) was created in Excel. All of the data were entered by one member of the research team, while another verified the information by checking to ensure that the data entered into the Excel file matched the paper copies of the study documents. This was an important component of our quality control procedures. The database was password protected and saved onto a CAMHnetworked drive. 51 4.0 EVALUATION STRATEGY The main goal of the evaluation strategy was to collect feedback from all participating staff at the pilot sites and other key stakeholders in order to assess the feasibility and utility of our tools and procedures and to determine strengths and limitations or issues going forward in terms of eventual provincewide wide implementation. The particular evaluation questions and indicators of success that guided this process are outlined in Table 3. Informal feedback was provided regularly by the Study Leads, GAIN Trainers and Executive Directors via email and/or telephone. Relevant comments were collected and maintained in an Excel file that was monitored by a member of the research team. Frontline clinical staff also provided feedback using a logbook in which they responded to three openended questions, typically on a weekly basis during the pilot phase. The purpose was to obtain the clinicians' and their clients' (indirect) perceptions of the project tools and procedures (see Appendix 6). Structured feedback was collected from all agency staff involved in the study via an online questionnaire, which consisted of approximately 60 questions, including items pertinent to ADAT,GAIN SS, PDSQ, MMS, POSIT, GAINQ3 MI, staged approach to screening and assessment, and GAIN ABS. Of 48 invitations sent to staff at the five pilot sites, 38 submitted a completed questionnaire (79% response rate). Skips were built into the online software program (Fluid Surveys, www.fluidsurveys.com), thus respondents were rarely required to answer all of the questions. For example, if a respondent had not administered the GAINSS CAMHmodified, then they would skip all of the related questions in that section. The questionnaire was administered to pilot sites during three weeks in November, 2012; however, staff at Rideauwood completed the online questionnaire in January 2013, given that recruitment at this site had just wrappedup in December, 2012. See Appendix 7 for the Screening, Assessment and Recovery Monitoring Feedback Survey. In addition, the project lead, project scientist, and program manager visited all of the pilot sites in January and February, 2013 to conduct focus groups. During the one day visit, a 52 summary of the findings were presented to all of the staff at the sites. Specifically, updates were provided on the numbers of clients recruited and tools completed. The analysis of study feedback was also presented and preliminary results were validated by asking staff members to comment on the degree to which the findings matched their own experiences. Furthermore, the proposed revisions to the GAIN tools and preliminary recommendations to the MoHLTC were discussed. For the final component of this visit, key informant interviews were held with the study leads and Executive Directors. Unstructured and openended questions related to systemlevel impacts of screening and assessment were used to guide the interviews. Specific topic areas included the perceived valueadd of a staged process for screening and assessment; integration into existing programs/services and interagency collaborations; ADAT; wider dissemination; other initiatives; and continued use of the study tools. All discussions from the pilot site visits were audio taped and later transcribed. Additional feedback by email or telephone was also encouraged after these debriefing sessions at the pilot agencies. The project team also requested a meeting with a standing committee comprised of Mental Health and Addiction Leads from each of Ontario's Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs). The project lead presented the goals and work completed to date for three of the provincial DTFP projects, including the screening and assessment project, as well as key implications for the addiction system based on preliminary pilot results. Committee members were asked to discuss these implications further with LHIN colleagues who were unable to attend the meeting and to provide a summary of feedback at a later date. Finally, the screening and assessment project served as a case study for the separate overall evaluation of the Ontario DTFP System Enhancement Program, conducted by the Evaluation Centre for Complex Health Interventions from St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. As part of this case study, this larger DTFP evaluation team conducted site visits and interviews with Executive Directors from two of the project's pilot sites (the Addictions Centre and ADSTV) and requested feedback regarding the tools and processes piloted, as well as regarding the 53 support provided by the research team. Feedback from this process was used to triangulate the results from all evaluation strategies described above. Table 3. Evaluation questions and indicators of success Objective Evaluation Questions Data collection Strategy and Indicators of Success To assess the acceptability and utility of a new, common package of screening and assessment tools and procedures for addictions treatment services in Ontario What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of the new suite of tools and client placement protocols over the current tools/process? What are the key lessons learned regarding the screening and assessment tools that impact scalability and sustainability? Technical indicators: Average time for completion of each screening tool % screening positive for internalizing and externalizing MH disorders on Stage 1 screener (goal) % of those positive on Stage 1 screener who are followedup with a Stage 2 screener; % positive on specific mental disorders on the Stage 2 screener Average time for completion of the new assessment tools/processes and relative advantage over the old ADAT tools Qualitative indicators of success: Perceived valueadd of the staged approach to screening Positive feedback on adaptability of tools for specific programs, service contexts and subpopulations (e.g., telephone versus face toface intake; group versus individual intake; single point in time versus consecutive sessions for assessment; mandated versus voluntary clients) Feedback gathered via interviews or focus groups of (a) pilot site clinicians and clinical directors; (b) program managers including managers of agencies receiving referrals and forwarded assessment information. Key output: Specifications for provincial implementation and sustainability: 54 Leadership and sector support Training requirements and cost IT infrastructure and cost Fidelity assessment 4.1 QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS To support achievement of the project objectives (pg 19) the overall qualitative analysis of pilot data was guided by three key questions: 1. What are the perceived strengths and challenges of the actual administration/utilization of the new suite of tools? 2. What are the perceived value add or perceived value loss of the new suite of tools over ADAT/current practice? 3. What are the strengths and limitations/issues going forward in terms of wider implementation of the new suite of tools? Qualitative data from the different sources of formal data collection tools (e.g., online survey, logbooks, focus groups, feedback from LHINs) were first analyzed separately as distinct sets of data. All data from one source were exported into Excel files and were organized first into broad categories (e.g., type of tool, feedback regarding the staged screening and assessment process, comparisons with ADAT). Then, within each category, the analyst reviewed all responses and identified a provisional set of qualitatively distinct points and assigned numeric codes with corresponding labels. Where a number of points (and corresponding numeric codes) clustered within a given thematic area overarching thematic categories were assigned. Thematic categories across all sources of data were then grouped and analyzed to validate the findings and to identify any qualitative \"outliers\" (i.e., feedback that was not consistent with any particular theme). Finally, informal feedback collected during the pilot site 55 was also consulted to again determine whether there were any discrepancies with the identified themes. 4.2 QUANTITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS AND DESCRIPTION OF STUDY SAMPLE The screening process for the study is outlined in Figure 2 below. Out of the 773 clients approached to participate in the study, 292 (38%) declined to continue after the introduction of the study. The main reasons for the lack of interest in the study included the extra time commitments associated with the new assessment process introduced by the study12, attending services for legal reasons only, and not presenting for substance use services. The remaining 481 clients were screened for the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two hundred and fortyseven of these clients were excluded from the study: 44 did not present for services for a substance use problem at the pilot agencies; 6 were not proficient in English; 37 were not clinically stable at the time of recruitment; 2 were cognitively impaired; and 160 did not consent to the study. The additional assessment time required by the study process and the perception that it would divert focus from treatment were the main reasons clients declined to participate in the study during the consent process. In the end of the screening process, 234 clients were enrolled into the study. The breakdown by site is as follows: 170 from Addiction Services of Thames Valley (London) 47 from Fourcast (Peterborough) 6 from Manitoulin Community Withdrawal Management Services (Little Current) 4 from Addictions Centre (Belleville) 7 from Rideauwood Addiction and Family Services (Ottawa) 12 Participants were required to complete the standard process (ADAT) PLUS the new tools being piloted in the project. Figure 2. An overview of the study recruitment process The research team requested basic sociodemographic information for the 234 clients from DATIS; however, data were available only for 217 of these clients. The other 17 clients did not have any admission program information available in DATIS. As shown previously, the number of participants from Manitoulin Community Withdrawal Management Services, Addictions Centre, and the Rideauwood Addiction and Family Services was very small. In addition, each of these three sites represented a special client population within Ontario addiction services. After careful consideration, the research team decided to analyze the data from these three sites independent from the rest of the study sample to highlight the 56 57 uniqueness of their client populations. All analyses conducted for this report are based on the final sample containing 200 clients (from ADSTV and Fourcast). The representativeness of our study sample (n=200) was determined by comparing them on key characteristics to all clients in the main participating agencies (Addiction Services of Thames Valley (London) and Fourcast (Peterborough) as well as the total substance use treatment population across all publiclyfunded agencies in Ontario (see Table 4). Pertinent data were obtained from DATIS. Information from residential treatment programs were excluded as only community treatment programs participated in our study. Chisquare statistical tests were conducted to compare the distributions of sociodemographic characteristics of the study sample to these two populations (Table 4) to examine potential biases in our findings. Descriptive statistics were also generated for the administration times of all the tools used in this study. Changes in administration time over the course of the study were analyzed using the independent sample and pairsample ttests (Table 5). Among the 200 clients, 148 completed a baseline tool (GAINQ3 MI). The remaining 52 clients did not complete a baseline tool, mainly due to missing several appointments following study recruitment. In total, 19 clients withdrew from the study at various stages. Most commonly, clients were in a state of crisis, and were thus unable to continue with the study. Some indicated that their needs were already being met at the agency; as such, they were no longer interested in participating in the study. Less frequent reasons for withdrawal were related to the fact that some clients had moved out of the province and in a few cases, there were difficulties in finding a convenient time to talk on the telephone. 58 5.0 FINDINGS AND INTERPRETATION 5.1 FEASIBILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES: QUANTITATIVE RESULTS 5.1.1 Representativeness of Sample Compared to the total treatment populations from ADSTV and Fourcast (see Table 4), the study sample was representative in terms of many key characteristics, such as gender, preferred language, housing, employment, presenting substances at admission, frequency of substance use, and mental health. However, younger clients were somewhat under represented in our sample: 27% were younger than 25 years old in the treatment population, whereas about 24 % were less than 25 in our sample (2(4)=11.01, p=0.03). Clients in our sample also tended to have higher education levels (2(3)=21.6, p<0.001) and were less likely to be involved in the court system. More specifically, the proportion of clients who had no legal problems were 60% in the treatment population and about 69% in the sample (2(3)=9.32, p=0.03). This was also reflected in the fact that presenting for services solely for court reasons was one of the main reasons for declining study participation. Compared to the treatment population across all Ontario publiclyfunded community treatment services (see Table 4), our study sample was representative in terms of gender, age, employment and mental health. However, our study clients were more likely to be in a stable relationship, have at least a highschool education, and be housed (fixed address). All our study clients preferred receiving services in English, whereas 4% of all clients in the treatment system preferred receiving services in languages other than English. This finding is, however, not surprising as only those who were able to speak or understand English were eligible to participate in our study. In terms of substance use, over 42% of our study sample sought services related to a drinking problem only. This was significantly higher than the 30% observed in the treatment population (2(2)=19.02, p<0.001). In addition, daily substance users represented about 61% of the treatment population, but only about 45% of the sample (2(4)=23.09, p<0.001). 59 Table 4.

There is a general trend, however, for the clients engaged in the project to be somewhat more stable, for example, compared to other clients in the participating agencies, those consenting were older and somewhat less likely to have legal problems, Compared to the overall treatment population in community treatment services our participants tended to: be married/partnered, have at least a high school degree, and present only with an alcohol use problem (i.e., less involvement of other drugs). Clients in our sample were also less likely to use substances on a daily basis. These results are not unexpected, as our protocol was quite time consuming and burdensome (as with any research study). More discussion regarding this issue is provided in the later sections. 5.1.2 Administration of Tools The administration time for all the tools used in the staged screening and assessment process are outlined in Table 5. One hundred and eightyseven clients completed the GAINSS during the pilot. On average, the tool took eight minutes to complete. As mentioned earlier, the project pilot tested stagedapproach screening for internalizing mental health disorders. Clients with a score 2 or above on the internalizing mental health screener, a subscale of the GAIN SS, moved onto a stage 2 mental health screening. Using the cutoff score of 2, 171 (91%) of the clients, who completed the GAINSS screened positive for internalizing mental health disorders. The project also explored the use of a cutoff score of 3. In our study sample, 155 (83%) clients scored 3 or higher on the internalizing mental health disorders screener. 62 Of the 171 clients who went onto stage 2 mental health screening, 130 completed the MMS as a stage2 screener and 27 completed the PDSQ. On average, the MMS took 6 minutes to complete and the PDSQ 19 minutes. Majority of the screening tools were administered by clinicians. Statistical analyses showed that there was no significant difference on completion time between self and clinician administration of the tools. One hundred and fortyeight clients from our sample completed the GAIN Q3MI. All of them were administered by clinicians. The administrations were on average 60 minutes long. The other 52 clients did not complete the GAINQ3 MI. The main reasons were related to a lack of time or clients not showing up for their appointments. As shown in Table 6 the groups of clients who completed a baseline assessment and those who did not were comparable except in age, status of relationship, employment, and presenting problem substance. Clients who completed a baseline assessment as part of our study were older and more likely to be married and employed. They were also more likely to present for services for drinking problems only: 49% vs 21% (chi(2)=10.7, p<0.01). 63 Table 5.

The online survey was sent to 50 clinicians from all five pilot sites; and 38 responded. Findings from the survey responses are presented in the following sections. Where relevant, results from the focus groups are also presented to highlight key discrepancies or areas of consensus, and to expand on the main findings. Feedback from all five pilot sites were also collected by the Evaluation Centre for Complex Health Interventions (led by Dr. Sanjeev Sridharan); pertinent results are provided below. Global Assessment of Individual NeedsShort Screener (GAINSS) The majority of survey respondents (n=28, 74%) reported administering the GAINSS during the course of the research study. These respondents were asked to estimate the number of times they administered the GAINSS during this same period. The result, 716 estimated 67 administrations (26 on average)13, highlights substantial experience with the screening instrument. Respondents generally noted three areas of strength for the GAINSS: administration, clinical application and its screening function. With respect to administration, respondents valued the fact that the GAINSS is quick to administer (8); is easy to administer (4) (noting in particular selfadministration); and is easy to understand (2). With respect to the GAINSS's clinical application, the most common endorsement was the comprehensiveness of the instrument (9). Respondents were also generally pleased with the GAINSS directing clinician's focus on key areas of concern flagged by the tool (4). Related to these two points, one respondent from the focus group discussions emphasized the perceived value of the GAINSS in standardizing the questions that are asked early in the clinical process to ensure that potential concerns are not overlooked. Two survey respondents noted that the results of the GAINSS facilitates discussion with the client (\"allows the client to open up about some difficult topics\"). Two respondents also noted that the GAINSS provides a snapshot of the client's current state, and one noted the ability to see change in problem areas over time within the same administration. Finally, with respect to the screening function of the GAINSS, four respondents noted that the GAINSS facilitates referral to appropriate services (most notably mental health) and that it also screens clients in and out of their own services. This point was reinforced in focus group discussions with one respondent noting the utility of the GAINSS in facilitating communication and collaboration across sectors. Two survey respondents made particular note of the value of the staged screening approach whereby the GAINSS can efficiently determine whether a more indepth screener/assessment is warranted. This latter point was also echoed in the feedback obtained from the focus group discussions conducted postpilot. 13 The results are based on only those respondents who provided an answer. 68 When asked about any encountered challenges with the GAINSS, the most common theme from the online survey related to the tool's perceived \"wordiness\" (7); these respondents reported needing to repeat questions to facilitate comprehension. Related to this issue were concerns around the interpretation of particular sections or words (5); in particular, clients reportedly had a difficult time understanding the meaning of the word \"significant.\" Two respondents noted concerns related to the GAINSS potentially negatively impacting rapport and challenges in its application to different cultures. From the logbooks, two clinicians noted concerns regarding the repetition of questions between the GAINSS and the GAINQ3 MI and, in the focus groups, one respondent noted redundancies between the GAINSS and the MMS, although it was noted that it is still important to ask these questions in the event that the stage 2 screener is not indicated. One clinician also suggested in the logbooks that the cutoffs for the GAINSS may be set too low such that too many clients are screened in for stage 2 screening. This last theme regarding the cutoff scores was the most prevalent topic of discussion regarding the GAINSS during the postpilot focus groups. One respondent suggested that it may be necessarily to explore whether cut offs need to be different depending on the setting at which a client presents (e.g., schools, primary care, mental health). Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ) Survey respondents had less experience in the pilot with the PDSQ with only seven respondents (18%) reporting having administered the instrument. This represents a total of 55 estimated administrations (average: 8 administrations per clinician). As would be expected, therefore, survey respondents had less feedback regarding the PDSQ. With respect to perceived strengths, four respondents felt that the PDSQ provided a more thorough exploration of clinical concerns and, related to this, two of them noted that the information aids referrals (which was also echoed in one focus group discussion). Three respondents noted that the PDSQ is easy to administer/score 69 No themes emerged related to perceived challenges associated with the PDSQ. Three unique concerns were identified and related to clients wanting to explain their responses to questions; the fact that the PDSQ may take long to administer if administered orally to clients with literacy issues; and that it may be a bit long overall. Modified Mini Screener (MMS ) Just under half of survey respondents (n=17, 45%) reported administering the MMS during the research study period. This represents a total of 303 estimated administrations (average: 18 administrations). Regarding the strengths of the MMS, the most common theme related to the perception that the MMS provides a comprehensive snapshot of mental health history and presenting concerns (7); and related to this point, three respondents noted that the MMS helps identify the need for further assessment. This theme of comprehensiveness was reinforced in one focus group. Five respondents noted that the MMS is quick to administer, and four noted that the results of the MMS can aid referral. Less common themes related to the MMS being easy to understand (3), easy to administer (2), and can be used to followup with the client (2). The most common concern regarding the MMS was the perception that it is \"wordy\" and/or particular items are confusing for clients (7) (e.g., symptoms lumped together, missing skips, a need for rewording for better clarity). Other less common themes included the perception that the MMS is repetitive (3), that it is overly long (3) and that it does not adequately consider cultural/spiritual issues (3). One respondent noted the fact that the MMS was missing a focus on family context. One respondent reported that a client found the MMS intrusive and one respondent felt that the item structure could introduce biased responses. In one focus group discussion it was highlighted that there are some redundancies between items in the GAINSS and the MMS (e.g., eating disorders, psychosis). 70 Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT) Given the few clients recruited at the Rideauwood Addiction and Family Services, only two survey respondents reported experience with the POSIT, and one noted that it was not administered for the purposes of treatment planning or referral. The only comments pertained to one client being irritated by a lack of rapport and that another client found the screening tool overly long. From the focus group discussions, two respondents from one pilot site appreciated the yes/no response format of the POSIT, which, even with over 130 items, still could be administered fairly efficiently and clients seemed to easily understand the questions and how to respond. One site noted some technical challenges with the accompanying software. Perceived Value of Staged Screening Survey respondents were asked whether they would want to continue using the two staged approach now that the research study had ended. Over half (50%, (n=19)) responded 'Yes'; another 26% (n=10) answered 'Maybe'; and 16% (n=6) answered 'No'. Survey respondents were also asked what value they saw in a staged approach to screening. All but two respondents noted some value. Several themes, some interrelated, emerged in response to this question. Fifteen respondents referred to the comprehensiveness of the staged approach (e.g., obtaining a thorough picture of clinical concerns, being able to tease apart mental health from substance use). Fourteen respondents valued the efficiencies realized by staged screening (i.e., only administering tools when warranted), and ten respondents noted the value add for treatment planning and referral . Related to this latter point, respondents also valued the fact that the tools provide standardized, objective clinical information (7). Six respondents highlighted the value of identifying issues early in the clinical process. Two respondents did note redundancies between the GAINSS and the longer GAINQ3 which was also conveyed in one logbook entry. One of these respondents suggested that only the stage two screener may be required but did note that the GAINSS would be advantageous for other service providers outside of the substance use sector). 71 In the focus group discussions, two sites noted particular value in a staged screening process because it teased out different types of problems; it facilitated referral decisions to mental health services and supports; and it was generally seen as efficient to start with a short screener and proceed with a longer screener only if indicated. Another pilot site highlighted the importance of having agencyspecific clinical protocols in place when the staged screeners raise a clinical flag. This may be particularly important for agencies that may not have mental health partners to which they can refer clients, either because there are none available or waiting lists prohibit referrals. Of the two survey respondents who did not note any particular value in the staged screening process, one respondent noted redundancies between the GAINSS and the MMS (also noted in a logbook entry). The other respondent felt unable to assess any added value due to a staged screening process already being in place within their organization. One logbook entry noted concerns that the staged approach requires too many questions asked of the client in a short period of time. And in the focus groups, one clinician suggested that a staged approach to screening may be more important in clinical settings (like withdrawal management services) where clinicians don't have the opportunity to collect relevant information during an extended course of clinical care. Global Assessment of Individual NeedsQuick 3 Motivational Interviewing (GAINQ3 MI) The majority of survey respondents (61%, n=23) reported administering the GAINQ3 MI during the research study period. This represents a total of 189 estimated client administrations (average: 12 administrations per clinician). Survey respondents were asked to rate their overall experience with the GAINQ3 MI. Of the respondents who provided an answer (16 did not), the majority (64%) were either very satisfied or satisfied. Table 7 summarizes all response to this question. 72 Table 7. Ratings of Overall Experience with the GAINQ3 MI Rating N Percentage Very satisfied 6 27.3% Satisfied 8 36.4% Neither satisfied or dissatisfied 4 18.2% Dissatisfied 4 18.2% Very dissatisfied 0 0.0% Total 22 100.1% Note: 16 respondents did not provide an answer to this question. Percentages do not total 100 due to rounding. Survey respondents were also asked to rate the usefulness of each of the subsections of the GAINQ3 MI for assessment and treatment planning. Of those that responded to this question, the majority of survey respondents found all but two subsections either 'Very Useful' Useful' or 'Useful' (40.9% and 47.8% respectively) and only for these subsections did some survey respondents feel these sections had no usefulness for assessment and treatment planning (18.2% and 4.3% respectively). Table 8 presents all ratings for each subsection. Table 8.

Survey respondents were also asked whether there were certain types of information about the client and/or their situation that are NOT adequately explored by the subsections of the GAINQ3MI. Fifty percent (n=12) responded in the affirmative. The most common content area noted as deficient pertained to substance use (5); one respondent suggested that the DHQ in the current ADAT package provides a good overview of substance use history and one respondent suggested supplementing the GAINQ3 MI with the substance use grids from the GAINI. During focus group discussions, two sites reinforced the need to supplement the GAIN Q3 MI with additional questions related to substance use history. There was general agreement that it made sense to incorporate the GAINI substance use grids to fill in this gap in information collected, noting however, that they are more complicated to administer using paper and pencil format as opposed to administration via ABS). Three survey respondents noted that there was not sufficient coverage of family history. Two respondents noted deficiencies in physical/medical history, two for social history, and two for culture. The following areas were noted to be deficient only once: eating disorders, trauma, mental health, selfharm, pregnancy, parenting and spirituality. And in focus group discussions, one site noted that the age of onset of mental health problems was notably absent from the instrument. With respect to administration of the GAINQ3 MI, three respondents felt that the response categories could be confusing for clients (one respondent noted that clients were particularly concerned about responding to questions where symptoms were lumped together). Three respondents noted concerns regarding administration using ABS (e.g., was \"cumbersome\"; validation errors took time to resolve), and three respondents noted that the 74 instrument could be long to administer. Two respondents noted that clients were annoyed that they had to respond to questions perceived as irrelevant and two respondents noted some concerns related to establishing rapport in the context of a standardized assessment. One respondent felt that the content could be repetitive. Twelve respondents provided comments related to the length of the Q3 (all of whom noted that the Q3 could be long to administer and five noting it could take upwards of an hour or more to administer]. This concern was reinforced during focus group discussions at one pilot site. The only other theme related to concerns that the length to administer may interfere with rapport (4), particularly for youth (2). Nine respondents provided qualitative responses related to concerns related to comprehension . Three respondents noted that the repetition of types of questions across different sections of the assessment was at times confusing for clients and/or lead to clients providing \"generic\" responses as opposed to responses specific to a particular life domain; three respondents provided specific examples where the tool presented problems related to comprehension; two respondents noted potential comprehension issues for specific populations (i.e., those with learning disabilities and Aboriginal clients); and one respondent noted a general concern that some wording was problematic. Nine respondents provided qualitative responses to the question regarding cultural factors . Among these, three noted concerns related to First Nations populations, two to older adults and two responses were related to the absence of spirituality in the instrument. Other concerns included the fact that the names of drugs may have different meanings for different cultures (1), that the language may be difficult for individuals whose first language is not English (1), and that there is no \"Black Canadian\" option under the population groups question. Reasons and Readiness to Change Items (MI Questions): Respondents were also asked whether they used the 'reasons and readiness to change' items, included at the end of each section of 75 the GAINQ3 MI, to help motivate their clients to change. Most respondents reported either 'always' (39%, n=9) or 'sometimes' (39%, n=9). One respondent using the items and four respondents (17%) reported 'never' using the items to help motivate clients to change. When asked to comment on the specific strengths and weaknesses of the reasons and readiness to change items, most responses focused on the clinical utility of these items. Eight respondents noted that the MI questions informed an MI approach in counselling (e.g., highlighting discrepancies between reasons and readiness for change). Six respondents appreciated having a measure of motivation and, related to this, two respondents felt that this measure helped inform treatment planning. Two respondents felt that the questions themselves were inherently motivating for clients. Two respondents noted that it would be helpful to revisit these questions either in the form of separate session to review the results and/or to revisit them to reinforce motivation. Two respondents noted that clients tend to repeat responses to these questions across different sections of the instrument. One respondent noted that his/her agency already uses an MI approach so these questions are not particularly new and one respondent noted some concerns related to the item structure of the questions. Logbook entries : Any feedback regarding specific items of the GAINQ3 were analyzed and addressed separately in the context of the subgroup to review proposed revisions to the Ontario GAINQ3 MI. Some of these issues were noted in the logbooks but are not presented in this section]. A total of 74 unique logbook entries pertained to the GAINQ3. Of these, the most common theme (21) pertained to observations that clients appeared fatigued or distracted when participating in the assessment. Related to this observation, 10 respondents noted that the assessment took long/longer than expected to administer. Another eight respondents noted that clients expressed concern that some of the questions were either invasive or they were not comfortable answering them (and which was reinforced by one site during focus group discussions). A smaller number of respondents (4) noted that clients expressed 76 appreciation for the process/assessment and another four respondents noted no concerns or issues when administering the GAINQ3. GAIN ABS and Clinical Reports When asked to comment on any specific issues or challenges that were related to using the ABS platform, the majority of respondents noted challenges related to ABS (13) ABS being slow to load and/or crashing during an assessment (13). Of these respondents, two noted that the technical issues were resolved and no further problems were experienced. Three respondents made reference to technical challenges with Catalyst system, in which ABS is integrated. Two respondents noted challenges with printing reports from ABS (e.g., can't see button on screen) and two respondents expressed optimism that with practice, accessing and using ABS will improve. Two respondents did not have sufficient experience with the system to offer any suggestions and one respondent suggested exploration of the use of mobile devises to access ABS. Respondents were also asked to comment on their use of the treatment planning statements which are automatically generated by ABS and which are presented in the Q3 Recommendations and Referral Summary (Q3RRS). Six respondents reported using the treatment planning statements to help establish treatment goals. Five respondents reported going over the treatment planning statements with clients, again in the interest of treatment planning. Two respondents noted that the statements helped to systematically address any relevant clinical concerns that may have otherwise been overlooked. One respondent noted that the statements were generally consistent with his/her own treatment planning. Suggestions for treatment planning statements were varied. Two respondents provided suggestions pertaining to target dates which are automatically populated by the ABS system; one suggested removing the target dates altogether and the other suggested increasing the time between target dates. Two respondents noted that there are generally too many of treatment planning statements generated. One respondent highlighted the fact that the 77 statements make reference to irrelevant clinical options (e.g., GAINI, Personal Feedback Report) and one respondent suggested that the language in the statements should be more neutral (e.g., less confrontational). Finally, one respondent suggested there needs to be a statement related to DBT work. GAINQ3 MI vis \u00e0 vis ADAT Almost all survey respondents had experience with the ADAT package of tools. Over half of survey respondents (58%, n=22) reporting more than three years of experience, 16% (n=6) reported less than a year of experience and 18% (n=7) reported between 1 and 3 years of experience. Only 8% (n=3) of survey respondents reported never using the ADAT. Survey respondents were also asked to rate their level of satisfaction with the ADAT package for the purposes of assessment and treatment planning. Of the 35 respondents who provided a rating (three did not), the majority (69%) reported being either 'Satisfied' or 'Very satisfied'. Table 9 presents all ratings for this question. Table 9. Rating of ADAT package for the purposes of assessment and treatment planning Rating N % Very satisfied 2 5.7 Satisfied 22 62.9 Neither satisfied or dissatisfied 9 25.7 Dissatisfied 1 2.9 Very dissatisfied 1 2.9 Total 35 100.1 Note: Percentages do not total 100 due to rounding Several themes emerged related to the relative strengths and weaknesses of the GAIN Q3MI in relation to the ADAT. With respect to strengths, the GAINQ3 was valued for its 78 standardization and provision of objective information (8); and was felt to be generally more clinically comprehensive (6; these two strengths were also reinforced during focus group discussions at two pilot sites). Six respondents noted that the GAINQ3MI better informs treatment planning and four respondents valued the report generated following administration of the instrument (the Q3 Recommendations and Referral Summary). Three respondents felt that the GAINQ3MI is easier to administer and three valued the reasons and readiness to change questions (the MI questions). Only one respondent specifically noted the value add of the stepped approach to screening and assessment. With respect to weaknesses, six respondents felt that the GAINQ3 was missing some relevant clinical information, most notably substance use history (see also early section regarding GAINQ3 MI) and, to a lesser extent, medical history. Five respondents noted concerns around the GAINQ3MI interfering with clinical rapport (also noted as a concern during focus group discussions at one pilot site, but with the caveat that this concern may be offset by having some flexibility around when to administer ), and related to this latter point, three respondents felt that the GAINQ3 was too long, particularly when administering early in the clinical relationship. Three respondents felt that the report was unwieldy. During focus group discussions at one pilot site, a clinician noted the value of the graphical reports that can be produced from the ADAT assessment instruments. These were felt to be particularly important in conveying assessment results to clients and as a tool for motivating clients to change. The GAIN Local Trainers reminded the group that there are other clinical reports that can be generated in ABS but that were not available for the purposes of the pilot (i.e., the Integrated Clinical Profile and the Personal Feedback Report) which also provide these graphical summaries. The Personal Feedback Report in particular is meant to be used specifically as a motivational interviewing tool to move a client along the continuum of change toward action. It was also noted that an additional benefit of these reports is that it integrates assessment information about a range of different biopsychosocial domains (as opposed to the ADAT tools where each instrument is generally specific to one biopsychosocial domain). 79 6.0 DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS This project, one of several initiated under the umbrella of Ontario's DTFP portfolio, set out to assess the acceptability and utility of a new common package of screening and assessment tools and procedures for addictions treatment services in Ontario. The selection and pilot testing of these various screening and assessment tools was to culminate in a set of recommendations to refresh or replace the current set of tools, known as ADAT. The project built upon considerable work done by the Project Leader and colleagues at CAMH for the Ontario Ministry of Health and LongTerm Care over the past several years and, in particular, an evaluation of the ADAT tools and related processes (Rush & Martin, 2006). This evaluation called for a refresh or, if needed, a full replacement of the ADAT tools based on key results (e.g., completion of the tools had become an administrative process to facilitate admission to residential treatment and sometimes after admission to the program, as well as the high variability in their application in assessment processes across the province. Going forward in the present project we were cognizant that many programs and clinicians in Ontario have used ADAT quite appropriately to facilitate treatment planning and differential referral to various levels of care. To that end, we entered the project expecting to retain the strong features of ADAT, such as the coverage of multiple domains and the focus on decisionmaking with the assessment information, while seeking to update the tools themselves with a more integrated package and more current well validated instruments. In addition to building upon this previous evaluation of ADAT the design of the present project was heavily influenced by recent trends in the area of client assessment, namely to consider a Staged approach that includes two levels of screening and two levels of assessment (i.e., placement versus modality matching). New work has also reinforced the close relationship of screening and assessment to recovery monitoring, the latter being the subject of a related project and project report (rush et al., 2013b). In the present project we engaged five Ontario sites in the pilot testing of this staged approach, beginning with the brief GAINSS and followed by one of three more comprehensive tools (PDSQ, MMS or the POSIT (for youth)), and then 80 followed by the GAINQ3 MI, which is intended for placement matching. Multiple types of feedback were received from agency representatives using the various tools including log books during implementation, an online survey and focus group discussions. Before summarizing the feedback it is important to note the main limitations of the study when interpreting the results, and considering the project recommendations. The main limitations are: The tools were not administered under \"routine\" conditions since the project required several special procedures, some related to the parallel outcome project (e.g., lengthy consent form for followup and provision of detailed locator information) and other procedures related to this project specifically (e.g., parallel administration of the ADAT tools for comparison purposes; the newness of the screening and assessment tools to the clinicians; challenges with the software). Related to the above is the selfselection of clients into the study, with a resulting sample that is somewhat older, more stable and less severe than the total population of the pilot agencies or the client population in community treatment services across the province. While this may have affected such indicators as completion time we were still able to secure participation from a large and varied clientele. The lack of a residential treatment service having residential withdrawal management service among the pilot agencies and only one youth service with a strong outreach component. That being said, we were able to pilot test the tools and processes in many different locales and service delivery situations, each with their unique populations and agency processes. Many of the pilot agencies have a history of participating in provincial system design projects, have staff that are well informed and experience users of ADAT including the decision tree for client placement and, in general, are experienced in the use of evidencebased practices. Thus, their feedback may not be representative of that to be obtained in wider piloting and implementation efforts. With these limitations in mind we offer the following summary conclusions about the pilot testing of this suite of screening and assessment tools. As noted earlier some of the feedback is 81 about the new tools and processes as well as their perceived value or (or loss) compared to the ADAT tools and related processes. We conclude with recommendations going forward and next steps. 6.1 FEEDBACK ABOUT THE NEW TOOLS AND PROCESSES: Overall the feedback was very positive about the staged approach to screening and assessment. This was seen as an efficient way to proceed through a screening process (i.e. longer tools held in reserve until needed) and provided good coverage of both substance use and mental health issues. The strength of the information on mental health in particular was highly valued and improved referrals to required services. The staged approach was also seen as well linked conceptually to both treatment planning and subsequent recovery monitoring. Challenges noted with the overall staged approach were the perceived redundancy in some of the tools (e.g., the GAIN SS and the GAINQ3 which includes the screening items as well) and the need for a well established response protocol to be in place so as to facilitate concrete referrals and followup. When we look at the overall completion times of the tools we see they are in the range expected and appropriate for the various components of the staged approach. The GAIN SS took about 8 minutes on average (slightly longer than reported by the test developers) but this improves with experience in administration. The follow up PDSQ took on average about 18 minutes ( about the same as advertised) and was seen as comprehensive, easy to score and useful. The Modified Mini Screener (MMS) took much less time (about 6 minutes on average) and was also positively viewed in terms of supporting mental health followup and referrals. The main limitation reported with the MMS was in the wording (many conditions lumped together) and the skip patterns that were said to be confusing for some clients. We did not receive much feedback on the use of the POSIT with younger clients other than an overriding concern that with youth in particular the use of structured screening tools can negatively impact building rapport with those presenting for help. 82 With respect to the GAINQ3 MI the completion time was about 60 minutes although we feel this was influenced considerably by the newness of the tool as well as challenges with the ABS computer system. That said, it is not unreasonable to expect an assessment process for the purpose of \"placement matching\" to be in this range of completion time and, with larger scale implementation and appropriate training and technical supports, completion times for the GAINQ3 would be expected in the 45 minute range, on average. Overall the feedback on the tool emphasized the comprehensiveness and high quality of the information, the value of the many reports being generated and the close relationship of the information and reports to individualized treatment planning. It is particularly noteworthy that the two sites with the most clients recruited for the project, and therefore the most experienced with the GAINQ3 have chosen to continue the use of the staged protocol and the Q3 after the pilot testing was over. The reasons cited for continuing included the high quality of the information and its perceived value in advocating for funding and for services for clients, in particular mental health services for clients with cooccurring disorders. In contrasting the staged screening tools and the GAINQ3 with the ADAT the new suite was said to be more comprehensive and leading to better treatment plans. The GAInQ3 in particular was said to cover many critical areas and all in one integrated package of subscales compared to the package of separate tools that was put together for ADAT. Using a set of separate tools was a conscious decision at the time ADAT was developed as there was not a low cost integrated package available at the time, This has since changed and the GAIN suite of tools is the best example of this new development, hence its choice for pilot testing in the first place. Importantly, the group of clinicians providing feedback on the new tools were overall reasonably satisfied with ADAT, having been welltrained and committed to its proper use for some time. However, advantages were still cited for the new suite of tool, including the GAIN Q3, as well as some limitations noted below for further consideration. The main perceived loss in the new suite of tools compared to ADAT was the detailed substance use history and current patterns of use provided by the Drug History Questionnaire. 83 However, rather than arguing for continuation of the DHQ the feedback was to incorporate the detailed substance use questions in other GAINrelated tools (known as the \"substance use grids). This has now been accomplished in postpilot revisions (see below). Another significant concern expressed by one of the pilot agencies was the requirement that the GAINQ3 be clinician as opposed to selfadministered, and therefore not appropriate for group intake. This challenge was also noted in the independent thirdparty evaluation of the Ontario DTFP initiative. The challenge with group intake was seen as increasing the overall length of the screening and assessment process to the point where it would impact waiting time (which had been eliminated completely in this one agency). While each pilot agency found their own way to incorporate the various tools in the staged approach this concern about potential increase in waiting time is very important and calls for further exploration of how the GAINQ3 can be administered in a selfcompletion format. This work has begun (see below). Significant concerns were also expressed about the underlying computer application that \"drives\" the GAIN tools (known as the ABS) and we were challenged in the early stage of the project with the functioning of this application. This did get sorted out, however, and the anticipated upgrade to the Catalyst software that links the ABS system will lead to even greater functionality. The last significant concern expressed by some clinicians in the pilot testing process was the challenges in the use of the tools in the process of engagement and building rapport with the client, in particular with youth. This important concern is often made with respect to any structured screening tools and is not unique to the present project. Going forward, however, it will be critical to acknowledge the flexibility required in the timing of the administration of the tools, the need to possibly avoid some topic areas until a relationship is established (e.g., past trauma), and requirements for training on how to deliver the various questions in a way that is motivating for the client and which contributes to the building of a therapeutic relationship and be useful for treatment and support planning. Post pilot revisions to the GAINQ3 and the 84 administration software allow for a more modularized approach to test administration and this should add more flexibility to the scope and timing of the administration of various components of the staged screening and assessment protocol. One important issue that requires further consideration with respect to flexibility needed in the staged model is the valueadd of the GAIN -SS in certain situations. The GAINSS does an excellent job at identifying substance use concerns as well as mental health challenges and those in the area of crime and violence. Since we were piloting the GAINSS in the context of specialized substance use treatment services the items in the subscale on substance use are somewhat redundant except perhaps as baseline measures for outcome monitoring. With respect to the subscales on mental health we used the cutoff on the Internalizing Disorder subscale to determine the subsequent administration of the PDSQ or the MMS. However, given the high prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the substance use treatment population almost all clients screened with this subscale in the pilot agencies hit the cutoff score to go to the next level of screening (91% hit the cutoff of two or more positive items on the 5 point subscale, and 83% hit the cutpoint of 3 or more. In this situation one might question the valueadd of the GAINSS and this will be the subject of further discussion in subsequent work with key stakeholders with the staged protocol. Feedback obtained in other projects has highlighted the value of having a \"common tool\" across mental health and addiction agencies in order to have a common language and facilitate cross referrals and also to support treatment system planning and evaluation. Thus, even if there is some redundancy in the staged approach in substance use agencies using the GAINSS mental health subscales there may still be good reason to use the tool in the staged model. Also, its important to note that the items in the GAINSS are also embedded in the longer GAINQ3 and these items in the GAINQ3 can be populated automatically when the GAINSS is completed, therefore reducing duplication. Alternatively, some agencies may wish to skip the initial GAINSS and go directly to the PDSQ/MMS and the GAINQ3. It will be important to be flexible in the application of the details in the staged approach. 85 Lastly, one very positive aspect of the suite of tools that were piloted as potential replacements for the ADAT package are their suitability for subsequent outcome monitoring. This was a high priority in the selection of the tools and we consciously linked this project to the testing of the feasibility of an outcome monitoring system for Ontario's addiction agencies (Rush et al., 2013b). Feedback obtained in the piloting of the baseline measures in the staged protocol, in particular the GAINQ3 MI, did not address this specifically as it was the subject of the other project. The advantage of the GAINQ3 MI in delivering a valid set of baseline measures for outcome monitoring. It needs to be acknowledged here, since it's a major factor in the subsequent decisionmaking process around provincial implementation of the new suite of tools. 6.2 RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS Key functions with regards to intake, assessment, referral, and service planning for individual clients necessitate common forms, programs, and/or procedures to completing these tasks so that they are consistent across the province. As stated in the Select Committee (2010: 8) Final Report regarding assessment \"provincially applied, evidence based, agencyappropriate assessment and screening tools are necessary to ensure consistency...all primary care providers and relevant staff have access to common, age appropriate, evidence based assessment and screening tools.\" This has been the essential focus of this project. Based on the feedback obtained in the pilot work with the staged approach to screening and assessment, and the specific tools under consideration, the Program Advisory Committee and the Working Group for this project endorsed a recommendation from the project team to move forward and replace the ADAT package with this new suite of tools. Importantly, the recommendation is for the development of an implementation plan that would concretely move things forward, engage the key stakeholders and opinion leaders and identify facilitating factors and challenges in implementation and resource requirements to launch and sustain the new common screening and assessment package for Ontario's addiction agencies. This recommendation for the development of the implementation plan has been made to the 86 MOHLTC and resources are currently available to enact this recommendation in the 201314 renewal of the Ontario DTFP portfolio. As additional resources will be required for going from the implementation plan to provincial dissemination, and because there are many intersecting pieces at the system level to consider, a decision on going forward with the implementation plan is still forthcoming as of this writing. However, it is expected to move forward and, to that end, work continues on several fronts to support the implementation process that undoubtedly lies ahead. Implementation of this new suite of common screening and assessment tools will bring the following anticipated benefits: Better individualized treatment planning and more appropriate placement of the client in the required level of care. In particular it is anticipated that this will be a stronger resource for supporting people with concurrent disorders. This, in turn, is intended to improve client outcomes. Ability to generate automated reports via electronic platform (ABS system) Higher quality data for program planning, accountability and research purposes from stateoftheart, standardized instruments whose validity and reliability are well established through extensive research. These data will be housed in Ontario. Potential for linkage with outcome monitoring tools, including data embedded in the GAINQ3 MI including outcome, that calculates cost savings resulting from treatment. Compatibility with the GAINSS used in many other sectors and which is anticipated for broader provincial, and possibly national, implementation. Low cost of annual licensure and training relative to ADAT and infrastructure (e.g., instrument development and ABS system) already in place with DTFP funding Potential for benchmarking, particularly via partnerships with other Canadian jurisdictions and benefiting from a substantial existing database of GAIN end users. 87 In support of the eventual adoption of the new suite of tools and processes the following work has been completed or is in process. 6.2.1 Clarification and Recommendations for Training Requirements The GAINQ3 is a standardized instrument -therefore formal training and certification will be recommended as part of provincial rollout. It is proposed that a trainthetrainer model be adopted. Under this model, 12 staff from each agency would receive training and certification to the Local Trainer level, via a distance course provided directly from Chestnut Health Systems. These trainers can then train all other staff at their agency. Costs will include14: Local Trainer Training and Certification: $1500/person* Indirect costs associated with staff backfill for local training (est. 6 hours/staff). GAINQ3 5year license: $100/agency (included in cost of training) GAIN ABS Provincial License: $10,000/year Other recommendations based on the experience of the pilot agencies and corresponding staff include: Training must to incorporate strategies on how to handle reactions to sensitive questions (e.g., questions related to sexual practices, risk behaviours, etc.); use of margin notes; Training needs to better emphasize how to generate and edit GRRS reports and use of validity reports; the need to edit reports in particular needs to be emphasized Incorporate specific training related to how to engage youth and contextualize their responses (e.g., responses to trauma questions) The Clinical Interpretation Training module should be required and would influence cost estimates of training as indicated above. 14 It is important to note that the current ADAT system continues to incur ongoing costs such as the provincial licence for the BASIS 32 and maintenance costs for TREAT the electronic database that houses the ADAT tools. 88 6.2.2 Revisions to the GAINSS and GAIN Q3: Revision that have been made or are underway based on pilot feedback and in discussion with the Project Working Group include the following: GAINSS Revisions: Some initiated by the developer of the GAINSS, Chestnut Health Systems: additional response item to be consistent with the GAINI; three new items (one pulled in from the additional CAMH modified questions); new version to be launched into Ontario ABS System this fiscal year; to be revalidated; cutoffs to remain the same. GAINQ3 (MI and Standard) Revisions: subgroup convened to review feedback from pilot sites and general recommended revisions to include: additional changes to reflect Canadian context (e.g. military section); separate out trauma from risk behaviours; adjust language to better engage clients; supplement with additional questions regarding substance use history (e.g., GAINI SU grids); also explore the possibility of generating other GAIN summary reports in ABS (e.g., MI report). French translation of the tools and related reports. Reports incorporate clinical reports: Personalized Feedback Report (PFR) and Individual Clinical Profile (ICP). Include consultation with First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit on the potential for cultural adaptation of screening, assessment and outcomeoriented tools, which was recommended following the Health Canada's Drug Treatment Funding Program Screening and Assessment and Client Satisfaction projects. 89 6.2.3 Implementation Strategies The third party evaluation of the provincial DTFP initiative highlighted that this project is one of a number of the DTFP projects with the potential to bring innovations in evidence informed practice for addictions treatment within Ontario. They noted that it is important that whatever changes are made on the basis of this work that they \"lead to measurable improvements in client outcomes as the relationship between evidenceinformed practice and improvements in outcomes should not be assumed \" (Sridharan et al., 2013, p. 85). As the intent of the Ontario DTFP is that the project specific innovations can be scaled up and spread throughout the addictions system, the external evaluation report also emphasized that there needs to be greater conceptual and operational clarity around the roles that different actors, like MOHLTC, will play in spreading innovations from the project level to the systems level. It was also recommended by the evaluators that a broader dialogue, led by the MOHLTC, take place on what it will take to facilitate this cultural shift and the types of support systems that would be needed to ensure effective implementation and sustainability. Based on this evaluation work it was found that it is currently unclear how to implement evidence informed guidelines and tools across all the agencies in Ontario as none of the actors presently working in addictions were able to provide an agreedupon explanation of how to get agencies to use these new resources. In the case of MOHLTC, there were concerns about compliance decreasing with mandating the use of tools. In the case of the LHINs, each LHIN has the ability to determine their own interest in implementing the tools and processes pilot tested in this project. Moving forward, it is essential that discussions between key stakeholders take place to elucidate how learning from this and other DTFP projects can be implemented at a system level. While the MOHLTC needs to take the lead in framing this dialogue, the LHINs and the project team will also need to be involved. To ensure effective implementation and achievement of these outcomes it will be important that \"spread\" of new innovations, including the package of screening and assessment tools, be informed by evidenceinformed models of implementation that emphasize a staged approach to implementation that goes beyond oneoff, didactic training. 90 Implementation strategies should include, for example, assessment of organizational readiness, key \"levers\" that facilitate implementation as well as identified challenges and specific goal setting (Fixsen et al., 2005). In short, future implementation must be based on much more than the oneoff training that characterized the provincial implementation of the ADAT several years ago and which led to considerable variations in the quality in the actual use of the tools and decisionmaking protocols for client placement (Rush & Martin, 2006). An initial implementation team has been developed in CAMH based on the principles of implementation science and which will begin its systemwide implementation work with the client and family Perception of Care tool developed through another of the Ontario DTFP projects (Rush et al., 2013c). This team will be a helpful resource for the eventual implementation of the tools and processes for improved screening and assessment. That said, it will be critical to retain a strong role for the research team and key provincial opinion leaders and stakeholders from past work on ADAT and the pilot testing since they hold essential content knowledge needed for credible training and support for implementation. There will no doubt be many challenges ahead in replacing the current, outdated set of ADAT tools with a new suite of tools based on the current project. Despite the many challenges ahead the way forward has been signalled by the results of this pilot work and in concert with the outcome monitoring project (Rush et al., 2013b). It is clearly time to \"refresh\" ADAT, while retaining its strong features such as the decisionmaking protocol for client placement. This work must be carefully integrated with several other provincial processes include ongoing implementation of the OCAN and other tools such as the RAIMH in mental health agencies, related work on the Integrated Assessment Record, and making the tools work in the context of central access models. A comprehensive evaluation plan will be required that assesses implementation processes and outcomes at multiple levels (client, clinician, program and system). 91 To conclude, it is valuable to note the implications of NOT acting on the results of the pilot work reported on here, and in parallel with the recovery monitoring project. These implications include: the continued lack of uptodate, evidence based screening and assessment tools in the province which then results in poor decisionmaking for client placement and, therefore, inappropriate and inefficient use of our current resources that depend on proper client placement. together with the lack of outcome data, there will remain a lack of information by which to create an Ontariobased business case for investment in our addiction services. a significant missed opportunity to use Federal DTFP funding for moving forward with a stakeholder informed implementation plan in this fiscal year. Clearly there are significant implications of not moving this work forward past the pilot stage and into implementation planning. 92 REFERENCES Alexander, M.J., Haugland, G., Lin, S.P., Bertollo, D.N. and McCorry, F.A.

New standardi zed assessment procedures were introduced in 2001 for use with all clients enteri ng the addictions treatment syst em in Ontario and were later evaluated in 2006. This project will address the recommendations from this evaluation, as well as the best available evidence regarding screening and assessment for substance use to develop and implement a revised protocol for standardized assessment in substance use treatment agencies across Ontario. Client recovery monitoring is an important pa rt of assessing the performance of the Ontario substance use treatment system and of planning enhancements to improve treatment quality and build capacity. A report commissioned by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC) recommended the adoption of a specific model of client recovery monitoring as part of a more comprehensive system of outcome monitoring for addiction treatment services in Ontario. The recommended model combines within-treatment assessment of client progress with post-treatment follow-up procedures that include provisions for linki ng clients back into treatment when their follow-up results suggest th e need for further treatment. This project will develop and pilot an evidence-based protoc ol for recovery monitoring based on the recommended model to determine the feasibility of implementing a recovery monitoring system for Ontario. Overall, the results are expected to make an impor tant contribution to Canada's National Treatment Strategy.

Construct Validity: Strong correlations were found between mean scale scores and the child's age for both functional skills scale and caregiver assistance scales Discriminant Validity - It was determined that the PEDI Modifications and Functional Skills Scales are better able to predict group status than the BDIST with p-values ranging from p<0.001 to p=0.38. Part I: skills rated as 0 (unable, or limited in capability, to perform the skill) or 1 (able to perform the skill, or beyond the level). Part II: functional activities rated on a scale between 0 (total assistance) and 5 (independent). Part III: functional activities rated as N (no modification), C (child-oriented modifications), R (rehabilitation equipment), or E (extensive modifications). PEDI: currently in general judgment, and a combination of methods Depends, but on average 20-30 minutes when administered by experienced physical therapists on a child whom with they are familiar with to 45- 60 minutes when administered by a structured parent interview. Gain Appraisal of Individual need - Quick (GAIN-Q and GAIN- QM) Designed for use by personnel in diverse settings (e.g., Employee Assistance Programs, Student Assistance Programs, health clinics, juvenile justice, criminal justice, etc.) Adolescents (12-18 yrs) and adults GAIN-ABS (Assessme nt Building System) Moderate to high internal consistency (adolescents: =0.91, adults: =0.94) summative scales show strong associations with logically related variables; evidence of predictive validity 11 pages in length; most questions are yes/no format and questions of recency of problems in each domain Past 12 months and Past 90 days GAIN-Q Core: 10 sections: 1.

Adolescents (12-18 yrs) and adults CAT (Computeri- zed Adaptive Test) Good internal consistency ( > 0.85 in numerous outcome monitoring studies) Good face validity; need data on construct and predictive validity Need to take caution when comparing scores between adolescents and adults (<18 vs 26+) due to difference in levels of endorsement on different symptoms. Adjustment is needed to compare data between two groups. 16 Item 4-point Likert Scale Assess 'recency' of symptoms of substance related problems. 7 items based on DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence; 4 items for substance abuse; 2 items for substance- induced disorders; 3 items for lower severity symptoms commonly used in screeners. Only the first 11 items were used in diagnosis. Triage categories based on level of substance use: Low: 0 symptom; Moderate: 1-9; High: 10-16 (clients at moderate/high levels are typically placed into more intensive levels of care such as intensive outpatient, residential) Dependence questions linked to need of residential treatment using American society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM)'s placement criteria. Linked to Tx plan using Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) potentially increases efficiency in treatment assignment with little loss of construct validity English interview Screening assessment and possible during and after treatment The computerized version requires training, practice, and supervision; Attaining certification in GAIN-Q administration requires that the interviewer (and initially, the site's local trainer) develops a skill set that meets the criteria for competence.

The information collected will be used only to identify and address problems that you may want assistance with and to help us evaluate our own services. Format : This assessment has questions about what has been going on in your life across a wide range of areas, including your physical and mental health, stress and risk behaviours, and life satisfaction. You will be able to say you do not know or refuse to answer any question that you do NOT want to answer. Length : Depending on how much has been going on in your life, it will take about 20-45 minutes to complete. You will be able to take a break if you need to. Privacy and Confidentiality : Your answers are private. All research and clinical staff who have access to your answers understand this restriction and have agreed not to share your specific answers without your prior written consent. This includes giving information to family members, other individuals, other treatment agencies, social work agencies, criminal justice agencies and other agencies. There are, however, two exceptions. First, we are mandated to report child abuse or if you are presently a danger to yourself or others. Second, officials from the federal government have the right to audit us to check to make sure we have protected your safety and accurately reported what we have done. Any questions?Copyright \u00a9 2000-2012 by Chestnut Health 1 05/03/2012 112A3. Timeframe Anchoring Several questions will ask you about things that have happened during the past 90 days . To help you remember this time period, please look at the calendar. First, let's find today's date and circle it. Next, count back 13 weeks to about 90 days ago and circle that date. Do you recall anything that was going on about (DATE 90 DAYS AGO)? (PROBE FOR SPECIFIC EVENT. IF UNABLE TO RECALL : Do you remember any birthdays, holidays, sporting or other special events that happened around (DATE 90 DAYS AGO)? Did anything change in terms of where you were living, who you were with, whether you were in treatment, work, school or jail? Where were you living then? Were you in treatment, working, in school, or involved with the law then?) A3a1. Record anchor for 90 days: v.

Additional Administration Instructions As we go through the questionnaire, I will read the questions and record your answers. It is important that you try to answer each question if you can and are willing to. You may not always know the exact answer, but I would like you to give me your best guess if you can. You can also tell me if you simply do not know or if you do not want to or refuse to answer any questions. I also have some cards here that we will use to help answer some of the questions.

Survey Page #1 Dear DTFP SARM Clinicians/Participants, Thank you all very much for your participation in the Screening, Assessment and Recovery Monitoring project. We are very appreciative of all the time and effort that you have put into this project over the past few months. As you know, the purpose of this study is two-fold: 1) to assess the acceptability and utility of a new, common package of screening and assessment tools and procedures for addictions treatment services in Ontario; and 2) to examine the feasibility of implementing common within-treatment outcome measures and post-intake follow-up procedures. In order for us to evaluate the feasibility of the various aspects of the project and the potential usefulness of the results for decision-makers and front-line clinical staff, we ask that you take some time to complete the following survey.

As you know, the idea of the GAIN-SS_CAMH-modified as a Stage 1 screener is to quickly determine whether there is enough reason to look deeper into the possibility that a client, who presents with a substance abuse problem, may also have a mental disorder. The Stage 2 screener (MMS, PDSQ or POSIT) allows clinicians to further explore this possibility.
