These are often the communities that have also experienced a disproportionate number of COVID deaths and severe illness. Community Vaccine Sites The New Orleans Health Department and its partners are bringing vaccines to neighborhoods with indicators of high social vulnerability and COVID deaths. To date, community vaccine events have been hosted in Central City, Gert Town, the Seventh Ward, Gentilly, the Lower Ninth Ward, New Orleans East, and on the West Bank. Homebound Vaccine Program New Orleans Emergency Medical Services is providing vaccine at the homes of residents who, due to a mobility or medical need, cannot otherwise access a vaccine site. Equity & Communications Working Group Starting in November, a group of community, faith, and public health leaders have been meeting biweekly to discuss vaccine equity in Orleans Parish. This group has identified community vaccine sites, spokespeople for the Sleeves Up NOLA campaign, and opportunities to reach New Orleans' vulnerable community members with vaccine information. Targeted Community Outreach The Mayor's Neighborhood Engagement Office and NOLA Ready outreach staff have hosted dozens of virtual outreach events informing community groups about vaccine development, safety, and administration. Through these events, we've been able to answer frequently asked questions directly by trusted local doctors and community leaders. Want to host an outreach event? Contact [neighborhoods@nola.gov](mailto:neighborhoods@nola.gov?subject=Vaccine%20Outreach%20Event%20Request). Canvassing The NOLA Ready outreach team is leading a canvassing effort to go door to door in neighborhoods to provide vaccine and appointment information to residents. With the help of Resilience Force, the Krewe of Harmonia, New Orleans Resources for Independent Living, and others, we've distributed nearly 10,000 door hangers in neighborhoods across the city.

Citywide Waitlist Early on in the vaccine rollout when vaccine supply was limited, the New Orleans Health Department and 3-1-1 operated a Citywide Vaccine Waitlist to help connect eligible residents to various vaccine sites across the city. This was in an effort to help residents navigate a disconnected healthcare system and allow multiple providers to contact eligible patients when appointments were available or there were extra doses at the end of the day.
