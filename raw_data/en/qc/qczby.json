Their job is to help the 12% of the U.S. population suffering with significant hearing loss. What can a Hearing Aid Specialist do for me? At Sam's Club, our hearing aid specialists use a computer-controlled audiometer to complete a screening and state-of-the-art testing equipment to do a thorough examination of the external ear, ear canal and ear drum. Hearing tests can be done on patients 19 years of age and older; annual follow-up screenings are free. Based on the screening results, the hearing aid specialist will recommend the device that will best suit the patient's needs. This could mean a hearing aid (for a patient with hearing loss) or personal sound amplification products (for patients seeking special amplification in applications like hunting, bird watching or lectures). The hearing aid specialist also refers members to a physician if their hearing loss indicates a potential medical problem. Hearing aid specialists can provide education on the proper use and care of products as well as offering free programming of, and adjustments to, hearing aids. While patients are shopping, specialists can even provide quick cleanings and adjustments to help extend the life of hearing aids.
