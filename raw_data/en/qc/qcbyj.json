I developed psoriasis when I was about 11. My main problems are in my knees and pelvis but recently I have started to feel more and more pain in my wrists and ankles. I am currently injecting 15mg of methotrexate a week, taking tramadol at night and 150mg of diclofenac a day. I feel like things are getting worse. My doctor suggested switching the diclofenac to celebrex but I'm not sure that's the best solution. I've been on methotrexate for six months - at first it was working really well but now my periods of stiffness in the morning are much worse and I'm constantly in some kind of discomfort. Can anyone suggest anything? I feel unable to tackle my rheumatologist who seems to think I should just plod along as I am. Psoriatic Arthritis Q & A [Psoriatic Arthritis Treatment, Nail Disease, and Natural Remedies](https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/ask-the-expert/psoriatic-arthritis-treatment-nail-disease-and-natural-remedies/) HI, I HAVE HAD SEVERE PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS FOR THE PAST 6 YEARS. IT HAS CAUSED ME TO LOSE MY TOE AND FINGER NAILS AND SEVERE JOINT DETERIORATION. I WAS ON METHOTREXATE FOR A LONG PERIOD WITH NO SUCCESS AND THEN ON TO ARAVA COMBINED WITH STERIODS AND ANTI INFLAMATORIES. 12 MONTHS AGO I WENT OFF ALL DRUGS AS THEY WERE NOT PUTTING MY ARTHRITIS INTO REMISSION. MY PAIN LEVELS ARE CHRONIC AND I WOULD LIKE TO FIND NATURAL THERAPIES TO TRY AND PUT MY ARTHRITIS INTO REMISSION. I AM DESPERATE. [Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Symptoms](https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/ask-the-expert/psoriasis-and-psoriatic-arthritis-symptoms/) I have severe psoriatic arthritis, I have tried remicade, humira, and enbrel with no avail. I broke out like chicken pox/measles when I took humuria and let it work out of my system. My face is now breaking out, especially around my eyes, massive scalp yeck, and losing tons of hair. I am over 50, and never had this problem in my younger years. It is getting worse year after year. Is there no help? [Stopping Methotrexate](https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/ask-the-expert/stopping-methotrexate/) Have been on methotrexate 20mg (8/@2.5mg) for about a year and 1/2. Recently moved and have a new Rheumatoligist who did his own blood test and x-rays, according to him he cannot find the blood factor or damage to any joints to prove that I have RA. I would like to know can I stop taking methotrexate or do I have to ween off of it slowly? Or should I even be thinking of stopping the meds? I have not had the pain or stiffness like I use to in about 2 months. For 3 months I have been seperated from my husband, a very bad situation that I was in for 12 years. I have been reading up on stress and what that can cause and do to a person. My body feels so much better, what do you make of this? Thank you, Loretta [Are pneumonia vaccinations recommended for patients on biologics?](https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/ask-the-expert/are-pneumonia-vaccinations-recommended-for-patients-on-biologics/) I am currently on enbrel and methotrexate for my psoriatic arthritis. I see that flu shots are recommended for those on biologics. My question, are pnuemonia vaccines also recommended? Two years prior to my PA diagnosis I had a bad case of bronchial pnuemonia and now have a mild case of asma. [Proper subcutaneous injection technique](https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/ask-the-expert/proper-subcutaneous-injection-technique/) I did an experiment, I am on enbrel for 3 months now and was getting a reaction at the site each time, so for 4 injections I pressed the auto injector down into my thigh a bit harder and notiiced no reaction at the site, it bled a little but that was all. So this past week I let up and did it with a lighter pressure and low and behold got a reaction. My question is do you think when it goes in a bit deeper it keeps it from pooling in the upper dermis and irratating the surrounding tissue? "}
