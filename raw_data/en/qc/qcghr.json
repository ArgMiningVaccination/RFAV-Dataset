Measles causes a cough and rash that lasts for about 14 days. Mumps causes painful swelling of the salivary glands as well as fever and headache. Rubella, also known as German measles, is usually characterized by a mild rash and flu-like symptoms. In rare cases, measles, mumps, and rubella can all be fatal, and rubella is also linked to pregnancy complications, including stillbirth. All three diseases have been declared eradicated in the United States due to the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine is usually given to children in two doses\u2014once between the ages of 12 months and 15 months and once between 4 years and 6 years. The vaccine provides lifelong protection from measles, mumps, and rubella. The adults who don't have immunity through vaccination or through prior infection can also get the MMR vaccine. Read on to learn more about the MMR vaccine for adults, including the recommended schedule and possible side effects. TEK IMAGE / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY / Getty Images Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Measles, mumps, and rubella were once common childhood illnesses, but they have been largely eradicated in the United States through the use of the MMR vaccine. The vaccine has been available since 1971. Still, occasional infections from these viruses do occur in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Also, cases have been rising in recent years due to people not vaccinating their children with the MMR vaccine. Since these diseases are still around, it's important to recognize the symptoms and seek medical attention if you believe you're infected. Measles The symptoms of measles include: Fever that starts low and increases daily, reaching 104 degrees or higher by the fifth dayDry coughCongestionConjunctivitisSmall, white spots with a red background (known as Koplik's spots) inside the mouthA red, itchy, blotchy rash that starts at the hairline about three to five days after the beginning of illness and spreads down the body Mumps The symptoms of mumps appear as long as 25 days after exposure to the virus. They include: Fever that starts low and climbs to around 103 degreesHeadachePain and tenderness while chewing or swallowingMuscle aches and fatigue Rarely, mumps can also cause vomiting, abdominal pain, and neck pain. Rubella Rubella is generally a very mild illness, but it can be very serious for pregnant people. The symptoms of rubella include: A rash that begins on the face and moves down the bodyMild flu-like symptoms that appear before the rashConjunctivitis MMR Vaccine for Adults The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the adult MMR vaccine for people who didn't get vaccinated as children or who don't have natural immunity after infection. If you didn't get the MMR vaccine as a child or are unsure if you got the vaccine, talk to your healthcare provider about whether you should be vaccinated as an adult. There are two MMR vaccines available in the United States: M-M-R II and Priorix. Schedule Most adults need only one dose of the MMR vaccine. However, two doses given 28 days apart are recommended for people who are at higher risk for measles, mumps, or rubella, including: Students living in a dorm or other community settingHealthcare workersPeople traveling internationally Side Effects It's common to experience some mild side effects after vaccination. The side effects of the MMR vaccine for adults include: A sore arm at the injection siteSwelling in the cheeks or neck, and pain or stiffness in the joints (more common in women) Who Should Not Get the Vaccine Most adults who haven't had the MMR vaccine should get one. However, people born before 1957 likely don't need the vaccine, since almost everyone was infected with these illnesses as children and therefore have immunity. The MMR vaccine can have serious side effects for some people. You should talk to your healthcare provider about whether to get the MMR vaccine if you: Have life-threatening allergies or a history of serious vaccine reactionsHave a weakened immune system or a parent or sibling with a weakened immune systemHave conditions that cause you to bleed or bruise easily or have had a blood transfusion recentlyHave tuberculosisAre considering getting pregnant.
