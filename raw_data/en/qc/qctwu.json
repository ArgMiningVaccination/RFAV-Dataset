Over the years, an emphasis has been placed on blood, tissue and imaging markers of outcome, radiotherapy (RT) dose escalation, RT fractionation, use and length of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), small molecule/gene/viral vector targeted therapy, immunomodulation combined with radiotherapy and health disparities in men with African and Hispanic/Latino ancestry. A particular interest is to apply quantitative prostate imaging, genomic (radiogenomic) and liquid biopsy methods to better assess risk in consideration of whether to biopsy initially, manage with surveillance, or treat, and the intensity of treatment.
