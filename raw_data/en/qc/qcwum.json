Open to the general public, this evening will offer people unable to go to Los Angeles a chance to see and hear details of the exhibit, and it will enrich the tour for people going to the exhibit. The evening will consist of a slide presentation by Pat Nahum on the \"objects of art\" in the King Tut Exhibit, followed by slides and a talk by Stephen Brezzo of the Fine Arts Gallery in Balboa Park. Mr. Brezzo will talk on art from King Tut to the contemporary. Refreshments will conclude this stimulating and informative evening which is free and will begin promptly at 8 PM. Fresh Produce Stands In spring a cook's fancy turns to fresh vegetables and fruits. Here we will attempt to list some of the vegetable stands familiar to the Bear Facts staff. For a bird's-eye\u00ad view of fresh produce, the Newcomers are planning their annual Country Outing - complete with a fresh herb garden, mushroom farm, egg ranch, and Bates Nut Farm. All Oceanids are cordially invited to join Newcomers on this fun excursion, May 12. Call Alma Coles, 453-8813, if you're in\u00ad terested. And now for the produce stands: Rancho Santa Fe -(Chinos) Japanese Vegetable Farm -perhaps the most popular fresh vegetable stand north of San Diego. Located 3 miles east of I-5 off Via de la Valle (on Calzada del Bosque). Assorted fresh vegetables (some with recipes upon request). Delicious white corn in summer. Hours: Mon-Fri 10:30 AM-1:30 PM, Sat 10:03 AM-12 PM, Sun 10:03 ALV[-2 PM (or until sold out which happens early each day.) Cardiff Area -B.G. and J. Growers - located 1 mile east of I-5 on Manchester (at intersection of Manchester and El Camino Real). Beautiful fresh straw\u00ad berries daily 10 AM until sold out. Later around July they will have delicious white corn. (Do not confuse this stand with the vegetable trucks that are of ten parked alongside Manchester selling second-rate produce.) Oceanside to Fallbrook -Japanese Straw\u00ad berry Farm on the north side of Mission Ave East (Hwy 76), several miles past Mis\u00ad sion San Luis Rey. There are also a couple of vegetabLe markets along this road with an occassional good buy. Rancho California -1/2 mile off Hwy 15 on Hwy 79 (east of Temecula), there is a good selection of fresh vegetables and fruits (some grown locally). Wynola (near Julian) -Farmer's Mt. Vale Ranch Market -homemade apple pie, nut bread, jams, cactus and apple candy, raw cider, etc. East San Diego County -Little Country Corner at the intersection of Hwys 94 and 54. Country Corner (formerly Japanese Vegetable Market) at the intersection of Jamacha and Sweetwater Rd (take Silver Springs exit off 94, past Monte Vista High School). The Banana Stand at Troy St. between Ban\u00ad croft and Sweetwater Rd. Zweifach. Award Established At its annual meeting in Atlantic.City on April 8, the ~icrocirculatory Society of America voted to create a new int~r-. national award to be called the \"Benjamin '11. Zweifach Award.\" The winner wi~l be selected from the world's outsta~ding.re\u00ad search workers in the field of microcircu\u00ad lation, a subject that studies the blood flow in the smallest blood vessels. The award will be uiven at the ,Jorld Congress for MicrocircuYation, which is held every four years. The first World Congress was held in 1975 in Toronto, Canada. The second one will be held in 1979 at UCSD. \"They never defile a river with the secre\u00ad tions of their bodies, nor even wash their hands in one; nor will they allow others to do so, as they have a great reverence for rivers.\" Herdotus speaking of the Persians (5th Century BC). 2 Medical Services & Specalists in the U.S. In the February and March 1978 issues of of Town & Country magazine, they feature a directory of \"The Best Medical Services and Specialists in the U.S.\" While our UCSD Medical Center and Hospital did not make the list of hospitals and clinics (Scripps Clinic did make it), some of our esteemed faculty clinicians were listed. The list was compiled by interviews with 80 doctors in some two dozen specialities. They selected their colleagues through medical writings, personal contacts at professional meetings, witnessing opera\u00ad tions and diagnoses, referring patients to one another, etc. Town & Country em\u00ad phasized this was only a samp1ing, that many excellent doctors were not included because they do not publish, are more heavily involved in administration and research currently, and for other reasons. The list is heavily weighted towards academics, as there is little question that the best medicine is usually practiced in teaching hospitals and by men who have teaching responsibilities. The UCSD Clinical Faculty members listed A recent UC survey has revealed regular faculty members work more than 60 hours a week per full-time-equivalent appointment (FTE). The survey results break down as follows: 27.5/hours/week/FTE in teaching activi\u00ad ties. 22.0/hours/week/FTE in doing research and creative activities. 8.0/hours/week/FrE in UC service. 5.5/hours/week/FTE in professional activities and .... 2! Pv-ofiles: UCSD Women <fie/foul ufte1t1te\"ll uftenlU'd The March Bear Facts Staff met tor the last time at the home of their diligent Circulation Editor, Gifford Menard. A friend of Gifford's expressed our feelings so well when she said, 11It is so hard to call her to congratulate her - I know the position is opening up an exciting life for her and Bill, but on the other hand I feel so sad that she is leaving us.\" Gifford has rendered a valuable service to Oceanids as Circulation Editor. Prior to her service, the circulation of Bear Facts had been a costly and cumbersome one, but thanks to Gifford's persistence and organization, it is now running smoothly and economically. Gifford Merrill Menard grew up in the small town of Seagate, at the tip of Long Island. She is a real New Yorker. Her great-grandparents immigrated directly to New York and never left the area. Her maternal great-grandfather came to America on the same boat with Vanderbilt and just before landing they discussed where would be the best place to establish a business and home -Vanderbilt chose Manhattan Is\u00ad land while Gifford's great-grandfather decided on Long Island. Her paternal grand\u00ad father and uncle founded a very successful iron forge manufacturing company in Brook\u00ad lyn Heights. The company was handed down through the family; and although it has merged with a bigger company, one of Gifford's brothers is still a member of the firm. Gifford attended the 100 year old Packer Collegiate Institute for Young Ladies in Brooklyn Heights where her mother had also gone to school. Although her mother went on to Wellsley, Gifford chose the business world and graduated from a school of busi\u00ad ness. After several jobs in advertising agencies, during the war she became secre\u00ad tary in the Australian War Supply Procure\u00ad ment Office in Washington D.C. One year after seven rainy weekends in a row, she quit her job to move to a \"healthy place\" -Pasadena, where her brother had settled. 3 She became secretary to Professor Clark Melliken, acting head of the Aeronautics Department at Cal Tech. Here she met a student taking a masters degree in geology, William Menard; and four months after their first date, they were married. Later they ~oved to Harvard where Bill earned a Ph.D. in geology in two years. In 1949 Bill accepted a job at NEL Point Loma and they came back to California Gifford remembers these years in Clai~e\u00ad mon t -no sidewalks, no mail service or post office, no phones or grocery stores. The lack of these conveniences plus three pre-school children kept her very busy. In 1955 Roger Revelle, that man of vision and persuasive tongue, persuaded Bill to join the Scripps faculty. It was a successful choice both for Menard and SIO. The years following have been most rewarding for both Gifford and Bill. There were several trips for both long and short periods. There was a Guggenheim year in England -the coldest winter in 80 years which found them marooned for two weeks with friends on a country estate. The children still talk of their \"snow in the country\" memories, while Gifford fondly recalls their private New Years service in the small chapel. In 1965-66 Dr. Menard was Oceanographic Advisor to Dr. Hornig, the President's Scientific Advisor. Gifford became very active in a current events discussion group and spent every possible moment learning all there was to know about Washington from politics to art museums. Little did she realize that she was preparing herself for a much more important role in their future. This is very typical of Gifford - when she becomes interested in something she systematically strives to learn every\u00ad thing about it. The year 1970 found the Menards back in Cambridge, England where Dr. Menard was an Overseas Fellow at Churchill Col- lege at the invitation of Sir Edward Bullard, now Professor Bullard at SIO. They lived in a college flat and experienced the joys and benefits of English college life. At special dinners at high table, Gifford said there was the most stimulating dinner conversation she has ever experienced. They lived like carefree gypsies ready to travel and explore at a moments notice. Meanwhile the children were growing up and Gifford decided to go back to school at San Diego State and received her B.A. She pursued further studies in poetry, literature, music, and drama. The Menards have been staunch supporters of the arts, active in the Friends of the Library, San Diego Opera, Los Angeles Symphony, La Jolla Chamber Music Society, and the Faculty Chamber Concert Series, as well as being charter members of the Friends of the UCSD Drama Department. Gifford became an active member of Oceanids, where she co-chaired the book group. And now a bit about their new life. Gifford accompanied Bill to Washington last month for his Senate Confirmation as the new Director of the U.S. Geologic Survey. It was an exciting moment when Senator Jackson came out of the chamber room to inform her that Bill had been con\u00ad firmed. She was close to tears when she held her Bible as her husband was sworn in as the tenth director of USGS. Follow\u00ad ing the ceremony, the Menards held a recep\u00ad tion in the Director's Office for 100 VIPS. In the afternoon they held open house for all USGS employees; and they were rewarded by a large turnout, many empl?yees expres\u00ad sing delight in not only meeting them, but in having their first opportunity to visit the Director's Office. Gifford looks for\u00ad ward to her role as the Director's wife. She has always worked with Bill and will do so again, with enthusiasm and energy. In spite of what some of us think, we are not over generous to our public ser\u00ad vants. The Menards get no moving expenses, no entertainment allowance, and the chauf\u00ad fered car is available only after Bill gets to his off ice. The salary is more equiva\u00ad lent to that of a UC Chancellor than to that of a president of an industrial company whose budget and number of employees are equal to that of the USGS. But Gifford promises us that, if the day comes when, a la Roslyn Carter, they give her a pai? staff she will quickly fill the jobs with forme~ Bear Facts staff and editors. Please don't forget, Giff, that there is no retire\u00ad ment age under the new law! Frieda Urey P.S. Gifford, we look forward to hearing from you regularly as our new \"Washington Correspondent.\" TI MY TANG LED T HOUG HI'S 2 [. MONITORING YOUR OWN BLOOD PRESSURE There are both advantages and disadvan\u00ad tages to monitoring your own blood pressure at home. The main disadvantage is that it may take weeks or months to become used to fluctuations without fear or panic at isolated high readings. Self-regulating medication during these periods can also be dangerous. The obvious advantage of self-monitoring is that it enables the patient to become more aware of the value of complying with the physicians' medication regimens as well as make the patient aware of factors that influence their blood pressure, such as emotional tension, uncomfortable positions, etc .. The two popular devices are the mercury manometer and the aneroid gauge. The manometer must be maintained properly as errors can occur easily if the mercury level is low or the tube dirty. The aneroid gauge can be easily impaired if dropped or handled roughly. The aneroid device, if not adequately maintained, is significantly less accurate. The cost can range from $20-$35 for aneroid gauges, to $38-$55 for mercury columns, to $60-$145 for models with microphone and lights which indicate systolic and diastolic pressures. Whatever device is selected, it is most important that they be checked periodically against your physician's measurement of blood pressure. The technique is no~ easy, and you should receive professional instruc\u00ad tion on the use of your particular device. You should also just record the readings and report them to your physician and let him regulate your medication, unless other- WI'Se instructed. .

REGULAR ..... ca I :I I .,, co I STUDENT ADMISSION $3. 00 I :I: G> a: I 19'18 no refunds no exchanges I .A team of scientists from Scripps In\u00adstitution of Oceanography at the Univer\u00adsity of California, San Diego, has obtained proof that life exists in the water under the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. In December 1977, in the second year of a project to drill a hole through the ~helf to find what life may be supported in that isolated, harsh environment, the project was successful in breaking through the 500 meters of ice, and the Scripps team obtained samples of seawater with active marine life. Preliminary results of the investiga\u00ad tions are being presented by Dr. Farooq Azam of Scripps in a symposium on the Ross Ice Shelf at the American Geophysical Union meeting in Miami Beach, Florida, April 17-20. Participating in the Ross Ice Shelf Project, conducted on the ice 260 miles (418 kilometers) from the open waters of the Ross Sea, were scientists from institu\u00ad tions throughout the United States, as well as from New Zealand and Russia. The project was part of the larger, $50-million-a-year, U.S. Antarctic Research Pr~gram (USARP), sponsored by the National Science Foundation through its Division of Polar Programs, which each year brings about 300 scientists to the Antarctic for numerous investigations. The Ross Ice Shelf is a floating ice sheet approximately 500 meters thick and roughly the size of Spain or Texas. Below this ice shelf are about 200 meters of sea\u00ad water. This water column and the sediments below it represent a unique environment in that no light penetrates into it, and it therefore does not have a surface layer in which plant growth can occur. This planktonic layer usually provides the basic food chain support for marine. life. Any living organisms present in the environment under the ice, remote from the open sea, must then depend for their sur\u00ad vival and growth on nutrients coming from the open waters of the Ross Sea. Although living organisms have been found at short distances from the edge of the ice, it was not known if the input of organic matter would be sufficient to support living organisms at some large distances from the Ross Sea. The Ross Ice Shelf Project proposed to investigate the biological, physical oceano\u00ad graphic, and geochemical environment below the ice shelf. It also included study of the glaciology of the ice shelf, which is moving at a rate of about one-two meters a day toward the ocean. About a dozen scientists were present at the access hole site and many more received samples from the project for their investigations. 8 JU The scientists from Scripps are involved in studies on the oceanic. planktonic life and are part of a food chain re1earch group in the university's Institute of Marine Resources baaed at Scripps. The four prin\u00adcipal investigators on the Antarctic project included: Dr. Osmund Holm-Hansen, coordina\u00ad ting scientist for the group; Dr. Farooq Azam, Dr. Angelo F. Carlucci, and Dr. Peter Williams. Also participating were Dr John R. Beers, Dr. David M. Karl, and rese~rch associate Lisa Campbell. Each is involved in investigating certain types of organisms and activity in the food chain The scientists filtered org~nisms from the seawater through a pump lowered into the hole. The organisms found included diatoms, dinoflagellates, radiolarians tintinned ciliates, and copepod nauplii. The population densities of these organisms were extremely low when compared with their population densities in the open Ross Sea water. Much of the work is yet to be done in identifying the species present and quantifying the results. Also significant were the capture of amphipods by Dr. Jere H. Lipps of UC Davis and the photographing of a fish with a ' camera lowered through the hole by Stanley Jacobs of Columbia University's Lamont\u00ad Doherty Observatory. Samples of seawater were also analyzed for the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a very sensitive indicator of the presenc~ of living organisms. The ATP levels indicated that living forms were p~esent, but in extremely low density, similar to deep-sea environments The number of bact~ria in the water ~amples, analyzed by epif luorescent microscopy, also showed ~evels similar to deep-sea bacterial Other tests, including assimi\u00ad lation of radio-labelled organic substrates indicated that the micro-organisms present ' were metabolically active and engaged in slow rates of macromolecular synthesis. The discovery of diatoms, microzooplank\u00ad ton, zooplankton, and metabolically active bacterial populations, along with the amphi\u00ad pods and fish, strongly suggests the presence of an operational food chain in these per\u00ad petually dark waters at -2\u00b0C and at a great distance from the source of organic matter production.

Ever dread the day a dozen six year olds wander through your home aimlessly, the birthday party out of games but not out of time? With some advance planning, parents can enjoy the birthday celebration almost as much as the guests. An important factor to consider in plan\u00ad ning a party is tqe age of the children involved. Young children, to the third grade, have a short attention span, usually 20-30 minutes. An accepted axiom in birth\u00ad day party circles: the length of the legs equals the period of time spent in looking and listening with fascination. Plan a theme for the party. It will be easier to arranee decorations and to decide how to decorate the cake if you have a central idea to work from. Try modifying games to fit your theme. If you have a circus theme, you could plan \"pin the nose on the clown.\" Have lots of activities planned. It's better to have too many planned and not do them than too much time with nothing to do. There's a wise rule of thumb which gauges the number of guests to the age of the child, i.e. six guests for a six year old. If you decide to have a large number of guests, entertainers who use a fast pace, bright colors, and audience involvement are a good source around which to plan a party. Shirley McManuss Puppets Please Traveling Marionette Show is a fast-paced variety show for children from pre-school through the third grade. Audience involve\u00ad ment is important to her performance, as it is to Marie Hitchcock's. San Diego's Puppet Lady's marionettes include Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Pam Mcintyre's hand puppet show also brings the children into the stage presentations. The Puppet Patch provides lots of color and music. The Magic Clown and Company has a pro\u00ad fessional clown. For those five years and younger, there's a marionette show. Older children get a magic show. Bobo Jim Magician's program is in three parts. The magic show is followed by a balloon show. The birthday child gets a five foot high balloon hat. Finally, the entire party makes a magic cake with a taste for all. Penny Bubblegums puppets and balloon animals were a smash with our four year old and five year old recently. 7 For more entertainers, check the yellow pages. Call high school and college drama departments. Local libraries also use area entertainers. Going out? The Puppet Playhouse offers a birthday plan. Younger children would love McDonald's party which includes a burger, fries, drink, and cake. Often a hostess will provide games. Some Burger Kings have a \"no charge\" plan for burger, drink, \"ice-burgers,\" and party favors. Shakeys and Straw Hat Pizza offer pizza parties as well. Older children would love .these. For a \"whale\" of a day, Sea World offers a party plan. Adventure calls in the Wild Animal Park's two party plans. The Ice Capades _Chalet's party plan sounds like fun tool . Don't be afraid to use your imagination. Try renting a projector and some cartoons. How about a trip to the Children's Zoo and a picnic lunch? With some advance planning, your child's birthday party will be as much fun for you as for your honored guest and friends. Janet Newlan Bower Spring Cleaning? Are you putting off that dreaded chore of spring cleaning? Wondering what to do with all those left-overs? Hesitate no longer. \"The Corner\" (the UCSD Medical Center Auxiliary Re-Sale Shop) will rush to the rescue, load up your discards and put them to good use. There are several heart-warming stories that have come out of \"The Corner\" since it opened last fall. Recently manager JoAnne Shouse received a call from the Bur~ Unit in the Hospital. They had a patient who had lost everything she owned in a fire. Now ready to be released she had nothing to wear. Could they bring her over for some new clothes? An hour later a very happy lady walked out of 11The Corner\" wearing a lovely new dress and shoes. Another special occasion appeared in the form of a woman who runs a home for mentally retarded young women. At a pre\u00ad arranged time she brought in several of the girls and they delighted in trying on all the lovely gowns and dresses. They all left with a special treasurer or two, and the woman was pleased to have found an economical way to dress her girls. There are many things for sale at 11The Corner\" -dishes, furniture, baby goods, paintings, accessories, etc. Come and browse any day (but Sunday) after 11 AM. For donations, call 291-4269. Greek Dinner Friends of the International Center will have a gourmet journey to Greece on Sunday May 21 at the last ethnic dinner of the ' academic year. Helen Reynolds of Ocean\u00ad side, author of the new cookbook Fabulous Greek Foods, will be dinner chairper8Dn:- The dinner will be held at 6 PM in the Internat~onal Center on the Matthews Campus. ~eservations are essential and must be made in advance by mail. Cost is $7.SO per person or $6.SO for members of the Friends. Checks should be mailed to Friends of the International Center, Q-018, UCSD, La Jolla 92093. Acknowledeement will be sent by return mail. The menu selected will be representa\u00ad tive of Greek Cuisine and will begin with three appetizers: Dolmathakia (stuffed grape leaves with currants, rice, and pine nuts), cheese puffs, and Tzaziki (cucumber and yogurt dip served with raw vegetables). There will be two entrees: Fourno (baked chicken) served with lemon potatoes and Spanakopita (spinach and cheese pie with f ilo dough). The Greek salad platter will consist of sliced tomatoes, lettuce, Cala\u00ad mata olives, and Feta cheese dressed with lemon juice and olive oil. The dessert will be Melamakarouna (honey cakes). Coffee and wine will also be served. Helen comes by her interest in Greek cooking loeically as her parents, the Cremostrates, were natives of Sparta. She, herself, was born in the U.S. and grew up in Rockford, Illinois, where she attended public schools and also Greek School, learn\u00ad ing to read and write the language. Her family later moved to Coronado where she met and married her husband, Norman, who is now a retired naval aviator, teaching commercial flying at Palomar Airport. They have two sons, Peter, 12, and Stephen, 16. During his years in the service, they lived variously in Hawaii, Corpus Christi, and San Diego. Helen's other major interest is ballet which she presently teaches at the Vista Classical Ballet School. She served as head of the Dance Department at the San Luis Rey Academy for Girls for five years until the school's closure last June. Helen also has taught at the Perfect Pan. Her book is an introduction to Greek cookery and is being published by Aero Publishers, Fallbrook, in soft cover. It is available at all B. Dalton and Hunter's Book Stores. The book may also be ordered by mail. Address Fabulous Greek Foods, 2021 Lincoln, Oceanside, CA 92054. The price by mail is $5595, plus 36\u00a2 tax, and 70\u00a2 postage and handling for a total of $7.0l. Lois Dechant Szilard Award Dr. Gertrud Weiss Szilard was invited by the Forum on Physics and Society of the American Physical Society to present the 1978 Leo Szilard Award for Physics in the Public Interest to Dr. Matthew Meselson of Harvard University on April 26, 1978 in Washington, D.C. Through the Leo Szilard Award, the Forum seeks to recognize valuable work in the public interest which carries forward the spirit exemplified in the life of Leo Szilard. Dr. Matthew Meselson is Thomas Dudley Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences at Harvard University and is well known for his work to clarify the nature of biological and chemical weapons and his determined efforts to prevent their use. The Award is intended to highlight his example of the use of science in the public interest for the benefit of young scientists everywhere. Dr. Meselson has also been a director and moving spirit of the Council for a Livable World, a Washington based citizen's organization founded by Leo Szilard in 1962. Gertrud Weiss Szilard was married to Leo Szilard, who died in La Jolla in 1964. She is an associate researcher in the Program in Science, Technology and Public Affairs under the direction of Dr. Herbert York, UCSD. There she is engaged in a project to edit and publish the Collected Papers of Leo Szilard who was personally respon\u00ad sible, perhaps more than any other indivi\u00ad dual for the American initiative in the atomic bomb, then spent the rest of his life in pursuit of a world order that would guarantee that it would never again be used. 8 Creative Handcrafts We get together twice a month to work on our individual projects and to enjoy each other's company.
