I am a Christian who believes in the Bible, including the teachings in the New Testament. I have a Christian worldview. This perspective recognizes that faith and conscience compel an individual to submit to the proper jurisdiction within the rule of law, in this case, Divine Law. I am objecting to vaccines because I believe in and follow God and the principles laid out in His Word and I have a deeply held belief that vaccines violate them. I believe my body is a temple for the Holy Spirit. Specifically, the New Testament teaches that: \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are...What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?\" 1 Corinthians 3:16-17, 6:19 (KJV). Accordingly I believe, pursuant to my Christian faith, that my body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. It is a God-given responsibility and requirement for me to protect the physical integrity of my Body against unclean food and injections. Vaccines contain neurotoxins, hazardous substances, attenuated viruses, animal parts, foreign DNA, albumin from human blood, carcinogens and chemical wastes that are proven harmful to the human body. (Please see [ http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf)). Not only the additives in vaccines considered contaminants from a biblical standpoint, the contaminants themselves are often contaminated. (Please see [ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20456974](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20456974)). At least 27 vaccines contain cells, cellular debris, protein and DNA (please see http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf) from aborted babies including but not limited to Adenovirus, Polio, Dtap/Polio/HiB Combo, Hep A, MMRV Pro Quad, Rabies, Varicella, Shingles vaccines, Ebola, tuberculosis, malaria and influenza (please see [ http://crucell.com/page/downloads/Factsheet_PER.C6_Technology.pdf](http://crucell.com/page/downloads/Factsheet_PER.C6_Technology.pdf)). The broad prohibition against consuming anything that might \"defile\" the body, and hence the conscience, is stated again in 1 Corinthians 8:7: \"Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.\" Again in 2 Corinthians 7:1, there is this admonition against defiling the flesh and the spirit: \"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\" More broadly, the New Testament requires of Christians that we, \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" (Mark 12:17). When it comes to consuming things into our own bodies, as opposed to make payments to government, compliance with God's law is required. The mandated vaccine, with its numerous additives and it's mechanism for altering my body, is the equivalent of a prohibited \"unclean food\" that causes harm to my conscience. Vaccines to me are unclean. I believe in and follow God and the principles laid out in His Word and I have a deeply held belief that vaccines violate them. I will wear a face mask for infective protection for patients during periods of influenza risk upon approval notice of this exemption. I make this request for the glory of God and consistent with my faith. Thank you for your consideration of it. Respectfully, "}
