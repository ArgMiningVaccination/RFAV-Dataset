Learn about the unique chemistry and characteristics of an essential oil Common Photosensitive Oils The skin is a complex system designed to protect the delicate internal environment of the body against external harms (water and heat loss, microbial invasion, UV radiation, etc.). In order for any substance to truly be absorbed through the skin, it must fully traverse all skin layers and enter into the bloodstream un - derlying the dermal tissues. Combined, the \"brick and mortar\" structure of the outer layer of skin and the presences of unique fats that fuse between the skin cells make the skin a secure, wa - terproof barrier. Unlike water, the compounds composing essen - tial oils are extremely small and lipid soluble, which allows them to cross this barrier and gain entry to the circulatory system. Used this way, essential oils are extremely beneficial because they offer both localized and systemic effects. In other words, the essential oil will be beneficial in the area of direct application while also influencing health of the body as a whole. Is it safe to use essential oils when taking medications? Essential oils are being continually studied to allow for a more full understanding of how they interact in the body and the pathways behind their physiologic benefits. Because we do not yet understand everything about essential oils, it is not uncommon for people to express concern that essential oils may interact with other forms of medicine. Although there is always more to learn, one thing is very apparent: essential oils have a long history of safety. In fact, when used congruently with medications, there have been minimal reports showing that essential oils cause significant interactions. By far the best way to ensure that your experience with essential oils will be positive is to communicate openly with your physician regarding your intended use with the oils. What does it mean for essential oils to be photosensitive? What should you avoid with photosensitive oils? To understand photosensitivity, it is first important to consider sensitivity responses as a whole category. A sensitivity response can be defined as heightened reactivity to essential oils that may lead to an unwanted response in the body. Although unusual when the oil is used appropriately, risk for sensitivity increases when too much essential oil is applied, or when the oil is applied to young and sensitive skin. Photosensitization is a special category of sensitivity in which exposure to ultraviolet rays (sunlight) after topical applica - tion of essential oil causes heightened sensitivity of the skin. This type of response is most commonly associated with citrus oils due to their unique chemistry. The best way to avoid any type of sensitivity is to be aware of how your body reacts to certain essential oils in different scenarios. Try testing a small amount of essential oil in an inconspicuous area before beginning more widespread use. For some oils, like citrus oils, sunlight can be a trigger, so exposure to the sun should be avoided after topical application. With other oils, it is not the sun but simply how your body interacts with the oil that causes the sensitivity. Awareness of your body and its responsiveness and limits is the best way to maximize efficacy and minimize sensitivity when using essential oils.

Apply 1-2 drops to affected area on the skin. Mix with water in a spray bottle to clean surfaces. Add to wood furniture and floor polish. Traditionally, Native Americans have used every part of the arborvitae tree for a variety of purposes. They built homes and canoes from the wood, made baskets from the roots, and crafted clothes, rope, and twine from the bark. They also used leaves in teas and salves for certain health benefits. The unique components found in Arborvitae essential oil give it its profound therapeutic benefits. High in tropolone content, Arborvitae essential oil contains strong cleansing properties that protect the immune system and support normal cell activity in the body. The essential oil also makes an excellent insect repellant and natural wood preservative. Arborvitae's warm, woody, earthy aroma calms nerves and balances emotions. Plant Part: Wood Distillation Method: Steam Origin: Canada Key Benefits: Balances and soothes the body and emotions Cleanses and purifies the air Soothes the skin Promotes healthy cell function Acts as a natural bug repellant Essential Oil Spotlight Fun Facts: dTERRA\u00ae is the only company in the aromatherapy industry that offers Arborvitae essential oil. The oldest arborvitae tree discovered was around 1,653 years old when it died. Because of the preservative properties of the Arborvitae oil, even trees that have fallen hundreds of years ago still look as if they had fallen only yesterday.

Over the course of the competition, she lost a total of 21.5 lbs. and achieved a balanced energy that has changed her life. Creating Change Working as a positive role model for wellness, Susan Niedt felt the need for a change. She admits, \"I didn't like the way I looked. I would sometimes cry when I looked in the mirror because my belly was so bloated. My role at work was to inspire and educate others on a path toward wellness. However, I would be setting up exercise classes for others, while I was 20 pounds overweight. When I began the competition, I felt that it was my opportunity to show everybody that you can create change. I knew that if I could show them that, I could be a better role model.\" Overcoming Challenges Susan faced some tough challenges at the outset. Due to stress, she would binge eat at night, sometimes eating a whole bag of chips. During the competition, unable to give up the habit at first, she replaced her snacks with TrimShakes. She eventually became creative with it, mixing the powder with yogurt and cacao to make a healthy pudding. After a while, she no longer felt the need to binge eat. On days when Susan just wanted to quit, she found that the Slim & Sassy Facebook page was a great inspirational tool. She explains, \"That Facebook page became my best friend. When I felt sorry for myself and I looked at the other people and the journeys they had to take, I was inspired. I was blown away with all the changes I was making, and I finally had the courage to send in my picture to put on the Facebook page. I wasn't going to do it, but I saw some of the other pictures and I said, 'If they're that brave, I can be that brave.'\" A year later, the changes that took place in Susan's life have had powerful effects. She now works with a personal trainer to keep up with her exercise. She also certified in AromaTherapy, and became an EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) practitioner. She says, \"I'm on a new journey. I don't know where it's headed, but I have a new-found confidence and a sense of self-worth.\" \u00ae Slim & Sassy\u00ae Metabolic Blend (Item No. 31370001) Slim & Sassy TrimShake (Item No. 35200001) LifeLong Vitality Pack (Item No. 34210001) Black Pepper essential oil (Item No. 41040001) Elevation Joyful Blend (Item No. 31040001) BeforeSusan Niedt Slim & Sassy\u00ae Participant 2014Susan's tips for your weight loss journey: DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP. \"Give yourself permission to eat something if you want it and forgive yourself at all times.

I can't tell you how powerful that was. It still makes me cry thinking about it.\" 1 2 PRODUCTS USED AfterAbout the Slim & Sassy Competition and Products Held once a year, the Slim & Sassy Competition was created to help encourage and support people on their individual journeys to wellness. One of the most important aspects of making a positive lifestyle change is to have support\u2014and dTERRA is committed to helping people receive the help they need. Slim & Sassy essential oil, a blend formulated to promote a healthy metabolism and manage hunger cravings, is part of that support. Diuretic, stimulant, and calorie free, it is a natural alternative to other options in the weight loss market. Slim & Sassy contains Grapefruit and Lemon, both of which help purify and cleanse the body, while Peppermint, Ginger, and Cinnamon provide a stimulating and positive effect on the endocrine system to assist with weight loss. Making the decision to eat a healthier ratio of calories is the first step to losing weight and maintaining a lean body composition. Slim & Sassy TrimShake is a convenient and delicious weight management mix providing essential nutrients with an average of 68 calories per serving and 8 grams of protein. The TrimShake includes the patented weight loss ingredient EssentraTrim\u00ae, which has been clinically demonstrated to help manage cortisol\u2014a stress hormone associated with fat storage in the abdomen, hips, and thighs. Blended with nonfat dairy, almond, rice, or soy milk, or water, TrimShake can be used as part of a weight-loss strategy of reducing daily caloric intake and burning fat stores through exercise.

Imagine embarking on a flight to Italy\u2014you would expect to find grand monuments from old civilizations and crowded tourist destinations. You would also expect to find the tasty flavors of a variety of foods in addition to pizza and gelato. And just maybe, when you leave the crowded cities behind, you might find the brilliant green leaves and aroma of Italian citrus trees. Unfortunately, after facing years of economic downturn, many growers have been forced to abandon their orchards. dTERRA's Co-Impact Sourcing now plays a major role in facilitating many family-run operations to reopen, continue production on their orchards, and preserve a special part of Italian culture. Through sourcing Lemon and Bergamot from the orchards of Sicily and Reggio di Calabria, dTERRA\u00ae has been able to positively affect the Italian economy in many ways. This region is home to some of the hardiest and most enthusiastic people in Italy, and though they struggle economically at times, they have precious resources to offer the world. Sicilian Commitment The people of Sicily proudly identify themselves as Siciliani\u2014and the pride they exhibit in their heritage is contagious. This pride also spreads to their work. Salvatore (Reno) and Roberto Amedeo work together in their family's fourth generation lemon business. In the face of the poor economy in Italy, Roberto's wife, Cecilia, researched American essential oil companies online to find ways to keep their business going. When she came across dTERRA, she says she \"felt something special about it.\" Following this feeling, she emailed Emily Wright, hoping for a response. For Emily, the email stuck out to her and she decided to reply. As they corresponded, a fast-growing friendship was born. When she first visited Italy, Emily found a family committed to constant improvement of their essential oil quality and relationships of trust were formed. When she returned to Italy seven months later with Dr. Hill, the magnitude of how many growers and pickers would benefit through dTERRA's Co-impact Sourcing initiatives became evident. For the Amedeo family, this meant providing jobs that would not only Italian Citrus Orchards: A CO-IMPACT STORYPRESERVING \"We can say that in our grower's veins doesn't flow blood\u2014 but Bergamot and Lemon oil.\" -Cecilia 8 / SPRING 2015 LIVING MAGAZINEstimulate a suffering economy, but also keep their country's citrus heritage alive. Giovanni, the father and third generation citrus producer, had professional equipment installed when he was a young man, which dramatically improved production levels and still ensured a high standard of quality. Salvatore, who oversees oil production and grower relations, shares, \"From 1850 to 1890 everything was done by hand. It's much easier with modern machinery to produce more essential oil without losing any quality.\" Roberto, the chemist of the family who oversees quality assurance, further illustrates, \"It used to take my father plus 50 men a whole season to do what we are able to do now in a single day.\" A Fourth Generation Business The Amedeo family, aside from their own orchard, also source lemons and bergamot fruits from many growers in Sicily and Calabria. Overall, the Amedeo family estimates that their production has grown around 45 percent since partnering with dTERRA\u00ae. Lemons are sourced from an area of about 865 acres, and bergamot from about 250 acres in Reggio di Calabria from many other family growers with the same level of passion and commitment. Alfredo, a partner lemon grower, says you can tell the quality of a Sicilian lemon just by smelling it. Passionate about his heritage, he insists, \"A lemon isn't a lemon unless it is Sicilian.\" Alfredo took over an abandoned orchard and now has created many jobs for people in the area that otherwise would have emigrated to the northern part of the country or left Italy altogether. In Reggio di Calabria, the \"toe of the boot\" of Italy, bergamot flourishes in the only place on Earth it is grown. Unique among citrus plants, bergamot produces a very sweet essential oil, although it is bitter as a fruit. Salvatore is the caretaker of a beautiful bergamot orchard. He knows every single tree\u2014when it was planted and how much fruit it bears. Salvatore started helping his father in the groves when he was young, and it quickly became his passion as he grew. He says, \"I know I love this work because I do it even when it rains.\" Salvatore and his fellow workers harvest bergamot twice a year from March to April and then again in June. Salvatore also organizes many other bergamot growers to help not only supply the demand dTERRA has for Bergamot, but to ensure that they have consistent work and receive a fair wage. Powerful Goals The goals of each grower in Italy intertwine with the purposes of Co-Impact Sourcing. Salvatore Amedeo's passion lies in taking care of people and creating jobs to help the economy. Roberto is passionate about quality; he analyzes each and every batch, running over 3,000 Gas Chromatograms a year. The quality of the Lemon and Bergamot essential oil is possible because of the Amedeo family's commitment to the people they work with and their careful attention to the preservation of the orchards. dTERRA has an exclusive partnership with the Amedeo family, ensuring quality essential oil and jobs in Italy for years to come. Bergamot was originally introduced to Reggio di Calabria from the Canary Islands. Grown on the hillsides, Bergamot thrives in this ideal climate. The acidic soil and the fresh ocean air help strengthen the trees, producing a fruit perfect for capturing the therapeutic benefits of Bergamot essential oil. www.doterra.com / 910 / SPRING 2015 LIVING MAGAZINE LemonEssential Oil Spotlight The invigorating scent of Lemon essential oil from a true Sicilian lemon revitalizes your mind and lifts your mood. Lemon essential oil contains numerous health benefits and can be used for a variety of purposes on a daily basis, which is why it is one of dTERRA's most popular essential oils. The high limonene content found in this essential oil makes it a powerful antioxidant and a cleansing agent. In the ancient world, Egyptians used lemon oil to cleanse their bodies of toxins. It also aids in digestion, supports healthy respiratory function, and provides immune system support, especially during seasonal changes. Plant Part: LEMON RINDS Distillation Method: COLD PRESSED Unlike most other essential oils, citrus essential oils go through the expression distillation process, often referred to as \"cold press.\" This method uses high mechanical pressure instead of heat to squeeze out the oil from the rind of the plant. Sourcing Origin: SICILY, ITALY Interesting Fact One lemon tree can produce between 500 and 600 pounds of lemons in a year. It takes about 45 lemons to fill up a 15mL bottle. HOW TO USE Aromatic Add 2-4 drops to the diffuser of your choice to help boost your mood and improve the scent of the room. Rub 1-2 drops into your palms and inhale to invigorate your mind and body.

Product Donations and Financial Contribution MultivitaminTHE Having created some of the most sophisticated and best-selling multivitamin/mineral supplements in the industry over the last 20 years, I've seen the products and their underlying research evolve in stages. Usually, it takes the products about 5-10 years to follow the research. Now, we have reached yet another critical point when research creates a new paradigm shift for multivitamin/mineral supplements. With our new Daily Nutrition Pack, dTERRA\u00ae leads the way so that you can be among the first to reap the full benefits of a truly expertly formulated, all-in-one daily multinutrient supplement. Do I Need a Multivitamin? The short answer is a resounding yes. Anybody in the scientific community who seriously studies vitamin and mineral nutrition agrees that virtually everyone's nutrition falls short in meeting even the bare minimum requirements for many nutrients (known as the RDI\u2014Recommended Dietary Intakes). Trying to get the RDIs of all 26 essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements\u2014micronutrients\u2014from foods alone is next to impossible, even if you eat a wholesome, balanced diet. Fruits and vegetables are rich in these micronutrients, plus they contain important phytonutrients (carotenoids, polyphenols, essential oils, etc.). The problem is that hardly anyone eats enough fruits and vegetables. A recent analysis of WHO/FAO data (Murphy et al., Br J Nutr 112(6):1004, 2014) shows that this is a world-wide problem: three out of four people on this planet don't even meet the minimum recommended five daily servings of fruits and vegetables! Instead, modern diets are high in refined foods and beverages devoid of micro-nutrients and full of empty calories. In the U.S., nine out of ten adults do not meet the RDIs for vitamins D and E, and over half of us don't meet the RDIs for vitamin A, calcium, and magnesium (Fulgoni, et al., J Nutr 141(10):1847-54, 2011). Even if you are vegan or vegetarian, you're unlikely to get enough vitamin D, B12, calcium, iron, and zinc. Long-term, these nutrient deficiencies cause lack of energy, poor immunity, weak bones, cognitive decline, and a host of other health problems. Experts agree that you should try to eat a healthy diet high in fruits and vegetables and take a multivitamin/mineral supplement. Now, the real question is which supplement should you take and how should it be formulated? Are the RDI amounts even sufficient? We know today that for most micronutrients they are not, and that optimum intakes are often higher than the RDIs. But how much higher? And what happens if we get too much? These questions have kept scientists busy for the last 50 years, and recent research makes it clear that it's time to rethink again. Multivitamin Evolution The first multivitamins hit the retail shelves in the '50s and '60s and remain a staple in today's retail and mass markets. These inexpensive products deliver the RDI of most vitamins and lesser amounts of most minerals. Their mineral sources are often poorly absorbed and utilized by the body and they lack phytonutrients and essential omega-3 fatty acids. Then, research in the '80s and '90s suggested that above-RDI amounts of certain antioxidant vitamins, some B-vitamins, and trace elements have additional health benefits, and these studies paved the way to the current generation of micronutrient supplements popular in the specialty and direct-sales markets. These comprehensive products often include mega-doses (10x RDI or more) of vitamins, better quality minerals, omega-3 fatty acids and phytonutrients, and some make you take 16 or more capsules or tablets a day. In fact, competition is fierce and many companies are playing a horsepower game where more must be better. Most recently, however, the results of very large, long-term studies have shown that mega-doses of micronutrients like vitamin C, vitamin Experience the full benefits of multivitamins!NUTRITION CORNER WITH DR. CARSTEN SMIDTwww.doterra.com / 13 E, beta-carotene, folate, and selenium don't work. In fact, some of these studies found negative effects at high doses previously assumed to be safe. Unfortunately, the supplement industry is still taking a defensive position belittling or dismissing these studies. Multivitamin Revolution The good news for you is that dTERRA\u00ae never believed in the \"more-is-better\" horsepower game. In fact, we are now in the unique position to embrace all the recent micronutrient research\u2014positive and negative\u2014and create a completely revolutionary concept of formulating multivitamins. How? Let's take a step back. I mean a giant step back to when we humans first roamed this planet. Our genes change very slowly and they can take thousands of years to adapt to dietary changes. For most of our history we ate hunter-gatherer diets. Only recently, our diets and lifestyles changed dramatically with the introduction of agriculture. And in the last 100 years, even more drastic changes occurred due to the industrialization of our food supply. So modern diets today are very different from the diets our genes are used to. Now, take a good look at the dosages used in all of the micronutrient studies, and compare them to the amounts that we used to get from diets we are genetically programmed for. That's what we did, and it soon became clear that problems only arise when we consume much more or much less than what we could possibly get from the natural diets our bodies are genetically used to. This makes a lot of sense, and we used this approach to set a new standard, one that embraces the concept of natural balance. For each micronutrient we now have a range of natural intakes that our bodies were made for, and they coincide with the amounts needed for optimum health benefits. Restore Natural Balance with Daily Nutrient Pack dTERRA's new Microplex MVp and xEO Mega\u00ae (Daily Nutrient Pack) are the first micronutrient supplements in the industry that apply this new standard of natural balance to all vitamins, minerals, trace elements, phytonutrients, and essential fatty acids. This game-changing, patent-pending approach ensures that you get the optimum amounts and types of all micronutrients every day, including a full spectrum of omega-3s, antioxidant polyphenols, and carotenoids. With Daily Nutrient Pack, you don't have to worry about getting too little or too much of anything anymore. Instead, you get what your body was made for and demands\u2014 the most efficacious and safe amounts needed for long-term health and vitality. How Do I Use Daily Nutrient Pack? Daily Nutrient Pack (the new Microplex MVp and xEO Mega) is a foundational supplement designed for men and women of all ages as well as for teenagers. Pregnant and nursing women also benefit, but should consult with their physician as they may require additional iron or folate. If you desire extra energy benefits, you can add our new, more potent Mito2Max\u00ae (with lychee fruit extract), and if you deal with occasional joint discomfort, we recommend adding our new Deep Blue Polyphenol Complex. We also updated Lifelong Vitality Pack with the new Microplex MVp and xEO Mega formulas while keeping the current Alpha CRS+\u00ae.

I have been using essential oils in my gardens since I have been with dTERRA. I teach the organic portion of \"The Master Gardener\" class for my local area. My class this year will include the wonderful uses of dTERRA essential oils in the garden\u2014not only for pest management, but also for plant vigor and growth. I don't use any chemicals in my garden at all and love sharing new and safe ways to enjoy gardening! I have substituted dTERRA essential oils for companion plants\u2014the results are amazing! For example, basil is a great companion plant for tomatoes. I use Basil essential oil in my watering can to give the plants a dose that can be absorbed through the root system, or I use it as a foliar spray. This helps to give the tomato plant great vigor for growth and plant resistance. -Kay Pittman Vinegar makes an effective natural herbicide and weed killer. I clean my greenhouse and garden tools with a mixture of 10 drops of Melaleuca in about 33 ounces of distilled water. We put this in a spray bottle and clean every inch of the greenhouse. -Maila Chan My garden was being attacked by a beetle-like bug. It was eating away at everything, especially my favorite lily plant. I put a couple drops of Peppermint in a spray bottle with water, sprayed the plants, and the beetle moved on! dTERRA was part of my inspiration for my garden. -Kristen Willis Last year, I had the best luck getting rid of slugs using White Fir essential oil on my peppers. I have also used Peppermint oil for aphids and mystery bugs. Peppermint also works great for cooling your body off in the hot sun. I make after-sun spray with Lavender, Peppermint, and aloe juice. After a long day of working on my garden, Deep Blue\u00ae Rub comes in handy for the joints and muscles. I clean my hands with essential oil sugar scrub. I can't tell you how much I love using dTERRA in the garden. -Jamie Stitt Essential oils can be valuable tools for every gardener. Whether you are trying to chase away garden pests, improve health and growth of the plants, or restore those gardener hands, essential oils can help. Here are some easy ways you can use essential oils to enhance your natural gardening experience. Apply Lavender to soothe irritated skin associated with certain plants or bugs.

Small urban gardens can be fun, educational, and productive, particularly with new methods of season extension, drip irrigation, and varieties especially suited to the garden. Here are a few tips on successful gardening. 1 Contact your local Cooperative Extension office. They are part of the land-grant university system all across the country. They have expertise on growing in your specific area and have experts and publications suited to your climate. 2 Start small and plant easy-to- grow crops. Many nutrient-packed vegetables grow quickly and easily and are less subject to weather-related problems than difficult-to-grow crops. Lettuce, spinach, chard, kale, Asian greens, and similar crops take up little space, don't mind cold weather, and grow quickly. 3 Don't overlook the root crops. There is nothing tastier than a home-grown fresh carrot, Asian sweet turnip, or fresh-picked beets. 4 Almost all vegetable crops love the sun. Sunshine helps plants get off to a good start and helps develop those sugars that make vine-ripened products so delicious. Walk around your yard and check for sunny spots and shady areas. Most likely, the area that gets the most sun will grow the best vegetables.5 If you have a yard with a fence, use the fence area to grow perennial crops such as raspberries and blackberries. They don't mind a little shade and you can let them use the fence line for support. 6 Consider getting your garden off the ground by adding compost and forming raised beds. Shaping and raising beds lets you protect crops from wind and frost with row covers to extend your season. 7 Invest in drip irrigation with an inexpensive timer. You use less water (good for the environment and your wallet) and are less likely to water too much and/or too little. Small garden timers are inexpensive and easy to program. Many yards already have a sprinkler system\u2014 it's easy to add a line for your veggies. 8 Know when to plant and when to harvest. Most extension offices have guidelines for the areas they serve. I like to follow what I call the \"Grandpa/Grandma System\" of gardening. Look around your neighborhood\u2014find the grandmas and grandpas with the best gardens. They probably know more than anybody in town about what to plant, when to plant, watering, harvesting, controlling bugs, etc., than anybody, including the experts. The other trait they usually have is that they love to share what they have learned with friends and neighbors. TIP: If you really want to get into serious gardening, I can recommend three national organizations that serve both professional growers and home gardeners. They sell seeds and supplies and give free advice. www.groworganic.com seedsofchange.com highmowingseeds.com GARDENER'S HAND SOAP \u00bd cup castile soap 2 tablespoons Fractionated Coconut Oil 1 teaspoon vitamin E 15 drops Geranium essential oil Rick Lattin Generational organic farmer, owner of Lattin Farms, and Founder and Managing Partner of Nevada Great Basin Basket CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) LLC. 20 / SPRING 2015 LIVING MAGAZINE Our sense of smell is the frontline modality by which we experience the world around us; however, many people may underestimate its significance. By comparison, humans have a weaker sense of smell than many animals, which must use smell for sustaining basic life functions (tracking food, identifying a mate, etc.). Although your nose may not be as acute as that of a bloodhound, you can still detect thousands of varieties of odors in infinitesimal quantities. Only in recent years have researchers begun to unlock the complexities that make up the sense of smell and, in turn, have reported that smell sensitivity is actually much more significant than previously predicted. In fact, our sense of smell is directly linked to our physical and mental health profiles. The Aroma of Essential Oils When it comes to essential oils, their powerfully fragrant aromas are the first thing we notice as we unscrew the bottle cap. By definition, essential oils are a rich mixture of volatile aromatic compounds. Because of their volatility, aroma is actually an intrinsic feature to essential oils, or in other words, essential oils are their aroma. Aroma in a \"chemical\" sense means that individual compounds (in this case, essential oil constituents) are able to interact with olfactory (smell) receptors in the nose. Not every type of compound elicits an aroma, because the compounds have to be very small and readily evaporate into the air. Essential oil compounds meet both of these criteria and are able to quickly and easily bind to smell receptors in the nose. The chemistry of essential oils varies widely from oil to oil, which explains why essential oils possess such widely different aromas, and thus, affect us in different ways. THE POWER OFDr. David K. Hill, CMO, Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Boardwww.doterra.com / 21 How Scent Affects Us One of the most well-studied areas of aroma research is the effect of smell on emotions and mood. For example, there is convincing evidence demonstrating that simply inhaling the aroma of an essential oil is effective for calming nervous or anxious feelings in a variety of settings. The smell receptors located on the upper surface of the nasal cavity make direct links with the limbic system of the brain, an area that governs the body's emotional responses. This close connection between aroma and emotion becomes obvious in our everyday life as certain odors trigger memories or specific feelings. Some aromas directly impact mood (for example calming, balancing, or invigorating), while others trigger memories of a specific experience, often one tied to a strong emotion. Intriguing new research has also helped us recognize that the benefits of aroma extend far beyond just emotional regulation. In addition to influencing the limbic region of the brain, olfactory centers are also intricately linked with the hypothalamus, an area of the brain more familiarly nicknamed the \"visceral control center\" because it controls physiologic functions throughout the body. The hypothalamus exerts its powerful influence by interacting directly with the pituitary gland, or \"master gland,\" a small gland located in the brain. The pituitary gland secretes hormones involved in the regulation of blood pressure, hunger and thirst signals, thyroid function, sleep cycles, production of sexual hormones, and memory, among other things. Because of the direct link of the olfactory system to this area of the brain, aroma is capable of interacting directly with the hypothalamus, influencing neurochemistry throughout the body, and, in turn, potentiating powerful health outcomes. There are many acceptable ways to use essential oils for their aromatic properties. One method is to diffuse the oil into the air. Not only does diffusion make the oil accessible to the body, but research indicates that there are also air purification benefits when diffusing oils. When diffusing oils, use of cold air or hydrodiffusion is best because burning or heating essential oils can alter their delicate chemistry. If a diffuser is not available, simply dropping essential oils into the palm of the hand and then cupping around the nose and breathing deeply is a convenient method for using essential oils at any time, in any situation. Although there are many ways that essential oils can be applied, throughout my experience as a physician, I have found that repeated daily exposure to the aroma of essential oils provides unique and significant support to healthy function of the body and mind. aroma REFERENCES Ceccarelli I, Lariviere WR, Fiorenzani P, et al.

There are many benefits to dilution, including increasing the surface area of absorption, enhancing absorption through dry skin, and preventing sensitivity responses. dTERRA's carrier oil of choice is Fractionated Coconut Oil due to its long shelf life and lightweight texture. CLASSIFICATIONS OF OILS FOR TOPICAL USE Neat: Oils categorized as \"neat\" can be applied topically without dilution because of their exceptionally mild chemistry. Frankincense, Lavender, Melaleuca, Melissa, and Sandalwood are good examples of \"neat\" essential oils. Dilute: Oils in this category have potent chemistry and should be diluted with a carrier oil before topical application in every case. \"Dilute\" oils include Cassia, Cinnamon, Clove, Oregano, and Thyme. Sensitive: \"Sensitive\" oils are those that should be diluted before use on young or sensitive skin. Bergamot, Black Pepper, Eucalyptus, Ginger, and Peppermint are examples of \"sensitive\" oils. APPLICATION SAFETY Although unusual, occasionally it is possible to have a sensitivity response to an essential oil. This occurs when there is heightened reactivity of an essential oil that may result in an unwanted response in the body or on the skin. Awareness of your body and how it reacts to different essential oils, amounts applied, and location applications can help minimize risk and ensure safe usage. Essential Safety Tips: Citrus oils contain a unique category of photosensitive compounds called furocoumarins, so it is important to avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, or other sources of UV light for up to 12 hours after topical application of these oils. More is not always better! Essential oils are very potent, so a little goes a long way. Start with 1-2 drops and then increase the dosage as necessary. Dilute, dilute, dilute! Dilution in no way diminishes the efficacy of essential oils and offers many benefits that can enhance your application experience. Conduct a simple sensitivity test when trying a new oil by applying a small amount of essential oil to an inconspicuous area. Check the spot each hour for several hours to ensure no sensitivity has occurred. Other Effective Methods of Topical Application: Add a few drops of oil to a warm bath Make a hot or cold compress by soaking a towel or cloth in water, adding essential oils, and then applying to the desired area Add oil to a lotion or moisturizer and then apply to the skin Mix with water and use as a mouth and throat rinse Topical Use ofESSENTIAL OILS Topical application is one of the ways you can experience the benefits of dTERRA\u00ae essential oils. This form of application is unique because it allows for localized effects in the area of the application in addition to providing whole body support. Additionally, you can use essential oils topically when you want an easy way to target specific areas on your body.FACE Use essential oil as part of your regular skin care regimen to beautify the skin and promote a clear, healthy looking complexion.ROOF OF THE MOUTH (SOFT PALETTE)/BASE OF THE SKULL Applying oils to these areas is an excellent way to help transform your mood and balance your emotions.

Incorporating juices and smoothies into your diet can have health benefits like more stable energy, boosted im - munity, stronger workouts, better sleep, and clearer skin. You can create health through your kitchen using nature's ingredients and potent plant extracts\u2014essential oils. Juices vs. Smoothies: Which is better? Deciding between juice or smoothies comes down to which is best for you and your health goals. Here's a comparison with some simple tips to help guide your choices. Juice: Pulp and liquid are separated so you are left with a concentrated fruit and vegetable blended drink that provides instant vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. Juice contains virtually no fiber since it is separated from the pulp and other nutrients in the fruits and vegetables. The digestive system doesn't work as hard because there is no fiber to break down. As a result, the body is able to focus on rest and repair as nutrients are quickly assimilated. By removing the fiber, you can also include and consume more nutrients through the vegetables and fruits you juice. Freshly pressed juices are made using a juicer, and are ideal for hydration, cleansing, and cellular repair. Drink them daily as part of a prevention lifestyle, during a detoxification program, or if you have a chronic illness and need a nutrient-rich drink to nourish the body. Smoothie: All ingredients (liquid base, fruit, vegetables, and spices) are blended\u2014fiber included. Smoothies include fiber since the entire fruit and vegetable are blended. Fiber supports blood sugar balance and digestive health, including regular elimination. Fiber is broken apart when the fruits and vegetables are blended, which makes it easier to digest with an even release of nutrients for the body. Smoothies are made using a blender. A high- speed blender is ideal for smoother and more palatable drinks. You may enjoy smoothies as a meal on their own, as a nutritious snack, before or after a workout, or to end a detox or fast. Benefits of Using Essential Oils Are your juices and smoothies missing an essential ingredient? Flavoring juices and smoothies with essential oils is tasty, but using essential oils internally is also an important daily health habit. Essential oils support the mouth, throat, digestive system, and immune system. Can you imagine drinking a chocolate-mint smoothie that is not only delicious, but part of a healthy lifestyle too? Here are some of the most common essential oils to use in juices and smoothies, along with their benefits: Cinnamon: Helps warm the body as well as invigorates and uplifts mood; supports diges - tion and immunity. Cilantro: Provides antioxidants, aids in digestion, soothes the skin, and promotes detoxification. Fennel: Soothes digestive discomfort. Ginger: Aids with indigestion and occasional nausea, also eases congestion. Grapefruit: Supports weight loss, boosts the metabolism, and helps reduce food cravings. Lemon: Stimulates cleansing and promotes lymphatic flow; provides respiratory support and uplifts mood. Lime: Provides uplifts mood. Peppermint: Soothes digestive issues, has a cooling sensation for fresh breath, and helps open airways. Wild Orange: Stimulates the lymphatic system, energizes and digestive issues.

It's best to peel conventionally grown fruits and vegetables to reduce exposure to chemicals and pesticides. You should also peel citrus fruits for blending; however, there's no need to remove the white inner peel which is rich in nutrients. Other fruits that have thicker skins, like mangoes and bananas, should be peeled before blending. 2. Save Time Wash and prepare your fruits and vegetables before you store them in the refrigerator. You can cut them into pieces that will fit into the juicer. Cleaning a juicer can be quicker and easier with a natural scrubbing paste made with 1 cup baking soda, 1 tablespoon castile soap, 1 tablespoon white vinegar, and 10 drops of Lemon essential oil. Add water to form the mixture into a paste and use it regularly to ease your scrubbing woes. 3. Avoid Chunky Smoothies Greens are an important part of smoothies because they contain fiber and other nutrients, making them a simple way to add more vegetables to your diet. Leafy greens also help balance blood sugar in a smoothie that contains high sugar fruits, like bananas and mangoes. However, some people add greens and end up with chunky smoothies! To make your drink more palatable, use a high-speed blender or blend your liquid base and greens first. Then, add the remaining ingredients for a chunk-free smoothie. 4. Less Is More How many drops of essential oil should you use? When using essential oils in juices and smoothies for their flavor and health benefits, one drop or less may be the most palatable. Start with one drop and add more to taste. If you're making a single serving, you might even start by dipping a toothpick into the bottle, mix throughout the drink, and taste the juice or smoothie before adding more. 5 Avoid plastic bottles Pour and store your juice or smoothie in a glass, ceramic, or steel bottle as essential oils break down synthetics in plastic bottles and containers. www.doterra.com / 2728 / SPRING 2015 LIVING MAGAZINE 28 / FALL 2014 LIVING MAGAZINE Lane Taylor graduated from Oklahoma State in 2012. He grew up in Arlington, Texas, where he started playing football in the fifth grade. He was an offensive lineman in high school. At OSU, he was an offensive guard and started all four years. He was an undrafted free agent in 2013 when the Green Bay Packers scooped him up as an offensive guard. Kasey Taylor also attended Oklahoma State. She enjoys cooking, crafting, hanging out with friends, watching football, and making DIY projects with dTERRA \u00ae essential oils. Most importantly, she loves spending time with her daughter Bryleigh, her husband Lane, and other Packer wives. Kasey is excited to be actively growing her dTERRA business. She enjoys teaching others how to use dTERRA essential oils, and espe - cially loves sharing her love for DIYs with essential oils. She is exploring healthy options for her family and ways to incorporate essential oils in her daily life. How has do-TERRA helped you as a mom? Kasey: I don't have to worry about my child being ex - posed to harmful chemicals. dTERRA gives me peace of mind as a mom. I know that my house is clean when I diffuse On Guard even when we have company over for the holidays. I love knowing that I can prevent or take care of issues at home by myself at the first sign.

I later learned that Ann was a co-founder of One Essential Community, and had built a large team of Wellness Advocates. I asked Ann if she would teach me about the oils and she invited me to her home for some DIY projects. The next time I decided to bring my mom. Now we are both dTERRA Wellness Advocates and avid DIYers. How can do-TERRA products benefit athletes in general? Lane: Health in general is important for athletes, and dTERRA is all about helping increase your overall health and wellness. Less chemicals and more natural products makes a difference. When you're an athlete, everything you put into your body matters. And, of course, the products I love help me be at my best and boost my performance. What do-TERRA products do you use the most? On Guard\u00ae: On Guard is my go to all the time. It works so well. We use it in the diffuser, as a roll-on for our feet, in the beadlets, and in a DIY hand cleanser. I keep it in my purse and use it multiple times throughout the day. I even use it to spray the table off at a restaurant. I dilute it with Fractionated Coconut Oil and apply it to Bryleigh's feet and down her back. Lavender: I diffuse Lavender in Bryleigh's room at night to help her fall asleep and have a restful sleep. The first time we diffused Lavender, Bryleigh fell asleep in less than 10 minutes and slept a good 12 hours. Before the Lavender, she had a hard time falling asleep. Every mother's dream is a little one who sleeps a solid 12 hours. Peppermint Beadlets: Lane and I both like to take them after a meal, or when we need an extra energy boost.

Imagine you had a magnifying glass strong enough to see down to the molecular level. Take that magnifying glass and peek into a drop of essential oil. What you'd find is an astonishing array of natural plant chemicals carefully honed by millennia of evolution, meticulously sourced and harvested to preserve the unique bouquet, and painstakingly extracted to capture the true ratios of physiologically active components. What you'd see in that drop of essential oil is one of nature's finest creations.Like humans, plants need to communicate with their neighbors. They need to ward off pests, fight off invaders, attract the right helpers, and heal after injury. Many of the chemicals they use in these processes are what we know as essential oils. The variety of essential oil compounds is staggering: monoterpenes, diterpenes, sesquiterpenes, esters, alcohols, and terpenoids, to name a few. It's likely that some essential oils will contain compounds we've never seen before\u2014only a fraction of plant species have been evaluated for their health benefits. Essential oils are useful in many ways, but their true distinctiveness lies in several characteristics: volatility, synergy, and adaptability. Essential oils are unique and elegantly functional, because they contain a mixture of highly volatile components. This is one of the stationary plant's best tools. How could a peppermint plant communicate with its neighbors? Can't pull up roots, so send over a volatile molecule. How could the peppermint plant tell a hungry bug to stay away from its leaves or roots? Secrete volatile molecules and allow them to surround the plant like an invisible shield. Historically, humans have harnessed this chemical volatility for wellness purposes. Science is just now beginning to understand the physiological processes at work when an essential oil is inhaled. These statements have not been evaluated by the Federal Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent desease.www.doterra.com / 31 Take Lavender, for example. Multiple studies show that Lavender essential oil offers far more than just a pleasant smell. Inhaled Lavender oil has been shown to directly affect the brain's serotonin system, 1 upregulate antioxidant enzymes,2 and maintain open airways.3 All those volatile chemicals can enter our nasal passages and begin to interact with our physiology almost instantaneously. It's one of the ways essential oils are so powerful. Another key to essential oil chemistry lies in the delicate balance of components. A drop of essential oil is like a snapshot of the plant's unique makeup and environment. All of the chemicals in the essential oil (hundreds of chemicals, in some cases) play some role in the plant's physiology. And all of those components make a complete oil that's unique, like a fingerprint\u2014and that's far more than the sum of its parts. We don't fully understand the synergy of essential oils. We know that in many cases, an oil contains a handful of main active components\u2014players like pinene, eugenol, limonene, linalool, and carvacrol\u2014and a whole host of \"trace\" components. Sometimes these are precursors or reaction products of the main players. Sometimes these are just individual chemicals thrown into the mix\u2014a little of this, a dash of that, all contributing to an amazing final product. The interesting thing is that multiple studies have illustrated the synergy of essential oil components. One recent study, for example, took seven essential oils and tested their antioxidant properties, comparing those results against the same tests run with the single most abundant component in each oil. The study found that an oil's antioxidant capability can't always be traced to one main component. Often, it's the supporting \"trace\" chemicals that modulate and interact with each other in ways we don't yet realize. Humans evolved with plants. Our physical makeup is based on the same organic molecules. We're subject to similar environmental stressors and threats. It's therefore no surprise that the chemicals developed by plants for protection and environmental adaptation are powerful agents within the human body, too. Unlike chemicals manufactured in a lab, essential oils change. They adapt. They morph into whatever chemical cocktail will best support the plant's survival. It is this adaptability that has caught the interest of scientists and medical professionals. Could natural, plant-based options be better for our wellness than static chemicals that have lost their effectiveness? Ongoing research will answer that question. A plant fights hard for survival; we benefit from that ever-changing fight. A single drop. That's the unit by which we measure essential oils and talk about their chemical components. It's also the current extent of our scientific knowledge\u2014a single drop in a vast ocean of possibilities waiting to be explored. We'll glean that information about just how unique and powerful essential oils are one research study after another. One drop at a time.

GUY'S GUIDE TO BETTER NUTRITION Dr. Tory Parker, Ph.D. in Nutritional Science One of the challenges men face is getting the right balance between meats and other healthy foods. Meat is a good source of many nutrients (protein and iron, for example), but a poor source of other equally important nutrients (like fiber, antioxidants, and phytonutrients). A good rule of thumb is to make sure the amount of vegetables on your plate is at least the same as the meat on your plate. Another tip is to consider meat as a flavoring ingre - dient, rather than a main ingredient. Some chopped meat can significantly improve the flavor of other foods, making them more palatable. What about Protein? While it's true that you need more protein when you are exercising or building muscle, you don't need that much more. Most men eat enough protein when inactive to satisfy the needs of the body even if you were gaining muscle. Thus you don't need to increase your protein that much. I have spoken with trainers who recommended 200 grams of protein a day to everyone. This is an expensive way to get carbs. All the excess protein that your body can't use just gets converted into carbohydrate (which you also need, but can get from other sources)! A good rule of thumb for effective body building is 0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weight, or just 125 grams per day for a 180 pound man. You wouldn't need 200 grams of protein until you weighed 285 pounds with low body fat. This applies only to the very top percentage of competitive body builders, which is probably why it is the amount people imitate. In contrast, the average sedentary male needs only 56 grams of protein a day, or 0.4 grams per pound. A 3 ounce deck-of-card-sized hamburger will provide 22 grams. A cup of milk provides 8 grams. If you had a meatless burrito for lunch, it would provide 21 grams in a half cup of black beans; more from the cheese and meat if they are included. Healthy eating habits that are easy to followWhole Wheat Pancakes Two fruit sources a day- fresh or dried fruit with or on your hot or cold breakfast, and an apple in the afternoon. Two vegetable sources a day- something with lunch and something with dinner Substitute whole grains whenever you get the chance. A majority of antioxidants are bound up in the fiber of foods. Fiber is good for all of your body, not just for your intestines! (See whole wheat pancake recipe to the right). Give the Lifelong Vitality pack a try. Men benefit from quality supplements regardless of their diet. Good supplements provide not only potentially missing nutrients, but also many beneficial ingredients that are not normally obtainable from food. Consider taking PB Assist\u00ae. It is important to get healthy bacteria to combat exposure to unhealthy bacteria in your daily life.Ingredients: 1 egg \u00bc teaspoon salt 1 cup almond milk 2 teaspoons sugar 1 cup whole wheat flour \u00bd teaspoon baking powder \u00bc teaspoon baking soda 2 tablespoons melted butter 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar* Directions: 1.
