Hepatitis B Vaccine Series All infants should complete the Hepatitis B vaccine series with either a single -antigen or combination vaccine, according to the ACIP - recommended hepatitis B vaccination schedule . Hepatitis B Post -Vaccination Serologic Testing (PVST) All infants born to HBsAg -positive pregnant women or infants born to women whose HBsAg status remains unknown indefinitely (e.g., safe surrender infants) should be tested for HBsAg and anti -HBs after completion of the vaccine series. PVST testing should be done one to two months after completion of the vaccine series, but no earlier than 9 months of age. For infants who complete the vaccine series on time at 6 months of age, PVST testing should be done at 9 months of age. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 7 Chapter 1 Program Background and Introduction Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 8 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 9 Background Screening of all pregnant women for hepatitis B has been recommended since 1991 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). On June 18, 1999, Governor George W. Bush signed legislation requiring pregnant women in Texas to be screened for HBV infection at their first prenatal examination and at delivery for each pregnancy. This law became effective September 1, 1999; and applies to the provider who attends to a pregnant woman during gestation and/or at delivery of her infant* . In July 2019, the U.S . Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reiterated the importance of screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in pregnant women at their first prenatal visit by giving it an \"A\" recommendation. This means there is significant evidence to prove that this screening is beneficial. The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) was first implemented in 1991 in Harris, Tarrant, and Dallas counties , as well as the cities of Houston and San Antonio. In 2001, the program was expanded to provide services to the entire state. The program was tasked with six key responsibilities: Identify ALL HBsAg -positive pregnant women and their infants in Texas , Assure administration of Post -Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is given within 12 hours of birth to exposed infants , Identify and vaccinate susceptible household contacts 24 months of age and ensure adult household and sexual contact s are referred out , Ensure hepatitis B vaccine birth doses are universally administered, Assure completion of hepatitis B vaccine series and Post -Vaccination Serologic Testing (PVST) of exposed infants , and Conduct active surveillance, quality assurance, o utreach, and education to improve PHBPP program outcomes . Although vaccine prevention and awareness has steadily increased since the start of the program, it was estimated in 2016 by the Centers f or Disease Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 10 Control and Prevention (CDC) that 921 -1,231** infants were born to Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) positive women in Texas. However, the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program ( PHBPP ) identified 660* infants as being born to HBsAg- positive women in 2017. In 2018 , a total of 3,322 cases of acute hepatitis B were reported nationwide to the CDC , with the highest rate amongst 4 0-49-year-olds. From 2011 - 2016, rates of acute hepatitis B were repeatedly highest among persons aged 30 -39 years old, however, 2017 and 2018 saw the highest ra te in 40-49-year-olds. The CDC reported in 2018 that over half of all acute hepatitis B cases were in individuals 30- 49 years old. Perinatal transmission of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is highly efficient and usually occurs from blood exposures during labor and delivery. Although in utero transmission is rare, it does account for nearly 2% of perinatal infections in most studies. Ever y year, it is estimated that 25,000 infants are born to women chronically infected with hepatitis B in the U .S. Without timely Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) at birth, approximately 90% of these infants would become chronically infected and approximately 25% of the infected would die premature ly of liver failure or liver cancer . Transmission of hepatitis B to these high -risk babies could be prevented 85-95% of the time by providing appropriate PEP within 12 hours of birth, as described in this manual. Although perinatal hepatitis B has been nationally notifiable since 1995, the report ing of cases has not been re liable for monitoring purposes. Less than 5% of the HBV infections that occur among children are reported as cases of acute hepatitis B to the CDC because these infections in infants and children rarely produce signs or symptoms of disease until other complications arise. Infants infected during their first year of life have a 90 % chance of developing a chronic HBV infection compared to only 25- 50% of children infected between ages 1 and 5 years old . In contrast , less than 5% of otherwise healthy people who become infected during adulthood will develop a chronic infection. Prior to routine PEP of infants and children, cases occurring in children accounted for a disproportionate amount of the disease burden due to chronic infection. According to the 201 8 National Immunization Survey (NIS), 89.2% of Texas children aged 19 -35 months, have received three (3) or more doses of hepatitis B vaccine. The 201 8 NIS results also show that 7 9.4% of children Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 11 in Texas received the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine between birth and three (3) days of age. * Under Texas law, both acute and chronic infection of hepatitis B in a pregnant woman are conditions that must be reporte d to the DSHS. The Texas Health & Safety Code Title 2, Chapter 81 authorizes LHDs to conduct disease investigations and gather all pertinent medical information. ** Numbers are not inclusive of City of Houston and City of San Antonio . The 10 Key Elements of the Perinatal Hepatitis B Preventi on Program The DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP has several important features including, but not limited to surveillance ; case management ; promotion of the universal birth dose ; and collaboration between DSHS Public Health Region (PHR) offices, Local Health Department (LHD ) offices , medical providers, and laboratories. The 10 objectives of the program are listed below. All case management and reporting forms can be found online at www.texasperinatalhepb .org . 1) Ensure that all pregnant women are tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). (Refer to Chapter 5) According to Texas law, providers must screen pregnant women for hepatitis B infection at the first prenatal examination (regardless of trimester) and upon delivery, or as soon as feasibly possible thereafter. The CDC recommends the HBsAg as the preferred test for screening for HBV infection during pregnancy. ACIP also recommends HBV DNA viral load testing for HBsAg -positive pregnant women to guide antiviral therapy as needed . HBsAg testing should be incorporated into standard prenatal testing panels used by all providers caring for pregnant women. It is recommended that the hepatitis B serologic marker (HBsAg CPT code 87341) and reason for testing (pregnancy) be specified when submitting these specimens to the laboratory. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 12 Providers should notify all HBsAg -positive pregnant women of their positive status as soon as possible and give them a copy of the original laboratory result. Providers should provide education to all HBsAg- positive pregnant women regarding the potential risks to their infant and what measures (e.g., HBIG, hepatitis B vaccine series, Post -Vaccination Serologic Testing [PVST]) can be taken in an effort to protect the child from Hepatitis B transmission. The pa tient should also be informed that the DSHS PHR or LHD will be conta cting them for case management. Delivery facilities/hospitals should determine if a pregnant woman presenting to their facility was screened for HBsAg prenatally and document those results in both the mother 's and infant's medical records. Delivery facilities/hospitals must draw blood to screen for HBV infection at delivery, regardless of the result obtained at the prenatal examination. Delivery facilities/hospitals should safeguard against errors in maternal HBsAg testing and failures in test reporting. This can be done by: o Maintaining standing orders for immediate HBsAg testing of all pregnant women upon admission for delivery . o Ordering admission lab tests that specify to draw \"HBsAg \", to avoid confusion with other hepatitis serologic markers. o Including a copy of the original HBsAg laboratory report in the delivery record. 2) Ensure reporting and case management of all HBsAg -positive women. (Refer to Chapter 7) All HBsAg -positive pregnant women must be reported to the DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP for case management of the mother and infant(s). Reporting can be accomplished by providing information directly to the appropriate DSHS PHR or LHD .Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 13 3) Ensure that delivery facilities/hospitals receive all prenatal HBsAg lab reports prior to delivery. (Refer to Chapter 5) HBsAg test results should be included on all forms (hard copy and electronic) used by providers to record and transmit information about care during pregnancy. For all pregnant women, a copy of the original HBsAg laboratory result should be transferred from the prenatal care provider to the delivery hospital wit h the mother's medical records. Providers caring for HBsAg -positive pregnant women should remind delivery staff (doctors, midwives, nurses) of HBsAg -positive status during a client's pregnancy to ensure the baby receives all necessary care upon delivery. 4) Ensure identification and management of infants born to HBsAg -positive women . (Refer to Chapter 4) Delivery facilities/hospitals should implement policies and procedures to ensure proper identification of HBsAg- positive pregnant women and their infants. (Refer to Appendix E for examples.) All infants born to HBsAg -positive women require the administration of PEP within 12 hours of birth. Delivery facilities/hospitals must document all required information. (R efer to number 5 under Key Elements for reporting information. ) Document proper hea lth information on the medical data worksheet for the infant's birth certificate (hepatitis B infection during pregnancy). If an HBsAg -positive woman refuses PEP for her newborn, providers must ensure that the mother is informed and educated about her status and the potential consequences to her newborn(s) and the option to receive PEP up to seven days after delivery. Document in the infant's medical record the mother's signed declination against medical advice (AMA) form (facility specific) against the medically recommended treatment for her infant(s) and all education provided regarding hepatitis B and the potential consequences to her newborn(s). Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 14 5) Ensure reporting of HBsAg -positive women and infants to the health department . (Refer to Chapter 5) HBsAg -positive mothers must be reported within one (1) week by completing the Mother Case Management Report form and sending it to either their DSHS PHR or LHD. HBsAg -positive infants must be reported within one (1) day by completing the Infant Case Management Report form and sending it to either their DSHS PHR or LHD. Delivery facilities/ho spitals must document and report the following information on the Hospital/Provider Report form : o Maternal HBsAg status (and other serology) at time of delivery , o Prenatal Provider & Infant Provider , o Date and T ime of B irth, o Birth Weight, and o HBIG and H epatitis B vaccine administration date and time to Chapter 4, Post -Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) , for chart of manufacturers and formulations of HBIG . 6) Ensure identification and management of infants born to women of unknown HBsAg status. ( Refer to Chapter 4 ) Delivery facilities/hospitals should implement policies and procedures to ensure prompt identificat ion and appropriate PEP administration to infants born to women of unknown HBsAg status. An infant whose mother's HBsAg test result comes back positive should immediately receive HBIG. Document Hepatitis B infection present during pregnancy on the medical data worksheet for the infant's birth certificate (i.e., Hepatitis B during pregnancy). Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 15 Complete the \"Provider/Hospital Report of a HBsAg -Positive Mother\" form and send to the local health department. Document the positive HBsAg result in the mother 's and infant' s chart s. 7) Ensure timely completion of the hepatitis B vaccine series for all infants born to HBsAg -positive women . (Refer to Chapter 4) Dose one should ideally be given within 12 hours of birth, and preferably no later than by hospital discharge. Dose two should be given at 1 month of age, but no later than 2 months of age. Dose three should be given at 6 months of age: o Must be given at least eight (8) weeks after dose two AND o At least 16 weeks after dose one. Combination vaccines may be used to complete the series, giving the infant a total of fou r doses of hepatitis B vaccine. Providers should document the date, lot number, and name/manufacturer for each dose of the hepatitis B vaccine administered to the infant. If the c hild was not already registered for the Texas Immunization Registry (ImmTrac2) at birth, parental consent should be obtained. The vaccination history of the infant should then be entered into ImmTrac2 as soon as possible after each visit. 8) Ensure timely completion of PVST for all infants born to HBsAg - positive women. (Refer to Chapter 4) To determine infant outcomes after appropriate PEP, PVST should be performed on all infants born to HBsAg- positive women or infants born to women whose HBsAg stat us remains unknown indefinitely (e.g., safe surrender infants) once: o the infant has completed a full hepatitis B vaccine series o the infant is at least nine months of age o at least one month has passed since the infant received the final dose of a hepatitis B containing vaccine Providers should order: o HBsA g (CPT: 87340) and o Quantitative 86137) Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 16 Providers should document the infant's PVST results and report all results (positive or negative) to their regional or local health department . 9) Ensure vaccination of household contacts 24 months of age. (Refer to Chapter 7 for case management of household contacts) Household contacts 24 months of age and younger must be identified and a case management record initiated within 15 days of notification. These contacts must be offered serologic testing (HBsAg and anti - HBs) and, if susceptible to HBV infection, initiate the hepatitis B vaccine series. If needed, both the testing and vaccine are provided free of charge through the PHBPP for all contacts 24 months of age. Refer to Chapter 7 for additional information. Records for contacts 24 months of age are closed upon hepatitis B vaccine series completion and PVST results. Revaccination may be needed before the case can be closed. All contacts >24 months of age , as well as all sexual partners to the HBsAg -positive mother, should be referred to a healthcare provider for Hepatitis B serology testing and vaccination as needed for health care evaluation. 10) Ensure program quality, monitoring, and evaluation. Central office provides the following monthly quality assurance reports to PHR and LHD case managers: o Infants past due for vaccines and/or serology , o Women past due , based on their Estimated Due Dates (EDD ), o Infants missing Post -Exposure Prophylaxis, and o Dashboard of PHBPP outcomes . Central office also provides the following reports to help increase identification of HBsAg -positive pregnant women: o Report from the Texas National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) of women of childbearing age with a positive HBsAg ; and Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 17 o Report from the Vital Statistics Unit of women who indicated Hepatitis B was present during pregnancy on the birth ce rtificate medical questionnaire. The PHR/LHD case manager is responsible for reviewing these lists monthly and reporting outcomes of these cases back to Central Office as indicated in the report instructions. Central Office may also create and send out additional reports not listed abo ve to help improve the program. The LHD/PHR case managers are also responsible for providing training and education to birthing hospitals , prenatal providers, and pediatric providers. The trainings should cover the entire PHBPP program, Texas laws related to screening and reporting, and the importance of the uni versal Hepatitis B birth dose. If any of the below occur, an Investigational Report form should be completed to determine the cause: o Missed maternal screening during pregnancy and/or at delivery . o Infant does not receive the appropriate PEP within 12 hours of birth. o Child misses any of the hepatitis B vaccine doses . o PVST is not done as required. Once the case manager has identified problems on the Investigational Report form, training will be provided by the DSHS PHR or LHD in an attempt to co rrect any identified error(s).

The virus is found in the blood and certain body fluids (serum, semen, saliva, and vaginal secretions) of people infected. I t is relatively stable and has been shown to remain infectious on environmental surfaces for more than seven (7) days at room temperature. It is a small, round, enveloped virus with partially double -stranded circular Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) and is high ly infectious; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that percutaneous or mucosal exposure to Hepatitis B is 50 to 100 times more infectious than the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). There are nine serotypes and eight genotypes of HBV recognized worldwide. HBV Infection HBV infection is a major cause of acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, and liver cancer. It is the most prevalent chronic infectious disease in the world, a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and a major health problem in the U .S. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that two billion people have been infected worldwide with the hepatitis B virus. The CDC estimates 257 million remain chronically infected globally while more than 887,000 people die every year due to the consequences of the virus. The highest hepatitis B infection rates are found in sub- Saharan Africa and East Asia. Five to ten percent of the adult population in these areas are chronically infected and most bec ame infected during childhood . Liver cancer caused by hepatitis B is among the top three causes of cancer -related death in men, and a major cause of cancer in women in these regions. In the U .S., the CDC estimate s 862,000 are living with chronic hepatitis B infection. Also, it is estimated that between 3,000 -4,000 people in the U .S. die of h epatitis B-related cirrhosis each year. After exposure, HBV is transported by the bloodstream to the liver, which is the primary site o f viral replication. Infection in adults is generally self - limited, meaning the immune system can eliminate the virus from the blood and provide lasting immunity against reinfection in about 95 % of cases. The remainder of adults whose immune systems do not eliminate the virus will Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 22 develop a chronic, lifelong infection. A person with chronic hepatitis B is defined by the CDC as someone with HBsAg present in their bloodstream for greater than six months with continuing viral replication and persistent viremia . (See Figure 2.1.) These \"chronic carriers\" can transmit the virus to other i ndividuals who are unprotected. Figure 2.1. Progression to Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection, Typical Serologic Course Communicability Persons with either acute or chronic HBV infection should be considered potentially infectious. Clinical Manifestations The clinical manifestations of acute HBV infection are age dependent. Infants, children younger than 10 years of age, and immunosuppressed adults with newly acquired HBV infection are usually asymptomatic (no symptoms) . Mean while, approximately 30-50% of adults will show symptoms of infection. Because many infected persons are asymptomatic, they are often unaware they are infected, resulting in inadvertent transmission to others. Additionally, infected individuals can transmit the Progression to Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection Typical Serologic Course Weeks after Exposure Titer IgM anti -HBcTotal anti (6 months) HBeAgChronic (Years) 04812162024283236 52 YearsTexas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 23 virus before symptom onset. When symptoms occur, they are not specific to hepatitis B; therefore, laboratory testing is required to distinguish HBV from other diseases. Signs and Symptoms The incubation period for HBV infection ranges from 60 to 150 days (average of 90 days). The preicteric (before jaundice) , or prodromal, phase usually lasts from three to ten days , from initial on set of symptoms to jaundice. Symptoms of this phase may include, but are not limited to: malaise headache anorexia myalgia nausea skin rashes vomiting arthralgia fever arthritis right upper quadrant abdominal pain dark urine starting one to two days before the onset of jaundice The icteric (jaundice) phase is variable but usually lasts one to three weeks. It is characterized by yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes , and conjunctiva; and hepatomegaly (liver enlargement). During convalescence, malaise and fatigue may persist for weeks or months as the other signs and symptoms disappear. Treatment No specific treatment exists for acute hepatitis B; supportive ca re is the mainstay of therapy. Persons who ha ve chronic HBV infection require medical evaluation and regular monitoring. Therapeutic agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of chronic hepatitis B can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liv er disease in some persons. Patients interested in treatment should seek a referral from their physician to a gastroenterologist, hepatologist, or an infectious disease specialist. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 24 For more information on acute and chronic HBV infections, please consult The Red Book: Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases (31st Edition) or visit http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HBV/ . Complications The complications of chronic infection include chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Persons with chronic HBV infection are at a much higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma than non - carriers. Approximately 25 % of persons who become chronically infected die prematurely from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. This means that approximately, 3,000 to 4,000 people die each year of HBV -related cirrhosis and approximately 1,000 to 1,500 people die each year from HBV -related liver cancer in the U .S. HBV infection is estimated to be the cause of 80% of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. The complications that arise are typically associated with chronic HBV infections. However, in a small number of cases, acute infections can result in fulminate hepatic failure and death. Fulmina nt hepatitis occurs in about 1 - 2% of acutely infected persons and has a mortality rate of 0.5 -1%, although mortality is suspected to be higher in acutely infected infants. About 200 to 300 Americans die each year of fulminant disease. Epidemiology of the Hepatitis B Virus Reservoir The natural host for the hepatitis B virus is humans. The virus is not known to naturally infect animals, although some non -human primates have been infected under laboratory conditions. Transmission The hepatitis B virus is transmitted by parenteral or mucosal exposure to HBsAg -positive body fluids or tissues from persons who have acute or chronic HBV infection. Parenteral exposure routes include, but are not limited to: intravenous (IV) drug use , shared razor , accidental needle sticks or sharps injuries, Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 25 contaminated multi -dose vials or medical equipment , and other breaches of blood -borne pathogen infection control practices. Mucosal exposure can occur from: birth sexual contact accidental blood exposure to the eyes or mouth shared household products (i.e. , toothbrush) other routes if appropriate barrier precautions are not taken. The highest concentrations of virus are in blood, serous fluids, and wound exudates; lower titers are found in other fluids, such as s aliva and semen. Saliva can be a vehicle of transmission through bites , however, other types of exposure to saliva, including kissing, are unlikely modes of transmission. There appears to be no transmission of HBV via tears, sweat, urine, stool, or droplet nuclei. See Table 2.1. As previously mentioned, HBV infection can also be transmitted through sexual contact, either heterosexual or homosexual, with an infected person. It is thought that transmission occurs among men who have sex with men (MSM), possibly via contamination from asymptomatic rectal mucosal lesions. Fecal-oral transmission does not appear to occur. Transmission in healthcare setting s, long -term care facilities , and in- home health settings are well described due to breaches in infection cont rol practices . Table 2.1. Concentration of Hepatitis B Virus in Various Body Fluids High Moderate Low/Non -detectable Blood Serum Wound exudates Semen Vaginal fluid Saliva Urine Feces Sweat Tears Breast milk Because HBV can survive for more than seven (7) days on environmental surfaces at room temperature, indirect inoculation of HBV can occur via inanimate objects. A 10% bleach and water solution is recommended to decontaminate a surface after a blood spill. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 26 Perinatal Transmission Transmission of HBV from mother to infant during the perinatal period represents one of the most efficient modes of HBV infection. The risk of perinatal transmission is directly related to the viral load of the mother. The hepatitis B \"little e \" antigen (HBeAg) marker is a commonly used indicator of active viral replication and , thus, high viral load. The absence of HBeAg is generally associated with a low viral load and a lower likelihood of transmission to the infant. However, appro ximately 20 -30% of the chronic infections in the U .S. are due to a variant of HBV called a \"pre -core mutant.\" This variant of the virus does not produce e -antigen while replicating . This pre-core mutant variant may have a viral load somewhere in between the e-antigen positive and e -antigen negative cases. HBV viral load can be directly measured and quantified using molecular technology. For a newborn whose mother is positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg, the risk for ch ronic HBV infection is 70 -90% by six (6) months of age in the absence of PEP (HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine). However , if the mother is HBsAg - positive but HBeAg -negative, the risk for chronic infection to the infant becomes less than 10 % in the absence of PEP. The exact mechanism of transmission remains unclear, although the mode of delivery (vaginal versus C -section) does not appear to have an impact on the risk of perinatal HBV infection. Infection during pregnancy can occur during the intrauterine, or int rapartum (delivery) periods , however, HBV transmission mainly occurs during delivery. Intrauterine (in utero) transmission is relatively rare, accounting for less than 2% of perinatal infections in most studies. Hepatitis B viral DNA and HBsAg have been detected in amniotic fluid, placental cells , and vaginal secretions of HBsAg - positive women during pregnancy , as well as in the cord blood of their neonates. Postpartum transmission through exposure to infectious maternal saliva, stool, or urine is quite rare. It has previously been believed that breastfeeding serves as an additional mechanism by which infants may acquire HBV infection. Although trace amounts of HBsAg have been found in breast milk, research strongly suggests that any risk of transmission associated with breast milk is negligible compared to the high risk of exposure to maternal blood and fluids at birth. Because there is no evidence that breastfeeding from an HBV - infected mother poses an additional risk to the infant, even without immunizatio n, both the CDC and WHO support mothers breastfeeding in these cases. They s tate it is safe for an infecte d woman to breastfeed her Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 27 child, as the benefits outweigh the risks. All mothers who breastfeed should pay particular attention to the care of their n ipples to avoid any cracking and bleeding. Other Risk Factors Associated with Hepatitis B People born in Asia, Africa, and other regions with moderate or high rates of hepatitis B (See Figure 2.2.) Unvaccinated people whose parents are from regions with high rates of hepatitis B Anyone having sex with a person infected with hepatitis B People who live with someone with hepatitis B Men who have sexual encounters with other men (MSM) People who inject drugs People with HIV infection People on hemodialy sis Healthcare workers Figure 2.2. Geographic Distribution of Chronic HBV Infection Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 28 HBV Lab oratory Testing There are several antigenic components of the virus that can result in a variety of positive laboratory tests at different points in an infection. The HBsAg is found on the surface of the virus and can be identified in serum samples 30 -60 days after exposure to the virus. This component of the virus is not infectious itself, but its presence in the blood indicates that the complete virus i s present , and that the person can transmit the virus to others. Once the immune system detects the HBsAg component of the virus, whether through acute infection or after vaccination, it begins to develop antibodies (anti -HBs). The presence of anti -HBs in the serum indicates immunity to the virus. Anti -HBs may also be referred to as hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), which can easily be confused with HBsAg. Available laboratory testing attempts to detect these various components and antibodies as they be come active. (See Figure 2. 3) Figure 2.3. Acute HBV Infection with Recovery, Typical Serologic Course The most common uses for test ing are to determine whether a patient's signs and symptoms are due to HBV infection, to diagnose and monitor Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 29 chronic infection, and to detect previous exposure to the virus. Testing may also be done to: screen for infection in at -risk populations or blood donors to determine carrier status screen for immunity due to vaccination or prior infection (See Table 2.2) Table 2.2. Diagnostic Tests for HBV Antigens and Antibodies , Quick Reference Factor to Be Tested HBV Antigen or Antibody Purpose HBsAg Hepatitis B surface antigen Detection of acutely or chronically infected persons.

HBV DNA levels guide anti-viral therapy. Diagnostic Tests for HBV Diagnosis of HBV infection (acute vs. chronic) is based on clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic findings. HBV infection cannot be differentiated from other liver disease based on clinical symptoms alone , and definitive diagnosis depends on the results o f laboratory testing. Serologic markers of HBV infection vary depending on whether the infection is acute , Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 30 chronic , or resolved. C ommercial tests for Hepatitis B , as summarized in Table 2.2 , are widely available and used for various clinical purposes. Refer to Chapter 5 for more detail on the diagnostic tests for HBV antigens and antibodies. Refer to Appendix D for comprehensive CDC resources on the interpretation of hepatitis B serology and information on assays not routinely required for the PHBPP.Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 31 Chapter 2: Le arning Check 1. True or False: Chronic hepatitis B can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer . Answer: True! Chronic Hepatitis B can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure , and liver cancer. Worldwide, the most common risk factor for liver cancer is a chronic infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. The Hepatitis B vaccine was the f irst cancer preventing vaccine. 2. Hepatitis B virus is spread in the following ways: A. Breastfeeding B. Needle sticks C. During childbirth D. Both B & C Answer: D: Hepatitis B is spread through parenteral or mucosal exposure to HBsAg positive body fluids or tissues from those who have acute or chronic hepati tis B. Breast milk is thought to contain negligible amounts of hepatitis B and CDC & WHO state that it is safe for an infected mot her to breastfeed their infant. 3. Which of the following clients should be screened, based on their risk factors? A. A recent immigrant from Nigeria B. A client who recently started dialysis C. A recent immigrant from Mexico D. Someone who reports a history of injection drug use E. A, B, & D Answer: E: Some risk factors for hepatitis B include people born in Asia, Africa , and other regions with moderate or high rates of hepatitis B; people on hemodialysis ; and people who inject drugs. Mexico is not an area with high Hepatitis B infections per the CDC's yellow book.

The primary focus of the ACIP childhood recommendations is the universal vaccination of infants as a \" safety net\" to prevent early childhood HBV infection. The strategies to prevent hepatitis B infection in children i nclude, but are not limited to: Universal vaccination of infants beginning at birth Routine screening of all pregnant women for Hepatitis B S urface Antigen (HBsAg) Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) of infants born to HBsAg- positive women or to women with unknown HBsAg status Routine vaccination of previously unvaccinated children and adolescents In this document, the CDC also provides strategies to enhance implementation of the ACIP recommendations, such as: Establishing standing orders for administration of hepatitis B vaccination at birth ; and Implementing policies and procedures to improve identification of, and administration of PEP to, infants born to: o mothers who are HBsAg positive , and o mothers with unknown HBsAg status at the time of delivery . The CDC and ACIP recommend that providers who practice in primary care and at -risk specialty settings should implement standing orders to identify their at- risk patients a nd subsequently vaccinate them. The document can be accessed electronically at: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm . The Institute of Medic ine (IOM) (now called National Academy of Medicine [NAM]) also released a report on preventing and controlling viral hepatitis infections in the U.S. After reviewing evidence on the prevention and control of hepatitis B and hepatitis C, the committee identified the underlying factors Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 44 that impeded current efforts to prevent and control these diseases. In this report, Hepatitis and Liver Cancer: A National Strategy for Prevention and Control of Hepatitis B and C , the committee offers recommendations in four categories: surveillance, knowledge and awareness, immunization, and services for viral hepatitis. This document, along with recommendations from ACIP can be found at the following web site: http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/pdfs/iom -hepatitisandlivercancerreport.pdf . Post- Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is derived from human plasma. The plasma, which is processed from select human donors with high Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (anti -HBs) titers, contains antibodies that are specific to the hepatitis B virus. Although HBIG is derived from humans, it is purified to prevent passing along disease to the person who receives it. HBIG is used to give temporary protection for individuals who might have been exposed to the virus. It is important to keep in mind that immune globulin does not provide long -term protection in the same way that vaccinations do. The prote ction is only short term, usually only lasting a few weeks to a few months. In the case of perinatal hepatitis B, HBIG is intended to give infants born to mothers with hepatitis B short -term protection against the hepatitis B virus, which they may have bee n exposed to during birth. Infants born to HBsAg- positive women should receive HBIG and the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. See Table 4.1 for HBIG products and basic administration information. By the time effectiveness of the H BIG dose has waned, the infant's immune system should be producing its own anti -HBs antibodies to the hepatitis B virus in response to the vaccine. It is important that the infant complete the vaccine series on time to give them the best chance of developi ng immunity against the virus. See Table 4.2 for indications for HBIG use, based on the infant's birth weight and mother's testing results.

In 1986, research led to a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine that was synthetically modified and did not contain any blood products. It was later licensed for use in the U.S. in 19 89. This was the first vaccine licensed in the country that was produced by recombinant DNA technology. HBV infection cannot result from use of the recombinant vaccine, since no potentially infectious viral DNA or complete viral particles are prod uced in t he recombinant system. The hepatitis B vaccine is available as both a single -antigen formulation (monovalent vaccine) and in a fixed combination with other vaccines (combination vaccine). As of March 2000, all hepatitis B vaccines produced for distribution in the U.S. are thimerosal- free. See Table 4.2 for administration recommendations, based on the infant's birth weight and mother's testing results.

The recommended timing of administration of the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine to infants has evolved since then to optimize prevention of perinatal and early childhood HBV infections. In 1991, the first dose was recommended to be administered at birth before hospital discharge or at age 1 -2 months. This recommendation helpe d dramatically decrease the number of new h epatitis B infections among children in the U.S. One study found a 68% decrease in perinatal hepatitis B infections within 10 years of initiation of the universal birth dose. In January 2018, ACIP published recommendations to give the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth for all stable newborn s who weigh 2,000 g rams (4.4 pounds). The CDC recommends that all infants born to HBsAg positive mothers, or mothers whose status is unknown, should re ceive the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth, regardless of birth weight. All infants weighing less than 2,000 g rams (4.4 pounds) at birth and who received the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine should have the series reinitiated at 1 month of age. The birth dose should not be considered a valid dose as part of the series in these infants. These infants will receive between four (4) and five (5) doses of hepatitis B vaccine, depending on the formulation of vac cine used after the birth dose. Exceptions to the universal birth dose should be rare and considered on a case-by-case basis. Any health care provider who decides to delay the birth dose must document the order to do so and ensure that a copy of the mother's laboratory report, indicating she was HBsAg -negative during this pregnancy and at delivery, is present in the infant's medical record. The birth dose should not be delayed in infants whose mother tested HBsAg -positive prenatally and/or at delivery. The hepatitis B vaccine birth dose serves as a \"safety net\" in the event that a mother was misdiagnosed as HBsAg -negative prenatally and/or at delivery. Children born to HBsAg -positive mothers wh o do not become infected during the perinatal period remain at high -risk of infection during early childhood. In one study, 40% of infants who were not infected perinatally became infected by the age of 5 years. Guidelines for standing orders in labor and delivery and nursery units to prevent h epatitis B virus Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 48 transmission to newborns can be found in Appendix E of this manual and on the DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP website at www.texasperinatalhepb.org . Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) Birth Dose Honor Roll The universal birth dose policy is imperative as a safety net for infants who could be at risk for HBV. The Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) recognizes birthing facilities/hospitals that have rea ched high coverage rates of the Hepatitis B Birth Dose. These facilities are awarded and enrolled in the Hepatitis B Birth Dose Honor Roll. This impressive designation demonstrates the hospital's commitment to preventing HBV transmission. To qualify for th e Hepatitis B Birth Dose Honor Roll, a birthing facility/hospital needs to demonstrate that they achieved a rate of 90% or higher for administering the hepatitis B vaccine dose before hospital discharge to all newborns during a 12 -month period. In addition, the facility/hospital needs to have written polic ies and procedures to ensure that all newborns are protected from HBV infection before hospital discharge. Examples of policies include, but are not limited to: Ensuring all parents are informed about the importance of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose Ensuring all newborns routinely receive the hepatitis B vaccine after birth and before discharge Reviews of charts to ensure the correct screening test, HBsAg, was ordered for mothers during their current pregnancy Results of all mothers' HBsAg testing are reviewed Ensuring all infants born to HBsAg- positive mothers receive HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth Implementing routine newborn admission orders that include a standing del egation order (SDO) to administer hepatitis B vaccine to all newborns Ensuring all mothers with a positive HBsAg are reported to the Local Health Department (LHD) prior to discharge Texas has the highest number of birth dose honor roll enrollee s in the nation ! Many of these facilities/ hospitals have also qualified for more than a one-time period. This notable achievement demonstrates the outstanding Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 49 efforts of the state's birthing facilities/hospitals and perinatal hepatitis B case managers as they strive to improve health for all Texans. For more information about the Hepatitis B Birth Dose Honor Roll and how to apply, visit: www.immunize.org/honor -roll/birthdose/ . For the most current list of all the hospitals enrolled, visit: www.immunize.org/honor -roll/birthdose/honorees.asp . Vaccination Schedule and Use Infants and Children Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for nearly all infants within 12 -24 hours of birth. Common formulations of the vaccine and their administration are: Engerix B\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline) o 0.5 mL (10 mcg) /dose o Approved: 0 -19 years of age o Three (3) doses - administered Intramuscularly (IM) o Schedule: Birth, 1 -2 months, 6 months Recombivax HB\u00ae (Merck) o 0.5 mL (5 mcg) / dose o Approved: 0 -19 years of age o Three (3) doses - administered IM o Schedule: Birth, 1 -2 months, 6 months Pediarix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline): DTaP+Hep B+IPV o 0.5 mL (10mcg)/dose o Approved: 6 weeks - 6 years of age o Three (3) doses* - administered IM o Schedule: 2, 4, 6 months o Should not be used for the birth dose Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 50 It is preferred that the same vaccine/manufacturer be used for completion of a series. The FDA licenses combination vaccines based on their efficacy and safety when compared to monovalent vac cines. If the vaccine the child previously received is not immediately available, or is unknown, vaccination should not be delayed; the child should receive the available age -appropriate vaccine. Infants should not receive the final dose of hepatitis B vac cine prior to six (6) months of age. If the third dose is inadvertently given before six months (24 weeks) of age, the dose should be repeated and administered once the chi ld is at least 24 weeks of age. Because the highest anti -HBs are achieved when the last two (2) doses of vaccine are spaced at least four (4) months apart, schedules that achieve this spacing are preferable. However, schedules with two -month intervals between doses (i.e. , Pediarix\u00ae), which conform to schedules for other childhood vaccines, have been shown to produce good antibody responses and may be appropriate in populations where it is difficult to ensure that infants will be brought back for all their vaccinations. The minimum interva ls for the hepatitis B vaccine schedule to produce a good antibody response in infants are as follows: The second dose should be administered at least four (4) weeks after the first dose. The third dose should be administered at least eight (8) weeks after the second dose. The third dose should be administered at least 16 weeks after the first dose. The third dose should not be administered any earlier than 24 weeks of age (6 months). It is not necessary to add doses or restart the series if the interval be tween doses is longer than recommended. Doses administered too soon (before the minimum intervals noted above), should be re -administered using the correct interval. The minimum interval that should be used when a dose is * It is important to note that although Pediarix\u00ae is approved as a three - dose series, children who receive Pediari x\u00ae on the appropriate schedule will receive four doses of the Hepatitis B vaccine, including the birth dose. This is sa fe and will not harm the child. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 51 administered too soon should be ca lculated from the incorrectly administered dose. For example, children who incorrectly received their third dose of the hepatitis B vaccine at age 5 months, should not receive the correct final dose until eight weeks after the wrong dose was given, meaning the child should not receive the correct /final dose until age 7 months. Three (3) doses of the hepatitis B vaccine are required for students in Kindergarten- 12th grade. Hepatitis B vaccine is also required for children to attend licensed childcare facilities. One dose for children 3 -4 months, two (2) doses for children 5 -15 months, and three (3) doses for all chil dren 16 months of age or older. Pre-term and Low Birth Weight Infants Pre-term infants born to HBsAg -positive women and women with unknown HBsAg status must receive PEP with the hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours of birth. Pre-term infants and those with low birth weight (<2,000 g rams or <4.4 pounds ) have a decreased response to the hepatitis B vaccine when administered before 1 month of age. However, by 1 month of age, pre -term infants, regardless of initial birth weight or gestational age, are likely to respond as adequately as full -term infants. Therefore, pre -term infants or those born weighing <2,000 grams ( <4.4 pounds) should r estart the hepatitis B vaccine series at 1 month of age. Since the birth dose does not count toward completion of the hepatitis B series for these infants, they need to receive a total of at least four (4) doses of the hepatitis B vaccine. Although the bir th dose is not considered a valid dose in the series for these infants, it is imperative that any infants born to mothers with either HBsAg- positive or HBsAg -unknown status receive the birth dose, in addition to HBIG, for the best protection. If ordered by the physician, pre -term or low birth weight infants whose mothers tested as HBsAg -negative during this pregnancy and at delivery can defer the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series to 1 month of age. In this case, both of the mother's negative lab reports must be documented in the infant's chart by the ordering physician. These infants, if discharged from the hospital before 1 month of age , can also receive the hepatitis B vaccine at discharge if they are medically stable and have gained weight consistently. The full recommended dose should be used. Divided or reduced doses are not recommended. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 52 Vaccine Administration and Contraindications The hepatitis B vaccine can be given concurrently with other vaccines. Pregnancy and lactation are not contraindi cations to receiving a hepatitis B vaccination. The vaccine is to be administered intramuscularly (IM) in the anterolateral thigh or deltoid area, depending on age of the recipient. The choice of site is based on the volume of the injected material and the size of the muscle. In children younger than 3 years of age, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh provides the largest muscle and is the preferred site; the deltoid muscle can be used in children older than 12 months of age if the muscle mass is adequate . In children 3 years and older, the deltoid muscle is usually large enough for IM injection. The upper, outer aspect of the buttocks should never be used for vaccine administration because of diminished immunogenicity and the possibility of damaging the s ciatic nerve. Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reaction associated with the hepatitis B vaccine administration is pain at the injection site. Less frequent adverse reactions include fatigue, headache, irritability, and a fever greater than 99.9\u00b0F. There is no scientific data or evidence to show an association between the hepatitis B vaccine and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), multiple sclerosis (MS), autoimmune diseases, chron ic fatigue syndrome, or autism. Post-vaccination Serologic Testing (PVST) Post-vaccination seroprotection is achieved in 98% of healthy full- term infants who received a three - or four- dose HBV series; infants of low birthweight (<2,000 g rams/<4.4 pounds ) will generally have a lower seroprotection. Because not all infants will adequately respond to the hepatitis B vaccine series, it is important that all infants born to HBsAg - positive mothers, or mothers whose HBsAg status cannot be determined (e.g., safe surrender), be tested for vaccine response after completion o f the series. This will ensure that an adequ ate immune response is reached. Testing for immunity following hepatitis B vaccination is routinely recommended by the CDC for at -risk infants who are born to HBsAg -positive women or women whose hepatitis B status remains unknown. The guidance on timing of post -vaccination serologic test ing (PVST) provided by the CDC indicates that the optimal time to collect PVST in infants who completed the vaccine series on time is at 9 -12 months of age. For infants whose series Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 53 was delayed, the PVST should be collected one to two months after completion of the series. Please note, testing is not recommended before 9 months of age to avoid possible detection of anti- HBs passively transferred from the mother or from HBIG administered during infancy and to maximize the likelihood of detecting late HBV inf ection. It is important to test for HBsAg and anti- HBs to determine the success or failure of vaccination. It is important to keep in mind that testing delays after series completion can lead to false negative anti -HBs results. Infants who completed the v accine series on time at 6 months of age, should have PVST performed three (3) months after the final dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series has been administered to determine the success of PEP. This would ideally occur at the next well- child visit at 9 m onths of age. Infants who were delayed or delinquent in completing the vaccine series should receive the PVST one to two months after completion, as long as the infant is at least 9 months of age. For example, an infant who did not receive their final dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until 8 months of age can still complete the PVST on time at 9 months of age, so long as at least 28 days has passed since the last vaccination. Important note: Testing delays after series completion can lead to false -negative a nti-HBs results. Providers should not order a hepatitis panel when performing PVST, as it typically does not include testing for immunity, but rather only screens for acute hepatitis infection. Providers should order the individual serology markers, HBsAg and anti-HBs . Refer to Chapter 5 for additional information on specific serology ma rkers and their interpretation. Procedures for Ordering HBIG and Hepatitis B Vaccine The HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine are costly and delicate biological products. Keeping a large inventory increases the risk for expiration. Review the expiration dates on the vaccines received and use the shortest -dated vaccines first. Hospitals, pediatricians, and other medical providers may order HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine directly fro m the manufacturer. Providers should contact the manufact urer for ordering instructions. The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Public Health Regions (PHRs) and Local Health Departments (LHDs) must ensure in Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 54 advance that the hospital has HBIG on hand when a positive HBsAg woman is planning to deliver at the facility to ensure administration of HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine birth dose to the infant within 12 hours of delivery. HBIG can be ordered by PHRs or LHDs from the DSHS Immunization Section on an emergency basis. See below for Ordering Instructions. The LHDs must order HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine through their DSHS PHR. Both biologics must be shipped to a DSHS PHR or LHD location. HBIG and Hepatitis B Vaccine Ordering Instructions fr om DSHS: To order HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, DSHS PHRs and LHDs must email the Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) at TxPeriHepB@dshs.texas.gov with the following information: The Provider Identification Number (PIN) Clinic Days and Hours : List the hours the clinic will be open to accept vaccine shipments for each day of the work week and note lunch period when no one is available to receive the vaccine. Be sure to note any holidays or clinic closings. Contact Person : Name of person that is physically present at the clinic to accept the shipment. Phone : Phone number of the contact person. Clinic Address : Provide complete name and address of clinic. Pick from List : Provide the vaccine needed and the vaccine formulation requested and the request for HBIG. Order Amount : Indicate number of doses needed. Date of Order : Date the order was completed. Upon receiving a vaccine request, the DSHS PHBPP will forward the request to the Vaccine Management Group to submit the order in the Inventory Tracking Electronic Assets Management System (ITEAMS). The order will be shipped via the DSHS Pharmacy Unit. The DSHS Pharmacy Unit ships orders on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of each week. T o meet shipping deadlines, orders must be received before 2:00 p.m. on these days. In the event of an emergency, please call the DSHS Immunization Section at (512) 776- 7284 extension 0. For after -hours emergencies, call the DSHS emergency telephone number (512) 776- 4911, ask for the Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 55 physician on call, then give the physician the information concerning your emergency. Handling and Storage Careful handling of hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG is extremely important. These procedures should be strictly followed: Transport only in insulated boxes with coolant to maintain proper temperature. Store biologics at 2 -8\u00b0C (35- 46\u00b0F). DO NOT FREEZE . Freezing destroys the pote ncy of these biologics. Special care should be taken to avoid waste because of the high cost of the biologics. If biologics on hand are provided to your clinic by the Texas Vaccines for Children Program (TVFC) and are due to expire within 90 days, please c ontact your DSHS PHR or LHD for assistance in transferring the product. Be sure to also refer to the package inserts for additional detailed storage and handling procedures. If your vaccine is provided by the Texas Vaccines for Children (TVFC) Program, be sure to follow all TVFC Program requirements. For more information on TVFC Program Requirements and Vaccine Storage and Handling, please visit www.dshs.state.tx.us/immunize/tv fc/ProviderResources.shtm . Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 56 Chapter 4 : Learning Check 1. True or False: HBIG needs to be given to infants born to HBsAg -positive women within 12 hours of birth because they are too young for the Hepatitis B vaccine. Answer: False! Both HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine are given within 12 hours of birth in this case to help prevent perinatal HBV transmission. HBIG provides short -term protection against HBV that the infant may have been exposed to during birth. Because HBIG does not provide long -term p rotection, the infant must also receive the hepatitis B vaccine at birth and complete the vac cine series by 6 months of age. 2. Infants born to HBsAg- negative mothers should receive the Hepatitis B birth dose vaccine... A. Before hospital discharge B. At 1 month of age at their pediatrician's office C. Within 24 hours of birth D. Only if requested by the parents Answer: C: The current CDC recommendation is to give the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine to all stable infants (weighing 2,000 grams/4.4 pounds ) within 24 hours of birth. All infants meeting the minimum weight should receive a birth dose, regardless of the mother's HBsAg status. 3. You are reviewing the vaccine history for an infant born to a HBsAg - positive woman and find that the infant has received the follo wing How do you interpret this vaccine history? A. The infant has completed the Hepatitis B vaccine series . B. The infant received an extra dose of Hepatitis B vaccine and there is a vaccine error . Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 57 C. The infant should repeat the Hepatitis B vaccine series since a different formulation was given after birth . Answer: A: The infant has completed the Hepatitis B vaccine series. No additional doses are needed and, altho ugh infants who receive Pediarix\u00ae on the appropriate schedule will get four (4) total doses of the Hepatitis B vaccine; this is considered s afe and is not a vaccine error.

HBV infection cannot be differentiated from types of viral hepatitis from clinical symptoms alone, and definitive diagnosis d epends on the results of laboratory testing. Serologic markers of HBV infection vary depending on whether the infection is acute, chronic, or resolved. Commercial tests for hepatitis B, as summarized in Table 5.1, are widely available and are used for vari ous clinical purposes: Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) is the most commonly used test for HBV screening for infection. However, it does not differentiate between an acute and a chronic infection. HBsAg can be detected between one (1) and 12 weeks after exposure to HBV. The presence of HBsAg indicates that a person is infectious, regardless of whether the HBV infection is acute or chronic. If the infection is self -limited (an acute infection), HBsAg disappears in most patients within a few weeks to sever al months after infection. People with chronic HBV infection continue to have circulating HBsAg. Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (anti-HBs) is a protective, neutralizing antibody. The presence of anti -HBs following acute HBV infection generally indicates reco very and immunity against reinfection. Anti -HBs can also be acquired as an immune response to hepatitis B vaccine or passively transferred tempora rily by administration of HBIG. Total Hepatitis B Core Antibody (anti -HBc): The presence of this marker indicates a current or past infection with hepatitis B. It is recommended that this test be ordered with HBsAg and Anti- HBs to determine if an individual has an ongo ing or previous infection with hepatitis B. Hepatitis B \"little e\" Antigen (HBeAg) is a marker associated with HBV infection and, when present, indicates active viral replication within the liver, higher concentrations of HBV, and high infectivity. Testing for HBe Ag is useful in identifying candidates for antiviral therapy and to monitor the rapy response . IgM Antibody to Hepatitis B Core Antigen (IgM anti -HBc): The presence of this marker indicates a new h epatitis B infection (within the last six [6] months). A positive resul t indicates an acute infection. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 62 Hepatitis B DNA (HBV DNA): HBV DNA is one of the first tests that can detect HBV in the bloodstream after initial infection. It can be detected as early as one (1) week after infection. The amount of HBV DNA in the patient's blood indicates how fast the virus is replicating within the liver. This test measures the patient's viral load, or how much virus is present in the patient. High viral loads indicate rapid viral replication while low or undetectable levels indi cate inactive infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends all HBsAg positive pregnant women be tested for HBV DNA to guide antiviral therapy as needed. Refer to Appendix D for additional CDC resources on ordering and interp reting hepatitis B serology.

Providers should not select a viral hepatitis serolog y panel for testing; instead, they should select and order the individual hepatitis B serology markers. The serology markers are HBsAg, anti -HBs, and anti -HBc. The CDC also recommends that providers order a n HBV DNA test for any pregnant woman w ho has a po sitive HBsAg result. HBsAg screening should occur when other routine prenatal testing is done. The HBsAg test is widely available and can be added to the routine prenatal panel of tests without requiring additional patient visits. The advantages of routine HBsAg testing at the first prenatal visit are: determining early in the pregnancy if the mother is HBsAg- positive so HBV carrier status can be better established at the time of delivery determining HBV DNA viral load early in the pregnancy to guide antiviral therapy as needed ensuring that the infant receives appropriate and timely Post -Exposure Prophylaxis ( PEP) immediately after birth providing appropriate counseling to families before delivery obtaining the name of contacts 24 months of age for case management referral of household contacts >24 months of age and sexual partner(s) to a health care provider for evaluation of susceptibility, vaccination status, and/or HBV infection Hepatitis B identified prenatally and/or at time of delivery is a re portable condition in Texas, as outlined in Chapter \u00a781.041 of the Texas Health and Safety Code within one (1) week of identification. All women identified as being HBsAg- positive while pregnant or at the time of delivery must be reported to their local or regional health department. Investigational Form If maternal screening was not performed during pregnancy and/or at delivery, documentation of the reason(s) as to why the mother was not screened should be stated on the Investigational Report form. Specific training regarding the identified issues in lack of screening should be Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 64 provided to the provider/delivery hospital by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Public Health Region (PHR) or Local Health Department (LHD) office. Medical Records Maternal HBsAg results, along with dates of testing, should be documented in all infant medical records. If HBsAg testing was not done prenatally or at delivery, it is the responsibility of the hospital and obstetrical care provider to ensure that the test is done before hospital discharge. If HBsAg results are positive, the hospital and obstetrical care provider are also responsible for administering the appropriate PEP to the infant in addition to reporting the positive result to the LHD as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) week after results are obtained. Standing Delegation Orders (SDOs) Hospitals should develop written policies to ensure screening of all pregnant women and administration of PEP to all at -risk neonates. These policies should be assessed by the DSHS PHR and LHD each ti me the hospital receives training from the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) case manager and any time there is a gap in HBsAg screening or PEP. These policies should include standing orders for the following key elements: Review prenatal HB sAg results of all pregnant women Test all mothers for HBsAg at each delivery Provide the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine to all infants 2,000 grams (4.4 pounds ) at birth: o within 12 hours of birth for HBsAg positive mothers or mothers with unknown status , OR o within 24 hours of birth, regardless of mother's HBsAg status . Provide appropriate PEP* (HBIG and birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine) to all infants of HBsAg -positive mothers (prenatally and/or at delivery) If the mother's HBsAg status is un known at the time of delivery, the mother's blood should be drawn as soon as possible to determine her HBsAg status. If positive, the infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible, but no later than seven days after birth* and Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 65 Report all HBsAg -positive mo thers to the DSHS PHR or LHD within one (1) week of identification . * For additional guidance on PEP of infants born to women who are HBsAg- positive or HBsAg -unknown status, please refer to Chapter 4 of this manual. Serologic Testing of Infants and Children Pre-vaccination Serologic Testing Serologic testing is not recommended before routine vaccination of infants and children, nor is it recommended for infants born to HBsAg- positive women immediately after birth. See guidelines and recommendations below for the appropriate timing of serol ogy testing of at -risk infants. Serologic Testing for Immunity of Infants and Contacts 24 Months of Age Testing for immunity following vaccination is routinely recommended for infants who are born to HBsAg -positive women. These infants should complete PVST and be tested for infection (HBsAg) and immunity (Anti -HBs). The CDC's recommendations and general guidance for PVST can be found in the January 12, 2018 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) titled Prevention of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in the United States: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices , accessible at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm . The MMWR states that PVST should be done one to two (1-2) months after completion of the vaccine series. However, t esting is not recommended before age nine ( 9) months to avoid possible detection of anti -HBs from HBIG administered during infancy and to maximize the likelihood of detecting late HBV infection. Therefore, infants who received their final dose of hepatitis B vaccine at 6 months of age must wait three (3) months for PVST to be done; ideally at the next well- child visit at nine ( 9) months to determine the success of PEP. It is important to test for both HBsAg and anti-HBs to determine the success or failur e of vaccination, as up to five (5%) percent of infants may not respond adequately to vaccination. Important note: Testing delays after series completion can lead to false-negative anti -HBs results. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 66 Providers should order the individual serology markers HBsAg and anti- HBs. Providers should not order a hepatiti s panel when performing PVST, as it typically does not include testing for immunity, but rather only screens for acute hepatitis infection. Most commercial labs are able to add additional lab testing to existing specimens within a few days of specimen collection. Case managers can prevent additional lab draws by verifying serology orders within a few days of specimen collection and adding appropriate serology markers as needed. For contacts 24 months of age, the same serologic testing (HBsAg and anti-HBs) should be done, at least one (1) month after the final dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series is completed, and as long as the child is at least nine (9) months of age. Post-Vaccination Serologic Testing Interpretation Table 5.3 Response to Infant Serologic Test Results Test Results Interpretation Action HBsAg ( -) Anti-HBs (+) Immune due to vaccination 1. Notify the DSHS PHR or LHD 2. No additional -) Suscept ible / DSHS PHR or LHD HBsAg (+) Anti-HBs ( -) Infant infected with Hepatitis B Virus 1. Notify the DSHS PHR or LHD 2. Provide education/counseling 3. Refer for evaluation Susceptible/Non- responder The CDC recently updated its guidelines for at -risk infants who do not respond to the first hepatitis B vaccine series. Children that fail to respond to the first complete hepatitis B vaccine series need to receive a single dose of hepatitis B vaccine immediately and have PVST repeated one to two months later. Infants who have repeat anti- HBs <10 m IU/mL should receive the next two (2) vaccines in the series, followed by PVST 1 -2 months after the final dose. Alternatively, providers and families may skip the booster dose of Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 67 hepatitis B vaccine and repeat the entire three- dose vaccine series, followed by repeat PVST 1 -2 months later. Single -dose revaccination has many advantages, including fewer vaccine doses, shorter duration of case management, and lower cost. Please see the January 12, 2018 MMWR t itled Prevention of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in the United States: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices , accessible at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67 /rr/rr6701a1.htm , for more details. Note that children who fail to respond to two (2) complete series of the hepatitis B vaccine are considered non- responders and parents/guardians should be counseled regarding susceptibility and prevention o f virus transm ission. Serologic Testing for Immunity on Contacts >24 Months of Age Services are not provided through the PHBPP for contacts >24 months of age. These contacts should be referred to a provider for health care evaluation. Document the referral on the mother 's case management form. Serologic Testing of Mothers with unknown HBsAg status Table 5.4 Testing Response to Mothers' Serologic Test Status Prenatal HBsAg Status Delivery HBsAg Status Action Unknown Unknown Test for HBsAg immediately Positive Unknown Unknown Positive In six (6) months , patient should be referred for the following tests: HBsAg, anti -HBs, and anti -HBc. Should the patient not have health insurance ( or their health insurance is refusing to pay ), serology testing for HBsAg, anti- HBs, and anti -HBc is provided by DSHS at no cost to the client. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 68 If the mother's HBsAg status is unknown at delivery, the mother, her infant, and contacts 24 months of age must receive appropriate case management until the mother's status is determine d. If determined to be positive, case management services shall be continued until completion of the program. Contacts >24 months of age should be referred to a healthcare provider for testing and vaccination if susceptible. Additionally, the new MMWR stat es that PVST should be completed for any infants whose mother's HBsAg status remains unknown indefinitely (e.g., infants who are safely surrendered after birth). Discrepant HBsAg Results Discrepant results occur when the mother's HBsAg tests during the current pregnancy yield conflicting results. Table 5.4 Hospital Response at Delivery to Mothers' Discrepant Serologic Test Status HBsAg Test Results Prenatally At Delivery Hospitals Positive (+) Negative (- ) Administer HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine -birth dose within 12 hours of birth Report case to DSHS PHR or LHD Negative (- ) Positive (+) All infants born to mothers with discrepancies in their HBsAg test results should receive HBIG and Hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. It is the role of the delivery hospital to administer appropriate PEP within 12 hours of birth to all infants b orn to mothers with discrepant HBsAg results and to report results to the DSHS PHR or LHD. Refer to Chapter 4 for further guidelines on PEP. Any positive HBsAg result should undergo confirmation by neutralization. If the sample is confirmed, the result is considered positive for HBsAg. If the sample is negative upon confirmation, then the HBsAg is considered negative even though the preliminary result was posi tive. It is necessary to gather more information when there are discrepant HBsAg results during the pregnancy. First, verify that the HBsAg positive result was Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 69 confirmed by neutralization. Also, determine if the client had any prior testing or has received hepat itis B vaccines. Additionally, it is helpful to have providers order HBsAg, Anti -HBs, and Anti -HBc to hel p determine Hepatitis B status. The Role of the DSHS Health Service Region (PHR) and Local Health Department (LHD) The LHDs must report the mother's di screpant HBsAg results directly to their DSHS PHBPP Coordinator using the Mother Case Management Report form within one ( 1) week of notification. The Mother Case Management Report form should contain the following information: Name Date of birth (DOB) Country of birth information Type(s) of tests Laboratories that performed the tests Hepatitis B vaccination dates (if applicable) Type(s) of vaccines (if applicable) Other pertinent health information NOTE : Cases can be opened and submitted using the Mother Case Management Report form with only the information the case manager currently has (e.g., with just name, DOB, and lab result). Case managers should not delay submitting cases due to limited informatio n or while waiting to interview the client. The case management form can be updated with additional information as it comes available and re -submitted immediately to their DSHS PHBPP coordinator. Case Management of Discrepant Hepatitis B serology results Case managers should ensure that six (6) months have passed between HBsAg -positive results to determine the mother's status. Repeat testing should include HBsAg, Anti -HBs, and Anti -HBc to help determine status. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 70 Note that all cases should remain open, and fo llow-up of the infant and contacts 24 months of age should be continued, until the mot her's status can be determined. Hepatitis B Immunity Laboratory Parameters A positive anti- HBs of 10 mIU/mL indicates adequate immunity to hepatitis B. This immunity may be from either a past hepatitis B infection or a hepatitis B vaccination. After receiving a primary hepatitis B vaccine series, individuals with anti -HBs levels of 10 mIU/mL are considered protected and immune to the HBV, in accordance with CDC guidelines. A negative result indicates a lack of recovery from acute or chronic hepatitis B or inadequate immune response to hepatitis B vaccination. Infants with a negative anti -HBs and a negative H BsAg should be revaccinated (refer to chapter 4 for details). The ACIP does not recommend more than two (2) hepatitis B vac cine series for non -responders. Indeterminate results indicate an inability to determine if anti -HBs are present at levels consistent with immunity. Repeat testing is recommended in one to three (1 -3) months. Refer to Appendix D for Interpretation of PVST. Inconclusive Laboratory Results Contact the r eporting laboratory to clarify reports of inconclusive laboratory results, such as equi vocal anti -HBs, and obtain appropriate follow -up instructions for re -testing. Contact the ordering provider to confirm which labs were ordered to help determine Hepatitis B status and che ck Hepatitis B vaccine history. Reporting Sources One of the most difficult challenges for a PHBPP is obtaining reports of HBsAg -positive pregnant women. To have a successful reporting system, a PHBPP should have several overlapping sources of information to identify HBsAg -positive pregnant women. Three ( 3) main reporting sources are laboratories, prenatal care providers, and delivery hospitals. Additional sources for reporting may include: Midwife centers/home births , Pediatricians/Family Practices , Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 71 Planned Parenthood , Federally Qualified Health Clinics (FQHCs) , and Rural Health Clinics (RHCs). Laboratory Reports A primary reporting source for the PHBPP is the laboratory. Nationwide, there are 260,000 certified laboratories under the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). The objective of CLIA is to ensure quality laboratory testing for all lab testing performed on humans, except for research purposes. Laboratory reporting is more consistent and reliable than provider reporting and is often automatic or electronic. Additionally, reporting by laboratories can be made a condition of licensure, but non - laboratory reporting sources require constant reminders and education. Several problems may be encountered using laboratory reporting as a source of perinatal cases, including: Provider information, including contact information, may be omitted ; Appropriate serology tests markers may not have been ordered ; and/or Pregnancy status is often not indicated. Having alternate reporting sources can compensate for the deficiencies or periodic problems that may occur in laboratory reporting. When information is missing on the electronic lab report (ELR), the reporting laboratory should be educated on the information that is required by law for reporting of certain conditions. Refer to Chap ter 3 for information pertaining to the statutes and rules of reporting. Labor and Delivery Hospital Reports The PHBPP also uses hospital reports to identify infants born to HBsAg - positive women. For a labor and delivery hospital to be an effective reporting source, it is necessary to educate the individuals responsible for determining a pregnant woman's HBsAg status, administering HBIG, and vaccinating the newborn. To achieve this, the program must collaborate with staff p hysicians, labor and delivery nursing staff, newborn nursery staff, pharmacy staff, and infection control staff. When possible, program assistance should be offered to develop hospital policies and procedures regarding screening and treatment standards tha t are reflected in Appendix E. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 72 The PHBPP staff should encourage reporting by making the process as easy as possible and by helping the collaborating facilities in identifying what works best for them (e.g. , whether reporting will be done by nursing staff or by infection control staff). Hospital staff designated to identify , and report cases should either call to report a case or fax in the completed case report form: Hospital /Provider Report of HBsAg -Positive Mother (Stock #EF11 11015) This available at www.texasperinatalhepb.org . The PHR and LHD program staff are responsible for completing the paperwork on all cases that are reported by hospitals. Instructions and form samples can be found online at https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunize/perinatal- hepatitis - B/publications.aspx . Refer to flow charts located in Appendix C for the flow of informa tion on serology testing and case management of HBsAg -positive women that must occur for the PHBPP to be successful. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 73 Chapter 5 Learning Check 1. You are reviewing hepatitis B lab results for pregnant women. Which of the following lab results are you most concerned about? A. A woman with a positive HBsAg, positive HBeAg, and a HBV DNA of 250,000 IU/ml. B. A woman with a history of Hepatitis B vaccination and positive anti - HBs. C. A woman with fatigue who is HBsAg -negative . Answer: A. The positive HBsAg, positive HBeAg, and high HBV DNA viral load indicate a high level of circulating HBV and increased infectiousness. It is imperative this woman be educated , and that the delivery facility is prepared to administer appropriate PE P to h er infant at delivery. 2. An infant born to a HBsAg- positive woman received three (3) doses of hepatitis B vaccine and completed PVST, with the below results. How do you interpret the results and what is your recommendation? HBsAg: Negative Anti-HBs: Negative A. The infant is not infected with HBV a nd is protected from the virus. B. The infant is not immune to hepatitis B and should be considered a non-responder. C. The infant is not immune to hepatitis B and should receive a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine, follow ed by PVST 1 -2 months after vaccination. Or, if preferred, the infant can repeat the entire three - dose series. Answer: C. The infant did not respond to the first hepatitis B vaccine series and is susceptible. The infant should immediately receive a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine and have PVST repeated 1 -2 months later. Alternatively, the provider & family can decide to repeat the entire three -dose hepatitis B series and repeat PVST 1 -2 months after the second series is complete. 3. A delivery hospital calls to ask for help in interpreting HBsAg lab results. A woman admitted for delivery was HBsAg -negative prenatally, but at her delivery HBsAg is now positive. What should the hospital do? Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 74 A. Repeat the HBsAg before discharge t o determine hepatitis B status. B. The result is most likely a false positive and the hospital doe s not need to do anything else. C. The infant needs HBIG and the hepatitis B birth dose within 12 hours of birth and be reported to the appropriate DSHS PHR or LHD. Answer: C. The positive HBsAg at delivery indicates a potential HBV infection that could be transmitted to the infant without appropriate PEP. This is true regardless of the prenatal HBsAg results. The PHBPP case manager can help determine true hepatitis B status by asking to see the results of the HBsAg confirmation by neutralization and by requesting other hepatitis B labs (anti -HBs, Anti- HBc, & IgM anti -HBc). Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 75 Chapter 6 Conducting Interviews, Counseling , and Education Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 76 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 77 Initialization of Interview The client interview is crucial to the case management process. It includes educating the client patient on her condition and reass uring her that competent healthcare providers and public health staff will coordinate case manage ment services for her, her infant(s), and her contacts 24 months of age. Contacts >24 months of age will be referred to a provider for health care evaluation. In addition, the personal information that she shares with public health staff will be kept conf idential, as required by law. The case manager should first verify with the ordering provider that the client has been informed of the positive HBsAg result prior to contacting the client. The case manager should not be the first person to inform the clien t of the positive results. When a case manager initially contacts the client, they should ask if the client has time to talk and, if she makes it known that it is an inconvenient time for her, the case manager should inquire about a more convenient day/tim e to reach her to conduct the interview. The initial interview must include the following: Introduction of public health staff Role of the public health staff and the public health department, including the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Public Health Region (PHR) or Local Health Department (LHD) office that will be managing her case Discussion with the client that her case managers are trained public health professionals and have experience assisting persons with hepatitis B in understand ing and managing their disease Overview of hepatitis B, perinatal transmission, and the risks to her infant Review the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP), including the phases of the program and the timeframe of case management services provi ded by the program Discuss with the client that public health staff will ensure that her medical information remains confidential, as required by law Providing Patient Assessment, Counseling, and Education The purpose for patient assessment and education is to establish rapport, get the client accustomed to talking comfortably with you, addressing the client's concerns, gathering information, and giving the client sufficient Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 78 information to support disease in tervention behaviors. Targeted medical information presented by the provider or program staff can reduce or eliminate inappropriate strategies the client may develop to handle the diagnosis. To conduct the assessment, the following should be done: First as k the client what she knows about hepatitis B. Provide information and education to the client regarding the disease, including: o Signs and symptoms of disease progression* o Preventing progression of liver disease Avoiding or limiting alcohol consumption Consulting a healthcare provider before beginning any medicine, including herbal remedies and over -the-counter (OTC) medications Obtaining vaccination against hepatitis A o Transmission* and preventing transmission o Work and school exclusions are not necessary o Testing and treatment options Ask the client about problems or questions regarding hepatitis B and clarify any misconceptions. Discuss the meaning of the client's test result(s), and the possible need for additional testi ng. Give time to ask questions. Encourage the client to get involved with a support group to help her cope with her HBV infection. Explain th at all household members 24 months of age will be tested for hepatitis B, vaccine will be given if there is no valid vaccine record , and the contact is susceptible. In addition, these contacts will be case managed by the PHBPP until the vaccination series and PVST have been completed (may require two (2) series of vaccine). Explain that all contacts > 24 months of age should be referred to providers for medical evaluation. * More detailed information regarding transmission can be found in Chapter 2 of this manual. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 79 Supporting Program Compliance It is important that the client understands the importance of the hepatitis B vaccine series and PVST to prevent infection of her infant(s). The case manager should reinforce messages expressed by the healthcare provider and verify that the patient understands and intends to comply with the program. The case manager should: Instruct the client to remind the delivery facility and care providers that she is a carrier of the HBV and that her infant(s) needs to receive HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Educate the client regarding the importance for the newborn(s) and other children in the househo ld 24 months of age to comply with timely completion of the hepatitis B vaccine series and subsequent PVST. Encourage the client to keep scheduled appointments and to notify the case manager when it is necessary to cancel or reschedule appointments. Encourage the client to contact the case manager with any changes to contact information or care providers (infant or mother). Obtain emergency contact information and complete disaster questionnaire. Ask if the client has any plans to move out of the state or out of the country duri ng pregnancy or after delivery. Providing Additional Patient Education Sources A critical aspect of the PHBPP is patient education. It is extremely important that program staff thoroughly explain to HBsAg- positive pregnant women and new mothers the serious consequences of HBV infection (found in Chapter 2), the lifesaving importance that hepatitis B biologics (HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine) be administered to their infants, and the necessity of PVST after completin g the vaccine series. The DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP has developed educational materials for HBsAg -positive women and their healthcare providers. These materials can be found at www.texasperinatalhepb.org . Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 80 The CDC and the organization Hep B Moms have information about hepatitis B and perinatal hepatitis B available to order for free or to download in many different languages from: o https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/perinatalxmtn.htm#eduTools o https://www.hepbmoms.org/brochures Concluding the Interview Ask the client what questions or concerns remain. Briefly review and reinforce all comp onents of the PHBPP. Reinforce the need to communicate her HBsAg status to her household and recent sexual contacts and the need for a medical evaluation. Arrange for the next communication, if indicated. Remind the client to update the case manager if she changes providers or moves. Give the client contact information for you and a back -up. Provide culturally sensitive and easy -to-understand educational information on hepatitis B, along with your contact information in case she has any further questions for you. Tip: To build a trusting relationship with the client, follow up within a week of your initial interview to answer any questions or address any concerns she may have. Make note of this in your case management notes. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 81 Chapter 6 Learning Check 1. True/False: Conducting an interview with a hepatitis B -positive pregnant or postpartum woman is op tional. True or False? Answer: False. The initial interview is a crucial part of case management. Attempts at contacting the woman for her initial interview should be done within seven ( 7) days of notification, but ONLY after the case manager confirms the woman has been informed of the re sults by the ordering provider. 2. All the following are ways to facilitate rapport during the interview except : A. Identifying the woman's preferred language prior to the interview and using translation services as needed . B. Introducing yourself and asking if this is a good time to talk before beginning the interview . C. Demanding the client answer all questions immediately since you have other work to do. D. Informing the client that all information will be kept confidential, as required by law . Answer: C. Clients that refuse to answer questions should be respected but still case -managed using information from their provider and the delivery hospital. Case managers should ask the clients if it is a good time to ta lk before starting the interview, and be respectful of clients' time, language needs, and concerns for privacy. 3. True/False: One good way to start the interview process is to ask , \"What do you know about Hepatitis B?\" True or False? Answer: True. Some women may have chronic hepatitis B or have been previously enrolled in PHBPP and may not need as much education. Other women may have never heard of hepatitis B prior to their positive result and will need more details. It saves time and improves the interview process to tailor education for each individual client.

Case management is a systematic process to ensure disease prevention through coordination of medical services and education. Case management uses an organized and coordinated service delivery approach, tailoring individualized and specific services to the needs of the client to facilitate continued support. The goal of Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) case management is to prevent perinatal hepatitis B transmission. Case managers achieve this goal through active disease surveillance, providing education to clients and healthcare providers, coordina ting interventions needed to prevent transmission, and ensuring appropriate testing to d etermine the outcomes of cases. The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Public Health Region (PHR) and Local Health Department (LHD) office case managers should conduct case management for HBsAg- positive mothers, their infant(s), and household contacts 24 months of age. Case management activities should occur according to the PHBPP guidelines. Case management in the PHBPP involves: Interviewing HBsAg -positive mothers and providing education and information (e.g., brochures, handouts, and online resources) on hepatitis B and the Perinatal Hepatitis B P revention Program (PHBPP) . Educating providers, facilities, contacts, and family members on hepatitis B and i ts prevention and control . Recommending that all women with chronic hepatitis B follow up with their primary care provider or specialis t to monitor their hepatitis B . NOTE: Case managers do not need to obtain a physical referral but do need to remind women of the importance of regular hepatitis B evaluation. Collecting contact information (sexual and household) for appropriate referrals . There are varying degrees of case management and each case may require different levels of involvement from DSHS. If the mother decides to follow up with her private physician, this is acceptable and should be encouraged. However, the case manager still has the responsibility of gathering all medical information from the provider, such as dates of vaccine administration (if applicable) and serology testing results . There can be Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 86 many challenges and obstacles to case management, such as refusal of services by the client. Any problems encountered , and efforts made to overcome those obstacles , should be documented in case management notes. Some clients may prefer or require more direct services, which may involve home visits to administer vaccines or to draw blood for testing. These services are pro vided by the PHBPP at no cost to the client. Services that are available to the HBsAg -positive pregnant woman, infant, and contacts will be discussed further in this chapter. The DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinators should review all case reports for completion pri or to submission to th e DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP. All current case management forms along with detailed instructions, can be found at www.texasperinatalhepb.org . For additional guidance, contact your DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinator. Timeline for Management of Cases Upon receiving notification of a positive HBsAg result in a pregnant woman, timing is important to ensure the appropriate steps are taken to maximize the health and safety of both the mother and child. A general outline for when certain steps need to be taken is as follows: Immediately : Contact the ordering provider to verify pregnancy status, get estimated due date (EDD) and planned delivery hospital. Verify client has been in formed of hepatitis B status prior to contacting client . Contact client to interview or to set up a time for an interview . Send \"Initial Provider Letter\" to prenatal provider. Within one week of notification: Open and submit mother case management form o Send in CMR within seven ( 7) days, even if interview is not done. CMR can be completed with all available information and updat ed after interview is complete. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 87 Within 15 days of notification: Complete interview/ or attempts to make interview have been done and documented. Open and submit Contact Case Management form, as needed o Complete contact case management as needed until contact is closed . Send \"follow up\" letter to client after initial interview is completed . Create reminder to contact delivery hospital two months before EDD Two months before EDD: Contact the mother to check in. Confirm EDD and planned delivery hospital. Remind the mother to inform the hospital of her hepatitis B status and that the infant needs HBIG and the hepatitis B v accine immediately after birth. Contact planned delivery hospital and inform them of the hepatitis B - positive client coming for delivery. o Confirm the hospital has HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine available, standing delegation orders (SDO s) for administer ing the vaccines, and S DOs to test every woman admitted for delivery for HBsAg. o Remind hospital to complete the \"Hospital Reporting Form\" and send it to case manager after delivery. Update and submit \"Mother case management form,\" as needed. Set up reminder to check with delivery hospital one week after EDD. Upon notification of delivery: Review hospital reporting form and request addit ional information, as needed. o Make sure infant received appropriate Post -Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP). If infant did not receive appropriate PEP, contact facility to make plans to provide it and/or complete the \"investigational report\" and make plans to provide training. Update mother's case management form, and open and submit infant case management form. o Pay specia l attention to Low Birth Weight (LBW) Infants and infants who do not receive the appropriate PEP. LBW infants need to re-initiate the hepatitis B series at one ( 1) month of Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 88 age. The birth dose does not count toward series completion. Infants that do not receive appropriate PEP, lag in program outcomes (PVST, completing the vaccine series on time) and ma y need more frequent follow -up. Within 2 weeks of delivery: Contact mother/guardian to say congratulations and obtain the infant's name and pediatrician. Send patient and provider reminder of the second hepatitis B vaccine dose. Set up reminder to contact both the provider and mother/guardian one week before next vaccine is due. One week before the second hepatitis B vaccine dose is due: Remind both the prov ider and the mother/guardian that the vaccine is due. Make note of next appointment. If the infant does not have an appointment, help the mother/guardian make one and offer Local Health Department (LHD) office/ home -visit services, as needed. Ask provider to send a copy of the vaccine record after administration with the date of administration, formulation, manufacturer , and lot number. Upon notification of second vaccine dose: Review vaccine record and verify the dose. If there are any problems, immediately contact the provider. Update and submit the infant case management form. Set up reminder to contact both the provider and mother/guardian one week before the next vaccine is due. One week before the third hepatitis B vaccine dose is d ue: Remind both the provider and the mother/guardian that the vaccine is due. Make note of next appointment. If the infant does not have an appointment, help the mother/guardian make one and offer Local Health Department (LHD) office/home -visit services, a s needed. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 89 Ask provider to send a copy of the vaccine record after administration with the date of administration, formulation, manufacturer , and lot number. Upon notification of 3rd Vaccine Dose: Review vaccine record and verify the dose. If there are any problems, immediately contact the provider. Update and submit the infant case management form. Set up reminder s to contact both the provider and mother/guardian one week before PVST is due. One week before PVST due: Remind both the provider and the mot her/guardian that PVST is due. Make note of next appointment. If the infant does not have an appointment, help index case make one and offer LHD/home visit services as needed. Ask provider to send a copy of the lab resul ts as soon as they receive them. One day after scheduled PVST: Contact ordering provider to ask for PVST results. If they have not yet returned, verify the provider ordered HBsAg Review lab results. Verify correct labs w ere ordered and determine if the infant is immune, susceptible, or infected. o If the infant is infected, report the infant to PHBPP within one working day. o If the infant is susceptible, contact the provider to discuss the booster dose and repeat testing pro tocol . (See Chapter 7 for more information .) Update and submit case management report with a copy of the PVST lab results . If the child is immune, case management is complete. Notify the mother/guardian of the results and send \"reminder of program completion \". Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 90 How to Manage Cases Assigning a Case to the Appropriate Jurisdiction by Federal Information Processing Standards Code Determining case jurisdiction is done via Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes. FIPS codes can be found using the zip code or the patient's street address and city at: https://ww Enter the zip code and click \"Go\". The FIPS code is displayed with the county name . See Figure 7.1 below for help identifying results. For more information on FIPS codes for your jurisdiction, contact the DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP team at TxPeriHepB@dshs.texas.gov or 800 -252-9152. Figure 7.1 FIPS Code Look -up Assigning a Case Identification Number (PHBPP Use Only) A new identification number (ID#) must be assigned to each pregnancy by program staff at the DSHS PHR or LHD level. This information shoul d be documented in the top right corne r of all case management forms. A s Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 91 The format for the ID# is: yr/county/mother/hh##, and is assigned as following: yr: The four-digit year the client was first identified in the PHBPP (i.e ., 2019) . county: The code . mother: The three -digit individual code, as assigned by the case manager (this is a chronological number unique to e very individual) . hh##: The two-digit number identifying the relationship to the mother.

When initially submitting the form, the required information for opening a case is: Case identification (ID) number Initial report date Initial contact date Mother's full name Mother's DOB Mother's address Provider informa tion (name and contact info) Estimated Date of Delivery/Estimated Due Date (EDD) or infant DOB and pregnancy outcome HBsAg -positive lab report with confirmation Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 92 Requested information that may be gained from the client interview, but not required for the initial submission of the form to open a case, is: Phone number Country of birth Mother's maternal grandmother's country of birth Planned delivery hospital Race Preferred language Insurance information Alternate contacts Disaster Questionnaire Vaccine history as applicable Prior hepatitis B lab results Contacting the HBsAg -Positive Pregnant or Postpartum Woman Establishing contact and developing a trusting relationship with the HBsAg - positive client is critical and is the first step in the case manageme nt process. She should be contacted as soon as possible following ident ification, preferably by phone. Important note: The case manager should not be the first person to inform the client of the positive results. Contact the provider first to determine whether they have notified the client and provided any counseling or education. If they have not, request they notify her of the results and that the DSHS PHR or LHD will be contacting her to follow up. Call the provider again later to verify it has been done . To establish a trusting relationship with the client, advise her that all information she provides will be kept confidential, as required by law. If the client is reluctant to provide information, the physician's office can be contacted to provide additional needed information. Remember, client consent is not required to obtain laboratory confirmed HBsAg test results from the provider. If you are e ncountering challenges while attempting to contact the client for case management services, refer to Table 7.1 on pages 133 , 134, and 135 for related actions. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 93 Best Practices: Notification(s) may be in any of these forms: o Phone call(s), with messages if t here is no answer - preferred method, o Letter(s) sent to parent(s), and o Computer/phone system that automatically calls or texts patients . Remind parents and provider one (1) week before immunization visit(s). Contact provider within one (1) day after scheduled appointment to ensure that patient received necessary vaccine(s)/PVST. o Verify the provider ordered the correct PVST labs and ask them to correct the lab orders, as needed. Many labs can add testing to existing samples within five (5) days, to pre vent additional lab draws. If the appointment is missed, contact parent(s) immediately to arrange for a follow -up visit or a home visit . Table 7.1 Challenges Contacting the HBsAg -positive Mother Challenges Contacting the HBsAg -positive Mother Challenge Follow -up Action No answer of telephone calls . Make at least five (5) attempts to call on different days of the week, at different times of the day. If possible, attempt at least one (1) evening call. Telephone number is disconnected . Contact the provider to verify contact information. Inquire how they have been contacting her. Check Immtrac2 and NE DSS for other possible numbers. If no new number can be obtained, a first -class letter should be sent to the client's home address. It should include contact information and request the client contact case management di rectly regarding a recent health issue (do not disclose HBsAg results in letter). Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 94 Challenges Contacting the HBsAg -positive Mother Challenge Follow -up Action No response to first-class United States Postal Service (USPS) letter.

Inability to contact client after exhausting all above options. Do not close as \"lost to follow -up.\" If the patient cannot be contacted, but you have an EDD and planned delivery hospital, attempts must still be made to locate the infant around the time of delivery. More information may become available after delivery (e.g., Vital Statistics records). Client moved to a known address in another jurisdiction/state. Obtain accurate location information, complete the appropriate transfer form and submit to the DSHS Immunization Section , PHBPP Central Office. PHBPP will forward the transfer information to the new jurisdiction. All out- of-state transfers should be sent to Central Office for the coordinator to transfer. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 95 Other methods that may be used to locate the client include: Check ImmTrac2 to check for additional/updated demographic information and to find current pediatric provider . Contact the post office to see if there is a forwarding request for the client . Make a home visit to the last known address, if there is no response to certified letters . NOTE: Find out from the provider what the patient's preferred language is and arrange for interpretation, if needed, to avoid any barriers whe n first contacting the patient. Check NEDSS for new labs or demographic information and/or contact the laboratory provi ding the test results for contact information on the patient . Access Accurint, an online searchable database available to law enforcement, and government agencies. Accurint includes postal addresses, driver's licenses, property ownership, and criminal reco rds. To use this database, you must request the assistance of DSHS PHR or LHD Sexually Transmi tted Disease (STD) program staff. Contact Medicaid and WIC programs, as up -to-date addresses are required for these services . A case cannot be closed as 'lost to follow -up' until all avenues have been exhausted. Additionally, the patient must no longer be receiving any known services from an OB/GYN due to the physician's inability to locate or contact the client for services, however, if the patient cannot be conta cted but you have an EDD and a planned delivery hospital (from client or Challenges Contacting the HBsAg -positive Mother Challenge Follow -up Action Client moved to an unknown address in another state.

Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 96 physician), attempts must still be made to locate the infant around the time of delivery before the case can be closed. After the EDD has passed and the planned delivery hospital does not have record of the birth, contact Central Office PHBPP staff to see if the mother/infant's birth hospital or contact information can be located in Vital Statistics records. Patient Education A critical aspect of the PHBPP is patient education. It is extremely important that PHBPP staff explain to HBsAg -positive pregnant women and new mothers about the serious consequences of HBV infection (refer to Chapter 2), the lifesaving importance of hepa titis B biologics (HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine) being administered to their infants, and the necessity of PVST after completing the vaccine series. The DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP has developed educational materials for HBsAg- positive women and their health care providers. Materials can be found at www.texasperinatalhepb.org . Case Management of HBsAg -Positive Pregnant and Postpartum Women Each DSHS PHR and LHD staff involved with the interviewing of clients should explain the services provided by the PHBPP and assure the client that her medical history (including her household contacts 24 months of age) will be handled confidentially by the PHBPP staff. Complete the Mother Case Management Report (Stock # EF11 -10932), which can be accessed at www.texasperinatalhepb.org . It should be completed and submitted within one (1) week to the DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinators for review who will submit the completed forms by email to TxPeriHepB@dshs.texas.gov (preferred) or by fax at 512 -776-7544. Every time the form is updated, it should be immediately submitted to the DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinator who will send to the DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP Database Manager. The procedures outlined below should be followed when a pregnant or postpartum woman is identified as HBsAg - positive . You may receive the report from the provider, the laboratory, or through National Electronic Disea se Surveillance System (NEDSS).Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 97 1. Contact the provider first to obtain the following information*: OB/GYN medical records o HBsAg lab result(s) with positive confirmatory test o Any additional hepatitis B lab results o EDD o Planned delivery hospital o Vaccination history (if available) o Pregnancy history (if applicable) o Treatment(s) and/or medication(s) for hepatitis B o Any referrals to specialist(s) for hepati tis B 2. Face sheet showing patient's contact and insurance information. NOTE: Occasionally, the LHD will be notified of new hepatitis B - positive woman by a delivery hospital. Request the hospital complete the Provider/Hospital Report of HBsAg -Positive Mother (Stock # E11 - , which can be accessed at www.texasperi natalhepb.org , the delivery lab, and the name of the prenatal provider. Contact the prenatal provider to obtain all information listed above. 3. Verify that the provider has notified the client of her positive HBsAg result. Establish the clients preferred language before contacting her. Utilize translation language services when appropriate. 4. Contact the client to obtain pertinent med ical history, personal information, and type of insurance (Medicaid, private insurance, no insurance). All efforts should be made to obtain patient insurance information, otherwise, the reason for not obtaining the insuran ce status should be documented. Tip: Insurance information is normally noted on the \"face sheet,\" obtained from the client's provider 5. Educate the client about HBV, communicability of the virus, and the importance of protecting her infant from HBV transmission using HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine. Tip: HBV education regarding routes of HBV transmission should be done prior to requesting information on all sexual partners and household contacts. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 98 6. Services that will be provided by the DSHS PHR and/or LHD should be explained to the client and, if needed, a face -to-face visit should be arranged. If the client is unable to travel to a DSHS PHR or LHD, the PHBPP staff can conduct home visits to provide these services, in accordance with their LHD policies . 7. Provide patient educational brochure to the client , the bilingual Hepatitis B Vaccine Can Save Your Baby's Life Brochure , (Stock # 11-11444 ), available through the DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP at https://secure.immunizetexasorderform.com/default.asp . Ensure that all educational materials are provided in a culturally sensitive manner. Tip: The group Hep B Moms has hepatitis B and pe rinatal hepatitis B information available in many different languages and available free on their website at: https://www.hepbmoms.org/brochures . 8. Refer the HBsAg -positive pregnant woman to her usual healthcare provider (PCP or OB/GYN) if she needs a referral for additional hepatitis B care. NOTE: The healthcare provider or OB/GYN might refer the HBsAg- positive pregnant woman to a Gastroenterologist, Hepatologist, or an Infectious Disease Specialist. H er case should continue to be managed, regardless of which specialty is following her. If the HBsAg -positive pregnant woman receives antiviral medications for hepatitis B, document the following information on her case management report: o treatment or antiv iral agents (brand and dose) o date antivirals were initiated 9. Notify the client's health care provider (or other specialty provider ) of the role of the DSHS PHR and/or LHD, including the case management services, that will be provided to the newborn and hous ehold contacts 24 months of age. 10. Complete and submit the Mother Case Management Report to the DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinator within one (1) week . This form is available at www.texasperinatalhepb.org . Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 99 11. Identify all household contacts who are 24 months of age, sexual partner(s), and household contacts >24 months of age. PHBPP Case Management services should be provided for all household contacts 24 months of age. All sexual partners and contacts >24 months of age should be referred to a healthcare provider for follow -up and evaluation. Adult contacts without health insurance who are found to be susceptible to hepatitis B can be vaccinated through the Adult Safety Net (ASN) Program. Susceptible children may be eligible for Texas Vaccines for Children program. Please contact your DSHS PHR or LHD for additional information. 12. After the initial interview with the preg nant woman, direct program involvement with her may be minimal. However, because the client may be newly diagnosed, program personnel should remain available to offer counseling or advice and to answer any questions or concerns she may have. 13. If possible, notify the delivery hospital where the client plans to deliver her infant(s) at least two (2) months prior to her estimated date of delivery. 14. Ensure that the hospital has both HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine available in advance, at least seven (7) days befo re her estimated date of delivery . 15. Review with the Newborn Nursery their standing orders and written policies pertaining to both the administration of HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine birth dose, and the testing of the infecte d mother for HBsAg on delivery. 16. Periodically contact the hospital (delivery unit or newborn nursery) to determine whether the mother has yet delivered. 17. Once the infant has been born, complete and submit the initial Infant Case Management Report within 15 days of the infant's birth to the DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinator. The form is available at www.texasperinatalhepb.org . Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 100 NOTE: Case management on HBsAg -positive women with a stillbirth or miscarriage will still be case managed by the progr am, however, they should be referred to a healthcare provider for healthcare to delay further injury to the liver. The case management report is coded as \"referred to medical follow -up,\" and the status code is noted as \"infected.\" Provider Education Patien ts with acute and chronic HBV infections require medical evaluation and regular monitoring. PHBPP case managers should refer all HBsAg- positive pregnant women to medical providers for supportive and/or therapeutic treatment to prevent the progression of liver damage. PHBPP case managers do NOT need to get a physical referral, but only need to educate the client to follow -up with their specialist or primary care physician for regular monitoring. If they are not already familiar in doing so, the provider should also be educated as to: interpretation of serology results (refer to Appendix D) monitoring patients for disease progression and prevention identifying the need for specialized consultation If the pregnant woman's infection has been verified as being chronic, the PHBPP staff should identify available medical resources for chronic hepatitis B infections and ensure the medical providers are knowledgeable about risk factors for HBV infection in pregnant women, their infants, sexual partners, and household contacts. If needed, staff should provide training to the providers. Pregnant women, infants, sexual partners, and household contacts >24 months of age should be referred to a FQHC or a RHC for appropriate medical management if they do not already have a healthcare provider. Client and Provider Reminders Due to the critical need to complete the hepatitis B vaccine series and PVST on time, reminders are required to remind parents as to when vaccinations and serology testing for their infants are due. It should never be assumed that parents will use effective methods of reminders for themselves, and physicians' offices should not be relied on for notification of appointments. To be effective, the system should be set up to make it easy to remind the Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 101 coordinators, who can then notify clients, when an immunization or test is due. Notifications to parents and providers should occur at least one (1) week prior to any hepatitis B vaccine and/or PVST due dates. Case Management of Infants Born to HBsAg -Positive Women Case management of infants born to HBsAg- positive women can be labor intensive. Adequate case management should require no more than nine (9) months to complete perinatal hepatitis B prevention case management services once the infant has been born. (Refer to Guideline 3 in Appendix C .) For children who do not adequately respond to the vaccine series and who are also not infected with HBV, case management services may take up to 17 months to complete. Infants born to women whose hepatit is B status remains unknown indefinitely (e.g., safe surrender) also need to be case managed to ensure they receive the hepatitis B vaccine series and PVST. 1. It is imperative that the case manager inform labor and delivery staff at the planned delivery hospital of the woman's HBsAg -positive status at least two (2) months prior to her expected delivery date. Staff should ensure that the delivery hospital has both HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine ready for administration to the newborn immediately after delivery , to be given within 12 hours. Hospitals should order HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine directly from the distributor. HBIG can be ordered through the DSHS Immunization Section only in emergency situations. Refer to guidelines provided later in this chapter. 2. Appropriate Post -Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) treatment should be administered, based on the mother's HBsAg status: Born to HBsAg -positive woman: o Administer HBIG within 12 hours . o Administer first dose (birth dose) of hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours . Born to HBsAg -unknown status woman: o Administer first dose (birth dose) of hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours . o If mother's hepatitis B status is still unknown at discharge, administer HBIG before discharging infant . Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 102 o If HBIG was not given before discharge and the HBsAg result later comes back as positive, administer HBIG no later than seven (7) days after delivery . If the infant has already been discharged, it is the delivery facility's responsibility to recall the infant and administer HBIG as soon as possible . Born to a woman with discrepant prenatal and delivery HBsAg results: o If any HBsAg test has been positive, administer: HBIG within 12 hours First dose (birth dose) of hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours NOTE: Infants born to HBsAg -positive women do not need placement in special isolation. (For additional guidance on PEP and vaccin e schedules, refer to Appendix B .) It is generally safe for HBsAg -positive mothers to breastfeed their infants. For additional information, refer to the Perinatal Transmission section in Chapter 2. 3. The case manager should ob tain all necessary information below about the first dose of the HBIG and Hepatitis B vaccine from the delivery hospital. Lot number Manufacturer/Brand Dose Date and time of administration 4. Information should be documented on the Infant Case Management Report (Stock # EF11 -10931 ) which can be found at www.texasperinatalhepb.org . The form must be completed and submitted within 15 days of infant birth to the DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinator for review, who must submit the Infant Case Management Report by either email to TxPeriHepB@dshs.texas.gov (prefer red) or by fax to 512 -776-7544. 5. Before the infant leaves the hospital, discharge planning should begin. The case manager should find out from the delivery hospital which pediatrician the infant is being discharged to. Once that information is Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 103 known, arrangements should begin to ensure the timely administration of the second and thir d doses of hepatitis B vaccine. 6. Reminders should be sent to the family and pediatric health care provider to notify them when vaccines and PVST are due. For additional information, please refer to the earlier Client and Provider Reminders section of this chapter. 7. The infant should complete the hepatitis B vaccine series on time. 8. Dose #2: at 1 month of age (no later than 2 months of age). 9. Dose #3: at 6 months o f age. Refer to Appendix B for further guidance on vaccine schedules. The infant should be vaccinated through his/her pediatrician. If the child is unable to be vaccinated by the pediatrician, the case manager should arrange with the DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinator and/or the DSHS Immunization Section to obtain the vaccine. Infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers can receive DSHS Immunization Section - supplied vaccine, even if they receive health care in the private sector. 10. The immunization information should be o btained from the infant's health care provider and be documented on the Infant Case Management Report form. If the parents consented to ImmTrac2, vaccine information can also be obtained from this system. Every time the form is updated, it should be immediately submitted to the DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinator who will send to the DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP Dat abase Manager. Information to be documented: date administered, provider/clinic that administered the dose . 11. Contact the parent or guardian by phone or mail to remind him/her about PVST at the child's 9 -month wellness visit.Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 104 12. Results of the PVST is needed to determine the success of PEP. Perform no earlier than 9 months of age Perform at least one to two (1-2) months after completion of the hepatitis B vaccine series Two lab tests are required: the 9 -month -old well -child visit, if all doses of the vaccine were completed at least one to two (1 -2) months prior. NOTE: Request that the provider annotates and flags the child's medical record to indicate that the PVST (HBsAg and anti-HBs) is due at the next well -child visit (see guidance above for timing). If an appointment date has not yet been scheduled, also follow up with the parent or guardian to schedule an appointment with the provider. NOTE: Follow up with the provider one (1) day after the appointment for PVST is scheduled to verify the child attended and that the correct lab tests were ordered. If orde red incorrectly, many laboratories can add the correct testing to existing specimens for up to five (5) days to prevent needing to do additional blood draws on the infant. A release of information is not needed from a parent or guardian to request that the provider perform PVST on the infant. Hepatitis B, identified prenatally or at delivery, is a reportable condition and is protected under Texas statutes and rules. Because of the significant health risks posed to the infant if proper care is not obtained, a release of information is not required to provide this information to the infant's care provider. Ideally, the hospital and/or DSHS PHR or LHD should notify the infant's care pr ovider immediately after birth. PVST is not recommended before the age of 9 months to avoid possible detection of anti- HBs from HBIG administered during infancy, and to maximize the likelihood of detecting late HBV infection. Quantitative antibodies for surface antigen are prefer red because they give a level of immunity with which to measure the immunity of the infant. Anti-HBc testing of infants is not recommended because passively acquired maternal Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 105 anti-HBc may be detected up to age 24 months in infant s born to HBV-infected moth ers. 13. The results of the tests should be recorded on the Infant Case Management Report form and the form should be immediately submitted to the DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP, along with a copy of the infant's results. Perinatal Hepatitis B Virus Infection Case Definition Perinatal hepatitis B infection in infants ages 1 -24 months is a nationally notifiable condition, and Texas is required to report all cases to the CDC. These cases are reported through NEDSS AND PHBPP . The case definition for perinatal hepatitis B virus infection is HBsAg positivity in an infant aged 1 -24 months , or an infant aged 9 -24 months who is positive for HBeAg or HBV DNA, born in the US or US territories to a hepatitis B -positive mother. An infant who is determined to be HBsAg -positive will be classified as a case of perinatal hepatitis B virus infection. Perinatal hepatitis B infection in the newborn may range from asymptomatic to fulminant hepatitis. All laboratory -confirmed perinatal hepatitis B virus infections must be reported to the DSHS through NEDSS and through the P erinatal Hepatitis B Program. It is the responsibility of the DSHS PHR and LHD program staff to obtain a copy of the laboratory report, update the Infant Case Management Report form, and submit both fo rms to the DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP Coordinator within one (1) working day of notification. CASE MANAGEMENT OF CONTACT(S) 24 MONTHS OF AGE TO HBSAG - POSITIVE PREGNANT WOMEN Household contacts are defined as persons 24 months of age currently residing in the home of the HBsAg- positive pregnant woman. Household contacts >24 months of age and sexual contacts are not eligible for the program and should be referred to a healthcar e provider. The Contact 24 Months Case Management Report form should be completed for all contacts identified who are 24 months of age, and case management should be completed. These case management procedures should be followed when a contact 24 months of age is identified as born to a positive HBsAg mother. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 106 1) Educate parent/guardian on the consequences and risks of HBV infection. 2) Complete the Contact 24 months of age Case Management Report Form (Stock # EF11 -10934) for each contact 24 months of age identified within 15 days of identification. This form, along with the instructions, is available at www.texasperinatalhepb.org . 3) Obtain vaccine and serology history on all contacts 24 months of age. A reliable vaccination history for each dose administered to complete the hepatitis B vaccine series should be obtained, if applicable. Serology history consists of a written and dated laboratory report; verbal reports are not acceptable. Case management is initiated based on vaccine results and serology history. If contact 24 months of age has no documentation of immunity by serology, the contact should be tested for HBsAg and anti -HBs. Once the results are obtained, follow guidance identified on Chart 7.2. HBsAg -positive results must have confirmatory testing performed. Chart 7.2 Actions after First PVST Results Actions After First PVST Results HBsAg Anti-HBs Status Action Negative Negative Susceptible Proceed to Step # 4 below Negative Positive Immune Submit form and documentation to DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinator Positive Negative Infected Refer to physician for follow -up and evaluation 4) If needed, ensure initiation and completion of the hepatitis B vaccine series. If the contact is susceptible after a complete hepatitis B vaccine series, give a booster dose of the hepatitis B vaccine and then repeat PVST 1 -2 months later. If the contact is still susceptible after the booster dose, give dose 2 and 3 of the second Hepatitis B vaccine Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 107 series and then repeat PVST 1- 2 months later. Alternatively, the provider and family can choose to not do a booster dose and just repeat the entire three- dose hepatitis B vaccine second series, with PVST repeated 1- 2 months after the last vaccine. The CDC does not recommend further vaccination after completion of two (2) complete hepatitis B vaccine series. These \"non -responders\" should be referred to their physician for follow up. 5) All updates to the Contacts 24 months of age Case Management form should be submitted immediately . DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinators must submit reports to the DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP Coordinator. 6) Perform PVST 1 -2 months after comple ting the vaccine series to determine if adequate protection has been achieved with one (1) complete series of vaccine, keeping in mind that PVST should not be done before 9 months of age. Refer to Chart 7.3 for relevant action s for each type of PVST result. Chart 7.3 Actions After Second PVST Results Actions After 2nd PVST Results 6.0 HBsAg Anti-HBs Status Action Negative Negative Susceptible / Non-responder Provide counseling and refer to provider Negative Positive Immune Submit form and documentation to DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinator Positive Negative Infected Refer to provider for follow - up and evaluation 7) Record all information on the Contact Case Management Report form. Any updates should be submitted immediately to the DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinator. NOTE: Reporting of adequate and inadequate is acceptable only if your lab is using mIUs as the measurement for anti-HBs and the cut Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 108 off is <10 for reporting inadequate anti -HBs, and 10 for reporting adequate anti -HBs. Check with your lab to be certain of results. Case Management Report Submission Guidelines Initial identification of cases should be submitted on t heir respective case management reporting forms within 15 days to the DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinator. All case management report updates must be submitted immediately to the DSHS PHR PHBPP Coordinator for any the following events: Administration of any dose of hepatitis B vaccine Completion of PVST Any added or updated information to any part of the form Closure of a case Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 109 Chapter 7 Learning Check 1. A HBsAg positive pregnant women lives with her 32 -year-old husband, 1 - year-old daughter, and 3 -year-old son. How do you case manage the members in the household? A. Each household contact should be referred to their PCP for vac cination and testing as needed. B. Only the 1-year-old should have a case management report opened and complete the hepatitis B vaccine series and PVST . C. All household contacts should have a case management report opened and complete the hepatitis B vaccine series and PVST. D. Both children need to hav e a case management report opened and complete the hepa titis B vaccine series and PVST. Answer: B. PHBPP case management services are provided for all household contacts under 24 months of age. Only the daughter is under <24 months of age and eligible for case management services. She should be vaccinated and receive PVST as needed. All other contacts should be referred to their PCP for evaluation, vaccination, and testing as needed. 2. True/False: In order to close out a PHBPP case as \"referred for medical follow-up,\" the case manager needs to give the client an official referral for a specialist. True or False? Answer: False. Case managers do not need to obtain an official referral but do need to remind women of the importance of regular evaluation. Instructing the client to have regular hepatitis B evaluations done with their primary care provider or specialist is sufficient to close as \"referred for medical follow -up.\" 3. PVST requires w hich of the following the following lab tests? A. HBsAg B. Anti-HBs C. Both A and B D. Hepatitis Panel Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 110 Answer: C. PVST consists of HBsAg and Anti- HBs. A hepatitis panel is not recommended because it usually only tests for markers of an acute infection and not immunity . Note that Anti -HBc is also not recommended because infants can passively acquire it from their HBsAg positive mothers for up to 24 months.

It can be detected as early as one (1) week after infection. The amount of HBV DNA in the patient's blood indicates how fast the virus is replicating within the liver. This test measures the patient's viral load. High viral loads indicate rapid viral replication while low or undetectable levels indicate inactive infections. The CDC recommends all HBsAg positive pregnant women be tested for HBV DNA to guide ant iviral therapy . HBV-DNA genotype HBV DNA genotype testing identifies which of the genetic strains of hepatitis B virus a patient is infected with. It is most often used to predict or monitor therapy, detect mutations, or in epidemiologic investigations to assess transmission linkages. Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) HBsAg is found on the surface of the virus and can be identified approximately 30 -60 days after exposure to the virus. The presence of HBsAg indicates that the person is in fectious . HBsAg testing is the current standard to indicate current infection with hepatitis B. If HBsAg is present for more than six (6) months this generally indicates a chronic infection. Hepatitis B \"little e\" Antigen (HBeAg or 'e' antigen) HBeAg is contained within the core of the virus rather than on the surface. When the virus replicates, HBeAg is produced in excess. The \"little e\" antigen is only detectable when the hepatitis B virus is actively reproducing. HBeAg indicates high infectivity due to the active replication of the virus and indicates a greater risk of progression to liver disease. HBeAg and HBsAg are generally detectable at the same time, however, HBeAg disappears before HBsAg. Mutant strains of HB V do exist that replicate without producing HBeAg. In many cases, infection with one of these mutant strains is more aggressive than HBe -producing strains.Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 142 Hepatitis B \"little e\" Antibody (anti-HBe) Antibodies to HBeAg only become detectable when the HBeAg is no longer present, indicating there is no active viral replication. Serology that is anti- HBe positive would indicate low infectivity. Hepatitis B Core Antigen (HBcAg) The core antigen (HBcAg) is a viral protein that is produced and contained within th e infected hepatocyte and is the most antigenic component of the virus. It does not freely circulate in a detectable amount within the blood, therefore, there is no specific lab test to detect the core antigen. However, it can be detected in a sample of li ver cells taken after a liver biopsy. Because of the antigenicity of the core antigen, the immune system does produce antibodies to HBcAg (anti -HBc) that are detectable. Hepatitis B Core Antibody (anti -HBc) Anti-HBc positive serum indicates that the indiv idual has been infected with the hepatitis B virus at some point, but it is not possible to determine when the infection occurred. Any individual who has been infected with the virus will test positive for anti -HBc for life. Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin M (I gM anti -HBc) IgM anti -HBc is detectable approximately six to eight weeks after infection occurs and indicates acute infection. It is generally not detectable after six months and therefore generally indicates a recent infection. This is the best serologic marker of acute HBV infection. Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (anti-HBs) This is a protective antibody. The presence of anti -HBs following a known acute infection indicates recovery and immunity against reinfection. Anti- HBs can also be acquired as an immune response to the hepatitis B vaccine, indicating that the individual adequately responded to the vaccine and is protected from infection.

Interpretation of Infant Post -Vaccination Serologic Testing and Related Actions HBsAg Anti-HBs Interpretation and Necessary Action - + The infant is immune to HBV. Case management services are considered complete. - - The infant is NOT immune to hepatitis B. The infant must receive a second dose of the hepatitis B vaccine as soon as post -vaccination serology results are known. The infant can then repeat PVST 1-2 months after the booster dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. If still not immune after the booster dose, the child should complete the 2 nd and 3rd hepatitis B vaccine dose and repeat PVST 1 -2 months later . Alternatively, providers and parents may decide to repeat the entire three- dose vaccine series and then repeat PVST 1- 2 months later. See Chapter 5 for more detail. + - The vaccination effort failed. The infant is infected with HBV (perinatal hepatitis B infection) and is likely to become a chronic carrier. All confirmed cases of perinatal HBV infection should be reported to the state through NEDSS as soon as they are identified, and to the perinatal hepatitis B coordinator through the submissi on of the Infant Case Management F orm, along with a copy of the laboratory report. Refer the child for clinical follow - up. Case management services are considered complete. NOTE: The surveillance case definition for perinatal hepatitis B virus infection is HBsAg positivity in any infant aged 1 -24 months or positive for HBeAg or HBV DNA aged 9 -24 months who was born in the US or in US territories to an HBsAg -positive mother.

What should we do when we get discrepant lab results for cases? (i.e., when a prenatal HbsAg lab is positive and the delivery HbsAg lab is negative? ) Women who have had ANY confirmed positive HBsAg lab result should be case managed and their infants should receive Post -Exposure Prophylaxis ( PEP) at birth. They should be case managed until HBsAg status is confirmed. To determine chronic hepatitis B, the client needs to have two (2) positive HBsAg results at least six (6) months apart. Clients with discrepant labs should be tested for HBsAg, Anti- HBs & Anti-HBc. This will help differentiate between acute and chronic hepatitis B cases. In addition, getting the vaccine history can help determine if they had a false positive HbsAg result. 2. When should I close out an index case as \"referred for medical follow up\" and how do I do that? Referred for medical follow -up means that the case manager has instructed the index case to follow -up with their PCP or specialist for management of hepatitis B. Case managers do not need to get an actual referral for the client. Any index case with chronic hepatitis B can be closed as \"referred to medical follow up,\" as long as the y have been educated about the need for regular hepatitis B monitoring and advised to see their specialist/PCP. 3. What should we do if postvaccine serology testing (PVST) for an infant is done before the infant is 9 months of age? Completing PVST prior to 9 months of age is not recommended, as it can lead to inaccurate results due to the detection of passive anti -HBs from the HBIG administered at birth. Also, testing after 9 months of age will increase the chance of detecting a late hepatitis B infection. If an infant completes testing early, they should be re -tested again after 9 months of age to ensure accurate results. Education should be given to the provider about the need to wait until the infant is over 9 months of age to perform PVST. 4. I have pediatric providers who want to wait to do PVST at 1 year of age. How should I respond to this? Case managers should educate providers on why completing PVST at 9 months of age is optimal for the child's health and safety. Infants who Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 188 complete the hepatitis B vaccin e series on time should have PVST done at 9 months of age to capture any late -occurring hepatitis B infections, while avoiding inaccurately sensing passive anti -HBs still circulating from the HBIG given at birth. PVST at 9 months of age is also convenient because the infant is due for a well -child check -up. Waiting to perform PVST until the child is older can result in false - negative Anti -HBs results and more vaccines for the infant. In addition, infants who do not respond to the first series of vaccines ar e still susceptible to hepatitis B and are at high risk of exposure in their household. It is imperative that the susceptible infants are re - vaccinated immediately to prevent hepatitis B transmission. Also, there are occasional cases of perinatal hepatitis B infection, despite PEP, and these infants need to be evaluated and reported as soon as possible. 5. What should we do when we have cases that are not responding to calls/letters? Utilize all available resources to check for updated contact information, including providers, NEDSS, ImmTrac2, and Medicaid/WIC, as applicable. Ask the provider if they have received a record request from another provider or know of any plans to move out of the country or out of the state . Follow the instructions listed in Chapter 9 : Case Management to establish contact with the client. Do not close out as \"never located\" or \"lost to follow -up\" without following the steps listed in the manual. If unable to establish contact after following the steps listed in the manual, contact your coordinator for advice on how to close the case. 6. What are some strategies to educate providers? Provider education and training is a vital component of the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Perina tal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP). It is the responsibility of the case managers to provide training to prenatal providers, labor & delivery staff, and pediatricians. These providers all need to be aware of the state laws and statutes related to H bsAg testing and reporting, serology interpretation, recommended post -exposure prophylactics (PEP), how to handle mothers with an unknown status, and the hepatitis B vaccine series and PVST. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 189 There are various ways to provide training. An in- person training is best for new providers or new labor and delivery staff. See the training checklist for details of topics and materials for each type of training. In-person training may also be needed after there is a missed HBsAg screen, PEP, etc., to review the facil ity's policies and procedures. 7. Can you explain what is different for infants who weigh less than 2,000 grams (4.4 lbs.) at birth? Infants who weigh less than 2,000 g at birth (<4.4 lbs .) are considered low birthweight infants (LBW). LBW infants born to HbsAg - positive mothers should receive HBIG and the birth dose of HBV within 12 hours of birth, however, the HBV birth dose does not count toward the vaccine series because LBW infants may have decreased immunogenicity. These infants should complete the three (3) additional doses according to ACIP's vaccine recommendation schedule and will need to receive at least four (4) total doses of the hepatitis B vaccine. Ensure LBW infants are flagge d/noted in the case management tracking system to confirm the infants receive the appropriate number of hepatitis B vaccine doses. NOTE: LBW infants born to women of unknown HBsAg status should receive HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth as well. LBW infants born to HbsAg -negative mothers can have their first hepatitis B vaccine deferred by the provider until 1 month of age or hospital discharge. 8. What should we do if we have a HbsAg positive mother who refuses post -exposure prophylaxis for her infant? It is important to provide education to the mother prior to the infant's birth about the potential consequences of perinatal hepatitis B infection and how to prevent transmission. Use real -life personal stories about hepatitis B to illustr ate the importance of prevention. The Hepatitis B Foundation (hepb.org) has short videos of people sharing their experiences with hepatitis B. If a mother still refuses PEP after delivery, the hospital should require the mother to sign a refusal to vaccina te/against medical advice form. Obtain a copy of the refusal documentation for the case management file. Obtain information for Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 190 the infant's pediatrician and follow up at their 2 -month visit to see if the mother consented to the hepatitis B vaccine. If not , close out the case as \"noncompliant/refused.\" Generally, involving child protective services or another authoritative figure has not been successful in convincing these mothers to consent to PEP. Providing real -life examples and stories may help convince a hesitant mother to allow PEP. 9. I have an index case who has moved out of my jurisdiction, what should I do? First, review the Case Management Report (CMR) for completion prior to transferring. Close out the case appropriately, for example as \"transferred to another jurisdiction \", \"transferred to San Antonio/Houston\" , or \"moved out of state \". There does not need to be any transfer form completed if the client moves out of the country. Make sure to document the case's new address and contact information in the comment section. Complete the Case Management Transfer Form (Stock no. F11- 11015) and send that form along with the CMR(s) to your PHR coordinator. Central Office (CO) is responsible for sending the case to the appropriate jurisdiction. If you discover the client has moved out of the state but are unable to obtain the new address, contact CO for assistance. CO can contact the other state to see if they are able to find the case. If the other state cannot find an address, the case will have to be closed as \"lost to follow -up\" instead of \"transferred out of state \". Remember that all transfer s out of state need to be done by CO. 10. I just received PVST results for one of my cases, but the provider only performed one lab test instead of both. What should I do? First, check the date of when the lab was performed. Most commercial labs keep specimens for four or five (4 -5) days and may be able to add labs to an existing specimen. If the lab was recent, immediately call the provider and ask them to call the lab and add the other test to the specimen. Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 191 If it has been more than a week, notify the provider and explain why both labs need to be completed. The provider should notify the guardian to return with the infant for additional testing. Some providers may not feel it is necessary to repeat a lab draw for one missing lab. Reiterate the need for both lab s to ensure the infant is not infected and that vaccination was successful. 11. I have an anti-HBs result for an infant that is <10 IU /mL or non- reactive. What should we do? First, make sure the HbsAg lab was drawn along with the anti -HBs to rule out an HB infection. If the HbsAg is also negative, this infant is considered \"susceptible \". The infant should receive a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine immediately. The infant can then repeat PVST (HBsAg and Anti -HBs) one to two (1 -2) months after the booster dose. If the anti- HBs remains non -reactive after the booster dose, the infant should repeat an entire second hepatitis B vaccine series and needs two (2) more doses of hepatitis B vaccine. The infant should then repeat PVST 1 -2 months after the last vaccine. The CDC recently recommended this \"booster dose\" option based on studies that found that children showed an adequate immune response (anti -HBs 10 mIU/mL) after just one (1) hepatitis B vaccine. The guardian and provider can also choose to immediately repeat the entire three -dose hepatitis B vaccine series and repeat PVST one to two (1-2) months after the last vaccine. 12. I have an infant who has received three (3) doses of hepatitis B vaccine, but the last dose was given at 4 months of age. Is this infant considered complete? No, this infant needs another dose of hepatitis B vaccine, on or after 6 months of age. 13. Any tips for finding infants in ImmTrac? ImmTrac2 has a \"smart search\" function. You do not need to know the name of the infant to use this function. Instead, you can put in \"baby\" and \"girl\" for the first and last name section. Then, put in the appropriate birthday, sex, and street address. This can help find infants when their first and last n ames are unknown. ImmTrac2 also Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 192 has instructional videos and webinars online at www.dshs.texas.gov/immunize/immtrac/User -Training/ . 14. I received a delivery report with no known mother information. The hospital says the infant was safely surrendered. What should I do and how can I case manage without the mother's information? The CDC recommends that all infants born to women whose hepatitis B status remains unknown indefinitely (e .g., safely surrendered after birth) be enrolled in PHBPP. These infants will need to receive HBIG and the hepatitis B birth dose, complete the Hepatitis B vaccine series, and complete PVST. If you receive a delivery report for an infant that was safely surrendered, contact the hospital, and ask to speak with the infant's social worker. The social worker should have information about the child's placement (e.g., with a foster family, with relatives etc.) and their contact information. Once the contact infor mation is received, reach out to the responsible guardians , and tell them about PHBPP and the need for case management. The \"mother's case management report\" can be completed without knowing the mother's information. For example, use \"Jane Doe\" for the mot her's name and leave all other information blank. Write a note in the comment section that this was a safe surrender infant. Open the infant CMR and use the guardian's demographic information for the \"phone number\" and \"address\" fields. Make a note that th is is a safe surrender infant. 15. Should HBsAg positive pregnant also have HBV DNA testing? Yes, the CDC recommends that HBsAg positive pregnant women also be tested for HBV DNA. The test is used to guide antiviral therapy that might be indicated for women with very high HBV DNA viral loads. 16. How can I help my hospitals enroll in IAC's Hepatitis B Honor Roll? The Hepatitis B Birth Dose Honor Roll recognizes U.S. birthing institutions with a birth dose coverage rate of 90% or greater and who have also me t additional criteria to ensure newborns do not fall through the cracks in the event of a medical error. Application for Texas Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) Manual 193 Honor Roll inclusion is available at www.immunize.org/honor - roll/birthdose/apply.aspx . 17. What types of support are available for these mothers? The DSHS Immunization Section PHBPP has developed educational materials for HBsAg -positive women and their healthcare providers. These materials can be found at www.texasperinatalhepb.org . The CDC and the organization Hep B Moms have i nformation about hepatitis B and perinatal hepatitis B available to order for free or to download in many different languages from: www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/perinatalxmtn.htm#eduTools and www.hepbmoms.org/brochures .
