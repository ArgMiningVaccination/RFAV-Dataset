Systematically illuminates Rudolf Steiner's spiritual practices. \"It is easy to be good by being weak. It is easy to be strong by being wicked. It is difficult and heroic to be free. . .\" Rudolf Steiner often emphasised the importance of meditation practice for the self-development of students of anthroposophy. In his writings and lectures, he offered various insights for approaches to meditation and for strengthening the qualities needed to unfold our spiritual abilities. In this accessible book, Massimo Scaligero -- a lifelong student of Rudolf Steiner -- systematically illuminates Steiners practices, building on the foundation of our human constitution and explaining how and why these practices work. This is a text that should be read and thought about deeply, but also acted upon. It will be an aid to all those who wish to take the path of initiation through anthroposophy.
