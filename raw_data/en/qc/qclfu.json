Efforts to boost human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates among adolescents have seen moderate success with the use of parent notifications. Nonetheless, there is limited research on the comparative efficacy and practicality of various HPV reminder methods in settings with restricted resources. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study (2016-2017) assessed the impact of three types of parent reminders (written correspondence, automated phone calls, and SMS messages) on HPV vaccine uptake for the subsequent dose among 12-year-olds at a prominent Federally Qualified Health Center in Los Angeles County. The researchers matched six clinics into three groups, randomly allocating one clinic from each group to either intervention or control. The intervention clinics were randomly assigned one of the three reminder methods. The researchers determined the rates of vaccine uptake for the next dose and analyzed intervention outcomes using logistic regression models. The proportion of successfully delivered reminders for each method was used as a measure of feasibility. The study included 877 12-year-olds due for an HPV vaccine dose (47% female, more than 85% Latino). The study found that after a 4-month follow-up, 23% of those in the intervention group received an HPV vaccine dose, compared to just 12% in the control group. Overall, receiving any reminder led to higher rates of the next-required HPV vaccine compared to standard care (p = 0.046). Notable improvements were seen with SMS reminders (p = 0.036) and among boys (p = 0.006). Automated phone calls proved to be the least feasible method. Text message reminders are both effective and practical in encouraging HPV vaccination. AHRQ-funded; HS000044 Citation: Glenn BA, Crespi CM, Herrmann AK .

Vaccination, Sexual Health Stone CA, Jr., Robinson LB, Li L Clinical phenotypes of immediate first-dose reactions to mRNA COVID-19: a multicenter latent class analysis. The objectives of this retrospective study were to define distinct clinical phenotypes of immediate reactions after dose 1 of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, and to assess the relation of clinical phenotype to mRNA COVID-19 vaccine second dose tolerance. Researchers identified 265 patients who experienced dose-1 immediate reactions with 3 phenotype clusters: limited or predominantly cutaneous, sensory, or systemic. Of these, 223 patients received a second dose and 200 tolerated the second dose; sensory cluster (numbness or tingling) was associated with a higher likelihood of second dose intolerance, but this finding did not persist when accounting for objective signs.

This study's goal was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of engaging unhoused peer ambassadors (PAs) in COVID-19 vaccination efforts to reach people experiencing unsheltered homelessness in Los Angeles County. A total of 117 PAs were enrolled at 103 events, participating for an average of 2 hours. Findings showed that 197 additional people were vaccinated over 167 PA hours, accounting for >25% of all vaccines given at these events, indicating that recruiting same-day unhoused PAs is a feasible, acceptable, and preliminarily effective technique to increase COVID-19 vaccination in unsheltered settings.

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a multi-component, system-level intervention to improve human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) clinics. The eight participating clinics were randomly assigned to study condition (four intervention, four usual care) that serve a primarily low-income Latino population. The intervention included parent reminders for HPV vaccine series completion, provider training, clinic-level audit and feedback, and workflow modifications to reduce missed opportunities for vaccination. The authors compared HPV vaccination rates among patients, ages 11 to 17 during a 12-month preintervention period and a 15-month intervention period. There was a greater increase in vaccination completion rates among boys, but not girls. AHRQ-funded; HS000046. Citation: Glenn BA, Nonzee NJ, Herrmann AK .

Vaccination Qin CX, Auerbach SR, Charnaya O Antibody response to three SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in adolescent solid organ transplant recipients. The purpose of this observational cohort study was to assess whether a third SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would improve immunogenicity in adolescent solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs), and to report the antibody response and safety of a third mRNA vaccine dose (D3) in adolescent SOTRs. Forty-two participants received three BNT162b2 doses and one received three mRNA-1273 doses. Participants were 6-13 years from transplant (median 10 [IQR]), and heart transplant was the most common procedure, in 41.9% of the participants. 9.3% of participants reported pre-D1 SARS-CoV-2 infections and 9.3% reported breakthrough infections. The study found that 88.4% of adolescent SOTRs had positive antibody responses 1 month post-D3, an increase from 63-73% post-D2. 54.5% of participants with prior negative responses seroconverted and 100% with positive responses increased or remained at maximum titer. Titers remained stable 3 months post-D3. There were no vaccine-related adverse events and four breakthrough infections. The researchers concluded that although this was a convenience sample, the results suggest there is an antibody response benefit to a third SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in adolescent SOTRs. response to three SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in adolescent solid organ transplant recipients.

The objectives of this study were to survey health administrators in Massachusetts county jails about institutional influenza vaccine policies and practices and estimate influenza vaccination rates in Massachusetts jails from 2013 to 2020. Findings showed that influenza vaccination rates in Massachusetts jails were low, and delivery practices in jails varied. The authors noted that lack of influenza vaccinations in jails is a gap in health care that needs to be prioritized, especially considering the current COVID-19 pandemic. They suggested that further investigations for effective and equitable vaccination in this population should involve people who are incarcerated and people who make influenza vaccine policies in jails.

The author indicates that there are too few cases reporting aphthosis after COVID disease or COVID-19 vaccination to infer a statistical association, but that case reports are a valuable source of rich details about conditions that are difficult to study with more rigorous designs and can be synthesized to help guide medical care. She recommends that it is time for a high-quality systematic review of vulvar aphthosis in order for clinicians to incorporate the existing evidence into decision-making and best care for patients.

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis of case studies and case reports was to assess the risk of severe immediate allergic reactions to a second dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in people who experienced an immediate allergic reaction to the first dose. The researchers evaluated the World Health Organization Global Coronavirus database, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Embase from the date of inception through October 4th, 2021. The main outcomes and measures were a risk of severe immediate allergic reaction and repeated severe immediate allergic reactions with a second vaccine dose. The study found that among 22 studies of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, 1366 individuals had immediate allergic reactions to their first vaccination. Of these, 87.8% were women with a mean age of 46.1 years. Six patients developed severe immediate allergic reactions after their second vaccination, 232 developed mild symptoms, and 1360 tolerated the dose. Among 78 persons with severe immediate allergic reactions to their first SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, 4 people had a second severe immediate reaction, and 15 had non-severe symptoms. There were no deaths. The study concluded that in a supervised setting equipped to manage severe allergic reactions, revaccination of individuals with an immediate allergic reaction to a first SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine dose can be safe.

This study's purpose was to investigate associations between parent vaccine confidence and intentions to have their child with autism vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine. A cross-sectional, web-based survey of 332 parents of children with autism spectrum disorder who were members of an integrated healthcare system in Southern California was conducted from May to July 2021. Approximately 35% of parents were going to vaccinate their child against COVID-19. Positive vaccine beliefs, healthcare provider trust, or parent vaccination status were associated with intention to vaccinate. AHRQ-funded; HS026407. Citation: Choi K, Becerra-Culqui T, Bhakta B .

Keywords: Children/Adolescents, Vaccination, BA, Singhal R Increasing HPV vaccination among low-income, ethnic minority adolescents: effects of a multicomponent system intervention through a county health department hotline. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has cancer prevention benefits, yet low uptake. The purpose of the study was to evaluate an intervention intended to improve vaccine uptake in low-income, ethnic minority adolescents using a telephone hotline to seek county health department services. The researchers recruited participants through randomization of health department hotline callers who were caregivers of never-vaccinated adolescents aged 11-17. The intervention included multi-lingual print and telephone education and personalized referral to a low cost or free provider of vaccines. Participants completed baseline, 3-month, and 9-month telephone surveys. The study found that by the end of the 9-month follow up period, the HPV vaccination rates had increased, however there were no differences between the intervention (45%) and control (42%) groups. The researchers also observed significant improvements in perceived HPV knowledge, perceived HPV risk, and barriers to vaccination. The study concluded that the county hotline intervention did not produce a greater increase in HPV vaccine rates in the intervention group than the group without the intervention. The study authors recommend that future studies should evaluate interventions which are more intensive and address accessing and using services in complex, safety net settings. The authors also noted that because 44% of unvaccinated adolescents in both the intervention and control groups received at least one dose of the vaccine during the study period, investigators of future studies should be aware of the potential priming effects of participation in the study, which may impact the results of interventions.

This paper discusses the decline in immunization delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. The global community is at risk for a resurgence in vaccine-preventable infections including measles, pertussis, and polio. Outbreaks in the United States are likely to occur when social distancing stops and children return to school. Partnerships between healthcare providers, community leaders, and local, state, regional, and national public health departments are needed to reassure families that vaccine delivery during COVID-19 is safe as well as to identify and catch up those children who are under-immunized.

Cox SN, Wedlock PT, Pallas SW A systems map of the economic considerations for vaccination: application to hard-to-reach populations. The authors developed a systems map of the mechanisms involved in vaccination, and associated costs and benefits, focused at the service delivery level, in order to identify the mechanisms that may be different for hard-to-reach populations. They concluded that decision-makers can use this systems map to understand where steps in the vaccination process may be interrupted or weak and identify where gaps exist in the understanding of the economics of vaccination. With improved understanding of system-wide effects, their map can help decision-makers inform targeted interventions and policies to increase vaccination coverage in hard-to-reach populations.

This retrospective cohort study examined the outcomes of screening mRNA COVID-19 vaccine risk using patient-reported anaphylactic history at a single academic hospital employee vaccination program. Although rare, m-RNA COVID-19 vaccines have been contraindicated in patients with known allergy to polyethylene glycol (PEG) 2000 present in the lipid nanoparticle carrier system of these vaccines. Health care workers and other affiliates who met criteria based on the Tennessee Department of Health COVID-19 Vaccination Plan received the first dose of Pfizer m-RNA vaccine. Out of 23,035 individuals who were screened before dose 1, 31 reported a high-risk allergy history that triggered a focused review by the Allergist On-Call. Out of those 31, only 3 were recommended not to proceed to Dose 1 and were referred to the Drug Allergy Clinic for assessment. Ultimately, all individuals were cleared to receive their first dose, and none reported an adverse reaction. AHRQ-funded; HS026395. Citation: Krantz MS, Stone CA, Rolando LA .

The authors implemented a clinical decision support alert in the electronic health record that warned providers when ordering a tetanus vaccine if a prior one had been given within 10 years and studied its efficacy to reduce potentially unnecessary vaccines in the ED. They found that a clinical decision support alert that warns ED clinicians that a patient may have an up-to-date tetanus vaccination status reduced potentially unnecessary vaccinations.

This study uses data from a survey of Medicare beneficiaries conducted in the fall of 2020 before the COVID-19 vaccine was approved to try and predict COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and decline rates. A cross-sectional analysis using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) Fall COVID-19 Supplement was used to conduct telephone interviews administered by NORC at the University of Chicago. The analysis included 8,455 community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries, representative of 50.2 million people. Overall, 58.7% said they would get the vaccine, 15.3% said they would not, and 26.1% were unsure. Least likely to say they would get a vaccine were beneficiaries under 65 years old (48.8%), Black beneficiaries (36.2%) and Hispanic beneficiaries (50.5%). Reasons given for not planning to get vaccinated included 1) the vaccine could have side effects or is not safe (42.4%), 2) do not trust what the government says about the vaccine (42.4%), 3) do not think the vaccine would prevent COVID-19 (11.%), and 4) do not like vaccines or needles (8.2%). Black and Hispanic beneficiaries were more likely to say they were declining because they don't trust the government than White beneficiaries. Younger beneficiaries were more likely to say the vaccine could cause COVID-19, and only 2% of respondents said they would decline the vaccine because COVID-19 is not serious. The latter group was disproportionately male (77.5%) Medicare beneficiaries' plans for the COVID-19 vaccine in Fall 2020, and why some planned to decline.

The Middlesex [Massachusetts] Sheriff's Office developed and distributed two self-response surveys to assess COVID-19 vaccine willingness among people incarcerated in the jail and among people who work at the jail. The goal of this study was to characterize vaccine willingness in these two populations at the Middlesex House of Correction and Jail. Findings showed that 59% of people incarcerated in jail did not want the COVID-19 vaccine, while 82% of jail staff were interested in receiving the vaccine. Among people who were incarcerated, those who identified as Black had significantly decreased odds of wanting the vaccine compared to those who identified as white. Race was not significantly associated with vaccine willingness among jail employees when adjusting for role and gender. AHRQ-funded; HS026008. Citation: Khorasani SB, Koutoujian PJ, Zubiago J .
