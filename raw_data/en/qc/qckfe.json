Failure to thrive concer... I've been working with Dr. Mayer for well over a year, and she's pretty much amazing. I consider myself to be pretty knowledgable on all things natural health, but was struggling with exhaustion, digestive issues, and nutrient deficiencies. Dr. Mayer ran all of the necessary tests and recommended a program that included supplements and lifestyle changes that literally changed my life. I now crossfit 6x a week, am in the best shape of my life, and have a diet that's on point. I've been to and worked with a lot of practitioners, but Dr. Mayer is the only one I trust with something as important as my health. I would highly recommend getting in with her while you can. Dr. Mayer has treated our son, Charlie, since he was a baby with chronic severe eczema, to now a thriving, healthy two year old. She has been an invaluable source of education to our entire family. We were low on hope and left with no answers from our pediatrician, dermatologist, and allergist- other than the use of steroids- for our precious 3 month old. Dr. Mayer went into great detail to understand Charlie's entire life and environment that could be aggravating his eczema, and helped us take control of everything within our power. With her guidance, we were able to eventually overcome Charlie's eczema and now look to her for everything. Most recently at 2 years old, we were terrified to find detectable levels of lead in Charlie's blood work. Dr. Mayer helped us to understand the results, how much to really worry, and how to detoxify his system. We have been empowered as parents learning from Dr. Mayer! Dr. Mayer, hands down, without a doubt, was the right choice for our son who was diagnosed with a neurotransmitter imbalance. I was also dealing with multiple health issues, so after watching my son's health improve, I began seeing Dr. Mayer, who in just a short window of time, was able to diagnose and set up a treatment plan of IV therapy, antibiotics, nutrition and supplements. It was the first time I had experienced a physician care for the whole body, not simply the symptoms. Now, not only does she care for our oldest son and myself, but my youngest son and husband. Today our family is healthy, happy, and thriving with the continued care of Dr Ashley Mayer. She is truly an amazing physician as well as a part of our family! When I came to Dr. Mayer I was suffering from extreme adrenal fatigue, hormonal imbalance, and an eating disorder. Dr. Mayer spent sooo much time with me, inquiring about my past, my health, and most importantly, my concerns and emotions. She took a true holistic approach to my healing. She is a doctor who truly cares about her patients and gives them the world!
