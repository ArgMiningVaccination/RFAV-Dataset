California is home to more than nine million residents aged 60 or older. By the end of the decade, 11 million Californians will be age 60 or older, and over one million will be 85 or older. Older Californians enrich our families, communities, and economy through diverse life experiences, cultures, and contributions.

Vaccine misinformation has increased over time, despite domestic and global efforts. The top 20 social media accounts spreading vaccine misinformation disproportionately include health care professionals and journalists. The Bottom Line 19Public Good News: The call is coming from inside the houseOver 70% of vaccine opposition originates from the U.S. Between March 2022 and March 2023, 71% of all English and Spanish language vaccine opposition and misinformation originated in the U.S. Other countries with English speakers (Canada, the U.K., Australia and India) make up the top vaccine opposition sources and account for more than 90% of opposition content. 20COVID-19 Vaccination is Our Best Tool in Preventing COVID! 21CDC MMWR: COVID- 19 and Mortality Among Unvaccinated and Vaccinated Persons CDC ACIP Slides: Bivalent COVID -19 Vaccine Booster DosesCOVID-19 Therapeutics Data23Disparities in COVID-19 Treatments: HPI Quartiles This chart uses the Healthy Places Index 3.0 (HPI) , developed by the Public Health Alliance of Southern California.

Scores range from less healthy community conditions in Quartile 1 to more healthy community conditions in Quartile 4 .

CDC MMWR: Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Outpatient Treatment of COVID -19 25Testing! Testing! Testing! Early testing and treatment is key. Many treatment options require initiation in the first 5 days. When in doubt, test! Based on FDA EUA, a positive test is not required for Paxlovid Rx, only a current diagnosis (which can be based on exposure and symptoms) Testing is widely available Note: Lack of testing should not be a barrier to prescribing therapeutics.26Outpatient Treatment ( Preferred ) Early treatment has shown to reduce progression to severe illness or hospitalization Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (Paxlovid) - PO bid x5 days Remdesivir x 3 days 27Outpatient Treatment (Alternative) Molnupiravir -PO bid x 5 days (Alternative therapy.

When clinical and/or logistical constraints prevent the use of both of these medications, molnupiravir can be an effective option for many patients.36 Talking with Patients about COVID- 19 Vaccines and Therapeutics\"Is the updated COVID -19 booster really necessary?\" The updated COVID -19 booster vaccine is strongly recommended for all individuals ages 6 months and older. COVID- 19 vaccines, including booster doses, have been added to the CDC routine immunization schedules . Recent data shows that the updated booster provides: oAdded protection against symptomatic infection in individuals 5 years of age and older oAdded protection against emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in adults 18 years of age and older 37CDC Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines MMWR: ACIP Immunization Schedules for Children & AdolescentsMMWR: ACIP Immunization Schedule for Adults CDC COVID- 19 Vaccine Effectiveness Updates: 2.24.2023 CDC MMWR: COVID- 19 Incidence and Mortality Among Unvaccinated and Vaccinated Persons Ages 12 Years and Older: 2.10.2023\"I already had COVID -19. Why do I need the vaccine?\" CDC: The Possibility of COVID -19 after Vaccination: Breakthrough Infections 38 Getting vaccinated still provides the best protection against severe illness, hospitalizations, and death from COVID- 19 Getting vaccinated provides an extra layer of protection against COVID- 19.39\"I'm not that sick. Why do I need treatment?\" COVID-19 treatment needs to be started within 5 or 7 days of symptom onset. If you wait until symptoms worsen, it may be too late. Mild symptoms can progress to severe symptoms. Treatment can significantly reduce your risk of severe illness, hospitalization and may reduce risk of long COVID. Therapeutics Myths and Facts40\"I'm not high risk.\" Therapeutics Myths and FactsMost adults are at risk of serious complications from COVID- 19 Obesity BMI >30 Physical Inactivity Age >50 years Unvaccinated 41\"Do treatments have dangerous side effects?\" Always a concern, which is why discussion with a clinician is required Paxlovid study <10% had side effects oBad taste (6%) oDiarrhea (3%) Drug -drug interactions need to be carefully assessed. Therapeutics Myths and Facts42 Therapeutics Myths and Facts\"Do medications cause COVID -19 rebound?\" COVID- 19 rebound can occur with or without treatment. Less than 20% of people experience COVID- 19 rebound. oRebound has been reported at higher rates in those who take Paxlovid, although not always statistically significant. If symptoms do return, they are often mild. Conversation Methodology 43To address patients concerns related to COVID -19 vaccines and therapeutics, use the 3- 5-3 method. 3 5 3 Steps to Start the ConversationKey MessagesWrap up the Conversation 3 Steps to Initiating/Continuing Conversations 44Ask and listen to the answer \"What do you think about COVID -19vaccines and treatments?\" \"Why do you feel that way?\" \"What concerns do you have about the medications?\"Create an alignment of safety \"I also want to weigh the risks and benefits. Let's decide together what's safest here.\" \"We both want what's safest for you, right now and into your future.\"Find common goals \"We all want to be able to recover quickly without needing hospitalization.\" \"What reasons would motivate you to take the vaccine/treatments?\" Find their personally motivating reason.3 2 1Key Messages 45The vaccine and treatments will keep you safe. The vaccine and treatments will protect you from getting very sick and may prevent long COVID. More than 12.7 billion vaccine doses have been given all over the world. Over one million Californians have safely taken Paxlovid.1 Key Messages 46Mild side effects are common. Severe side effects are rare. Mild vaccine side effects are a sign that your body is protecting you. Adverse events are rare. Treatment side effects happen in less than 1 out of every 10 people. During treatment, some people temporarily have: Unpleasant taste in the mouth (mints can help) Diarrhea General malaise2 Key Messages 47The vaccines and treatment are very effective. Vaccines and treatment are extremely effective at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID -19 and its variants.3 Key Messages 48Rebound is often misunderstood. Viral rebound can happen with or without treatment and is usually mild. Most people do not get rebound.4 Key Messages 49Have questions? Please ask. I am glad you want to know more.
