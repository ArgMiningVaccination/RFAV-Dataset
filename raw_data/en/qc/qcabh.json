RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 14 of 270 Introduction The purpose of this handbook is to build on human subjects protection principles and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards, while describing how to appl y these regulations and standards to the day -to-day conduct of clinical research studies at UT Southwestern . This handbook is intended to accompany and complement the UT Southwestern curric ulum , which includes the CITI course and video product ions, and to serve as a resource and reference for our research staff. This handbook has been written both as an introduction to best practices for those who are new to clinical research at UT Southweste rn, and as a refresher for more experienced clinical research staff. The content in this handbook is geared tow ard research staff who oversee the management of clinical research studies within the UTSW environment . However, the majority of the content wil l be applicable to clinical research involving human subjects in all types of settings. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines a human subject as a living individual about whom an investigator (the researcher leading the project) conducting resea rch obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual or obtains identifiable private informa tion about the individual ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm ). Regulations g overning use of hum an subjects in research extend to use of human organs, tissues, and body fluids from identifi able individuals and to graphic, written, or recorded information derived from such individuals. There are other terms that may be used to refer to human subjects in research in this handbook , incl uding participant, volunteer, or subject. The NIH glossary defines clinical research in broad areas including: Patient -oriented research. Research conducted directly with human subjects or on material o f human origin such as tissues, specimens, and cognit ive phenomena. This research includes: o Mechanisms of human disease o Therapeutic interventions o Clinical trials o Development of new technologies. Epidemiological and behavioral studies. Outcomes research and health services research. Also taken from the NIH g lossary, a clinical trial is defined as a biomedical or beh avioral UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 15 of 270 research study of human subjects designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions (drugs, treatments, devices, or new ways of using known drugs, treatments , or devices). Clinical trials are used to determine whethe r new biomedical or behavioral interventions are safe, efficacious, and effective. The term \"prospectively assigned \" refers to a pre-defined process specified in an approved protocol that stipulat es the assignment of research subjects (individually or in clusters) to one or more arms (e.g., intervention, placebo or other control) of the clinical trial. An \"intervention\" is defined a s a manipula tion of the subject or subject 's environment for the pu rpose of modifying one or more health -related processes and /or endpoints. Examples include, but are not limited, to: drugs/small molecules/compounds, biologics, devices; procedures (e.g., surgical tec hniques); delivery systems (e.g., telemedicine, face -to-face); strategies to change health -related behavior (e.g., diet, cognitive therapy, exercise, development of new habits); and, treatment, prevention, and diagnostic strategies, including t he use of on e of the above for imaging. A \"health -related biomedica l or behavioral outcome\" is defined as the effect of an intervention on the study subjects. Examples include positive or negative changes to physiological or biological parameters (e.g., i mprovement o f lung capacity, gene expression); psychological or neur odevelopmental parameters (e.g., mood management interventi on for smokers; reading comprehension and/or information retention); disease processes; health -related behavior; and well-being o r quality of life. Throughout this handbook , the terms clinical re search study and clinical trial will be used interchangeabl y. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 16 of 270 Chapter 1: Basic Concepts in Clinical Research A. Overview of Clinical Research Regulations and Guidance Depending on the researc h study type and the specific funding agency or sponsor, multipl e levels of regulatory and compliance oversight may be invo lved, including federal regulations, state laws, institutional policies and guidelines, and fund ing agency or sponsor po licies and guidelines. Even if you are not able to fully understand all the c omplex regulations and policies, it is important to be awar e of their presence and impact on clinical research operations as they all contribute to the foundation for and direct the conduct of research studies. Understanding the levels of oversight for a s tudy will ensure the appropriate procedures are in place. Department of Health and Human Services The diagram below was derived from the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) organizational chart. The full organizational chart is found online at (http://www.hhs.gov/about/orgchart/ ). Most clinical resear ch studies that take place at an Academic Health Center (AHC) are regulated by one or more of the DHHS agencies. T hough all these agencies a re part of DHHS, they function under different sets of regu lations that will be discussed later in this chapter. Most government agencies have the legal authority to develop and enforce their own specific regulations and rules, i ncluding the National Inst itutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (F DA), and Office for Human Research Protection (OHRP). Suc h agency -specific regulations and rules are announced in the daily Federal Register and published, or codified, in an annual update to the C ode of Federal Regulations (CFR). The Code of Federal Regu lations (CFR) is the codification of the general and perm anent rules UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 17 of 270 published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The CFR has 50 titles rep resenting broad areas subject to Federal regulation . Each t itle is further divided into parts that cover specific re gulatory areas, for example, 21 CFR 50 is shorthand for Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 50. The FDA functions under Title 21 and OHRP regulations are included in Title 45. Office f or Human Research Protections (OHRP) OHRP is the federa l office that creates and enforces the regulations for all types of human subjects research, not just clinical research. In 1974 the Departme nt of Health, Education and Welfare, now known as the US De partment of Health and Human Service s (DHHS ), publishe d regulations for the protection of human research subjects, Title 45 CFR Part 46, the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. Thi s regulation became known as the Common Rule in 1991 when a n additional 14 federal departments and agencies incor porated the policy into their own regulations. That number continues to grow. The Common Rule is applied to biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects in the United States and is the basic standard of ethics to which any government -funded research in the US is held. Most researchers in academic institutions, including UT Southwestern , apply these protections to all types of res earch involving human subjects. National Institutes of Hea lth NIH is located withi n the DHHS. In addition to con ducting its own research studies, the NIH provides federal funding for thousands of researchers in universities through its institutes and centers. In fact, NIH is the largest public funder of biomedica l and behavioral researc h in the world . NIH's mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengt hen life, and reduce illness and disability. It is importa nt to note that although the NIH is primarily a funding agency and not a regulatory body, research studies funded through the NIH are regulated under 45 CFR 46, the Common Rule, and by the stipulat ions of the funding grant and institute or center within th e NIH. Food and Drug Administration UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 18 of 270 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also a branch of the DHHS. The FDA is the regulatory body responsible for the regulation and oversight of all human su bjects research if it involve s drugs, devices, biologics an d/or vaccines. These types of studies mu st adhere to CFR Title 21. Investigational New Drug (IND) Application (21 CFR 312 ) Prior to evaluating a drug in humans, the sponsor must receive approval from the FDA to conduct a study under an investigational new drug application (IND) application. This FDA application process standardizes the testing of new medicati ons with human subjects. The FDA has two primary objective s in reviewing an IND application : 1. To assure the safety and rights of subjects are protected in all phases of a new drug investigation. 2. To assure the quality of the scientific investigation of the drug is adequate to permit an evaluation of the drug's eff ectiveness and safety. According to t he FD A, an investigational drug is the object of clinical investigations to determine the safety and effectiveness of the drug. The term investigational drug in this handbook refers to a drug being investigated under a n IND application. This include s new drugs and FDA approved drugs being evaluated for a new indication or in combination with other drugs. Investigational drugs and the various stages and phases o f development will be described in more detail later in thi s handbook . When all phases of clinical studies are successfully completed, the holder of an IND Application may then submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Rese arch (CDER) for approval of the drug for the indication und er investigation. For therapeutic biologics, a Biologic License Application (BLA) is completed and submitted in the same manner. A Drug is defined as: A substance recognized by an official pharmac opoeia or formulary, created using a chemical process A sub stance intended for us e in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease A substance (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 19 of 270 body. Biologica l products are included within this definition and are gene rally covered by the same laws and regulations, but differences exist regarding their manufacturing processes (chemical process versus biological process.) A Biologic is defined as: Biological pro ducts include a wide range of products such as vaccines, bl ood and blood compone nts, allergenics, somatic cells, gene therapy, tissues, and recombinant therapeutic proteins. Biologics can be composed of sugars, proteins, or nucleic acids or complex combina tions of these substances, or may be living entities such a s cells and tissues. Biologics are isolated from a variety of natural sources \u2014 human, animal, or microorganism \u2014 and may be produced by biotechnology methods and o ther cutting -edge technologies. In general, the term \"drugs \" includes therapeutic biologica l products. Investiga tional Device Exemption (IDE) Application If the study is evaluating an investigational device, the FDA reviews an investigational device exemption (IDE) application with the same objectives in mind as if reviewing a n investigational new drug application ( IND) application . It can be counterintuitive to grasp that submitting an IDE application is the process for testin g a new device. The term exemption means that it doesn't mee t the PreMarket Approval (PMA) regulatory requirements, thu s it must go through r igorous testing to ensure safety and effectiveness. The term \"device \" is very broad and refers to an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article intended for use in the di agnosis, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of devices vary widely fr om bandages to pacemakers, defibrillators, and infusion pumps. Even wheelchairs and crutches are consider ed devices. An investigational device is the object of cli nical investigation (s) to determine the safety and effectiveness of the device and is not available for commercial sale or distribution for the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 20 of 270 indication being evaluated. When all stages of inves tigation are successfully completed, the individual that su bmitted the IDE ap plication to the FDA may then submit a PMA application to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) for approval of the device for commercial sales and distribution. Investigational devices and the various types, stages and p hases of developme nt will be described in more detail later in this manual. Table 1. Application Type Investigational Product Drug Biologic Device Investigational IND IND IDE Approval NDA BLA PMA Table 1 provides a summary of the Investigational Pr oduct stages, iden tifying how the different processes correspond to the different types of investigational product. The definitions below were abstracted from the FDA Glossary of Terms: https://www .fda.gov/drugs/informationondrugs/ucm079436.htm B. Federalwide Assurance For an institution to accept federal research funding, it must obtain, or hold , a Federalwide Assu rance (FWA ). The FWA is effective for 5 years and must be renewed by the institution every 5 years, even if no changes have occurred, in order to maintain an active FWA. Any renewal or update that is submitted electronically, and a pprov ed by OHRP, begins a new -5-year effective period . UT Southwestern 's FWA provide s assurance to the federal government that all investigators working on human subjects research will comply with the terms of assurance . Other institutions covered by the UT S outhwes tern FWA include the following: Parkland Health and Hospital System Scottish Rite for Children Children's Health Texas Health Resources UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 21 of 270 The terms of assurance dictate that when an institu tion engages in FWA -regulated research, the institution ass ures co mpliance with the principles of the Belmont Report, the Common Rule, and all other applicable federal, state, institution or funding agency regulations and good clinical practice guidelines. C. Good Clinical Pract ice There are many regulatory authorit ies inv olved in the oversight of clinical research as described thus far. In addition, there is one international \"gold standard\" guideline that, if followed, meets all the regulatory authority ove rsight expectations - the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guid elines . GCP is an international standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analyses, and reporting of clinical trials that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the ri ghts, integrity, and confidentiality of trial subjects are protected. The FDA accepted the GCP guidelines when they were published in the Federal Register on May 9, 1997. Revision 2 (R2) was adopt ed by the FDA on March 1, 2018. D. Research Setting In additi on to the Federal regulations, all members of the research team should be aware of the research setting in which they are conducting research. The steps to initiate, conduct and report research may differ b ased on the research setting. This manual is geare d towa rd research staff conducting research within UTSW or other UT Southwestern clinical research environments . UTSW , is comprised of The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, inclusiv e of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Medic al Sc hool, School of Allied Health Sciences, UT Southwestern Moncrief Cancer Center, Zale Lipshy University Hospital, and William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital, other centers and organized researc h units within UT Southwestern Medical Center. E. Sponsor Types A study sponsor is an individual, company, institution, or organization with the responsibility for the initiation, management, and/or financing of a clinical trial. There are several types of s tudy sponsors; this handbook will utilize two categorie s: industry sponsor and sponsor -investigator. Industry Sponsor An industry sponsored study is one that is initiated by a company or organization. They UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 22 of 270 develop the protocol and approach a site or an in vestigator at a site to participate in a study. The te rm industry sponsor often refers to a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company. But any funding organization, including a small company, a non -profit organization, or a foundation, designs and develops a protocol and appro aches a principal investigator (PI) or study site to be involved in the conduct of a study. In this case, the organization or company that approached the study site is considered the industry sponsor and assumes the sponsor responsibili ties. When conducti ng an industry sponsored study, UT South western typically participates as one of a number of study sites. A clinical research organization (CRO rg) may be contracted by the sponsor to manage some or most of the tasks related to study cond uct and management , such as regulatory affairs, clinical tri al planning, site selection and initiation, recruitment support, clinical monitoring, data management, trial logistics, biostatistics, medical writing, and project management . To provide oversight , a CRO rg often send s a monitor to a study site to review stud y records and data , although monitoring can also be done remotely . The monitor will also submit reports to the sponsor regarding the site's conduct on the study , as we ll as meet with the Principal Investigator peri odically to report on the team's ongoing performance . By reviewing the study team's work and providing timely feedback , the monitor ensures that the information recorded by the study team is both accurate and up-to- date, both of which ha ve a significant impact on the scientific validity o f the stu dy. Sponsor -Investigator A sponsor -investigator is an individual who both initiates and investigates . The term applies only to an individual . This term is not used to describe a company, an organi zation, or an agency. (ICH GCP E6 Studies managed under sponsor -investigator are referred to as Investigator -Initiated . The obligations of a sponsor - investigator include both those of a sponsor as well as those of a principal investigat or. The investigator often seeks funding or support for the aforementione d studies from non -profit organizations, foundations, private funding, departmental or institutional funding, and/or federal agencies. An investigator may also take their idea to a c ompany for funding. However, even if the study is funded by a company or organization, if an investigator initiated the study and developed the protocol, the PI is still a sponsor -investigator with additional responsibilities. It becomes most apparent that a PI is a cting as a sponsor -investigator when conducting f ederally -funded studies. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 23 of 270 A federally funded clinical research study is a peer -reviewed activity sponsored under a broad charter by a govern ment agency. Government or federal agencies that provide funding for research include, but are not limited to: The N ational Science Foundation (NSF) The Department of Defense (DOD) The Department of Energy (DOE) The Department of Transportation (DoT) The D epartment of Veteran's Affairs (VA) The National Institut es of Health (NIH within the DHHS) Within each of the vari ous federal agencies referenced above there are also numerous subdivisions. For example, the NIH has 27 institutes and centers that support research whose funding falls within the federally -sponsor ed category (NIH Organization | National Institutes of Health (NIH) ). Some e xamples of those instit utes and centers include the National Institute on Aging, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) , just to name a few . The various centers and institut es may also have additional categorization. For instance, the NCI has various cooperative groups and consortiums. F. Study Types Most researchers categorize study types b y the investigational product, such as drug, device, or biologic. However, these product s can be us ed for various reasons, thus we have categoriz ed the studies based on the intent of the investigational product. Intervention Intervention is a process or action that is the focus of a clinical research study. This could include the use of inve stigationa l drugs or medical devices or testing new proce dures. Interventions could also include noninvasive approaches such as training and education. Intervention st udies have been further divided, as described below. Therapeutic Intervention A therapeu tic intervention study is one that evaluates the usefulne ss of investigational therapies compared to standard treatments or no treatment. This could involve an investi gational drug, a device, a biologic, gene therapy, radiation therapy, stem cell t herapy, or nutritional, behavioral, or psychosocial approaches. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 24 of 270 Prevention Intervention A prevention intervention study is one that looks for better ways to prevent disorders from developing or recurring. Depending on the study, prevention research may involve dr ugs, vitamins, vaccines, minerals, or lifestyle changes. Supportive Care Intervention Supportive care intervention studies explore ways to improve comfort and the quality of life for individuals with chronic illnesses . Supportive care research may involve drugs, nutritional, behavioral, or psychosocial interven tions. It's important to note that supportive care research is intended to help the patient achieve comfort but do es not affect the ultimate course of a disease. Non-Intervention There are types of studies that don't involve an intervention, including: A genetic study that involves blood tests for genetic analysis related to a disease or condition A long -term study that involves psychological tests and brain scans A study of family history that invol ves talking to family members to learn about people's medical needs, their environment, and their history The Non -Intervention st udy type has been further divided, as described below . Epidemiologic/Observational/Outcomes Epidemiological studies seek to i dentify the patterns or contributing causes of disorders in groups of people. In the most basic of terms , epidemiology is the stud y of the frequency with which diseases and/or disorders affect different groups of people and the reasons why they occur. Epidemiologic studies, also known as observational or outcome s studies , can involve healthy populations a s well as diagn osed patients. Epidemiological research helps us to understand how many people suffer from a disease or disorder, if those numbers are chang ing, and how the disorder affects our society and our eco nomy. These studies often include observation or surv eillance, surveys, outcomes, or monitoring the subject's environment. An interesting facet of studying disorders is that the accepted definition of a disorder also tends to change over time as new info rmation from scientific research becomes known , makin g the aspect of researching the disease or disorder continuously challenging . For example , even scientists working in the same field at the same t ime may not always agree on the best way to UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 25 of 270 measure or de fine a particular disorder. What may be assumed as th e incidence ( i.e., the number of new cases within a defined time ) of a disorder within a larger population may change as new awareness regarding t hat disorder emerge s. The rise in autism spectrum disorde r (ASD) in the United States is an example of increas ed in cidence most li kely due to a general growing awareness of autism and changes to the condition's diagnostic criteria. Chart Review Chart revi ew studies collect data from patient medical records. A c hart review study could be retrospective, prospective , or both. Chart reviews are a common research method of gathering data on a specific medical condition or set of patient characteristic s. For ins tance, a typical chart review study would be one that col lects information from hospital medical records to compare breast cancer patients treated surgically with those that chose radiation therapy only. Another example would be collecting data to compare the outcomes of laparoscopic vs. open surgery techniques. Registry/Database: Registry or database studies create individual databases for the collection of data from certain types of subjects. These are also oft en referred to as databanks, or data registr ies. A registry is a collection of information about indi viduals, usually focused on a specific diagnosis or condition , although the research question may not yet be known . The data to be collected needs to be identified . This identifiable information is p rotected by law under strict privacy agreements, such as the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Many registries collect i nformation about people who have a specific dis ease or condition, while others seek participants of vary ing health s tatus who may be willing to participate in research about a particular disease. Individuals provide information about themselves to these re gistries on a voluntary basis. Registries can b e sponsored by a government agency, nonprofit organizatio n, health ca re facility, or private company. Examples of registries include the Cutaneous Lupus Registry, Morphea Registry, Re gistry, ConTex Registry, Orthopedic Hip Registr y, COVID Registry, Concussion Registry, Be the Match Regi stry, INTERMACS Registry , among others. Biospecimen Repository Biospecimen studies involve collection of biological specimens from h ealthy volunteers and/or diagnosed patients. These are also often referred to as biobanks, or specimen banks. The UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 26 of 270 specimen s may be used in ongoing laboratory studies or may be preserved for future use. Moreover, the repositor y locations may be external (i .e., housed off campus , such as with the study's sponsor) or local (i.e., store d on UT Southwestern's campus in a controlle d environment ). Human biospecimens include -but are not limited to -blood and other body fluids, tissues, and other biological materia ls obtained from human s. Per UT Southwestern's policy Biorepository Oversight Committee , biospecimens are defined as, \"human biological materials including but not limit ed to tissue, organ s, blood, plasma, se rum, CSF, DNA, proteins, and all other materials derived from human subjects. \" Subsets of human mate rials, such as derived cell lines that are tracea ble to a human subject or patients with linked identifiers or Person ally Identifiable Information (PII) as well as those materials that cannot be linked to identifiers, should also be handled as independent biospecimens per the NIH . A list of biospecimens recognized by the NIH are included in this document : https://oir.nih.gov/system/files/media/file/2021 -11/guidelines -biospecimen.pdf . Biorepository Finally, an other non-intervention study category recognized at UT Southwestern ar e biorepositories, which contain both da ta as well as biospecimens specimens. Per UT Southwestern's policy biorepository is defined as, \"a storage site for biospecimens where the biospecimens are collected fr om various sources and stored or archived to support current or future scientific investigation.\" Under the definit ion of human subject at 45 CFR 46.102(f), obtaining identifiable private information or identifiable specimens for research purposes constitutes human subjects research. Obtaining iden tifiable private information or identifiable specimens includes, but is not limited to: using, studying, or analyzing for r esearch purposes identifiable private information or identifiable specimens that have been provided to investigators from any source; and using, studying, or analyzing for research purpose s identifiable pr ivate information or identifiable specimens that we re already in the possession of the investigator. In general, OHRP considers private information or specimens to be individually ide ntifiable as defined at 45 CFR 46.102(f) when they can be linked to spec ific individuals by the investigator(s) either dire ctly or indirectly through coding systems. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 27 of 270 Although not required, UT Southwestern encourages teams to consider using an honest broke r to assist with maintaining the privacy of the identifiable private information within their dataset, biorepository, etc. An honest broker can essentially create a firewall between the investigator and the subjects ' identifiable information needed for the study . For example, an honest broker could generate or receive a datase t and then strip out all of the subject identifiers so that the data is no longer readily ident ifiable by anyone on the study team . They c an create a de - identified data set or a limite d data se t (LDS) , which would then be turned over to the study team to utilize for their research. There are different type s of honest brokers that can be involved in clinic al research, depending on what the study requires. For additional guidance on UT S outhwestern's policy on repositories, please review policy_2.9repository.pdf (utsouthwestern.edu) . If you have any other questions regarding the non-intervention study types and topics listed above, please reach out to the HRPP: Human Research Protection Program (HRPP): UT Southwestern, Dallas, Texas . Screening, Early Detection, or Diagnost ic Screeni ng research aims to find the best ways to detect or screen for certain disor ders or health conditions. Detection or diagnos tic refers to the practice of looking for better ways to identify or diagnose particular disorders or conditions. These stu dies may l ook for individuals with certain risk factors, disease types, or individuals who may be showing signs and symptoms of disea se. Other Types of Studies Extension (Rollover) Extension , or rollover studies , are clinical research studies in which the use of experimental therapeutics is extended for a longer period of time than what w as offered in the initial study . Extension stud ies are considered a new protocol, even if they are designed exactly the same as the initial study (e.g., same treatment paramete rs and schedule of activities). The difference in the extension studies is usual ly due to the different enrollment procedures. Only those subjects who participated in the initial study may be enrolled in the extension, a rollover of the subje cts actively enrolled. Extensions occur to continue providing treatment to patients who are benefitting from treatment during the initial protocol. Post-Trial Access (PTA) refers to the provision of a product to research participants following study comple tion. P TA may involve open -label trial extension studies, long -term extension studies, rollove r clinical studies, separate UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 28 of 270 protocols, or prot ocol amendments. Scientific or Sub -study (Ancillary) Scientific , or sub -studies , sometimes referred to as ancillar y studies, involve procedures done in addition to the main study to answer additional question s. A sub -study poses a separate research questi on than the parent protocol, contributes to the parent protocol's objectives, and uses all or a subset of the participant information or specimens collected during the main study . For example, an investig ation al drug study may also collect laboratory sampl es from the study 's enrolled subjects in order to analyze the effects of the investigational drug on a certain protein. The purpose of the main st udy is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the inv estigational drug, while the scientific or sub -study collects information about the protein. These scientific/sub -studies may be designed to be optional or required in order for the subject to participate in the main study . In addition, they may either be embe dded in the main study or they may be a complet ely separate stand -alone study, requiring a separate protocol and perhaps a separate consent form. The following study types are common in cancer -related research : Correlative Correlat ive research exa mines the statistical relationship between two or mor e variables without manipulating them. It is considered non-experimental since it only seeks to establish the degree of association or correlation between two or more variables to determine the type of correla tion: positive ( two variables increase or decre ase together ), negative (one variable increases while the other decreases ), or zero (there is no relationship between two variables ). This type of research design is often applied to laboratory , or radiology -based , studies that utilize subject specimens in order to identify assessment of risk, clinical outcomes, and/or therapy response. For example, researchers may use correlational research to analyze the potential relationship between unhealthy behaviors, suc h as smoking , and the incidence prevalence (the number of existing cases of a disease in a population at a given time ) of lung cancer. Adjuvant Treatment Studies Adjuvant studies offer additional therapy after standard treatment a nd are designed to preven t the recurrence of cancer in people who no longer show clinical evidence of disease. Typically, adjuvant studies attempt to treat the subclinical or microscopic disease thought to be UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 29 of 270 responsible for cancer re -occurrence and theref ore improve disease -free and overall survival. In other words , even if a patient's surgery to remove a cancerous tumor is considered successful at removing all visible cancer, microscopic bits of cancer sometimes remain and are often undetectable with curr ent imaging technology an d methods. Types of adju vant treatments typical ly offered in these studies include chemotherapy (using cancer killing drugs), hormone therapy (to stop hormone production in your body or block the effect of hormones ), radiation therapy ( high-powered energy beams, such as X -rays or protons, to ki ll cance r cells and given internally or externally ), immunotherapy ( which stimulat es your body 's own immune defenses or supplement s them ), and targeted therapy ( designed to alter specific abno rmalities present within cancer cells. For example, a targeted therapy i s available to block the action of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in women with breast cancer ). Adjuvant treatment studies can offer a variety of additional treatment options that may further decrease the chance of the can cer coming back , also known as cancer recurrence . Neoadjuvant Treatment Studies Neoadjuvant studies provide additional therap ies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hormo ne therapy ) before standard tr eatment , which is usually surgery . Such studies evaluate treatments designed to reduce tumor size to a point where it can be effectively treated by standard -of-care therapies. Within clinical research, true neoadjuvant studi es test the administration of a new drug or regimen preoperatively, with the study's primary endpoint focused on evaluating the cancer's clinical or pathologic response during post- therapy (i.e., at the time of surgery ). For example, years of clinical rese arch studies have strongly demon strated that neoadjuvant chemotherapy given to the patient prior to surgery can reduce an inoperable breast cancer to a size that can be removed surgically. Compassionate Use or Expanded Access Compassionate use descr ibes a way to make non -FDA approved dr ug products available to patients. The intent i s to provide treatment to the patients, not to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drug products . This process is often confused as researc h, but is in fact mecha nisms to make non -FDA approved drug av ailable for clinical care. Under compassionate use, a physician may request access to a drug that is still under development to treat a patient who has exhausted all approved options for a severe or life - threatening disease. The patient is informed that the drug is investigational and not FDA - approv ed and is given the opportunity to understand the limited knowledge about the risks and benefits of the drug at this stage of development. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 30 of 270 The sponsor decides whether to make the investigational drug availabl e to an individual for compassionate use, or to many patients through what is called an Expanded Access or Open Protocol . The data from compassionate use and expanded access studies are incl uded in the application for FDA review, but since the data are not derived from a well - designed, adequately cont rolled clinical trial, they are not considered to be pivotal. G. Phases of Clinical Development Preclinical or Non -Clinical The drug development process begin s with preclinical, or non -clinical , research in the laboratory. Non-clinical studies are those that do not involve human subjects , but instead involve animals . Preclinical or non - clinical studies are necessary to gather information including toxi cology, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics to support clinica l research in humans. Clinical trials can only be undertaken if the pre-clinical findings suggest that the new drug or treatment is likely to be safe and will wo rk in humans . Pre-clinical studie s, also called laboratory studies, include: Cell studies : These are often the first tests done on a new tre atment. For instance, to see if it might work, researchers look for effects of the new treatment on cancer cells th at are grown in a lab dish or a t est tube. Since this is pre -clinical, these studies may be do ne utilizing human cancer cells or animal cance r cells. Animal studies : Treatments that look promising in cell studies are tested next in live animals. This gives researchers an idea of how safe the new treatment is in a living creature. Although pre -clinical studies provide valuable data, they cannot offer all of the necessary information to determine whether the study should move forward. This is because humans, compared to other vertebrates (s uch as mice and rats ), can be very different in the way they absorb, metabolize (i.e., process), and get rid of drugs or treatments from their systems. For example, a treatment that works well at treating cancer cells withi n a mouse might or might not work in people. Moreover, there could also be side effects and ot her serious problems that won't appear in anima l studies but could show up when the same drug or treatment is introduced in human subjects. Nonetheless, if the pre -clinical studies are completed and the treatment still seems promising, the study team will need to reach out to the US Food and Drug Admin istration (FDA) to receive permission before testing the treatment in human subjects. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 31 of 270 Clinical Studies There are many ways to categorize clinical s tudies. Following is a description of the phases in investiga tional drug studies. Later in this chapter we w ill also review how Investigational device studies are categorized , which are done in a slightly different way than investigational drug or biologi c studies . H. Investigational Drug Studies The term drug refers to articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases or conditions in humans. The term investigational drug refers to a drug being investigated u nder an IND. This includes new drugs and FDA approved d rugs be ing evaluated for a new indication, in combinat ion with other drugs, new route of administration, or in a new subject population. The FDA categorizes investigational drug studies into developme nt stages, or phases, based on study characteristics su ch as t he objective and number of participants. In add ition to pre -clinical studies already described above , there are five phases: Phase 0, I, II, III, and IV. Phase 0: (Exploratory) Phase 0 stu dies are exploratory and involve very limited human exposure to the drug (e.g., for a brief time) , with no therape utic or diagnostic goals. Phase 0 studies use only a few small doses of a new drug in a few people (usually 15 people or less) . The purpose of this phase is to help speed up and streamline the drug approval pr ocess. Phase 0 studies may help researchers fin d out if the drugs do what they're expected to do. This may help save time and money that would have been spent on later phase trials. Unlik e other phases of clinical trials, there's alm ost no chance the huma n participants in phase 0 studies will benefit from their participation in this phase of the study . Any benefit s, if they do occur from the study drug or treatment , will most likely only happen to future participants in later phases of the study . Moreover, since the d rug doses given to the participants are so low, there's also less risk to those that pa rticipate in this phase in the trial. Phase I: (Human Pharmacology) Phase I is the first step in testing a new drug in humans after animal research. Researc hers evaluate the treatment's safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. These studies test the best way to give a new treatment, the route of administration, and th e best dosage. The dose UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 32 of 270 is typically increased a little at a time to find the highest (maximum) dose that does not cause harmful side effects. Placebos (inactive treatments) are not used in phase I trials. Phase I studies are usually brief , and the study r esearchers monitor the development of all adverse events closely, including their severity and frequency , since thi s information will provide the foundation for the future \"side effects\" that may be listed if this drug should get to market . Though Phase I studies a re primarily concerned with assessing a drug 's safety, the y are also done to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions (i.e., the uses, effects, and modes of action ) of drugs in humans, the side effects associated with incre asing doses, and to gai n early evidence of effectiveness. Therefore, the overall purpose of this phase of the study is to determ ine safety and dosage . Since little is known about the possible risks and benefits of the treatments being tested, Phas e I trials usually include only a small number of subjects (e.g., 20 to 100 healthy volun teers ). Phase I studies could also enroll a sma ll number of diagnosed patients with the disease/condition of interest who have not been hel ped by previous treatments. As a result , sometimes people choose to join phase I trials when they have failed all other treatment options. Phase I trials car ry the most potential risk , especially to diagnosed patients who have not been helped by other treatment s for their disease . However, there are some phase I studies who are able to offer some help to a s elect few patients. For those with life -threatening i llnesses, weighing the potential risks and benefits carefully is key to determining whether to participate . This is because w hile some people may benefit from being on one, disease respo nse is not the main purpose of a phase I trial . Per the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as of January 4, 2018, approximately 70% of Phase I drug studies move to the next phase in research. Phase II: (Therapeutic Exploration) Phase II studies are controlled cl inical studies to gather preliminary data on effectiveness, an d to determine if the drug works as predicted in people who have a certain disease or condition. For example, participants receiving the drug may be compared with similar participants receiving a different tre atment, which may be either an inactive substan ce, called a p lacebo, or a different drug. This phase could take anywhere from several months to a couple of years to evaluate the drug 's UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 33 of 270 therapeutic effect, dose range, and metabolism. During this phase, the goal is to minimize toxicity, maximize therape utic effect, and assess populations of patients who may benefit or be adversely affected when taking the medication. This phase also identifies common short -term side effects and risks. In Pha se II studies, t he investigational product or treatment is give n to a larger group of people (i.e., up to several hundred people with the disease/condition ) to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety. Although these studies invo lve a few hundred patients , they are not considered large enough to statistically d emonstrate whether the drug will be beneficial to treat the disease or condition . Instead, Phase 2 studies provide researchers with additional safety data. Researchers use these data to refine resear ch questions, develop research methods, and des ign new Ph ase 3 research protocols. Therefore, the purpose of this phase of the study is to determine efficacy and side effects . According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as of January 4, 2018, approximately 33% of Phase II drug studies move to the ne xt phase of research. Phase III: (Therapeutic Confirmatory) Phase III studies gather more information about the drug or treatment's safety and effectiveness by studying its ef fects on different popu lations a s well as by studying different dosage s on those populations . These studies are often referred to as Pivotal , as they provide primary evidence for the FDA submission. These studies also focus on the validity of the study e ndpoints and long -term sa fety. Phase III studies typically last longer t han two years to gather long term saf ety data. The study drug is given to large groups of people (i.e., 300 to 3,000 volunteers ) in the target (i.e., individuals with who have the di sease or condition ) patien t population . Researchers confirm effectiveness , monitor side effects, and compare to commonly used treatments. In previous studies and/or phases , it is possible that less common side effects migh t have gone undetected. However, b ecause these studies involve a larger population and are typically longer in duration, the results are more likely to show long -term or rare side effects . Therefore, the purpose of this phase is to document efficacy as wel l as monitor adverse reactions . As of January 4, 2018, a pproximately 25 -30% of drugs in this Phase III move to the next phase of research per the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . Phase IV: (Therapeutic Use) UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 34 of 270 Phase IV PMS Studies Phase IV studies gather additional information about the drug's effects in different segments of the population by enrolling a more diverse group of subjects. The population required for this phase is also qu ite large and can enroll se veral thousand volunt eers who have the disease/condition . Phase IV studies also gather additional information used to dete rmine cost effectiveness, drug compliance, or t he drug's impact on quality of life. The purpose of this pha se of the study is to establish the safety and e fficacy of the proposed new treatment for a disease or condition. Phase IV studies are conducted aft er FDA approval has been obtained to provide ad ditional information about treatment risks, benefits, and be st use. These include post -marketing surveillanc e (PMS) studies. Not all Phase IV studies are PMS studies, but every PMS study is a Phase IV study. PMS studies may be mandated by the FDA to further investigate certain aspects of an intervention or procedure. If a PMS study reveals a safety issue, the FDA must determine the appropriate action, which could include adding information to product lab eling, restricting use or distribution, or remo val from the market. Dieta ry Supplements Dietary supplements are not drugs, but rather compounds that do not make health claims regarding the treatment of a specific disease or condition and are therefore reg ulated as foods by the FDA. The FDA regulates b oth fini shed dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients under a different set of regulations than those covering conventional foods, prescriptions, and over-the-counter drug products. Many people som etimes find it difficult to distinguish between a drug and a dietary supplement. If a product is approved by the FDA based on evidence that it was safe and effective for treating a disease, it is regulated as a drug . However, if a product does not make cla ims to treat, cure or mitigate a disease and /or only makes claims to improve overall health or offers a broader, more vague statement about its effects , it is regulated as a dietary supplement. I. Investigational Device Studies UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 35 of 270 As previously referenced, the term \"device \" is very broad and refers to an in strument, apparatus, implement, machine, implant, in vitro reagent, or other object that is intended for use in the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of devices vary widely, from bandage s to blood pr essure cuffs, to pacemakers. Investigational Devices are categorized as Significant Risk or Non-Significant Risk. Significant Risk, Non -significant Risk, Exempt A significant risk device refers an investigational device that is used to suppo rt or sustain life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Significant risk device studies must have an IDE application approved by FDA before they may proceed and must follow the FDA regulations described in 21 CFR 81 2. A non-significant risk (NSR) device study is one that does not meet the definition of a significant risk device study. A convened IRB (i.e. a scheduled full board meeting ) can make the determination that a device is NSR. Non-significant r isk device studies do not need an IDE applicati on with the FDA, but still must follow the abbreviated FDA requirements of 21 CFR 812. These abbreviated requirements address drug labeling, IRB approval, informed consent, monitoring, records, and reports. Howeve r, there is no need to make progress report s or final reports to the FDA under t hese abbreviated requirements . An exempt device is a diagnostic device, in which the tests are noninvasive and don't require an invasive sampling procedure that could pres ent significant risk. It does not introduce ene rgy into a subject and is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation by another medically established diagnostic product or procedure. Device studies , which are exempt from the requirements of th e IDE regulations , are not exempt from the regu lations requiring IRB review and approval and the protection of human subjects. Device Classes Class I General Controls Class I devices are subject to the least regulatory control. Class I devices are subjec t to \"General UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 36 of 270 Controls \" as are Class II and Cla ss III devices. General controls include procedures to control misbranding, device repair, replacement or refund, and go od manufacturing practices. Class I devices are not intended to help support or sustain life or be substantially important in preventin g impairment to human health. Most Class I devices are exempt from the premarket process and a few are also exempt from most good manufacturing practices regulation. Examples of Class I devices include elastic bandages, examination gloves, hand -held surgic al instruments, and wheelchairs. Class II: General controls with special controls Class II devices are those for which general controls alone cannot assure safety and effectiveness thus additional controls mu st be applied. In addition to complying with g eneral controls, Class II devices are also subject to special controls. Special cont rols may include special labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards and postmarket surveillance. Devices in Class II are held to a higher standard than Class I devices, and are designed to perform as indicated without causing injury or harm to subject or user. Examples of Class II devices include acupuncture needles, powered wheelchairs, infusion pumps, surgical drap es, and implantable radiofrequency transponder systems for patient identification and health information. Class III: General con trols and premarket approval A Class III device is one for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effective ness solely through the use of general or sp ecial controls sufficient for Class I or Class II devices. Such a device needs PMA, a scientific review to ensure the device 's safety and effectiveness. Class III devices are usually those that support or sustai n human life and are of substantial importa nce in preventing impairment of human health. Examples of Class III devices include implantable pacemakers, pulse generators, and automated external defibrillators. Device Categories Many investigational device s tudies being conducted under an IDE gather the scientific information needed for the FDA to establish the safety and effectiveness of that particular device. In the past , Medicare coverage was denied for devices that were under an IDE and had not yet recei ved FDA approval , because the treatme nts were c onsidered experimental. However, there are devices which are refinements of existing technologies or replications of existing UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 37 of 270 technologies made by other manufacturers. The F DA now places devices into two categ ories to help determine Medicare cov erage: Experimental (Category A) Experimental devices are innovative devices in which \"absolute risk \" has not been established. For example, initial questions of safety and effectiveness have not been resolved and thus FDA has not determined whether the device type could be considered safe and effective. Investigational (Category B) Studies using investi gational devices are expanding the research, based on previous data. This category includes device types that could be considered safe and effective per haps because other manufacturers have already obtained FDA approval for the device type. Non - significan t risk studies may also be included in this category. If the appropriate approvals have been obtained, Medicare may co ver the research -related costs ass ociated with Category B devices. 510(k) Clearance A new medical device that can be demonstrated to be substantially equivalent to a previously legally marketed device can be cleared by the FDA for marketing as long as certain requirements are met. The va st majority of new medical devices enter the marketplace via this process. The 510(k) pathway rarely req uires clinical trials. J. Study Design The study design describes the strategy by which interventions or therapies are as signed to participants in a clinical study. There are several types of intervention models, including Single group design, Parallel design, Crossover design, and Factorial design. This chapter will not go into significant detail into each design , but rath er give a broad overview so all members of the study team have a general understanding of the study design. Th ese descripti ons should allow the research staff to interact with study participants more successfully by helping them to be able to describe the study design in layman's terms . There are sever al types of intervention models, including Single group design, Parallel design, Crossover design, and Factorial design. Single Group Single Group design describ es a clinical research study in which all subje cts receive the same UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 38 of 270 intervention throughout th eir participation in the study. Parallel Parallel design describes a study in which two or more subject groups receive different interventions at the same tim e, in parallel. For example, a two -arm parallel design study involves two groups of participan ts. One group receives drug A, and the other group receives drug B throughout their participation. Hence, participants in one group receive drug A \"in parallel \" to participants in the other group receiving dru g B. Crossover In a crossover study desig n, subjects are given one treatment and th en \"crossover \" to another treatment. For example, a two -by-two crossover design involves two groups of participants . One group receives drug A first, then switches to drug B. The other group starts drug B, then swi tches to drug A. All participants receiv e drug A and drug B at some point during the study, but in a different order, depending on their assigned group. Factorial Factorial design describes a clinical study in which groups of participants receive one of several combinations of interventions. For example, a two -by-two factorial design involves four groups of participants. Each group receives a combination of 2 interventions. The first group receives drug A and drug B, the second group receives drug A and placebo, the third group receives placeb o and drug B, and the fourth group receives placebo and placebo. During the study, all possible combinations of the t wo drugs, A and B, and placebo are given to differen t groups of participants. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 39 of 270 In addition to intervention models , the study 's design can also be described by other ways, such as who will receive treatment (controlled versus uncontrolled), how often the investigational treatment is required for the enrol led subjects (single or multiple dose), how man y centers will be involved (single versus multi -center), and whether the staff will be aware of who receives treatment on the study (i.e., blinding). The fol lowing section explores these additional standards. Controlled vs. Uncontrolled A controlled stud y assesses a group of subjects receiving the investigational treatment against a control group of subjects that does not receive the treatment. This comparis on group gives investigators important clues about t he effectiveness of the treatment and its side effects. Conversely, an uncontrolled study is when all participants are given a treatment and simply followed for a period of time to see if they improve, with no comparison against another group (control gr oup) that is either taking another treatment or no treatment at all. The most common type of study in this design is a placebo -controlled study comparing one or more active treatment groups to a placebo group that does not receive the active treatment. Single or Multiple Dose Some studies look at on e or more (i.e., multiple) treatments, or doses, in comparison to each other. The main difference between a multiple dose study and a single dose study is the number of doses given to individual study subjects . However, single dose studies are almost alway s performed first to obtain a rough understanding of the drug's single dose pharmacokinetics (the study of drug absorption, distribution, m etabol ism, and excretion ) before the study researchers move to a multi ple dose . The various treatments and/or doses u sed should be outlined in a detailed protocol for the study researchers to follow . Single Site or Multi -Center Some clinic al research studies are conducted at a single site (such as UT Southwestern) , while multi-center studies are conducted at more than o ne study site (e.g., at various hospitals across the United States as well as in Europe) . There are pros and cons to choo sing one type over the other. For instance, a multi -center study allows for a larger pool of research subjects , more geneti c variety fr om the subjects (if that is an area of interest in the study) , and the ability to compare results across centers, all of which contributes to the overall generalizability of the study . On the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 40 of 270 other hand, a mul ti-center study has higher costs a ssociated wit h staffing /managing the study in addition to methodological, implementation and statistical challenges . The protocol will i ndicate whether the study is a single or multi - center study. Blinded or Unblinded Open Label or Unblinded Blinding , also known as \" masking ,\" refers to the research activity of purposely withholding information regarding the assigned treatment from one or more participants in a clinical research study. It is an essential methodological fea ture of clinical studies that helps to maximize the validity (what an instrument measures and how accurately it does so) of the research results . In Open Label , or Unblinded studies, the subject and the investigator know which treatment the subject is rec eiving. Sometimes the treatment cannot be blind ed, particularl y in surgical technique studies in which the investigator knows which surgical technique was used and it may not be possible or ethical to hide the specific treatment from the patient. Or, the s tudy may be designed so that some patients rece ive an addition al infusion, while others receive the standard of care. Or one s tudy drug creates a distinct color when i t's reconstituted (i.e., adding a liquid diluent, such as sterile water or bacteriostatic water, to a dry powdered drug to make a liquid with a specific concentration ) by the investigational pharmacist, while the standard treatment appears clear when it is delivered bedside . In all of these situations, it would be impossible to not know which treatment arm the patient has been randomized t o becaus e the differences are so apparent . Blinded: Single -blind (single masked) In a single -blind trial, either the in vestigator or the subject are aware of the details of the study treatment. In practice, i f one of them knows the treatment that is being received , it is possible for that person to subconsciously relay important treatment -related details to the other person , thus introducing bias (i.e., any tendency that limits impartial consideration of a que stion or issue ; a type of systematic error that can distort measurements and/or affect investigations and their results ) and influencing the study outcome. Blinded: Double -blind (double ma sked) In a double -blind tria l, interventions are randomly assigned to subjects, and neither the subject nor the in vestigator knows the treatment assignment. Consequently, the study staff cannot convey information about the study treatment, intentionally or unintentionally , to the sub jects. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 41 of 270 Randomized, double -blind placeb o-controlled trials involve the random placemen t of participants into two (or more, if there are multiple investigational dose) groups; an experimental group that receives the investigational treatment and a control group that receives a placebo (a harmles s substance made to resemble the investigationa l treatm ent). Neither the researchers nor the research subjects know who is receiving the experimental treatment and who is getting a placebo. This type of clinical study is widely considered the gold standard for the validation of treatment interventions. Therefo re double -blind, or \"randomized ,\" studies are preferred as a design , as they limit the potential for bias. It's important to note: the blind , whichever one is utilized in the study, should be maintain ed at all times by the study staff . In cases of emerge ncy (e.g., a subject is experiencing a severe allergic reaction during treatment and the investigator needs to know which one it is), t here are procedures to be followed so that the blind can be broken for subject safety reasons. Blinded: Double Dummy Double dummy is a technique for retaining the blind when two treatments cannot be made identical. For example, Drug A can only be administered in liquid form and Drug B can only be administered in tablet f orm. Every subject will take two sets of trea tment. Using this example, the subjects could receive: Active liquid and active table, Active liquid and placebo tablet, Placebo liquid and active tablet, or Placebo liquid and placebo tablet. Randomization Randomization is a method used to prevent bias in research. The randomized study is generally considered the most reliable form of scientific evidence because it is the most widely accepted design for eliminating the variety of biases that could compromise th e validity of the research. This is because w hen it is applied co rrectly to a study design, randomization elimin ates bias b y distributing the characteristics of patients that may influence outcome randomly between treatment groups so that any difference in outcome can be explained only by treatment. In a randomized study this is achieved by any number of methods, s uch as a computer or table of random numbers , which then determines the treatment assignments . Thus, participants have an equal probability to be assigned to one of the various groups. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 42 of 270 At several points during (e.g., through interim analysis , where all accumulated data is analyzed and findings are used to make any necessary adjustments to the ongoing study ) and at the end of the clinical trial, re searchers will compare the data from the random ized groups to determine which treatment is more effective or has fewer side effects. Consequently , the fundamental benefits of randomization include the following : 1. Eliminates selection bias introduced by the researchers . Selection bias occurs when th e selection of subjects into a study (or their likelihood o f remaining in the study) leads to a result that is methodically different to the target population. 2. Balances all treatment arms with respect to potential variable s (both known as well as unknow n by the person and/or staff that developed the protocol ) 3. Forms the basis for stronger statistical tests based on an assumption of the equality of treatment assignments In sum, a randomized trial is an ess ential tool for testing the efficacy of the tre atment in clinical research and ensures the scientific vali dity of the results . UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 43 of 270 Source: clinical -trial-randomization -infographic.jpg (992\u00d71299) (cancer.gov) . There are several potential types of randomizations in research and the study protocol will identify the type of ran domization utilized in the study design , if applicable. It is important to have a basic understanding of the randomization process to be able to explain the different ways and likelihood that subjects could receive various treatment options. In this handbo ok, we will briefly discuss the three most po pular types of randomizations in clinical rese arch: Simple, Block, and Stratified. Simple randomization In simple randomization the subjects are randomly allocated to experiment/intervention UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 44 of 270 groups based on a c onstant probability. In other words , if we di vide all enrolled subjects into two groups called A and B, each subject has a 0.5 (50%) probability of being assigned to either group A or group B. The activity of allocating subjects to either group can be perf ormed in multiple ways, such as flipping a coin, assignments drawn from random tables or nu mbers , just to name a few . The benefit of using this methodology is that it eliminates selection bias since probability drives the assignment allocation . However, a disadvantage of utilizing this methodology is a potential imbalance in the number allocat ed to each group (if the study ha s a planned small sample) as well as the prognostic factors between groups. Block randomization Block randomization is the arrange ment of treatment options within groups, or b locks. The treatments are randomized within ea ch block to avoid potential imbalance. The aim of block randomization is to balance the number of subjects allocated to each experiment/intervention group. The di sadvantage with block randomization is that t here is still an aspect of expectedness in how subjects are sele cted and the randomization of prognostic factors (e.g., predictions of how a disease is likely to affect a patient on the study ) is not taken into consideration . Nonetheless , block randomizati on guarantees that at no time the imbalance will be too great and at certain points the numbers of participants in each group should be mostly equal. Stratified In stratified randomization, the study subjects are defined based on specific pre-determined strata, which are commonly referred to as cova riates . An example of a covariate is a variable that is observed (rather than manipulated ) and may impact a study's outcome . Stratifi ed randomization allow s the rese archers to further refine the groups in which subjects will be placed base d on these covariates . The sample size necessary to reach a clinically significant result will help determine the number of strata required for the study design . In the example belo w, enrolled subjects are divided up into two groups based on gender assignment at birth , such as female and male sexes, and then randomized to their treatment.

Any missteps in identifying the appropriate covariates will have a significant impact on the final validity of the results. The benefit of stratified ran domization is that it enables comparison between experiment/intervention groups , thus making the process of analyzing conclusions more efficient. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 46 of 270 Chapter 2: UTSW Clinical Research Infrastructure , Policies, Agencies and Affiliated Hospitals This chapter provides a brief overview of the entities involved in the oversight of clinical research at the UT Southwestern . Clinical research at UTSW is supported by many diverse entities that vary greatly in size , scope , and level of involvement . Some entities' poli cies and procedures affect all researchers, while other entities' policies and procedures only apply to those engaged in specific typ es of research. Not all researchers encounter all of the offices or committees described in this chapter, but all those inv olved in clinical research should be aware of the services that each offers to support resear ch activities at UT Southwestern . A. Human Resea rch Protection Program The Human Research Protection Prog ram (HRPP) provides oversight of all research activities involving human subjects at the UTSW . The HRPP is a collective effort of all who participate in the conduct, review, approval and facilitation of Human S ubjects Research at UTSW . The HRPP 's goal is to maintain the university's policies governing human subjects research, which apply federal, state and other regulatory requirements to al l university faculty, staff, students, volunteers and research subjects. The HRPP responsib ilities are carried out by the following offices: IRB (IRB) Office - Responsibilities include: UTSW IRB review - Research reviewed by one of four UT Southwestern IRBs or by a UTSW IRB Expedited Reviewer Non-UTSW IRB Review (sIRB/Reli ance) - Collaborative research reviewed by a single IRB (either UTSW IRB or a non -UT Southwestern IRB) Quality Assurance and Monitoring (QAM) Responsibilities include: Routine and for cause monitoring Support to investigators before, during, and after reg ulatory audits Regulatory Support Office (RS O) - Responsibilities include support for investigators with: Clinicaltrials.gov registration and reporting requirements FDA sponsor invest igator submission and reporting requirements for an IND or IDE The HRPP policies address the review, approval and co nduct of human subjects research at UTSW . Some prominent issue s addressed by these policies include the definition of human UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 47 of 270 subjects resear ch, the principal investigator (PI) status for human subjects protocols, the use of existing datasets, and applying s tate law. UT Southwestern HRPP Policies are available on the HRPP homepage in a n index and are searchable by -text and keyword : https://ww w.utsouthwestern.edu/research/hrpp/policies/ . B. UT Southwestern Institutional Review Boards Researchers send their human research subjects protocols to the IRB or HRPP and dependin g on the level of review required or whether review is conducted through an external IRB, the protocol may be reviewed un der expedited review (i.e., with a Senior Regulatory Analyst) or assigned to the next available institutional review board (IRB) meetin g. Studies reviewed using an external IRB will undergo administrative review . IRB-specific policies and procedures can be found here. The Institutional Rev iew Board is charged with the responsibility of reviewing, prior to its initiation, research involving human participants. The IRB is primarily con cerned with ensuring that the rights, welfare, and privacy of human participants are pro tected. The UTSW IRB has received full accreditation from the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protectio n Programs (AAHRPP), which indicates that UTS W follows rigorous standards for ethics, quality, and protections for human research. The IRB has the auth ority to approve, require modifications in order to approve, disapprove, suspend, terminate, and obser ve the consent process for research that fall s within its jurisdiction as specified by both the federal regulations and institutional policy. Each IRB mus t have at least five members of varying backgrounds in order to provide complete and adequate review o f human research and its safety, institutiona l, legal, scientific, and social implications. Each Board will also include at least one member who is not af filiated with the institution and one member who is not a scientist. The UT Southwestern IRBs have sev eral consultants who advise the Board and are periodically involved in protocol review as necessary. Additional facts about UT Sout hwestern's IRB: Four regularly occurring IRBs that meet twice per month (~8 IRB meetings a month) Each IRB reviews all typ es of research (biomedical and social/behavio ral) Each IRB has ~18 members where each member serves a 3 -year term UTSW has approxi mately 5000 active pr otocols at any given time UTSW is the IRB of record for partner institutions The UT Southwestern Me dical Center IRBs may provide review and cont inuing oversight of some, UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 48 of 270 or all research conducted at affiliated institutions. Institutions relying on the U TSW IRBs remain responsible for ensuring compliance with the IRB's determination s and the terms of its OHRP approved FWA, as applicable. Finally , UT Southwestern IRBs may also agree to defer to another institution's IRB, or a central IRB. For instance, UTSW routinely defers to the Advarra IRB and WCG IRB and the National Cancer Institute's Central IRB ( CIRB). These efforts are managed through the Single Institutional Review Board (sIRB). The purpose of using sIRB is to encourage collaboration, reduce dup licate study submissions, and minimize the impact of multiple IRB reviews for th e same protocol. For m ore information about the role and responsibi lities of the sIRB at UT Southwestern, please go to https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/research/hrpp/sirb/ . For -specific policies and procedur es, please visit: https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/research/hrpp/irb/ . Within the IRBO, the Regulatory Support Office (RSO) provides additional services to support each of the following specific areas within clinical trial management : Clinical Trials.gov Reporting Support Program : ClinicalTrials.gov (CT.gov) is a federally mandated clinical trial registry and results database run by NIH that discloses key information of clinical trial s to the general public. Failure to comply may resul t in public notices of noncompliance and violati ons, FDA sanctions, civil monetary penalties ($ 3,237 per day) , withholding of grant funds, refusal to CMS claims and journal publication. RSO staff can a ssist the Responsible Party (i.e., Principal Investigat or) with ClinicalTrials.gov Reporting, which includes (1) Registration, (2) Updates, and (3) Results. More information is available here: Clinica lTrials.gov Support: Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) - UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX . FDA Submission Support Program : UT Sou thwestern requires oversight of sponsor investigators. To provide necessary support and oversight, the H RPP requires that all IND/IDE submissions t o the FDA also be reported to the HRPP Regulatory Support Office 's SI Support Team. T he RSO can a ssist the Sponsor Investigator with FDA submissions for IND, IDE, and Expanded Access. This includes (1) Preparation , (2) Submission, and (3) Maintenance.

Scientific /Ethical Committee Simmons Compreh ensive Cancer Center (SCCC) Protocol Re view and Monitoring Committee (PRMC) As a National Cancer Institute - Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) within the Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) provides independent peer review for scient ific merit, prioritization, and monitoring for all cancer -related clinical and population science studies conducted at the UT Southwestern and its affiliated health care systems, Parkland Health and Hospital System an d Children's Medical Center. PRMS appro val is requi red before any cancer -related study can open at UT Southwestern Medical Center. The PRM S has a two -stage approval process. The first stage of the protocol review is performed at the level of the disease -oriented teams (DOTs) to determine trial feasibility and portfolio diversity. Studies that pass the initial review at the DOT level qualify for submission to the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC) for second stage review. Cancer -related outcom es or other study endpoints may reflect clinical tr eatment or quality of life, change in attitudes/beliefs or behaviors, or healthcare delivery for either solid tumors or hematology/hematologic malignancies. Such studies can occur at any point along the ca ncer care continuum, including screenin g and early detection, diagnosis and treatment including palliation and symptom management, through survivorship, as well as end of life and hospice. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 51 of 270 These studies then may include enrollment or measurements of any o f the following: 1) cancer patients, th eir caregivers or relatives 2) or cancer clinical care team members, 3) or individuals targeted for cancer prevention activities including lifestyle change, 4) or the assessment of cancer epidemiologic, imaging, or bi ological markers. If the study involve s any of these factors the study must be reviewed by the PRMC. The Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee consists of : PRMC #1, PRMC reviews protocols which nical interventional focused while Pop ulation Science PRMC reviews studies geared towards the science that are population -based research areas.

Committees Commit tee (IBC) The Institutional Biosafety C ommittee ( IBC) is managed through the UT Southwestern Office of Safety and Business Continuity ( Safety ). IBCs have been established under the National Institute of Health (NIH) Guidelines. The IBC reviews research act ivities involving recombinant or synthe tic nuclei c acid molecules, infectious agents, human materials , and other potentially hazardous biologica l agents. Safety, primarily the Biological Safety Program, is the monitoring and effector arm of the Institution al Biosafety Committee (IBC) and UT Sou thwestern Administration. Safety provides administrative services for all IBC business operations. UT Southwestern's IBC does the following on behalf of the institution: Ensure all research conforms with the NIH Gu idelines, when applicable. Ensure all impacted h ealthcare providers are provided education on the hazardous biological materials (e.g., investi gational drug s), their associated exposure risks and the proper methods to mitigate these risks. Ensure all nec essary safety control measures, practices, and pr ecautions are in place to support the safe handling of hazardous biological materials . Ensure healthcare providers have available all required personal protective equipment. Ensure investigators follow al l institutional compliance processes (e.g., acqui sition of IBC approvals ). UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 52 of 270 Contact Safety when research involves: The deliberate transfer of genetic material into human research participants. Investigational drugs composed of live, attenuated, or genet ically modified microorganisms. Collection of pa tient specimens and/or samples for onsite processing or storage (see flow chart for details: https://www.utsouthwestern .net/intranet/administration/safety/safety - programs/biological/tip_sheet_human_subject _study.pdf ). NOTE: Some research studies may be exempt from Human Subject Research by IRB specifications. Exempt from I RB registration does not indicate that these projects are exempt from IBC registration. Information regarding IBC policies, guidance and training information are located on the IBC website : https://www .utsouthwestern.net/intranet/administration/safety/safety - programs/bi ological/human -subject -studies.html Subcommittee for Human Use of Radiation in Research (SHUR) The Subcommit tee for Human Use of Radiation in Research (SHUR) is managed by the Office of Safety and Business Continuity (OSBC) and is also a part of the Radi ation Safety Advisory Committee (RSAC) at UT S outhwestern . SHUR has been appointed to review all research prot ocols that require participants to be exposed to ionizing r adiation for research purposes. SHUR is an ancillary comm ittee that works with the Inst itutional Review Board (IRB). Studies submitted through the electronic Institutional Review Board (eIRB) that have been ear marked that radiation is involved are directed to SHUR for review and approval . SHUR ensu res that patients participating in clinical studies will be informed of the research radiation procedures as well as provided accurate information about the risks associated with the research radiation procedures . In addition to UT Southwestern Medical Center, SHUR also provides independent peer review for all clinical studies that use ionizing radiation at its affiliated healthcare system s: Parkland H ealth Children's Health Scottish Rite for Children Texas Health Resources Ionizing radiation is a beneficial tool for both diagnostic and the rapeutic clinical applications. However, there is a risk to the patients associated with radiation exposure. For clinical uses of radiation, it is generally believed the benefit of the exposure to ionizing radi ation outweighs the risks. All research stu dies with radiation procedures are reviewed. Research studies with only medically UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 53 of 270 indicated radiation procedu res are reviewed by the IRB. Each IRB has a SHUR faculty member that will review the ra diation safety aspects of the research study when the stud y goes for IRB review. Research studies that include radiation procedures for research use are reviewed by SH UR and IRB. SHUR radiation safety approval is required for all modalities of ionizing r adiation for research. This includes ( CT, x -ray, fluoroscopy), interventional radiology, radiopharmaceuticals (both diagnostic and therapeutic uses) , and radiation therapy. It is important to note that some clinical procedures outside of Radiology m ay use ionizing radiation (e.g., surgical procedures, cardiac catheterization procedures). It is also important to note that magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) does NOT use ionizing radiation; thus, research studies with only MRI procedures do not need to b e reviewed by SHUR. The members who compris e SHUR include faculty from various clinical depar tments that us e ionizing radiation - this includes the Depar tment of Radiology (including the Medical Physics Division, Nuclear Medicine Division, and Breast Imaging Division), Department of Radiation Oncol ogy, and Department of Pediatrics - and OSBC Radia tion Safety le adership. SHUR faculty members perform the rad iation safety reviews for research studies that result in a radiation dose greater than 5,000 mrem from research procedures. Radiation Safety lead ership performs the radiation safety reviews for r esearch studie s that result in a radiation dose less than 5, 000 mrem from research procedures. The OSBC Radiation Safety Program serves as the committee liaison and corresponds with the principal investigat ors and research coordinators. SHUR will issue radiation safety approvals through the eIRB. For research stud ies where changes are needed, SHUR will issue letters with stipulations through the eIRB. The SHUR radiation safety review encompasses a review of the following for each research study: the eIRB smart form, the study protocol (and investigator's brochur es, if applicable), and the study consent form(s). For the eIRB smart form, it is importa nt that the radiation procedures (both those that are medically indicate d and those that are for research use) are pro perly documented. When entering the radiation procedures in the eIRB smart form, you should consider the following: Are all procedure types for each radiation modality listed correctly? Does each procedure have the correct effective dose listed? o Study tea m can reference the SHUR exam tables. The exa m tables include dosime try information for the most commonly used radiation procedures o Study team can reach out to SHUR for assistance. If the re search study is using a new radiopharmaceutical, then Medical Ph ysics will need to be consulted to evaluate th e UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 54 of 270 dosimetry information . Medical Physics can also assist with providing estimates of the effective dose for radiation procedures that are not lis ted on the exam tables Does each procedure list the correct numb er of exams? Does each procedure correctly ind icate which exams are u sed for research or medically indicated? o This determination affects the risk statement used in the study consent form. The patient will be reading the consent form to understand risks as sociated with the research study - it is impor tant that we provide the appropriate radiation risk statement. Thus, it is important that the number of procedures for research use are correctly indicated o This determination also affects who will be performing the radiation safety review - SHUR faculty or Radiation Safety leade rship Is the research study using a radioactive new drug or biological product that is not approved by the FDA? o The study t eam should include an Authorized User (AU) listed on the institu tion's radioactive materials license. This ca n be confirmed by the R adiation Safety program. The A us are typically faculty within the Nuclear Medicine Division of the Department of Radiology o The smart form should list the IND number for the radiopharmace utical and include a copy of the IND letter fr om either the FDA or st udy sponsor to show the IND is approved o The smart form should include the Investigator's Brochure - this has important information for evaluating radiation doses For the study protocol, it is important that all radiation procedures included in the researc h study are identified and documented in the eIRB smart form. Relevant information is typically included in the Schedule o f Events or Schedule of Activities. When reviewing the study pr otocol, you should consider the following: Are all radiation procedur es included in the study protocol documented in the eIRB smart form? o It is important to review the footnotes for the Sche dule of Events or Schedule of Activities. Sometimes alternate ex ams will be listed in the footnotes without be ing a line item in the schedule/table o It is important to review the inclusion/exclusion criteria. There may be radiation procedures required at s creening to satisfy the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria. There may be radiation procedures listed as alte rnatives to study proce dures (e.g., CT study for patients that have contraindications for MR imaging) UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 55 of 270 o It is important to read the written portion of the study protocol about the radiation procedures. There may be more detail in this section that describes the type and frequency of the radiation procedures. Any alternative radiation procedures may be listed in this section, too (e.g., multi -gated a cquisition (MUGA) scan as an alternative for echocardiogram ( ECH O) procedure) Common radiation procedures that are missed in the eIRB smart form: o CT studies for patients that have contraindications for MR imaging o Procedure needs to take into account all ar eas to be imaged (CT Chest, CT Abdomen/Pelvis) o Monitoring for ad verse events may call for imaging procedures ( CT study) o Some procedures that use ionizing radiation do not include \"radiation\" in the procedure name (i.e., MUGA, bone scan, port/catheter/needl stud y consent form(s), it is important that all radiation procedures included in the research study are identified and documented along with any appro priate risk statements. This is the document that the patient w ill be reading to better understand the proced ures that are included in the research study and the associated risks. When drafting the study consent form(s), you should consider the following : Are the radiation procedures used for research clearly identif ied? Are the radiation procedures medically in dicated cl early identified? For research studies using the UT Southwestern IRB: o Please use the SHUR -approved risk statements. This includes the r adiation risk statement and pregnancy risk statement (if applica ble for radiopharmaceuticals). o Please do not u se any other risk language for the radiation procedures for research uses. For research studies using a CIRB or other outside IRB, please ensure t he radiation risk statement accurate for the radiation procedure s for research uses. Medically indicated radia tion pr ocedures do not require a radiation risk statement. Please refer to the SHUR website for additional information and guidance, including gu idelines for what constitutes radiation for research, radiation procedure exam tables (for dosimetry informati on), and various SHUR -approved RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 56 of 270 Radioactive Drug Research Commit tee (RDRC) The Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC) , similar to the IBC, is managed through the UT South western Office of Safety and Business Continuity (OSBC). RDRC is chartered by the FDA under the provisions of 21 CFR 361.1 , Radioactive drugs for certain research uses . The RDRC reviews and approves certain basic research using radioac tive drugs in humans without an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The following information in this section is taken directly from the FDA Guidance for Indus try and Researchers - The Radioa ctive Drug Research Committee: Human Research Without An Investigational New Drug Application published in August 2010 ( https://www.fda.gov/media/76286/download ). The FDA has two pathways that allow for the investigational use of radioactive new drugs and biological products: the most common pathway is the investigational new drug (IND) application (21 CFR 312), and the second pathway is the RDRC approval (21 CFR 3 61.1). The RDRC is intended to review and approve the investigational use of radioactive dr ugs for certain resea rch purposes, specifically basic science research. For research purposes outside of the scope of the RDRC, these research studies involving th e investigational use of radioactive new drugs must be conducted under 21 CFR 312, Investiga tional New Drug Appli cation . The RDRC does not review research that is intended for immediate therapeutic, diagnostic, or similar purposes, or to determine the saf ety and effectiveness of the radioactive drug or biological product for such purposes (i.e., the research cannot constitute a clinical trial for the product). Examples of the types of basic science research that would be appropriate to conduct under an RDRC without an IND include the following: Metabolism and excretion studies (including kinetic s, distribution, dosi metry, and localization) of a radioactive drug Noninvasive functional imaging/molecular imaging studies for human physiology, pathophysiology, or biochemistry o Biodistribution o Pathophysiology o Receptor binding or occupancy o Transport proc esses o Enzyme activity o Multistep biochemical processes The FDA regulations (21 CFR 361.1) list three additional requirements for human subject research that may be conducted under an RDRC: UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 57 of 270 1. The research must be approved by an RDRC that is approved by FDA (2 1 CFR 361.1(b)(1) and 21 CFR 361.1(c)(4)) - UT Southwestern RDRC is approved by the FDA. 2. The dose to be administered must be known not to cause any clinically detectab le pharmacological effect in humans (21 CFR 361.1(b)(2)). This requirement means that RD RC protocols cannot i nclude the use of drugs that have no documented previous human experience. 3. The total amount of radiation to be administered as part of the study m ust be the smallest radiation dose practical to perform the study without jeopardizing th e benefits of the stu dy and must be within the specified limits (21 CFR 361.1(b)(3)). a. Limits on Radiation Dose for Adults: i. From a single study: 3 r em for whole body, active blood -forming organs, lens of the eye, gonads; 5 rem for other organs. ii. Annual and Total dose: 5 rem fo r whole body, active blood -forming organs, lens of the eye, gonads; 15 rem for other organs. b. The radiation dose to an individua l subject consists of the sum total of all sources of radiation associated with the research protocol includ ing the following: i. The radiation absorbed dose from the radioactive drug (including any significant contaminant or impurity) ii. The radiation absorbed dose from any assoc iated x -ray procedures, and iii.

Additional resources are located in the following chapter within the HRPP Policy and Procedure Manual : 5.3 Financial Conflict of Interest Management . A separate committee reviews and manages Institutional Conflict of Interest (ICOI) , which may exist when the interests of the inst itution or thos e of an institutional leader have the potential to impact or bias certain activities, like research decisions, at UTSW. The ICOI Committee and COI Office identify ICOIs and determine how to appropriately eliminate or manage them. The ICOI Committee meets at least quarterly to discuss ICOIs that may ar ise from UTSW's ownership interests, licensing, gifts, or certain interests or responsibilities of high-level leaders. The ICOI Committee is comprised of senior faculty members and administrato rs, as well as at least one non-affiliated member. After ICO I evaluation, a Management Plan is issued which details the strategies required for managing or eliminating t he conflict. ICOIs usually have unique circumstances and concerns to address. There fore, requireme nts in Management Plans following ICOI review ar e customized to reflect the specifics of the situation and best manage the conflict at hand. ICOI Management Plans may include a variety of requirements, including disclosing UTSW's interest i n informed cons ent documents for study participants as applicable. When specific informed consent language is required, the Management Plan will include this directive and be provided to all relevant individuals and the OHRPP. The COI Office supports the ICOI Committee and monitors adherence to ICOI Management Plans. ICOI review is not based on any regulatory requirements. However, both AAHRPP and UT System require that h uman research programs and institutions maintain ICOI programs. UT Southwestern's policy on institutional conflict of interest (ICOI) is located here : https://secure.compliance360.com/ext/E hc2hXLwZ_o= .

Per Medicare regulations, UTSW p roviders: CANNOT bill for services provided to patients if those services are provided for by a study sponsor or grant. These include: o The investigational item or service, itself Items and services provided solely to satisfy data collection and analysis ne eds and that are not used in the direct clinica l manage ment of the patient (e.g., monthly CT scans for a condition usually requiring only a single scan) o Items and services customarily provided, and paid by the research sponsors for any UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 77 of 270 enrollee in the trial CAN bill for routine costs in Medicare Qualif ied Clin ical Trials and for reasonable and necessary items and services used to diagnose and treat complications arising from the patient's participation in all clinical trials. Routine costs include: o Items or services that are typically provided absent a clinical trial (e.g., conventional care) o Items or services required solely for the provision of the investigational item or service (e.g., administration of a non -covered chemotherapeutic agent), the clinicall y appropriate monitoring of the effects of the item or service, or the prevention of complications o Items or services needed for reasonable and necessary care arising from the provision of an investigational item or service -in particular, for the diagnosis or treatment of complications For informat ion regardin g research billing and compliance, please go to the following : https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/employees/spa/ Within SPA the major responsi bilities listed above are further sub -divided into spec ialized offices that oversee its management : Central Coverage Analysis Group (C CAG), the Clinical Trial Finance Team, and Grants, among others. The Central Coverage Analysis Group (CCAG) performs a systematic review of protocol -related documents to det ermine if all patient care costs in a study are covered by the study sponsor, other funding source s, or qualify for reimbursement by third party payers, such as Medicare. The team completes a coverage analysis for all clinical research studies (including c linical trials) that involve billable procedures. The Clinical Trial Finance Team is responsible for the billing and invoicing of clinical trials, in conjunction with departmental personnel. Additiona lly, the CT Finance Team handles clinical trial budget review, ClinCard administration, treasury services for all awards, On Account payment management, customer maintenance, bank account validations, and management of Payment UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 78 of 270 Management System (PMS) draws . Sponsored Programs Administration is the central dep artment that assists researchers with applying for funding and managing their awards. S PA helps Principal Investigators and departments submit research proposals, execute grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and fiscally manage sponsored awards and a greements. The Grants office within SPA provides support to study teams throughout the lifecycle of their grant support, as follows: The Pre -Award stage refers to identification of a funding oppor tunity, development of a proposal, and submission of th e proposal to the sponsor for review. Pre-Award is composed of two teams; Proposals and Non -Industry Agreements. Pre -Award reviews proposals/agreements, assists with required updates/changes, and subm its proposals/agreements to sponsors for funding. The Post -Award stage encompasses grant s management activities after an award is received. Post Award is composed of several teams: Award Setup, Award Maintenance, Revenue Cycle, SPA Cash Management, Fi nancial Reporting and Award Close -Out. Post Award manages the financial aspect of research fu nding from making funds available to spend, performing billing & invoicing functions, completing award modifications, submitting financial reports, and closing out projects in compliance with regulatory requirements.

Office of Research Support and Regulatory Management (RSRM) The Office of Research Support & Regulatory Management (RSRM) ov ersees components of basic and clinical research that aim to help investigators assure compliance with regulatory requirements and institutional policies. The RSRM office is a centralized recourse that encompasses multiple units: Conflict of Interest (COI) and Conflict of Commitment (COC) Export Control (EC) and International Collaboratio ns Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) Stem Cell Resear ch Oversight (SCRO) The RSRM office a lso su pports multiple campus initiatives to assist our investigato rs in maintaining compliance w ith regulatory and institutional requirements. These include: NIH Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy Re adiness - This resource is a collaboration of multiple UTSW research administrative and support departments to ensure that P Is submitting new NIH applications are in compliance with the recently implemented NIH DMS policy. Departing Researchers: Research Project and Data Checklist - This resource provides contact information for those offices that should be notified when t he departure of researchers lead s research projects to be discontinued or transferred. In addition, the RSRM office provides support to the UT Southwestern Medical Center CTSA Program . Particularly, our office mana ges the CTSA H1 Core which is a collaborative effort between the Texas A&M School of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences and the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 87 of 270 University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The i ntent of the Core is to facilitate cross institutional research pa rtnerships to promote the development of translational research models leading to novel therapeutics and diagnostics. The Conflict of Interest (COI) Office , part of the Office of Research Support and Regulatory Management, oversees the identification, ma nagement, and monitoring of conflicts of interest and conflicts of commitment, and the approval of outside activities. Conflict of interest (COI) and conflict of commitment (COC) refer to si tuations where one's secondary int erests (such as personal financi al interests or outside activities) could impact one's primary interests (UTSW research, institutional responsibilities, etc .). The COI Office, and COI Committee, address both of these. All outside activities and personal f inancial interests, and those of covered family members, must be disclosed in one's COI Statement of Financial Interests annually and within 30 days of any changes. Statements must be submitted regardless of whether there are items to report. Completed COI Training and submitted COI Stat ement of Financial Interests for all investig ators and research staff are required for all IRB protocols and research grant applications. The COI Office identifies conflicts of interest, conflicts of commitment, and reques ts supervisor approval for outsi de activities. The COI Office facilitates req uesting supervisor approval and documents this according to Policy. The COI Office reviews the content of all submissions and identifies any conflicts. COIs are reviewed and manag ed via a Management Plan issued by the COI Committee. COIs and COCs may occ ur in connection with research or institutional responsibilities, as well as other reasons. While many COIs are due to the confluence of research at UTSW and outside activities wi th a sponsor or manufacturer, th ere are infinite ways a COI or COC may appear . The UTSW COI Office is not limited to identifying conflicts with clinical research involving human participants ; for example, we may identify and manage conflicts that involve r etrospective chart review, de -identified data analysis, basis research, and o ther conflicts. Conflicts are not inherently \"bad\", and many can be successfully managed by the COI Committee. Strategies to manage COIs should not be implemented without first discussing them with the COI Off ice. The Export Control Office ensures UTSW 's ongoing compliance with United States UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 88 of 270 Government 's export control regulations. If an international component is present, there is an export control consideration. Export Contro l (EC) and International Collabo rations refers to the regulatory responsibili ty to ensure that international items, technology, software, IP, and collaborations meet relevant export control requirements. The EC Office performs risk assessments for internat ional shipments, travel, researc h funding, the Export Control portion of visa applications, vendors, and international collaborations. Export Control regulations are complex. These regulations are set by three primary federal agencies with the ability to lobby heavy fines and restrict future exports. These agencies classify goods , identify restricted parties and destinations, and apply sanctions to support international trade compliance, economic objectives, and national security interests. Most research at UTSW is considered \"low risk, \" and can quickly be assessed, but when Expor t Control concerns are present, the primary objective is always complying with the regulations. Export Control is universally applied. Every activity, research project, award, a nd publication with an internati onal component is subject to Export Control risk assessment. Therefore, proactively reaching out to Export Control with requests for assessment of any planned international components will help ensure that you are informed, and any Export Control concern c an be addressed. All research projects conducted by UTSW investigators involving live vertebrate animals require prior review and approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The committee members o versee the welfare and humane ca re of animal research subjects. The Stem Cell Research Oversight (SCRO) committee oversees research and review s activities involving human embryos, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and human induced pluripotent stem (iPS Cs). Additional i nformation abou t the SCRO Committee is located in Chapter 2, Section E: Ancillary Review Committees. The RSRM Office can be re ached at 214-648-0456 (or ext. 8 -0456 if you're on campus) to speak to someone live or leave a message. More in formation about the RSRM and it s units can be found here: https://www.utsouthwestern.net/intranet/research/rsr m/ J. Affiliated Hospitals UT Southwestern is world -renowned for its resear ch and the quality of clinical c are its faculty provides to patients at UT Southwestern Uni versity Hospitals & clinics and affiliated hospitals . UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 89 of 270 UT Southwestern Faculty physicians offer patient care at UT Southwestern University, Hospitals & Clinics, Parkl and Health & Hospital System, Ch ildren's Medical Center, Texas Health Care System, and othe r affiliated hospitals and clinics. Each of the hospitals listed below outline a brief overview of their services and resources , with an emphasis on research opera tions. Whenever an affiliated ho spital is listed i n a research study application as a performance site, performance site approval must be obtained prior to beginning enrollment at the site. This is because Human research studies proposed to occur at UT Sou thwestern Medical Center or one of the affiliated performance sites require each site's individual approval before any research -related activities can initiate at that site. In terms of a real-world example , if your study lists both UTSW and Parkland as pe rformance sites but has only received IRB approval from the OCTM for UTSW, then the study may only screen, consent, and enroll UTSW patients until Parkland grants their performance site approval. Moreover, all scientific publications based on research studies that involve a non -UTSW perf ormance site must acknowledge the contributions of the partner site(s ). For additional guidance on the performance site approval process with UT Southwestern's affiliated hospitals, as well as access to documents that the outline conditions and wording f or affiliated site acknowledgements in research publications, please review: Performance Site Review: HRPP - UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX . This website also contains the Site -Specific contacts for each institution.

Texas Health Research departments are located within their Human Research Protection Program Office (HRPPO), Research Administration (RA) and Clin ical Research Trials office. All human -subject research conducted by THR em ployees/THR -credentialled individual or at a THR hospital/clinic or that is accessing THR data must be reviewed and approved by the THR HRPPO and THR Research Administration in addition to the IRB prior to beginning the research project. The Human Research Protection Program Office (HRPPO) is responsible for ensuring that all THR engaged human -subject research is conducted ethi cally and in compliance with federal regulations and T HR policies. The Research Administration Office ensures all agreements and payments for procedures are appropriately in place , ensures appropriate patient billing and research coding are appropriately applied post study initiation , and reviews and sets up non-THR individual 's access to THR systems or facilities. All studies in which THR is a performance site must have a THR employee or THR credentialed individual listed on the study. The following items are required for all studies in which THR is a performance site: Completed Study Questionnaire Completed and signed Entity Reviewer form. o Both of these forms can be found under \"Forms and Templates\" at: https://www.texash ealth.org/Research/Review -Board -and-Committee Other items may be required depending on the study specifics. Such items could include, but not limited to a Data Use Agreement, a THR Coverage Analysis, completi on of Contractor Questionnaire and additi onal items related to being a contractor, Contractual agreement for services, etc. After final review and approval, a letter from the THR HRPPO will be sent to the PI and study team noting site approval has been granted. In addition to the above, the f ollowing are additional considerations when engaging in research activities at a THR facility. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 99 of 270 Data All data that is being used outside of THR by non -THR individuals must at a minimum have a Data Use Agreem ent (DUA) in place. THR and UTSW have a Master DUA and for each individual study an Exhibit is created under that DUA. You may not send any THR data to another institution without prior permission from THR. This includes registries, other University collaboratives and/or other UTSW Affiliates (e. g., Parkland Hospital, Children's Hospital, etc.). THR requires a study specific Data Use Agreement with all other institutions receiving THR data even if that data has been combined with UTSW data. As part of the use of THR Data, THR must be noted in all p ublications stemming from the use of the data. THR has a Research Data Analytics team that can assist with research data requests. The THR individual listed on the study will be able to submit these requests or you can reach out to one of the THR Researc h Administration staff for assistance. Access Requesting access to a THR system (i.e., electronic medical record) or THR hospital/clinic (e. g., to consent a patient, complete a survey, etc.) requires being credentialed by the THR hospital or be set up as a THR research contractor. This would need to be indicated while completing the THR Study Questionnaire and would be facilitated by RA. Hospital Services If the study will i nvolve Hospital services , a THR Coverage Analysis will need to be completed . Services will be reviewed as whether considered Standard of Care or not by Research Admin. Research Admin will provide any fiscal responsibilities to you for study related items.

Working as a Me mber of a Research Team Effective Teamwork The conduct and successful execution of a clinical research study is entirely dependent upon the team 's effort s. The foundation of a successful team is communicating effectively, trusting fellow team members, and valuin g the skill and knowledge that each member brings to the team. Success of the team is interdependent. Each person has a piece of the puzzle; if even one small piece is missing, the puzzle is incomplete. At a minimum, without each person's contrib ution, the quality of the product will be far less than what is possible when all team members are fully engaged to accomplish the goals and objectives of th e project. This is because solutions built on collaboration tend to be higher quality, longer last ing, and le ss prone to error. Qualities of a Highly Functioning Team Interdependence . Interdependence is defined as the mutual reliance, or mutual dependence , between two or more people or groups. Trust . A relationship built on trust means a firm belief i n the reliability, truth, ability, and/or strength of the other team members . Efficiency . Efficiency is the quality of accomplishing something with the least amount of wasted time and effort. The more competent the individual team members become in clinical research , the more efficient the team becomes as a whole Continuous and ongoing evaluation for further refinement . A highly fun ctioning team learns from both its past mistakes as well as successes , discusses ways to improve pro cesses, and then refines how the y coor dinate efforts so that each successive subject enrolled on a study has a more Now that we know what the qualities of a highly functional team are, how do you create this team? Following are important information off ered by rese archers with subject matte r expertise in this area: Requirements for a Successful Team Knowledge of the r esources required for project completion . Resources include the protocol, brochures, manuals, etc. Identifying the skills necessary for a successful project Involving a ll stakeholders . Stakeholders can exist not only within the team (e.g., the PI, UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 101 of 270 biostatistician, etc.), but also from without the team (e.g., department heads overseeing the work units where research activities will occur, e tc.). The more each individual i s noti fied about your team's plann ed study activiti es in advance, the more prepared you will be for any potential outcome Establishing effective communication procedures . Asking others for help opens the line of communicatio n and they may in turn ask for h elp in the future. Never asking fo r help can isolate team members from each other. Strategies of a Successful Team Involving others in decisions that will ultimately affect them Keeping everyone on the team informed of what is going on Seeking diverse viewpoint s and appreciating unique points of view Making a conscious effort to listen to and learn from others Incorporating all relevant viewpoints into a project Essentials of Fostering Collaboration Creating a climate of trust: show trust to build trust. Knowin g that team members can rely on each other will make work less stressful. Facilitating relationships to initiate interaction Asking questions, listening, and taking advice Identifying skills and knowled ge of each team member Clearly est ablishing the respon sibilities of each team member B. Communication is Key Conducting a research study involves in teractions between the research team, clinical care providers/staff (if applicable ), the sponsor, research administrative offices, scientific services staff, and re search participants. Continually building upon these relationships will foster positive outcomes and help ensure re search integrity. C. Members of the Research Team There are many members of the research team, often representing different areas of expe rtise, who work together to conduct a clinical research study and obtain protocol -defined data. Ea ch member of the team m ust work with a wide variety of people, having a variety of backgrounds and knowledge. All members of the research team have common goa ls; ad herence to regulations, maintaining integrity of the research data, and protecting the right s and welfare of subjec ts. It is important to understand everyone's roles, responsibilities, and limitations. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 102 of 270 There are also institutional resources and comm ittees that will be involved at different levels with the research done in the institution. It is important to be aware o f and know about these groups. Additional information about these entities was discussed in Chapter 2 of this manual. Principal Invest igator Investigator is an individual who conducts a clinical investigation, under whose immediate direction the investiga tional product is administered or dispensed to a ). In the event an investigation is conducted by a t eam of individuals, the Investigator is the responsible leader of the team, and may be refer red to as the Principal Investigator (PI) or Clinical Investigator (CI). The PI assumes ultimate responsibility for protocol conduct at his/her study site(s) . Who can serve as the PI at UT Southwestern ? Individuals with faculty or Clinical appointments qualify a s PIs by the nature of their appointments. Individuals with other appointments may be able to serve as PI under certain circumstances. Refer to the in stitut ional policies to learn more about other staff appointments eligible for PI status on the IRB protocol submission. NOTE: Having PI status on a grant application is not the same as having PI status for human subjects protocols reviewed by an IRB . If you ar e unclear on your PI status, please reach out to the HRPP at HRPP@UTSouthwestern.edu . You can also refer to the UT Southwestern Human Subjects Protocols policy for more information on this topic : https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/research/hrpp/assets/policy_5.1principal.pdf ). When conducting clinical research involving the use of drug s, including biological produc ts, unde r 21 CFR part 312 and the use of medical device s under 21 CFR part 812, the overall responsibilities of the investigator include: Ensure that a clinical investigation is conducted according to the investigational plan (referred to as the protocol), the sig ned investigator statement or agreement and applicable regulations Protect the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects under the investigator's care Maintaining adequate records regarding the receipt, use and disposi tion of investigational drugs, b iologics , or devices used in a research study (21 CFR 312.60, 21 CFR 812.100) UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 103 of 270 Specific responsibilities of the PI include, but are not limited to: Complying with the principles of the Belmont Report and adhering to the reg ulations outlined in The Common R ule and other applicable regulations, such as the FDA Providing adequate training to and oversight of study personnel activities and, in the case of clinical research, ensuring protocol procedures comply with GCP requirements Obtaining written documentatio n of IRB approval or exemption of the study prior to initiating human subjects research Ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained, using an adequate and appropriate consent process, and ensuring the consent process is documented appropri ately (u nless the IRB has grante d a waiver of informed consent or documentation of informed consent) Ensuring permissi on for the use and disclosure of protected health information is obtained in compliance with the HIPAA privacy rule, if the research staff is with in the Health Care Comp onent or part of the affiliated covered entity Ensuring compliance with IRB approval c onditions, which includes following the procedures and using only the materials within the IRB -approved application and protocol. In the ca se of ex empt human subjects re search, monitoring for changes that could alter the exemption determination and consult ing with the IRB as necessary Obtaining IRB approval prior to implementing changes of protocol and promptly reporting changes of protocol Submittin g continuing review progress report(s) in a timely manner Reporting unanticipated problems (Ups) to the IRB Reporting noncompliance to the IRB Ensuring adequate medical oversight for subjects enrolled on the clinical research studies Ensuring adequ ate reco rds are kept to document study procedures and adherence with the IRB-approved application and protoco l, as well as ensuring records are retained and accessible for the required retention period Registering studies and providing updated information to Clini calTrials.gov, when required Filing and updating an OAR, disclosing relevant potential financial COI to the IRB, and following any management plans for human subjects research issued by the campus COI Committee Ensuring that additional procedures a re in pl ace for inves tigator -initiated, multi -center studies PI may delegate tasks, but not responsibilities. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 104 of 270 The information in this section was taken from the FDA Guidance on Investigator Responsibilities - Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Su that conduct clinical research studies involving the use of drugs and biological products (under 21 CFR Part 312 ) and medical dev ices (under 21 CFR Part 812 ) commit themselves to personally conduct and/or supervise the investigat ion. The Principal Investigator is the person ultimately responsible for the legal and ethical conduct of the study in accordance with the protocol, signed investigator agreement(s), and applicable regulations . PI's commit themselves to personally conduct or supe rvise t he investigation. In the event of an FDA inspection, the Principal Investigator will be responsible for attesting that s/he supervis ed the conduct of the clinical investigation and protect ed the rights, safety, and welfare of participants in the drug or medical device clinical trial. It is common and acceptable practice for investigators to delegate certain study -related tasks to research staff, colleagues, or other third parties (individuals or entities not under the direct supervision of the inve stigato r). When tasks are delegated by an investigator, the investigator is responsible for providing adequate supervision of those to whom tasks are delegated. The PI is responsible for providing adequate supervision and ensuring tasks are perfor med in accordan ce with the protocol and regulations. This responsibility cannot be delegated . Per the FDA Guidance on Investigator Responsibilities, when \"assessing the adequacy of supervision by an investigator, (the) FDA focuses on four major areas: (1) wheth er indi viduals who were delegated tasks were qualified to perform such tasks, (2) whether study staff received adequate training on how to conduct the delegated tasks and were provided with an adequate understanding of the study, (3) whether ther e was ad equate supervision and involvement in the ongoing conduct of the study, and (4) whether there was adequate supervision or oversight of any third parties involved in the conduct of a study to the extent such supervision or oversight was reasonably possible .\" [FDA Guidance for Industry Investigator Responsibilities \u2014 Protecting the Ri ghts, Safety, and Welfare MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 105 of 270 Certain tasks may be delegated to members of the study team wh o are q ualified by education, training, exper ience, and applicable licensure to perform those tasks. The required qualifications depend on what tasks are being delegated. Appropriate delegation is primarily a concern when delegating that that are c linical or medical in nature, such as evaluati ng clinical response to an investigational therapy in study subjects (e.g., global assessment scales, vital signs, or providing medical care to subjects during the study ). Most clinical or medical tasks require formal medical training and may also have li censing or certification requirements. Licensing requirements may vary by jurisdiction (e.g., states, countries ). Investigators should consider qualifications/licensing requirements when delegating specific task s. In all cases, a qualified physician (or dentist , as applicable ) should be responsible for all research -related medical (or dental) decisions and care. The FDA Guidance for Industry Investigator Responsibilitie s \u2014 Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of S tudy Subjects which study tasks have been delegated to individuals lacking appropriate qualifications .\" The following are examples of tasks that the FDA ha ve determined to have been inappropriately delegated during pr evious inspections at other research institutions : Screening evaluations, including obtaining medical histories and final determination if the subject meets inclusion/exclusion criteri a Rational e: Since screening evaluations typically include assessing medical history, laboratory values, so forth, this activity requires a medical license to determi ne whether a study subject meets the enrollment criteria Physical examinations Rationale : This activ ity requires a medical license in order to perform all of the necessary components of a medical examination Evaluation of adverse events (AEs) Rationale : This activity requires a medical license in order to evaluate the qualities of the adverse e vent (e.g. , seriousness, relatedness to the investigational product or treatment , so forth) as well as w hether modifications in treatment that may be required to addr ess the AE (e.g., discontinue treatment , lower the dose , so forth ) Assessments of primary study endp oints Rationale : According to the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) , \"An endpoint is a targeted outcome of a clinical trial that is statistically UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 106 of 270 analyzed to help determine the efficacy and safety of the therapy being s tudied ... Endpoints may also be used to throughout a study to determine if a participant's risk of continuing to be in a study is too great. \" Based on this explanation , only medically licensed pro fessionals can determine whethe r the study is meeting its stated primary study endpoints and/or whether a patient may nee d to be take n off study due to personal risks outweighing any benefit from continued study participation. Informed consent obtained by untrained and/or und elegate d (i.e., not formally listed as study personnel with the appropriate regulatory body, such as the IRB) study staff Rationale : According to the FDA \"A Guide to Informed Consent ,\" the, \"FDA does not require the investigator to personally co nduct the consent interview. The investigator remains ultimately responsible, even when delegating the task of obtaining informed consent to another individual knowledgeable about the research. \" In the end, t he PI is responsible for oversight of all resear ch act ivities under his or her protocol, including informed consent. Invasive sample or specimen collection (e.g., biopsy ) Rationale : Invasive procedure s are procedures in which the body is penetrated or entered (e.g., by a tube, needle, or i onizing radiat ion). Such medical procedures require a licensed professional to complete this tas k. Sponsor -Investigator A Sponsor -Investigator is an i ndividual who both initiates and conducts an investigation, under whose immediate direction the investiga tional p roduct is administered or dispensed ( 21 CFR 312.3 (b), 21 CF R 812.3(o) and ICH GCP E6 1.54 ). The term does not include any person other than an individual ( i.e., it does not include a corporation or an agency). The obligations of a Sponsor -Investigator include both tho se of a sponso r and those of an investigator If the PI is conducting an investigator -initiated study ( e.g., federally funded grant submitted by the PI or a study funded through department or faculty start -up funds), he/she is considered the Sponsor -Investi gator If the I nvestigator holds the IND application with the FDA, he/she is considered a Sponsor -Investiga tor and must report directly to the F DA all protocol amendments, Information Amendments, Annual reports, and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) Sub-Investi gator 21 CFR 3 12.3(b) states: \"In the event an investigation is conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team. 'Sub -investigator' (Sub -I) includes any other UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 107 of 270 individual member of that team\" but is primarily used to ref er to ot her physicians for faculty colleagues that could be delegated tasks that require making critical study decisions. Per ICH GCP [E6 1.54] A sub-investigator is any individual member of the study te am designated and supervised by the investigator at the study site to perform critical study -related procedures and/or to make important tria l-related decisions (e.g., associates, residents, research fellows). The sub-investigator should report directly to the investiga tor for his/her responsibilities related to the clinical research study (i.e., the investigator should have clear responsibilit y for evaluating the sub - investigator's performance and the authority to terminate the sub -investigator's involveme nt with the st udy). A sub-investigator assumes responsibility for tasks delegated by the PI. The sub-investigator must be as knowledgeab le about the protocol and investigational product as the PI because they may be delegated to conduct some or all aspect s of the study , including making critical study -related decisions. Clinical Research Coordinator The federal regulations clearly define the role and responsibilities of the PI and sub-investigator , but not the Study Coordinator, also referred to a Clinica l Research Coo rdinator (CRC). Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that a CRC: Works with and under the direction of the PI. The clinical research coordinator is a specialized professional working with, and under the direction of , the principal investiga tor. Plays an integral role in day -to-day activities . The investigator has ultimate responsibility for how a clinical trial i s carried out, but the CRC plays an inte gral role in the day-to-day study activities and managing many logistical aspects of the st udy. Can have very diverse roles and responsibilities . The CR C's role and responsibilities can be very diverse. There may be a combination of administrative, financial, regulatory, and subject management responsibilities. It is important for the CRC to kno w the scope of their role and responsibilities. Characteristically are organized, able to multi -task, great a ttention to detail and prioritize emergencies . Some of the important qualities of a CRC are to be organized and to be able to handle multiple task s simultaneous ly. Great atten tion to detail and strong time management skills are imperative. It is es sential to keep accurate records, collect clean data, and escalate any emergent issues to the PI in a timely manner (e.g., if there is a potential subject safety issue, the PI needs to be contacted so s /he can appropriately UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 108 of 270 address) . May be licensed or unlicensed personnel . Licensed personnel must work within th eir scope of practice. This includes licensed physicians, advanced practitioners ( e.g., Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRegN), nurse pra ctitioners, ph ysician assistants) , licensed nurses, such as those with a Mas ter's or Bachelor's degree in Nursing, or Registered Nurses (RN). Unlicensed per sonnel may not be delegated or perform tasks that they are not legally licensed or certified to p erform. Typic al CRC Responsibilities Under the FDA's guidance per 21 CFR 312.60 , \"An investigator is responsible for en suring that an investigation is c onducted according to the signed investigator statement, the investigational plan, and applicable regulations; for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects under the investigator 's care; and for the control of drugs under inv estigation. \" Succ essful CRC s keep in mind that the PI is ultima tely responsible for the conduct of the study . Thus, all study procedures must be carried out according to the PI's direction. Typical duties a CRC may perform as directed by th e PI include, bu t are not limited to , the following : Ensuring I RB approval is current . Even if the coordinator is working with the regulatory staff in their program, they should know IRB approval and expiration dates. The CRC should also ensure that all ap propriate docume nts have IRB approval, and that only the most recently approved documents are used. Obtaining informed consent . Any member of the study team may obtain informed consent from subject if they are qualified, have been properly trained on the i nformed consent process for the study and have been delegated this task by the PI. This process will be reviewed in more detail in a separate chapter later in the manual. Protecting the rights, safety and welfare of subjects . Protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of study subjects is always important, and although this is a specific responsibility of the PI as outlined by the FDA, it is still a shared obligation by all members of the research team. Scheduling subject visits . When scheduling subject vis its, the coordin ator must often coordi nate with many individuals, groups or other UTSW departments or clinics. This may include comm unicat ing with other members of the study team to ensure their availability for the conduct of study procedures, and most im portant ly, working with t he study subject around his or her availability (to the extent allowed by the protocol) . Depending on the subject population, individual subjects may need to coordinate study visits with his or her work schedules or to arrange chil dcare. While coo rdinating all these aspect s may be challenging , study visits must still be scheduled within the visit windows defined in the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 109 of 270 protocol. Completing all necessary study visit documentation . Completion of study visit documentation may include a ctivities prior to a study visit, for example, creating research orders in EPIC and documenting all communication with the study subject (e.g., phone calls prior to the visit, email reminders, messages left via voicemail, etc.) . There is also documentati on that needs to b e collected during the study visit. The documentation completed during a study visit could be as simple as documenting the time that all procedures (both standard of care as well as research -mandated) were performed. Or it could be more com prehensive, incl uding documenting the subject's response to questions, updating their medical history or medications, and documenting any potential adverse events that will eventuall y need to be assessed by the investigator . Documentation also continues af ter the study vi sit. Depending on the type of study and the study sponsor, additional forms may need to be completed, such as Case Report Forms (CRF). Finally, the data may need to be transferred into an electronic data capture (EDC) system or a study database. Interviewi ng subjects/administering questionnaires . If appropriately trained, and delegated this task by the PI, the coordinator could conduct interviews and administer subject questionnaires. Collecting and processing biological samples . The coordin ator may collect , handle, and process biological research samples or specimens, if appropriately trained and delegated this task by the PI. The coordinator should also be aware of sample collection or processing procedures that may need to be performed by certified person nel (e.g., such as by a phlebotomist) . Abstracting study data from the medical record . The coordinator may be asked by the investigator , study monitor, or other representative from a regulatory b ody to abstract data from the medical record of actively enro lled subjects in order to answer a specific research question or look for potential serious adverse events, such as from emergency department or urgent care visits . Or, if the study team is larger in size and can afford to allocate this res ponsibility to a nother team member, such as a Data Analyst , then the coordinator will need to work closely with this team member(s) to ensure that all information has been appropria tely captured in a timely manner. Documenting and reporting adverse events . CRC should enga ge in a dialogue with the subject to explore adverse events, including all medical and non -medical related signs and symptoms the subject may be experiencing or ha ve experienced since their last research visit. After the PI has assessed the AE and any appr opriate responses have occurred (e. g., adjusting treatment, titrating a dose down, etc.), the coordinator UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 110 of 270 may report, or facilitate reporting of AEs or other Reportable Events (REs), to the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the IR B, FDA, or Data and Safety Monitoring Board/Committee (DSMB/C). It may be the responsibility of the clinical research coordinator to report these issues to the IRB, or they may ask the regulatory sp ecialist in their group for assistance. The PI must review all submissions , regardless of who submits reportable events to the IRB or other regulatory authorities . Ensuring protocol compliance . By the study team - The CRC should make sure all procedures defined in a protocol have been performed. It is appropriate for a CRC to review study specific data collection forms to ensure all data from each visit is captured. By subjects - The coordinator should also determine subject adhe rence and compliance if defined in the protocol. If there are concerns, the coordinator should consult w ith both the PI and the subject to help determine if there are areas of improvement to focus on. Maintaining Study and Subject Records . The CRC should ensure that all study and subject records are maintained as in, updated in a timely manne r. There are add itional chapters in this manual that describe study records and subject records in more detail. Acting as an Advocate/Liaison/Communicator . The CRC sh ould always act as the subject's advocate. Sometimes this involves being a liaison to faci litate communica tion between clinical care staff, clinical research staff, the IRB, and the sponsor/CRO rg representatives. Providing assistance to regulatory, recruitme nt, financial and data management staff . As mentioned earlier, the roles and responsibilit ies of a CRC can be very diverse and may depend on the specific study type, study sponsor, and research program. CRC may be asked to provide assistance to regulatory , recruitment, financial, and data management staff in their program, or they may be asked to perform all o f these tasks. Remember, a t UT Southwestern , each employee must work within their scope of service /practice . It is important to be mindful that you must work in the scope you are hired into at UT, not the scope you may have credentials in.

Tasks a CRC Should NOT Do Unless the CRC is a licensed physician or advanced practitione r (i.e., PA or N P), a CRC is generally not qualified to: Assess adverse events . While a CRC may identify the occurrence of adverse events, he or she is not qualified to assess the severity or clinical significance of such events. This is the responsibility of the PI or Cl inical Investigator that has been delegated this task. Perform Physical Exams . The coordinator should not perform physical exams. If a phys ical exam is required per the study protocol, the physical exam should be completed by a licensed physician or advanc ed practitioner. Assess significant of abnormal laboratory values . A CRC may not review abnormal laboratory values to determine clinical s ignificance. This task must be performed by a licensed physician or advanced practitioner. Perform oth er tasks require d of a licensed professional . There are some tasks that require a licensed professional, such as a blood draw from a central line, punch biopsies, lumbar punctures, etc. All members of the study team should be aware of their scope of practi ce and limitatio ns. Provide clinical care. If a licensed physician or advanced practitioner is also serving the role of a CRC, it is important to remember t heir role in the study is to conduct research, not to provide clinical care. Unless the CRC is also a member of a pa rticipant's clinical care team, they should not make any medical recommendations or answer non -study -related questions. The role o f the CRC is to convey concerns about subject's medical conditions and non -study -related questions to a member of the subject' s clinical care team. Regulatory Staff Like CRC, the federal regulations do not clearly define the role and responsibilitie s of a Regulat ory Specialist. At UT Southwestern , Regulatory staff are primarily responsible for the preparation, processing, and su bmission of applications and supporting regulatory documents, including consent forms, to the IRB and administrative or over sight boards a nd committees as applicable and according to regulatory and institutional requirements. Regulatory st aff are also exp ected to develop and maintain knowledge of federal and institutional guidelines, regulations, and requirements governing res earch. Regulat ory staff is typically responsible for activities including, but not limited to: Preparing, processing and submitting initial IRB applications, change of protocol UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 112 of 270 submissions, and continuing reviews to the IRB and other committees as applicable Tracking s tudy submissions, approvals and expiration dates (if they apply; UT Southwestern no longer date stamp s informed consent forms with an expiration date ) to ensure uninterrupted project approvals Processing IRB approval letters and accompanying approved docu ments (e.g., consent forms, recruitment material, subjects surveys/questionnaires ) Ensuring all s taff cr edentials (train ing, Curriculum Vitae (CVs), medical licensure, etc.) are current (not expired) and up to date Preparing and maintaining the FDA 1572 Preparing and maintaining the regulatory files/binder Communicating submission progress to the P I, the stu dy team and the sponsor/CRO rg (as applicable) Preparing and submitting REs according to regulatory and institutional requirements Preparing, processing and submitting final report to the IRB and other committees as applicable These are the typical tasks reg ulatory staff ma y be responsible for performing, but there are frequently additional duties that these staff may be required to perform or conduct . Financial Staff Financial staff play a key role throughout the life cycle of a study. The financial staff m ember is integra l to the budget development and negotiation process, identifying routine care versus research -related costs and the related financial impact on subjects, as well as routing the grant, contract, and/or agreement through UTSW UT Southwestern as part of the st udy initiation process. Financial staff also play a role monitoring study acco unt(s) throughout the course of the study to ensure all charges are appropriate and consistent with the established grant/contract and/or agreement. Regularly o ccurring meetings with the PI and the study team is important, especially if there is a change t o the protocol that could impact study costs. Financial management could be the responsibility of one member of the study team, or various financial -related tas ks could be delega ted to multiple members of the study team. Recruitment Staff Recruitment staf f assist in the implementation of a recruitment plan to identify the target subject population, taking the protocol's eligibility criteria into account. The recru itment staff is integral to identifying recruitment barriers and implementing processes to overcome the se barriers. Recruitment staff should identify all helpful institutional and local resources. Subject recruitment UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 113 of 270 could be the responsibility of one memb er of the study team, or various recruitment tasks could be delegated to multiple members of the study team. Data Management Staff Data management personnel are responsible for the oversight of c linical research data. Data management tasks include data ac quisition, data extraction, data entry, data processing/coding, continuous monitoring of t imeliness and completeness of data entry, data security, and data quality. Data management could be the re sponsibility of one member of the study team, or various dat a management tas ks could be delegated to multiple members of the study team. Sponsor The sponsor is the entity responsible for the initiation, management, and/or financing of a clinical research study. The sponsor does not actually conduct the investigati on or administer /dispense the test article to research subjects ( 21 CFR 50. I), 21 CF R 312.3(b) , ICH GCP E6 (1 .53)). The sponsor may be an individual, a pharmaceutical company, a governmental agency, an academic institution, a private organization, or another organization. The sponsor may co ntract with a CRO rg to conduct some of the initiation and/or management activities that a sponsor is responsible for ( e.g., monitoring). UTSW Clinical Staff UTSW clinical staff may interact with research subjects as part of their clinical du ties. For exampl e, research subjects present in the clinical setting may be seen for medical and nursing care, collection of laboratory specimens, radiology tests, and other health -related interventions. UTSW clinical staff should always communicate with t he study team if there are any subject safety concerns or if they are unsure if rese arch procedures to be conducted. In the latter situation, since the Principal Investigator has already delegate d all research -related procedures to the staff per the Delega tion of Authorit y (DOA ) log, then the research staff should be responsible for carry ing out any research procedures , as necessary. Nursing Staff UTSW nursing staff caring for subjects participating in a clinical research study (for example, Advanced Practice Research Nur ses, or A PRsNs) should follow UTSW policies unless instructe d otherwise in the research protocol approved by the IRB of record. Nursing staff should be provided information by the study team on study protocol -required activities they will be required to conduct. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 114 of 270 Additionally, information on how to c ontact the study team should be provided t o the clinical staff. This advanced information is an essential part of preventing protocol deviations. Non-UTSW Registered Nurses Working at UTSW Registered nurses who practice at UTSW , but who are not employed b y UTSW (i.e., employed through a Department), must obtain approval for practice at UTSW facility by Professional Staff Services and must be reapproved annua lly. Advanced practitioners, such as NPs a nd PAs who practice at UTSW , must be approved for practice by UTSW , as app licable. There is no approval to practice as a Licensed Practical Nurse or Medical Assista nt at a UTSW facility. These staff members have the same limitations and restrictions as unlicensed personnel. Unlicensed personnel and the PI are re sponsible for kn owing the scope of activities allowed for clinical research activities. Some restricted act ivities may be within the scope of practice for unlicensed personnel after obtaining approved training, such as phlebotomy training. Any uncertaintie s about approved activitie s should be clarified with the manager of the clinical department in which the st udy is being performed and/or with the Office of Clinical Research . For additional guidance on credentialing information and privileging processes, including Parkl and Health and Hospital System as well as Children's Heal th, please go to the following web site: Professional Staff Services (Formerly Credentialing) - MyUTSW (utsouthwester n.net) . Study Pharmacist Though the PI is ultimately responsible for drug accountabilit y, UTSW policies require the Investigational Drug Services (IDS), who employs a team of pharmacists and pharmacy te chnicians to perform the tasks of study drug storage , preparation, dispensation, and accountability (per UTSW policy RES-161). For more information about the IDS, refer to Cha pter 11 , General Support Services . External Visitors From time to time, external visitors may request to visit the campus 's research and/or clinical laboratories. These visitors would be defined as any individual not employed by UT Sout hwestern or its af filiated hospitals (e.g., Parkland, Children's Health, and so forth). UT Southwestern does allow visitors to its research and clinical laboratories for educational or training purposes. Please refer to EHS-105 VISITORS IN RESEARCH AND CLINICAL LABORATORIES for more information on this policy and guidance on next steps that may be required to secure permissions . UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 115 of 270 Please note: This policy do es not apply to the following: UT Southweste rn students, employees, faculty, residents or fellows; visiting scientists and researchers covered by arrangeme nts of the funders and home institutions; and guests who visit UT Southwestern fo r a short term and f or a specific event (i.e., serving as a gues t lecturer, delegation member, site visitor or similar). For additional guidance , including observers in patien t care areas, badge request form, so forth, please refer to Professional Staff Se rvices and scroll to \"Observers \": Links - Credentialing (utsouthwestern.net) . D. Delegation of Authority Log Throughout this module, duties are referenced that can be delegated to the memb ers of the study team by the PI. These dut ies can be documented on the Delegation of Authority (DOA) log. This log may be the only record of the delegation of duties for the study , so it is imperative to maintain this log. Though the re are many references to appropriate delegation of tasks to qualified staff, there is no federal regulation that explicitly references a DOA Log. Per the FDA Guidance on Investigator Responsibilities referenced above, the investigator should mai ntain a li st of the appropriatel y qualified persons to whom significant research -related duties have been delegated. This list should also describe the delegated tasks, identify the training that qualifies such individuals to perform study related delegate d tasks, e .g., can refer to an i ndividual's CV on file, and identify th e dates of involvement in the study. Obtaining the signatures of the staff involved in the conduct of the study allows future researchers to accurately reproduce the study activities. I t is effic ient to collect staff signatures on the same log that indicat es the delegated duties and tasks. An investigator should maintain separate lists for each separate study. Things to watch out for: The start date for any staff member cannot be before he or she has 1) been listed on the approved IRB application; and 2) b een trained. There should always be documentation of training with the topics and date of training. Some DOA logs will also require the PI to sign, or initial, and date when a stu dy staff member starts. The date that corresponds to the PI's signature or in itials should be the same as the start date. Keep everyone on the team up to date and current A key to conducting research responsibly is to make sure all study staff have the ne cessary resource s and support to compl ete their delegated task(s). This could also include scheduling regularly occurring meetings to check in with other staff involved in the conduct or oversight of UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 116 of 270 the study. Regular and ongoing communication with membe rs of the study team can help ensure t hat all involved: Have an adequate unde rstanding of the specific details of the protocol needed to perform their assigned tasks Are aware of regulatory requirements and acceptable standards for the conduct of clinical trials and the p rotection of human subjects Are competent to perform delega ted tasks Are informed of any pertinent changes during the conduct of the study and receive additional training as appropriate Understand the study purpose and how to assure data integrity Are remi nded of the study -spec ific inclusion and exclusion criteria E. Professionalism Regardless of an individual's role on the clinical research team, it is important that those who interact with subjects remember that subjects are volunteering their time to parti cipate, most often to benefit others in the future. The y will also likely hav e varied backgrounds, beliefs, needs, and personalities. At any time, for any reason, a participant may withdraw from the study. Therefore, it is the job of all members of the res earch team to make the subject's participation in clinical research as positive an experience as possibl e. Always remember that participants come first. Establish rapport with participants. Retention begins with the first contact with the subject, is an ongoing process, and i s everyone's responsibility . This can be achieved by: Treat ing participants, and their caregivers, with respect Assur ing a welcoming atmosphere where participants are seen Identify ing and resolv ing issues in a timely manner . If you ex perience any delays in resolvi ng an issue, clearly communicate that to the subject and e xplain that you will follow up when you have more information and/or have reached a resolution. Transparency and constant comm unication is key in helping to defuse any issues as they arise Addition al considerations include: Schedule appointments at locations that are convenient to the participant whenever possible. However , this is not always possible , especially when certain equipment (e.g., whole -body 3T and 7T scanner s) are only located in a UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 117 of 270 spec ialized facility , such as the Advanced Imaging Research Center ( AIRC ). In those situations, clearly explain the reason why appointments may need to occur at a specific location Prepare for other necessary tasks, such as transpo rtation reimb ursement , gift cards with a flat compensation fee for participation , and so forth. . Most likely, all of these situations will already have been negotiated by the financial team and ready for disbursement to the study subjects via an authorized payment system, such as ClinCard s. If you have any questions about how to obtain ClinCard s for the study, being trained on how to add funds, etc., reach out to the Sponsored Programs Administration (S PA) Communication strategies Contact subjects, or respo nd to communication fr om the subject, as soon as possible. The longer a subject waits before hearing back from study staff, the less confidence and trust they have i n the study staff, and they may beco me more concerned or apprehensive about continuing thei r participation Be per sistent. Document all attempts to contact participants and keep trying. Obtain prior IRB approval for all patient -facing documents that will be given to subjects at any time duri ng the study. This includes: Informational packets/folde rs that could include information sheets about their disease or condition, local support groups or services that may be available, Tokens of appreciation to be given to research subjects (e.g., special event cards, thank you notes) All correspondence , including study visit remi nders , which could ask subjects to bring unused study drug to next appointment and to call if they expe rience any side effects or symptoms All research team members shou ld do their best to minimize risk to research subjects . All rese arch involves some lev el of risk. Investigators and members of the research team are obliged to give consideration to maximize the potential benefits while minimiz ing any potential risks arising from participation in the resear ch study. We often think of r isks in terms of physi cal harm that may occur as a result of participation in research procedures, but harm may also result from aspects of participation beyond research p rocedures. For example, harm may result from accidental disclosure of sensitive findings (e.g., disease sta tus, genetic results, etc.) that result from participation on a research study. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 118 of 270 According to the Belmont Report, Part C, Section 2, most risks enco untered by participants in research fall into the follow ing categories: Physical: Physical risks may includ e pain, injury, and impairment of one of the five sense s, such as touch or sight. These risks may be brief or extended, temporary or permanent, and may occur during participation in the research or arise afterwards. In many situation s, physical risks in r esearch can be minimized by carefully and skillfully foll owing the protocol and by having trained individuals conduct research procedures, through careful monitoring of research participants' health status, by recruiting appropriate p opulations, and by providing clinical care when needed. Psychological: Psychological risks can include anxiety, sadness, regret, and emotional distress, among others. Psychological risks exist in many different types of research in addition to behavioral studies. Possible way s to protect against psychological risks include r eminding participants of their right to withdraw from research or limit their participation if th ey become uncomfortable, providing counseling or psychological support for participants who experience distre ss, or thoroughly debriefing research participants after research sessions are over. Social: Social risks exist whenever there is the possibility that participating in research or the revelation of data collected by investigators in the course of the rese arch, if disclosed to individuals or entities outside of the research, could negatively impact others' perceptions of the participant. Social risks can range from jeopardizing the individual's reputation and social standing, to placin g the individual at-risk of political or social reprisals. Often, minim izing social risks to participants involves protecting confidential data, including not only the data collected, but the fact of participation in the research project itself. Legal: Legal risks include the exposure of activities of a research subject \"tha t could reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability .\"(eCFR :: 28 CFR Part 46 - Protection of Human UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 119 of 270 Subjects ) Protections against legal risks often involve protecting the confidentiality of research data. For studies conducted in the United States, inves tigators can apply for Certificates of Confide ntiality , which are intended to prevent investigators from being forced to disclose data that can be linked to identifiable research participan ts in legal proceedings. Effective Oct ober 1, 2017 , Certificates of Confidentiality (C oCs) are automatically d eemed to be issued for any NIH -funded research that collects or uses identifiable, sensitive information that was on-going on or after December 13, 2016. More information about th ese automatic NIH C oCs is located here: CoCs for NIH -funded Research | grants.nih.gov . Economic: Economic risks may exist if knowle dge of one's participation in research, for example, could make it difficult for a resea rch participant to retain a job or to find a job, or if insurance premiums increase or loss of insurance is a result of the disclosure of research data. Protecting con fidentiality of data is one method for protecting against economic risks, especially those related to employabilit y and insurability. Investigators may elect to keep research data separate from medical records to prevent employers and insurance com panies from obtaining information that could put the participants at risk. F. Subject Responsibili ties The study subject is also considered an integral member of the research team. Their role needs to be highlighted during the informe d consent process and reinforced at each subsequent research visit. Responsibilities include: Adhering to the study visi t schedule Complying with the study treatment Notifying the study team if there are changes in their current medications (including s topping a current one, adjustments in dosages, etc.) or new conditions/diagnoses made by their other clinical care provider s during their study participation . For exampl e, if a subject is on a cardiology study but during a standard clinic visit to their prima ry care provider is informe d about an adjustment to their current medication as well as a new diagnosis, then this information needs to also be sh ared with the resear ch team Keeping the study team up to date if there are changes in their home life such as a new job, a new address, a new phone number, etc. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 120 of 270 Many studies are starting to also request permission to contact the subject's primary care team, to relay any significant findings during subject's participation in the research study that could impact that patient's ongoing clinical care. If the protocol requires it, make sure that th e primary car e team's contact informat ion is current while the p atien t is on study. G. Clinical Care vs. Clinical Research According to the Belmont Report, the distinction betw een (clinical) research and (clinical) practice is blurred partly because both often occur together (as in research desi gned to evaluate a therapy ) and partly because notable departures from standard pra ctice are often called \"experime ntal\" when the terms \"experime ntal\" and \"research\" are not carefully defined (taken from The Belmont Report: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjec ts/guidance/belmont.html ). Good clinical care of patients is not the same as GCP when working with research subjects. For the most part, the term clinical care refers to inter ventions that are designed solely to enhance the well -being of an individual pa tient with a reasonable expectation of success. By contrast, the term \"research\" describes an activity designed to test a hypothesis, permit conclusions to be drawn, and contrib ute to generalizable knowl edge (expressed, for example, in theories, princ iples, and statements of relationships)\" (taken from The Belmont Report: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansub jects/guidance/belmont.htm l). Often in clinical research studies, the investigator plays a dual role as physician and investigator. It is the duty of the physician and all members of the research team to act in the best interest of the participant, whil e at the same time perform ing good research. Differences in these roles must be understood. Examples of su btle, but sig nificant, differences that need to be understood and carefully documented by the research team include but are not limited to : Concomita nt medications that might normally be prescribed for a patient may not b e allowed for a subject while parti cipating in a research study Treatment periods, including run -in and wash -out periods, may differ from clinical practice to what the protocol may req uire A symptom or side eff ect may be normal in certain disease states would be considered an adverse even t during study participation Unless authorized by appropriate licensure, members of the clinical research team should not give clinical research subjec ts health care recommendat ions If you ever find yourself in a situa tion when you' re unsure whether the information provided by the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 121 of 270 subject is important or not, or you're unclear what the scope of your responsibilities are, please reach out to your Princip al Investigator or other r esources (many listed throughout this hand book as depart ments, offices, and committees ) for clarification and guidance . The wide-ranging activities that occur throughout the life cycle of a study and that you capture as a part of the research team may end up having wider significance that could le ad to a groundbreaking discovery or scientific advancement. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 122 of 270 Chapter 4: Protocol Content Essentials A. What is a Protocol? The protocol is a study plan, or an investigational plan, which describes how the clinical r esearch study will be implemented. It should be written in a comprehensive manner to leave no room for misinterpretation. A protocol is designed as an instruction manual on how to answer a specific research question, while pro tecting the rights, safety, a nd welfare of subjects. The protocol m ust include specific information about who may participate in the study, how many subjects will be studied, the primary measures to be evaluated, and the schedule of tests, procedures, medi cations, and dosages as appli cable. The protocol should include the length of study participation, potential risks, and how adverse events will be handled. The protocol allows researchers at multiple locations (multi -site study) to perform the study in the same manner so that thei r data can be combined as though all data was obtained at the same study site. The protocol is at the center of any clinical trial. It details all the information required to safely conduct the study. A protocol may come from a spons or, such as a drug company , or it may be developed by a n individual investigator. Protocol formats can vary between companies and investigators, but the content should not. There are some sections in the protocol that may not be included, depen ding on the discipline being studied, as well as the phase of study . Not all study staff are involved in writing the protocol, but all members of the team should understand the necessary protocol components. The contents of a clinical research protocol sh ould general ly include the following s ections as described in this chapter. Site specific information may be provided on separate protocol page(s), or addressed in a separate agreement, and some of the information listed below may be contained in other pro tocol refere nced documents, such as an Investigator's Brochure (IB). Refer to the Clinical Trial Protocol development tools and templates created through an NIH and FDA collaboration: https:// osp.od.nih.gov/clinical -research/clinical -trials/ Finally, it should be mentioned that in the past few decades, the FDA has recognized a growing need to promote improved clinical trial design to reflect the changing demographic nature of the general popu lation in the United State s. Specifically, the FDA is interested in helping underrepresented communities become more involved in studies , and in November 2020 released UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 123 of 270 a guidance document entitl ed, Enhancing the Diversity of Clinical Trial Populations \u2014 Eligibility Criteria, Enrollment Practices, and Trial Designs Guidance for In dustry . Per their document, \"enrolling participants with a wide range of baseline characteristics may create a study population that more accurately reflects the patie nts likely to take the drug if it is approved and allow asse ssment of the impact of thos e characteristics on the safety and effectiveness of the study drug.\" Although this document does not establish legally enforceable responsibilities , it does provide helpful recommendations for investigat ors to consider when cre ating more inclusive studies that could potentially increase enrollment of underrepresented populations in their clinical tri als. B. Title Page All protocols should have a title page. The title page will include the following informat ion, as applicable: Protocol Title. The title should be specific enough to distinguish the protocol from those for similar studies. It should include the drug, disease being studied, design, and the study phase. Protocol Number. A unique number that identi fies the protocol. IND o r IDE Number , as applicable. Protocol Date and Version Number. All protocols should include a version number and version date that will allow subsequent versions to be identified. Funding Sponsor. PI name and Institutional Affiliati on. The contact informat ion for the study PI. Sub-I(s). Include name, department, address, phone number, FAX number and e -mail addresses for all protocol personnel. Coordinating Center, as applicable. C. Table of Contents Every protocol should include a Tabl e of Contents to allow e asy navigation. D. Protocol Su mmary/Abstract The protocol summary, or protocol abstract, should give a good overview of the study and usually includes the following: Study objectives/endpoints . A statement of endpoints Study popul ation . A description of the population being studied, sometimes with inclusion/exclusion criteria Study design . A statement that details what study design will be used UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 124 of 270 Study drug/device . The name (if k nown) and class, formulatio n, route of administration, and dosing regimen. Similar is true for an investigational device s tudy. This section should include the device specification, the device manufacturer, as well as the device implantation or application Study Duration . This inclu des duration of treatment, s ubject participation, and overall study projection Methods and ma terials . A brief description of required procedures and tests Anticipated maximum number of participants and study centers Diagram. A diagram or \"schema\" that repr esents the study design at a glance Schedule . The study schedule of assessments, also known as the protocol calendar or the schedule of events E. Introduction/Background The Introduction/Background section should identify the reason(s) for doing the study, a ny previous related studies and how they contributed to this study' s design , and finally how this current study fits into the developmental plan for addressing a condition or disease . The introduction/background section is basically a brief dis cussion of why this protocol's novel inquiry is necessary. For instance, i f there is a n existing gap in the knowledge about a particular disease or condition , the introduction/background section will explain how it is anticipated that this new research protocol will a ddress the gap. This section should encompass the following: The name and description of the study drug/device, medical need, and rationale for use A description of the design and major endpoints and rationale for use A summary of findings from nonclinical and clinical studies releva nt to the proposed study A statement of how this protocol differs from other protocols using the same treatment A description of the population to be studied An identification of the setti ng in which participants will be seen A summary of the known and pot ential risks and benefits, if any, to human subjects A description of and justification for the route of administration, dosage, dosage regimen, and treatment period(s) (investigational drug) or the device specifications and the device implantation or appl ication should be described (investigational device) A description of the study control and/or comparison group A general description of the procedures and length of the study A state ment that the study will be conducted in comp liance with the protocol, GC P, and the applicable regulatory requirement(s) UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 125 of 270 Reference to earlier related studies and data regarding the investigational agent and disease or condition under study Discussion of implications for future studies F. Study Objectiv es/Purpose This section shou ld clearly state the primary and secondary objectives and endpoints. State the primary objectives of the study (i.e., Purpose) . For instance, you may want to determine the \"e fficacy\" of Agent A. Example: \"To compare disease -free survival (DFS) as assessed by investigator for participants treated with Agent A plus pembrolizumab (i.e., standard of care) versus those receiving placebo plus pembro lizumab. \" NOTE : One of the most important aspects of clinical research is that it can tell us how well a proposed intervention (i.e., whatever is being used to treat a disease or condition ) works . Interventions typically include drugs but can also mean surgical procedures , lifestyle changes (e.g., exercise, diet programs) , so forth . The efficacy , therefore, of an inte rvention is how well i t works when compared to a placebo or no treatment at all. Efficacy can be measured in many differ ent ways, such as how well the intervention improves symptoms, how long it takes for symptoms to improve with the intervention , or how m any people respond to the intervention. State the primary endpoints of the study ( i.e., how the objective is measured) . Example s of endpo ints include, but are not limited to : Continuous measurements : blood pressures, weight, b lood chemistry variables . For example, Determine if Agent A lowers blood pressure by a certain number or degree Event times : time to recurrence of cancer, survival time Counts : frequency of occurrence of migraine headaches, number of uses of rescue meds fo r asthma Binary endpoints : no recurrence/recurrence, major cardiac event yes or no Ordered ca tegories : absent, mild moderate, severe pain, New York Heart Association (NYHA) status Unordered categories : categories of adverse experiences: Gastrointestinal (GI), cardiac, etc. NOTE : An e ndpoint is a targeted outcome of a clinical trial that is statist ically analyzed to help determine the efficacy and safety of the therapy being studied. The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint . State the sec ondary, exploratory and or safety objectives and endpoints. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 126 of 270 Secondary objectives are goals th at provide further information on the use of the proposed intervention. Example: \" To compare overall survival (OS) for participants treated with Agent A plus pemb rolizumab versus those recei ving placebo plus pembrolizumab.\" Exploratory endpoints may inclu de clinically important events that are expected to occur too infrequently to show a treatment effect or endpoints that for other reasons are thought to be less li kely to show an effect but a re included to explore potential new hypothes es. Example: \" To ide ntify molecular (genomic, metabolic, and/or proteomic) biomarkers that may be indicative of clinical response/resistance, safety, pharmacodynamic activity, and/or the mechanism of action of A gent A and pembrolizumab.\" G. Study Design and Methods The Study D esign and Methods section provides specifics as to how the research will be conducted and the means used to achieve the study's specified objectives. This section m ay include the following: A description of the type/design of study to b e conducted, e.g., d ouble -blind, placebo - controlled, parallel design, and so forth. This section should also include a schematic diagram of trial design, procedures, and stages A desc ription of the measures take n to minimize/avoid bias, such as by employing randomizati on or blinding A description of the treatment(s) and the investigational product(s) being tested The expected duration of subject participation (e.g., in days, months, or years, etc.) , and a descrip tion of the sequence and duration of all study periods, including any follow -up (as well as whether these visits will all be in person, over the phone, virtually, etc.) A description of the \"stopping rules\" or \"discontinuation c riteria\" for individual subj ects, parts of the study, or the entire study Accounta bility procedures (e.g., s tudy drug storage, handling, dispensing, and documentation of administration, return and/or destruction of the drug ) for the investigational product (s), including the placebo(s ) and comparator(s), if any Maintenance of research t reatment randomization codes and procedures for breaking code s for emergency purposes H. Selection , Exclusion, and Withdrawal of Subjects This section should include a complete list and description of spec ific requirements for subject UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 127 of 270 selection including a ge range, health status, disease specific criteria, allowable and disallowable medications, etc. Subject selection may be referred to as Eligib ility Criteria or Inclusion/Exclus ion Criteria in some protoco ls. The \"eligibility criteria\" details the inclusio n and exclusion criteria for a subject to be eligible to participate. Inclusion criteria is the criteria that must be present for a subject to be eligible, whereas exclusion cri teria is the criteria that m ust NOT be present for the subject to be eligible. These criteria should address: Willingness to sign an IRB -approved informed consent form and comply with the protocol requirements Age, gender, and mental capacity Disease or c ondition specific criteria Required thresholds of physiologic and laborator y testing Allowed and disallowed medications Medical and surgical history Ability to tolerate a withdrawal period from current treatment prior to study treatment (if applicable) Fertility limitations and restr ictions for the duration of the study parti cipation, both for participant and partner A statement that the investigator can use judgment regarding any o ther condition not specified which may impact participation Limit on concurr ent participation in other i nterventional studies This section shou ld also include the subject withdrawal criteria (i.e., terminating investigational product treatment ), and pr ocedures specifying: When and how to withdraw subjects from the investigational product treatment The type and timing of the data to be collected for withdrawn subjects Whether and how subjects are to be replaced The follow -up for subjects withdrawn from investigational product treatment Per the Office of Human Subjects Research (OH RP) and the Department of He alth and Human Services (HHS), \" Subjects have the right to withdraw from (i.e., discontinue participation in) research at any time (45 CFR 46.116(a)(8)). If a subject decides to withdraw from all components of a research study, the investigator must discon tinue all of the following resea rch activities involving that subject's participation in that study (45 CFR 46.116(a)(8)): Interacting or intervening with the subject in order to obtain data about him or her for the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 128 of 270 research st udy (e.g., administering an experimental drug, performing a tissue biopsy, drawing blood, exposing the subject to visual stimuli on a computer monitor and measuring response times, orchestrating environmental events or social interactions, or conducting et hnographic interviews with t he subject); Obtaining addition al identifiable private information about the subject for the research study by collecting or receiving such information from any source (e.g., obtaining additional information from the subject's education records or medical records, or obtaining biologica l specimens pertaining to the subject that have been or will be obtained for clinical purposes and stored in a hospital's pathology department or clinical laboratory); and Obtaining additional id entifiable private informati on about the subject for the res earch study by observing or recording private behavior without interacting or intervening with the subject (e.g., recording mother -infant interactions in the home environment using video cameras o r monitoring messages posted on an internet forum that is pa ssword-protected and accessed by invitation only). Sometimes, a subject wants to withdraw from the primary interventional component of a study, but is willing to allow the investigator to contin ue other research activities described in the IRB - approved p rotocol and informed consent document that involve participation of the subject, such as: (1) obtaining data about the subject through interaction with the subject (e.g., through follow -up intervi ews, physical exams, blood t ests, or radiographic imaging); or (2) obtaining identifiable private information from the subject's medical, educational, or social services agency records or from the subject's healthcare providers, teachers, or social worke rs. When a subject's withdra wal request is limited to disco ntinuation of the primary interventional component of a research study, research activities involving other types of participation for which the subject previously gave consent may continue. Continued participation in sec ondary components of a research stu dy may be particularly important in clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of specific interventions in the management of diseases or disorders. For this reason, OHRP recommends that when a subj ect decides to withdraw from a clin ical trial, the investigator conducting the clinical trial ask the subject to clarify whether the subject wishes to withdraw from all components of the trial or only from the primary interventi onal component of the trial. If the latter, researc h activities involving other components of the clinical trial, such as follow -up data collection activities, for which the subject previously gave consent may continue. OHRP also recommends that the invest igator explain to the subjec t who wishes to withdra w the import ance of obtaining follow -up safety data about the subject. \" UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 129 of 270 For additional guidance and recommendations from the OHRP/HHS on how to withdraw subjects from non-exempt human subjects research co nducted or supported by HHS , please refer to: https://www.h hs.gov/ohrp/sites/default/files/ohrp/policy/subjectwithdrawal.pdf . I. Treatment/Intervention Plan This section of the protocol will include details of the treatment( s) to be administered, including the name(s) of all the product(s), the dose(s), the dosing schedule(s), the route/mode(s) of administration, and the treatment period(s), including the follow -up period(s) for subjects for ea ch investigational product treat ment. This section will give details about the investigational treatment(s) to be administered, including: Generic, chemical, and trade name s Packaging (e.g., blister pack, bottles , etc.) Storage procedures and stability considerations Dosage form and formulations Formulation of placebo Dosing schedule(s) Treatment period(s), including follow -up period(s) Blinding procedures and code breaking process Dosage regimen, supporting rationale, and ad justment procedures (if necess ary) Route/mode(s) of administra tion Compliance parameters Medication(s)/treatment(s) permitted (including rescue medication) and not permitted before and/or during study participation Procedures for monitoring subject complia nce J. Investigational Product D etails This section includes specifics about the drug(s) being used and how they are stored and procured for use in the clinical trial. Industry -sponsored protocols may refer to a Pharmacy Manual for some detailed information. This section should include: Drug name (generic name) with IND number Classification Mode of action (i.e., a functional or anatomical change, resulti ng from the exposure of a living organism to a substance ) Storage and stability UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 130 of 270 Dose specifics Preparation (e.g., if the drug is deliver ed in a powder format and the investigational pharmacist needs to reconstitute it in normal saline first before it can be infused into a patient ) Route of administration (e.g., intravenous, oral, patch, etc.) Incompatibilities (i.e., physical or chemical r eactions that occur between t wo or more drugs when they are combined in the same syringe, tubing, or bot tle) Availability Side effects (these include the ones that are known at the time of publication, but more may become poss ible while the research team i s working with subjects. The se are then reported to the sponsor, who will then update the appropriate essential documents, such as the Investigational Drug Brochure (IDB) as necessary to share this information with all of the research te ams) Nursing implic ations (e.g., immediate emer gency actions that a nurse must take if a certain side effect was observed during the drug's administration) If the study is evaluating an Investigational Device, this section should instead includ e: Device s pecifications, pack aging, labeling Device stora ge Device implantation/application Device accountability procedures Concomitant medications allowed/disallowed, required washout periods . A washout period is when subjects receive no treatment or a different treatment than the o ne that is currently being tested in the study . The purpose of a washout period is to eliminate or reduce the effects of a previous treatment , which may affect the validity of the final results. For example, if you are doing a cardiology study and investig ating a new drug for atrial fibrillation, then the patient may need to undergo a washout period for a pr evious drug (e.g., baby aspirin) to make sure that any effects , good or bad, obse rved with the investigational drug is due only to that drug, and not du e to a combination of the dr ug with the baby aspirin. An important consideration to note is that any washouts of current drugs can only be decided by a licensed member of the team , who has been trained to safely make that dete rmination whether a patient ca n be taken off of a current medication. Use of sham procedures (i.e., exposure to an inactive (or sham) procedure to assess the efficacy of an int ervention , in this case against devices or procedures in a clinical trial) Preca utionary, prohibited medicatio ns and procedures Prophylact ic medications and procedures Device removal UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 131 of 270 Clinical or laboratory evaluations required K. Informed Consent This section should include a statement that the informed consent requirements and regulati ons relating to informed conse nt will be followed, emphasi zing the requirement for obtaining consent prior to performing any study -related activities. Moreover, i f a Legal ly Authorized Representative (LAR) or guardian is allowed to sign o n behalf of the re search subject (e.g., in situa tions where children are bei ng recruited and too young to assent , or an adult may lack the capacity to comprehend, etc.), then this also needs to be clearly outlined , including the parameters where this instance would be allow ed. L. Assessment of Efficacy This section should include a detailed description of the efficacy measures to be recorded, including the identification of primary and secondary endpoints, and methods for recording and analyzing efficacy parameters. Study end points are the variables chose n to assess the effects of the investigational product related to pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacodynamic measures, efficacy, and safety. A primary endpoint(s) should reflect clinically relevant effects and is typically se lected based on the principal objective of the study Example: \"Disease -Free Survival ( DFS) as assessed by investigator: time from randomization to the first documented local recurrence, or occurrence of distant kidney cancer metastasis(es), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs f irst.\" Secondary endpoints assess other drug effects that may or may not be related to the primary endpoint. Endpoints and the plan for their analysis should be prospectively specified in the protocol Example: \"Overall Surviva l (OS) time from randomization to death due to any caus e.\" The methods used to ma ke the measurements of the endpoints, both subjective and objective, should be validated and meet appropriate standards for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, reliability, and responsiveness (sensitivi ty to change over time). M. Assessment of Safety This section will include the safety parameters that will be assessed, including the methods and timing for assessing, recording, and analyzing safety parameters. This may include procedures for eliciting and recording adverse events. The purpose of conduc ting ongoing safety assessments is UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 132 of 270 to continually evaluate changes in subject risk or safety information over the course of the study. As new information is discovered, this new d ata will then be disseminated out to all of the centers participating in the research study, if it is a multi -center study. Adverse Events This section should include explicit descriptions and definitions of adverse events, as well as reporting requiremen ts and the type and duration o f the follow -up of subjec ts after adverse event s. Refer to Chapter 9 of the manual for more information on the identification, documentation and reporting of adverse events. N. Study Activities and Observations Screening Proced ures This section will detail all the screening requirements that need to be addressed prior to enrolling subjects. These issues may include, but are not limited to: A description of all activities and tests needed prior to enrolling Baseline values to be established at screening Repl acemen t of Subje cts This section will describe the procedures to replace subjects who fail the screening, withdraw from the study, or whose participation is otherwise terminated. It's important to note that t he replacement of subjects is protocol specific and ne eds to be tailored to the trial 's study design . For e xample , the following is a typical replacement procedure in a cancer study : a subject is withdrawn by the study team from the dose escalation cohort for any reason oth er than a dose limiting toxici ty (DL T) prior to completing the first 28 days of [Agent X] treatment on a 28 -day cycle . In this instance , since the patient n ever initiated the study treatment, a replacement subject would be enrolled and will be assigned to the same [Z] dose level so that the study still meets its objectives for enrolling [Y] number of subjects at [Z] dose . Concomitant Medications This section will address the use of other medications by subjects while enrolled in the study, including both over the counter (OTC ) medicati ons as well as prescribed medications. This section should describe the medications that are allowed (e.g., baby aspirin, statins) and those that are not allowed during study participation, including the procedures to be taken if a subject starts a disallo wed medication during their participation in the study. Moreover, if there is a washout period allowed for the subject to stop ta king a current medication before initiating treatment , then the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 133 of 270 duration of this washout should b e thoroughly e xplained. Subje ct Enrollment/Registration This section will define the enrollment start for participants. Some studies consider the subject enrolled when informed consent is obtained, while others consider the subject enrolled when they are randomized or rece ive their fi rst dose of study treatment (e.g., first pill, first infusion , etc.) . Each study will clarify the specific criteria that defines enrollment . Study Procedures The study procedures section should include an outline of the labor atory and diagnostic tests required, as w ell as a study schedule for tests and procedures at each study visit throughout the study. Clinical assessments will also be described in this section. If there is a study window of time allowed for completing each visit, this information should also be included (for example: Month 3 - Visit 3 ( +/- 6 days). Also, if important details are necessary to clarify what is required and when , then insert that information as footnotes into the table. This will keep the table in a simpler format for ease o f use, bu t also provide significant details that the study team may need when performing each study visit. An example of a footnote for the Physical Examination is included in the table below. Procedure Screening - Visit 1 Baseline - Visit 2 Month 3 - Visit 3 Month 6 - Visit 4 End of Study - Visit 5 Informed Consent X Medical History X Physical Examinationa X X Venipuncture X X X X X Laboratory Tests [CBC, CMP ] X X X X X Eligibility Review X Drug D ispensation/Accountability X X X Questionnaires/Surveys X X X aPhysical examination (PE): Complete PE at screening, including height (at Screening visit only) and weight; directed PE, thereafter, including weight. Ultimately, the more information that is provided, the more li kely that study teams will execute the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 134 of 270 protocol exactly as was originally intended. This will also reduce the number of errors and protocol deviations that could impact the scientific validity o f the study. O. Statistical Consid erations The study protocol sh ould have a specified analysis plan appropriate for the objectives and design of the study. The Principal Investigator (PI) should clearly describe the types of analyses to be performed and eval uation techniques (endpoints, ph armacodynamic assessments, out come measurements, etc.). This section is intended to address the study design, in relation to the objectives of the study and the plan for evaluation of the data. The following will be include d in this section: Overview of g eneral study design issues Classification of study variables (primary vs. secondary) A description of the statistical models and methods to be employed, including timing of any planned interim analysis(es) The total number of subjects planned to be enrolle d. In multicenter trials, the number of enrolled subjects projected for each study site should be specified Reason for choice of sample size, including reflections on (or calculations of) the statistical power of the trial and clinical justification The le vel of significance to be used Criteria for the termination of the study, including statistical and admini strative procedures for monitoring the progress of the trial to implement early termination Procedure for accounti ng for missing, unused, and spurious (i.e., fake/false) data Proce dures for reporting any deviation(s) from the original statistical plan (an y deviation(s) from the original statistical plan should be described and justified in the protocol and/or in the final report, as appropriate) The sel ection of subjects to be inclu ded in the analyses (e.g., all randomized subjects, all dosed subjects, all eligible subjects, evaluable subjects) Procedures for handling of non -evaluable or incomplete data In sum, the description of the analytical and stat istical techniques utilized in the protocol should be as explicit as possible. All manipula tions of the data should be explained, and the statistical methods to be used should be clearly identified. Simple statements about an \"appropriate analytical techni que\" and an \"appropriate stati stical test \" are discouraged; they imply that the investigato r has not fully planned out the required analyses for the study. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 135 of 270 P. Direct Access to Source Data/Documentation The protocol shou ld include a statement that the investi gator/institution will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and regulatory inspection by providing direct access to source documents and study data. Q. Quality Control and Quality Assurance The quality of a clinical research study is based on the study d esign and is embedded in the study protocol and procedures used to conduct the study. The Quality Management section of the protocol describes the procedures that will be used during the study to protect data quality and integrity. Components of the qualit y management procedures includ e creating, implementing, maintaining and upho lding/following standard operating procedures (SOPs) . The Quality Management section of the pr otocol describes the procedures that will be used during the study to protect data qua lity and integrity. SOPs could be implemented at the department level, the program level , or for the specific study . A well-written SOP will support the following expectations and standards : A quality, well -designed protocol is integral to ensuring high qu ality data is collected and managed Study team meetings and training. It's very important to have ongoing study team meetings to effectively monitor the progress of the study, and ensure the PI is providing appropriate oversight. The study team should purs ue ongoing tr aining offerings to keep abreast of the changing clinical research standards and regulations The data m ust be collected, recorded and reported accurately. If it's not, the data may never meet the study objectives Periodic monitoring and self -audits shoul d be performed Additional information on how to protect data integrity will be discussed in Chapter 10 of this manual. R. Adverse Events and Data & Safety Monitoring Plan The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) describes the protections for re search par ticipants and data i ntegrity, and the oversight for the clinical research study that will be provided, at a level commensurate with the study risks. Thus, the method and frequency of monitoring is directly related to the possible harms to researc h particip ants in the study. T he Common Rule requires that all studies involving human subjects have a monitoring plan when appropriate ( 45 CFR 46.111 ). The NIH often requires that all clinical trials supported by NIH have a DSMP: https://osp.od.nih.gov/clinical -resear ch/nih -data-and-safety -monitor ing-policies/ UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 136 of 270 NIH Guidance for DSMP: Refer to the NIH Guidance on How to Write a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan should include the following elements: Description of how the progress of the study and the safety of subjects will be actively monitored who will be monitoring and at what frequency (e.g., quarterly, a nnually) Description of the mechanism for identifying and submitting repo rtable events to the IRB, FDA and NIH (as applicable) How will problems/side effects be identified ( e.g., lab tests, physical exams, etc.) How will the p roblems/si de effects be handle d by the study team What are the reporting requirements and timeframes A detailed plan for stopping the study for safety reasons Plans for ensuring data accuracy and protocol compliance The processes used to monitor safety mu st be det ailed and include spe cific descriptions of potential side effects and risks related to this specific investigation. Definitions and criteria for determining causal relationships to the investigation should be defined. This section of the protocol will vary depending on the typ e of study, and the levels of complexity and risk. For minimal risk studies, describe how potential problems will be monitored and handled (e.g., breaches of confidentiality, emotional upset , etc.) For clinical studies or rese arch inv olving more than minim al risk to subjects, describe: Who will monitor subjec t safety and how often will events be assessed What follow -up procedures are required How will the events be recorded and communicated amongst research team members and who is responsible for submitting the reports The composition of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board/Committee (DSMB/C) if one has been formed for the study, and how frequently they will review the study Describe stopping rules for the study Describe what oc curs if a subject withdraws prematurely Data and Safety Monitoring Board/Committee A DSMB/DSMC oversees and monitors on -going clinical research for safety and data quality issues. In addition to regular review of the data and safety measurements, they may review reports on QA, UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 137 of 270 audits, monitoring and protocol deviations. They typically review all SAE reporting in real time via the DSMC Chair. Appropriate protections and oversight can range from oversight by the PI and IRB for a single -site, minimal risk cli nical trial, to oversight by a full DSMB and IRB(s) for a multi -site trial that involves greater than minimal risk.

Ethics This section sho uld include a description of ethical considerations related to the study. It may UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 138 of 270 involve descriptions of independent ethics committees, reference to ICH principles, new information relevance and distribution, and subject confi dentiality. T. Data Handling and Record Keeping This section will describe the data handling and record keeping processes and measures to be taken, including how data will be collected, protected, managed, and detailed procedures for correcting data. Data in cludes both study -related docu mentation supporting the conduct of the study, and subject -specific results of assessments which will be used for endpoint analysis. The descriptions should specifically state how, where, and under what secured conditions the data will be managed and maint ained. Specific reference to hard copy and electronic information should be defined, including the use of electronic data capture systems, if applicable. This section should also describ e how long the study records will be ke pt. ICH, FDA, and UT Southwest ern Human Research Protection program policies related to recordkeeping and retention may vary in terms of the length and determining time point for records reten tion. If you are ever placed in a situa tion with conflicting ret ention timeline, always opt to follow the most conservative (i.e ., longest term requirement) policy for your study . U. Publication Policy This section of the protocol should cover the publication policy, if not already addressed in a separate agreement. The research protocol should speci fy not only how the results will be disseminated in the scientific media, but also to the community and/or the participants, the policy makers, etc. Therefore, the publication policy goes further to lay down the groundwork for who will be acknowledged as contributors, who will be acknowledged, etc. , in the event that the results of the protocol are published. V. References /Bibliography All study protocols, whether randomized -controlled double -blinded cli nical studies or chart rev iews, should contain a referen ces/bibliography section. This is because this section will contain a comprehensive review of the literature that supports the rationale for the current study and include previous investigations that lead the investigator to develop the specific research question for this new protocol . In addition, this section should include a justification of the research design and the use of any placebos. Some points to remember: References should be used for any point that can be attribu ted to a specific source They should be sequentially numbered throughout the protocol UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 139 of 270 W. Supplements/Appendices When additional information is necessary to support decisions made by the Principal Investigator, it should be included in an appendix. The Suppl ements/A ppendi ces sections off ers an opportunity by the study author (s) to provide researchers with any additional information that would be useful to successfully and accurately execut e the protocol. Examples of content that can be typically found in this section include, but are not limited to: Study tables (e.g., height and weight to calculate a pediatric BMI) Supplemental material of documents such as flow diagrams or work -up tables . A properly constructed flow diagram can grea tly clarify complex intera ctions Questionnaires A descri ption of the analytical methodology Brief reprints from study journals UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 140 of 270 Chapter 5: Study Records: Management, Security and Retention The discovery process for new diagnosis, treatment and preventi on options can sometimes b e perceived as burdensome and onerous, but every researcher must remember that none of these discoveries would be possible without valid data. Federal regulations, state laws, institutional policies, and good clinical and research practices require investi gators to keep all study -related documents to eff ectively demonstrate that they follow the highest ethical and clinical research standards. While these regulations might seem overwhelming, it is important to understand that proper documentation not only pr ovides the framework for appro priately organizing required paperwork, but also provides a tangible audit trail from the initial inception of the idea to completion of the study. This chapter of the manual will refer to research d ata. For the purposes of t his handbook , Data is defined as recorded f actual material, regardless of the form or media on which it may be recorded, that is commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings. This in cludes a variety of media and do cument types, such as data spr eadsheets, fi lms, sound recordings, or pictorial reproductions. Data is also used to describe records, such as the protocol, procedural manuals, data collection forms, SOPs, diagrams, and workfl ow charts that relate to the study. Within this chapter, we w ill also desc ribe the record keeping and retention regulations related to both the sponsor and the investigator. The sponsor of a study may be a pharmaceutical company, a non -profit organization or the UT Southwestern PI. As a reminder, when the PI both in itiates and conducts the clinical research study, the PI is considered the Sponsor -Investigator and assumes responsibilities of both the sponsor AND the investigator. If a study is industry -spon sored, it is important to know t he regulations that apply to a sponsor, as well. Some sponsors, CRO rgs, or federal agencies may require that investigators keep additional documents, and it is helpful to ask questions and understand why. A. Federal Regulations for Record Keeping US Federal Re gulations discuss record keepi ng in several areas. Those areas differ depending on the type of study that is being conducted. There are two sections that stand out in the CFR related to investigational drug records. 21 CFR 312.57 Record Keeping and Record Retention 21 CFR 312.52 Invest igator Recordkeeping and Record Retention UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 141 of 270 There are additiona l 21 CFR 312 regulations relating to investigational drug accountability records, subject case h istory records, AE records, and the records that must be avail able for an inspect or or auditor. Regarding investigational drugs, 21 CFR 812.140 is more compre hensive and includes a section describing the records that mus t be maintained by the sponsor and the investigator. There is a separate section on the records that must be available for an inspector or auditor. This chapter will primarily focus on the regulations relating to these record s in more detail. Information in the CFR can be found here: (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch .cfm). It should be noted that The Natio nal Institutes of Health (NIH) recently issued a final NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing (DMS Policy) to promote the management and sharing of scientific data generated from NIH -funded or conducted resear ch. This policy, which became effective on January 25, 2023, \"establishes the requirements of submission of Data Management and Sharing Plans (hereinafter Plans) and compliance with NIH Institute, Center, or Office (ICO) -approved Plans. It also emphasizes the importance of good data management prac tices and establishes the expe ctation for maximizing the appropriate sharing of scientific data generated from NIH -funded or conducted research, with justified limitations or exceptions. This Policy app lies to res earch funded or conducted by NIH that resul ts in the generation of scient ific data. \" To review this policy, please visit: NOT -OD-21-013: Final NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing . Any NIH -funded study subm itted after January 25, 2023, is impacted by this update. The new policy requires that P Is deposit their scientific data in publicly accessible data repositories at the time of, or before, the data is included in a peer -reviewed publication, or at the comp letion of a research project; and that a plan for how and where the data will be deposited is explicitly described in a Data Management and Sharing (DSM) Plan. The UTSW IRB does not need to approve the plan (that is the exclusive purview of the NIH to review the DMS Plan for adequacy ). However, the IRB does need to see the plan and ensure that it's consistent with the study. If you have any questions about these new NIH guidelines, please refer to the above -refere nced policy or visit UTSW's intranet websit e, \"NIH Data Management and Shar ing Policy ,\" which was created by the Office of Research Support and Regulatory Management (RSRM) to help guide researchers impacted by this update: NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy (swmed.edu) . The UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 142 of 270 website includes a video presentation on the updates, templates available for download, etc. Finally, i n addition to the above NIH policy, the NIH has also released Supplemental Information to guide research ers, depending on the study 's design . Please refer to the following as applicable to your study : Supplemental Information to the NIH Pol icy for Data Management and Sharing: Protect ing Privacy When Sharing Human Re search Participant Data : https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/NOT -OD-22-213.html Supplemental Information to the NIH Policy f or Data Management and Sharing: Res ponsible Management and Sharing of American Indian/Alaska Native Participant Data : https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/NOT -OD-22-214.html Supplemental Informat ion to the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing: Sel ecting a Repository for Data Resulting from NIH -Supported Research : https: //grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/NOT -OD-21-016.html Supplemental Information to the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing: Allowable Costs for Data Management and Sharing : https://grants.nih.gov/gran ts/guide/notice - files/NOT -OD-21-015.html Supplemental Information to the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing: Ele ments of an NIH Data Management and Sharing Plan : https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice - files/NOT -OD-21-014.html Please email datasharing@utsouthwestern.edu if you have any questions about this new policy or contact the RSRM Office at 214 -648-0456 . B. International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice The ICH GCP Guidelines related to recordkeeping are summarized below and can also be found on this website: ichgcp.net . As discussed in Chapter 1: Bas ic Concepts of Clinical Research, the FDA accepted the ICH GCP guidance as standards to be followed when conducting an investigational drug or device study. It is also important to recognize that some sponsors, including federal agencies, require that the research they are funding follows GCP standards, even if it not an investigational drug or device study. Therefore, it is expected that ALL types of clinical research studies will follow the GCP standards. A sum mary of ICH GCP guidelines related to record retention will be described in mor e detail below. Required records include all original records and certified copies of original records of UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 143 of 270 clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical rese arch study necessary for the reconstruction a nd evaluation of the trial Origin al documents may include hospital records, clinical and office charts, labora tory notes, subject diaries, pharmacy dispensing records, and recorded data from automated instrument s Dates and signatures, or initials, should b e legible. It should be clear who has documented the data (initial and date) The information should be docum ented in the correct time frame along with the flow of events. If a clinical observation cannot be docu mented when made, then the delay should be de fined and justified Data records should be easily accessible and available for review by treating physician s and during audits or inspections. The documents should be retrievable in a reasonable time C. Protocol/S tudy Record Maintenance During the Conduct of the Study Additionally, the ICH GCP guidelines refer to the necessary study records as Essential Document s. According to the ICH GCP Guidelines, Essential Documents are those documents which individually and co llectively permit evaluation of the conduct o f a trial a nd the quality of the data produced. These documents serve to demonstrate the compliance of the investigator, sponsor and monitor with the GCP standards and all applicable regulatory requirements. Essential documents also serve a number of othe r important purposes. Filing essential documents at the study site or with the sponsor in a timely manner can greatly assist in the successful management of a study by the investigator, sponsor, and monitor. The se documents are also the ones which are usua lly audited by the sponsor's independent audit function and inspected by the regulatory authority(ies) as part of confirming the validity of the study conduct and the integrity of data collected. Throughout a s tudy's life span, there will be many essential documents generated that need to be maintained by the research steam . These e ssential documents can be ca tegorized according to the stage of the trial during which they will normally be generated : 1) before th e clinical phase of the trial commences 2) during the clinical conduct of the trial, and 3) after completion or termination of the trial A complete outline of the recommended essential documents can be found on the ICH GCP Website (ichgcp.net ). UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 144 of 270 D. Management of Study Records The protocol records are stored in what is most commonly referred to as the Regulatory Binder . The term Regulatory Binder refers to the place where regula tory documentation related to the study is stored and updated. This place is not nec essarily one locat ion, or even one physical binder. It is also feasible to store some of the documents only in electronic format. If documents are only stored electronicall y, a paper placeholder should be stored in the regulatory binder that describes wher e the information is located and how to access it. It is important that whether study documents are electronic or paper records, they are always easily accessible to study staff, an inspector, an auditor, or a s tudy monitor. A quick note about the differe nce between monito ring and auditing: Monitoring is usually conducted by interested parties involved in the research (investigators, institutions, sponsors) to identify issu es and to improve processes. The goal is quality control (QC) and quality improvemen t (QI ), and it is usually conducted on a predetermined cycle , unless it is for cause (more on this topic is covered in Chapter 10). Frequent monitoring can identif y data deficiencies that require a corrective an d preventative action (CAPA) plan. Auditing is usually conducted by regulatory agencies (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) ) who operate under their regul atory authority to confirm that study requirements are being met. This type of monit oring is much less frequent and is based on regulatory requirements or concerns about the conduct of the study . Auditing can be random or for cause. Auditing can result in a corrective action plan , but it can al so result in punitive action for the study, such as stopping all research activities or, in a worse -case scenario, debarment of the PI from participating in all current and future research activities . Regulatory File s/Binder should be created at the begin ning of the study, prior to IRB approval and subject enrollment. As new documents are received, or as documents are revised or updated, the regulatory files must be kept current and up to date. Examples of documents t hat will likely have more than one vers ion include the protocol, investigational dru g brochure or investigators brochure, consent forms, and recruitment material. It is recommended to store documents in reverse chronological or der, with the most current do cuments first. The Essential Documents must also be retained for a period of time af ter the study is concluded. Below is a table containing the recommended Regulatory Binder sections and the applicable UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 145 of 270 contents of each. This t able provides an organization al framework and guidance on the docume nts that need to be maintained. Research team s are not required to follow the exact grouping or sequence of documents. Some of the sections or documents are not applicable to all studies. Additionally, investigators m ay choose to store certain documents in places other than the Regulatory Binder. Fin ally, some sponsors, CRO rgs, or federal agencies may require that investigators keep additional documents that are not specifically referenced in this material.

Regulatory Files/Binder Tips to Remember Keep the Regulatory files/binder up to date. This may require setting aside time on a regular basis to review and update files and documents in th e regulatory binder Identify individual(s) responsibl e for creating and maintaining the regulatory files. Ensure that the individual(s) are aware of their responsibility Store the records in a safe and secure location. Per ICH GC P E6 4.9.4 , the investigator/i nstitution must take measures to prevent acci dental or premature destruction of these documents. This means that the study files should not be placed up against a wall in a hallway where they could be stolen or damaged. They should not be placed UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 149 of 270 immediatel y under a sprinkler system to prevent acciden tal destruction of the records Customize the regulatory files/binder to meet each study. The table above is a template; unused sections can b e omitted, and new sections added as needed F. Protocol/Study Record Sto rage after Protocol Completion/Study Closure A study is considered \" complete \" when the data is deemed final ( e.g., no additional data needed from the patient and/or access to the medical r ecords , no more editing/analyzing of obtained data requir ed, etc. ). Study records can be archived after completio n but must be maintained for a specified amount of time. The investigator/institution shoul d retain the study documents as specified in ess ential documents [ICH GCP E6 8 ] for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontin uation of clinical development of the investigational product. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained [ 21 CFR So uthwestern complies with federal, state and institutional requirements f or clinical research, the PI must ensure adeq uate records are retained and accessible for the required retention period to document study procedures and adherence with th e IRB -approved application and protocol. UT Southwestern 's policy on record retention is covered under FSS-201 RECORDS MANAGEMENT AND RETENTION . Per the policy, \" UT Southwestern records are s tate records and it is UT Southwestern policy that these records, regard less of the medium in which they are maintained , must be retained for the minimum periods identified in the UT Southwestern Records Retention Schedule (\" Schedule \") as a pproved by the Texas State Library and Archives Commission (\"Commission\") and by the Texas State Auditor's Office , in compliance with Texas Government Code, Chapter 441. All Records Retent ion policies are supervised by Supply Chain Manag ement: Records Retention - Materials Management (utsouthwestern.net) . Resea rch records should be maintained for the longest amount of time specified to meet the requirements, not the shortest. In the case of investigational drugs or devices, it often takes many years to reach marketing approval . To address this, HRPP's policy on record retention states, \"The HRPPD retains all records (with or without participant enro llment) for six years after closure or cancellation, which is suffici ent to meet federal, stat e, and local regulations, sponsor requirements, and organizational policies and procedures .\" It is important to note the record keeping requirements described in this manual relate to FDA regulated studies in the US. Studies condu cted internationally have different regulations to be followed. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 150 of 270 G. Record Keeping and Management Resources Additionally, the UT Southwestern Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) has developed a policy for record keeping (including access, storage and rete ntion) : https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/research/hrpp/assets/policy_8.3recordkeeping.pdf . To review other UT Southwestern HRPP policies covering documentation, or to access additional policies and procedures that cover a wide range of topics, go to: HRPP Policies and Procedures: Human Research Protection Program (H RP-) - UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX . UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH MANUAL Version 1.0 Page 151 of 270 Chapter 6: Study Initi ation Process at UT Southwestern Prior to initiating a study, the research team should be aware of the research setting in which they are conducting their research. In this context, \"research setting\" can r efer to many different things, such as whether the study is engage d in some aspect of the larger community (e.g., school -aged children in Dallas Independent School District) , involves recruit ing patients within a private medical practice, requires permissions to acce ss patient contact information from outside research networks , and so forth. The process of initiating a study at UT Southwestern begins with the initial commitment to be involved in the study. This could take the form of a grant submission to the NIH or signing a confidentiality data agreement (CDA) with an industry pharmaceutical sponsor , etc. There are typically more activities that must be conducted if the study is investigator -initiated , as some of the necessary documentation required for IRB review are already provided by industry sponsors and/or the CR Org. The process below describes the most basic study initiation process for clinical research studies within UT Southwestern, but there may be additional requirem ents and steps in order to obtain final study approval, depending on whether there is involveme nt from a ny additional research setting s. Moreover, these steps do not always occur sequentially; depending on the situation and/or sponsor , some activities may occur in parallel (e.g., a sponsor may work on the budget in parallel with regulatory review) . If you are ever unsure what to do at any poi nt in the study initiation process, please reach out to any of the departments and offices referenced throughout thi s handbook for guidance . UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 152 of 270 Activity at UT Southwestern Investigator -Initiated Process Industry -Sponsored Process (NOTE: a Clinical Research Organization may be the point of contact) Industry Sponsor makes initial contact with team to PI or other study team member regarding a new clinical trial N/A In most situations, t he sponsor will make contact with the study team via em ail and include minimal information regarding their study (e.g., protocol title, a few eligibility criteria, etc.). Internally, the team w ill review this offer to gauge interest and feasibility. Usuall y, the Clinical Research Manager ( CRM) will confirm that the patient population exists and start the process of determining who would be the PI for this potential new study. This could be achie ved through a Disease Oriented Team ( DOT), if it's a cancer stu dy, or department meeting to discuss the proposal and secure consensus to proceed . The CRM should also ensure that the meeting minutes reflect the discussion and the preliminary plan for moving forward. Feasibility Assessment Complete Ensure the PI has the necessary resources and capabilities to carry out t he proposed protocol (e.g., access to subject population, adequate time, and resources ) There is often a sponsor feasibility checklist that must be completed prior to the study team's feasibility asses sment (sometimes referred to as a questionnaire) . The C RM will complete this assessment with support from the Principal Investigator (PI). Other available resources are available on campus to complete this assessment (see Chapter 11). The most obvious ques tion to be asked during a feasibil ity assessment is: ca n we recruit a sufficient number of patients for the study within a timeframe that i s consistent with the projected funding? Once the feasibility is completed, one person should be responsible as the p oint of contact for any potential follow -up questions in order to prevent unnecessary delays. Site Selection N/A The industry sponsor will determine whether the site meets the qualifications necessary to execute its protocol, based on the information that has been submitted through the feasibility. Occasiona lly, the sponsor may need to physically visit the site (kno wn as a site selection vi sit (SSV), pre -site selection visit (PSSV), or site qualification visit (SQV)) in order to complete their assessment to review study spaces, laboratory facilities, equipmen t, etc. Expect to spend 2 -4 hours of CRM time and approxima tely 30 minutes w/ the PI. Consider discussing and providing a copy of startup fees so that the sponsor is aware of these when considering site selection. This may help avoid delay in approval of fe es. NOTE: If Parkland is a site, confirm drug shipment is available for both sites . Once you are site selected, the study team will receive a formal notification from the sponsor or CRO rg. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 153 of 270 Ensure Confid entia lity Disclosure Agreement (CDA) is in place in order to receive study initiation documentation Ensure the grant/federal submission is complete and routed as appropriate. Ensure the Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement (CDA) has been routed for signat ure as appropriate. The CDA may be required by the spon sor to release study documents to us. NOTE: the site c annot agree to the confidentiality statements often requested in the online feasibility questionnaires. The site must request a CDA. The department 's manager should submit a request for CDAs through eAg reements. The process should not take longer than 1 week. Once the study team has a fully executed CDA in place, then the sponsor should send the following to the site since these items will eventually need to be submitted to the IRB for review . If any are missing, then contact the sponsor: - Protocol - Consent template - Investigational drug brochure (IDB) - Budget template - Contract template - Questionnaires (e.g., Quality -of-Life (QoL) , Activities o f Daily Living (ADL), etc. ) - Central lab or Imagining manual (if available) - Pharmacy manual(s) (if available) Protocol Development/Review / Consult with clinical research services that may be involved in the conduct of study procedure s The Principal Inv estigator is responsible for develop ing the protocol , although s/he may need to consult with other UT Southwestern research resources to assist with sections as needed (e.g., BERD to determine the appropriate power analysis and sample size calculation ). The sponsor will be responsible for developing and review ing their protocol. They may receive assista nce from the PI with drafting some or most of the contents . If so, their in - house scientific team will still sign off on all content before the study team re ceives the finalized version. Regardless of who has developed the protocol , the study team should still familiar ize themselves with the study requirements and make sure that the team has all of the necessary equipment (e.g., 10-lead versus 12-lead EKG ) in place. For instance, if any specialized equipment is ne eded to conduct the study, this is the time that the team should troubl eshoot and prepare for all contingencies. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 154 of 270 Become familiar with the investigational product The PI will s ubmit appropriate applica tions (IND, IDE) to the FDA , if necessary . Once this is done, review and become familiar with the investigational product (see industry - sponsored process for tips) If appropriate, the PI should s ubmit appropriate applications (IND, IDE) to the FDA. Meanwh ile, review and become familiar with the investigationa l product. Although IDS will be responsible for storage, preparation, dispensation, etc., you still need to make sure all of the staff are familiar with the investigational product. For instance, does it need to quickly be administered to the patient , because it is only viable within 30 minutes after reconst itution? If so, then you need to make sure that you have the appropriate staff and resources to manage this (e.g., a dedicat ed staff member will nee d to be in contact with the IDS and get this to th e RN ASAP) . Or is the investigational product a pill, and has a diary that needs to be filled out by the patient? In that situation, m ake su re you are familiar with the log so that y ou can teach the patient how to complete it . Prepa re all of your questions and reach out to the sponsor or CROrg as needed for clarification. Develop an Instruction Manual or Manual of Procedures (MOP) Develop (or review one provided from by a network) a manual to describe how to conduct all study procedures and complete the correspon ding documentation. Any study manuals are t ypically provided by the industry sponsor or CRO rg. Familiarize yourself with the contents and plan a dry run through of al l events that will need to be done during a typical study visit (e.g., if there are vital si gns that need to be taken before, during, and after an infusion, make sure that the room has the appropriat e equipment). Or if there are certain research labs that need to be drawn during the study vis it, make sure you know where to bring the specimens for processing and work with the CLS to relay important information (e.g., a potential delay because the patie nt was late to clinic, etc.). Budget Development and Negotiation This likely will have already occurred during the grant submission process (which t he PI handled prior to the start of this process) . However, if you require additional guidance , reach out to Sponsored Programs Administration (SPA) to assist with all phases of this process. The study sponsor or CRO rg will send you a study budget that they created in house. This should be handed over to your financial staff team member and/or SPA representative . Our representative will then, in turn, review the budget proposal and begin budget n egotiatio ns with the sponsor. As needed, the research team may b e consulted for assistance throughout this process (e.g., to confirm if all potential research charges have been captured in the budget. For this reason, it is important that the team has alre ady revie wed the protocol and manuals to determine what addition al research requirements , beyond standard of care, may be required to conduct the study . Any \"research only\" charges that ha ve not been included in the sponsor's budget should be referred to the sponso r to cover the cost ). NOTE: cove rage analysis will o ccur in tandem with the budget development and negotiations. The study team will initiate this process through VELOS , usually after the study has been submitted through UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 155 of 270 eIRB. For details on th is process, please reach out to SPA. Create and/or review the Laboratory Manual Create a laboratory manual , including processing instructions, related to specimen/sample handling. The laboratory manual is t ypically provided by the industry sponsor or the CRO rg. It will contain all of the information required to collect, pr ocess, store, ship, etc., all research - related specimens and samples needed for the study. This manual may include critical information that impacts on the budget, so make sure to review it thoroughly and relay any differences noted between what is standar d of care and what the sponsor requires. Share this information with the staff responsible for the budget and contract negotiations. Reach out to research resources that may be involved in the conduct of study pro cedures Initiate communication with groups such as the CRU (if necessary) , IDS, and so forth, that may be helpful for conducting your study . (Refer to chapters 2 and 11 for a list of available resources and contact information ) Initiate commun ication with groups such as the CRU (if necessary) , IDS, and so forth to discuss the logistics of conducting the study and make sure that they are pre pared to support the study team, as needed per protocol. Refer to chapters 2 and 11 to review the departme nts, offices, and teams at UT Southwestern that are prepared to support your team conduct the clinical research study. Outline what parties are responsible for managing what aspects of the protocol, and make sure ev eryone has the con tact list for all other team members in case they need to be reached . If any p otential problems are identified, work with these departments t o create solutio ns and workarounds. Route Contract/Agreement through eAgreements Ensure the grant/federal funding related documentation is complete and routed as appropriate. Reach out to SPA for guidance . Ensure the Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA), or contract, has routed for signature as appropriate. This would have been initiated throu gh the eAgreements portal. By default, most users hav e standard access to eAgreements. For access to the web site, go to eAgreemen ts - IR Products and Services (utsouthwestern.net) . SPA can provide support throughout this process. Draft the Informed Consent Form Refer to the UT Southwestern Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) website and use the applicable template(s) : Human Research Protection Program The industry sponsor or CRO rg representative will usually provide the st udy team with their own informed consent document util izing their own template. If they have not provided o ne yet, request one ASAP. Although it's not required at UT Southwestern, the best practice is to utilize the HRPP's informed consent document template , which contains all of the FDA -required elements of consent and incorporate the sponsor's language into o ur local template. This way, the informed consent document already UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 156 of 270 (HRPP): UT Southwest ern, Dallas, Texas includes any required site -specific language. Then you can w ork with the industry o r CROrg representative to include the ir suggested langu age into the template . Develop study data collection forms (visit/procedure checklists, worksheets, source documents, CRFs, etc.) and/or study database Develop the study data collection forms and/or database to collect the necessary data in a consistent a nd analyzable manner (e.g., CRFs, Excel, REDCap) Any data collection forms are t ypically provided by the industr y sponsor or CRO rg, usually in an electroni c format using one of the major CRF platforms (e.g., Medidata RAVE, Medrio, Oracle InForm) . These platf orms are the databases that will also store all of the information from the study site(s) for the sponsor to rev iew. The sponsor or CROrg will work with th e study team to determine who all needs access and then schedule the appropriate training, as needed. T his training will be done independently by the study team members. Prepare and/or review Recruitment Materials Develop a recruitment plan that is appropriate for your subject population and prepare recruitment materials. If the assets contain the UT South western brand and/or logo, these also must be reviewe d by CMPA to ensure that they meet the branding requirement s. Develop a recruitment plan that is appropriate for your subject population . If necessary, reach out for assistance from one of the research r esources listed in chapters 2 and 11. P repare to subm it any recruitment materials provided from the sponsor/CRO rg to the IRB for review and appr oval. Any patient -facing documents utilized to recruit patients must be submitted to the IRB for review to make su re that they do not contain language that is coercive or unduly influences subjects to participate. IRB Initial Application Submission All studies initiate in VELOS. From VELOS the study will be pushed to eIRB in \"Draft\" format. Finish the Initial IRB application (typically eIRB) using the electronic IRB software system (eIRB). Studies that will be routed to a central IRB, i.e., CIRB, WIRB, must first be Create the study in VELOS. Once completed, VELOS will push the study to eIRB in \"Draft\" format. Finish the Initial IRB a pplication (eIRB) using the electronic IRB so ftware system (eIRB). Studies that will be routed to a central IRB, i.e., CIRB, WIRB, must first be submitted using th e UTSW process. The IRB will need to review the protocol, consent form, and recruitment mater ials, at minimum. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 157 of 270 submitted using the UTSW process. Scientific/ancillary commi ttee review (i f applicable) If any scientific/ancillary committee review is required for the study (e.g., the study needs SHUR to review research -related radiation, PRMC to review cancer - related studies), then t heir review will occur in parallel to the reg ulatory review by the IRB. Respond to any queries/stipulations ASAP. If any additional scientific/ancillary committees are required to review any element of the submission (e.g., SHUR to review research required radiation, PRMC to review cancer -related studies), then th eir review will occur in parallel to the IRB. Scientifi c ancillary reviews and their final approval are required prior to the study receiving final approval and Investigator Relations Team (IRT) ac tivation. For instance, if the ancillary review has occurre d, but the study still has not satisfactorily addressed all conditions/stipulations released by the scie ntific committee first, then the IRT will not activate the study. Do not delay; address all s tipulations/conditions ASAP to prevent any unnecessary dela ys to activate the study. Initiate the ClinicalTrials.gov registration as applicable All necessary info rmation must be submitted by the Responsible Party, which may be the PI if the study is investigator initiated. Reach out to the RSO for guidance. Any delays may create fines and/or inability to publish the data. Typically, the industry sponsor is the Responsible Pa rty for an industry study . In rare cases, this may be the res ponsibility of the PI if s/he is the IND holder, for instance. For any questions regarding this process, reach out to the Regulatory Support Office (RSO) for guidance: Regulator y Support: Human Rese arch Protection Program (HRP -) - UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX Create the Regul atory Binder ( e.g., essential documents such as the DOA/Signature log, Training log, etc.) Develop the essential documents and create the Regulatory Files/B inder to organize the documentation currently available. Use Florence for newer studies. Typically, the industry sponsor or CRO rg will supply the study site with the essential documents needed to for the site's regulatory binder. However, if any are missing, first reach out to them for a template. If they do not have one available, then contact the Clinica l Research Office for the most recent templates available. File this information in the study 's regulatory binder (either hard copy or virtual, usually mana ged by the sponsor/CRO rg). This information will need to be filled out and reviewed by the time that t he study receives permission to start actively recruiting (usual ly during the Site UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 158 of 270 Initiation Visit (SIV)), so make sure that the documents are in order. IRB Approval Include a copy of the IRB approval letter in your regulatory files (paper), or upload to the Florence system (if a newer study) Once your study has received final IRB approval, send a PDF copy of the IRB approval letter to the industry sponsor or CRO rg. These are generated by the system once all stipulations and findings from the IRB and any ot her scientific ancillary committees have been satisfactorily addressed (e.g., SHUR, PRMC). If there are any other approvals required, such as from budget, c ontracts, etc., these must be addressed before the study team can receive the final Activation notic e by IRT. Please note: Approval is DIFFERENT from Activation . Approval indicates that all reg ulatory requirements have been met. Activation means that the s tudy is ready to start enrolling subjects since the budget, contract, etc., have now also been final ized. Two weeks prior to SIV N/A Two weeks in advance of the SIV provide coordinators with a protocol packet to include protocol, fast facts, CRFs , and any other documentation required . A copy of the IRB approved consent form may be included, but the current version should be downloaded in real time when the study team is ready to consent a patie nt. Also: Ensure all study supplies were delivered (SCCC and PHHS) Ensure receipt of study drug. - If study drug has not yet been shipped, obtain a projected date of arrival from the sponsor/CRO rg. Work with the IDS regarding any potential delays - NOTE : the s ponsor may hold the release of investigational drug unti l the first patient is consented; however, every effort should be made to ensure that the drug can b e expedited at that time to ensure availability for subject treatment Site Initiation Visit (SIV) Conduct a team meeting to review the protocol and related procedural details. If not already done, make sure to document all training on the DoA log as well as separate training log, if The SIV is typically conducted by the industry spons or/CRO rg once all approvals have been secured . If the sponsor/CRO wants to conduct th e SIV before the study has all approvals (e.g., the study has IRB approval but h as not received final activation) that is fine, but they need to understand that the team wil l not be able to enroll any subjects until activation is in pla ce. At the SIV the s ponsor/CRO rg will also conduct any last- minute training, review the essential docu ments to ensure that they are in place, etc. This SIV may be done virtually or in person and last anywhere from 30 minutes to a few UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 159 of 270 applicable. hours. Work with the spo nsor/CRO rg to make sur e that you have a clear agenda of the topics to be discussed as well as a list o f all personnel that are required to attend. Open study to accrual Complete necessary steps to open the study to accrual. This may be completed using the current trial management software Complete necessary steps to open the study to accrual. This may be done using the current clinical trial management software. Subject Recruitment / Enrollment After the study is Activated in eIRB , the study is ready to begin recruiting and enrolling subjects. After the study is Activated in eIRB , the study is ready to be gin recruiting and enrolling subjects. NOTE: recruiting subjects may entail reviewing subject medical records, to determine eligibility. You may not engage in this research activity until the study has been \"Activated\" in the system. TIP: The CRM should s end an open to accrual notification to the DOT team once the study is open to enrollment. Thi s notification should include STU#, Study title, PI, primary co ordinator contact information, sites that are open (SCCC/PHHS/ Ft. Worth), and basic I/E criteria. M eanwhile, the CRM should also: prepare and document additional training of staff as needed. T his may include other department staff, physicians, research st aff, clinic staff, inpatient staff, etc. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 160 of 270 Chapter 7: Informed Consent Process Much of the informat ion presented in this chapter was taken directly from the DRAFT Guidance for IRBs, Clinical I nvestigators and Sponsors: Informed Consent Information Sheet (http://www.fda.gov /RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm404975.htm ) and the Office for Human Research Protection s (OHRP) Tips on Informed Consent: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/ictips.html . A. What is Informed Consent? Informed consent is one of the primary ethical considerations in research involving human subjects. The Belmont Report : Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research describes the purpose of informed consent as the me chanism to ensure that participants understand the research study and voluntarily agree to participate. A copy of the Belmont Report may be found at the followi ng site: ( http://ww w.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.html ). Informed c onsent is more than just a form, and more than a signature on a form . It is a process of information exchange designed to: 1) provide the subject with all the information that he/she would reaso nably want abo ut a study to make an informed choice. 2) ensure that the subject understands the information presented. 3) discuss the individual's rights as a research subject; and 4) give the subject an opportunity to ask questions and volunteer to participate in the study. The informed consent process is one of the key mechan isms for ensuring that the rights, welfare, and safety of research subjects are protected. Just like protecting the rights, welfare and safety of human subjects is a continuous process, infor med consent is an ongoing process and is not intended to be a one-time occurrence, but rather an ongoing process throughout the conduct of th e study . The informed consent process is the application of one of the principles of the Belmont Report, Respect for Persons . According to the Belmont Report, \"Respect for persons requires that subjects, to the degree that they are capable, be given the o pportunity to choose what shall or shall not happen to them. This opportunity is provided when adequate standards f or informed consent are satisfied.\" The Belmont Report, Part C. Applications , outlines three fundamental aspects of the informed consent pro cess: UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 161 of 270 Information The Informed consent document is intended to include information necessary to inform research subjects about the purpose, risks, potential benefits, and alternat ives to the research. This information should allow people to decide about whether or not to participate based on their own goals and values. The exchange of such information during informed consent should occur both at enrollment and throughout the study. Refer to the 8 Elements of Informed Consent (45 CFR 46.116(a) ) for more information. The information must be pr ovided in such a way that it prov ides a reasonable person wit h the information she or he would need to make an informed decision. Comprehension Investigators are responsible for providing in formation during the informed consent process in a manner that ca n be comprehended by p otential participants. Addit ional procedures may need to be in place for subject who do not fluently speak English or have a low literacy level. Investigators should not enroll anyone in a study unless the investigator is confident th at the individual comprehends all information disc losed and agrees to procedures described during the informed consent process. Voluntariness Potential participants must understand that enro lling in the research is voluntary and that they may withdraw fro m the s tudy at any time without penalty or loss of benefits ( 45 CFR 46.116(a) ). Individuals' decisions about par ticipation in research should not be influenced by anyone involved in conducting the research: \"...consent must be freely given or truly voluntary.\" [Respect for Persons, p 3 Informed Consent . Emanuel, EJ et al., eds. 2003. Ethical and Regulatory Aspects o f Clinical Research: Readings and Commentary. Balt imore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press, p.189.] For participation in research to be voluntary, there must be no coercion and undue influence . UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 162 of 270 A note about Undue Influence and Coercion The Belmont Report states that undue influence occurs , \"through the offer of inducements ,\" which create, \"exces sive, unwarranted, inappropriate or improper reward or other overtu re in order to obtain compliance\" (National Comm ission, 1978, p.8). It also argues that , \"Persons in positions of auth ority ... urge a course of action f or a subject.\" This includes manipulating a prospective subject's choice by utilizing the \"influence of a close re lative.\" Undue influence needs to be distinguished from coercion for the purposes of UT Southwestern IRB app lications of policy. Coercion is considered the use of a threat of harm or punishment to influence b ehavior . For example, a PI is using coercion if s/he informs a subject that they will lose access to needed health services if they don't participate in a research study. NOTE: in general, payments do not constitute coercion. Other less apparent , but equ ally important, examples of vulnerability includ e Institutional vulnerability to undue influence and Deferential vulnerability to undue influence. Institutional vulnerability is when an ind ividual is subject to the formal authority of others , which could unduly influence the subject's willingness to pa rticipate. Examples of institutional vulnerability include prisoners, military personnel, students, and employees of the university . Deferenti al vulnerability is similar to institutional , but arises from infor mal re lationships characterized by inequities in social status ( e.g., gender, race, class) , power UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 163 of 270 (e.g., students taking a medical class as part of their curriculum, and then given a resear ch survey by their instructor who is also the PI of the study) , knowledge ( e.g., doctor -patient relationship), or c ognitive ability ( e.g., elderly person defer to adult kids). In all these situations and beyond, the staff should maintain a h eightened conce rn that subject's decision re garding participation in the study may not be truly voluntary. Deferential vulnerabili ty can be very subtle , and as such investigators must be especially sensitive to the potential that subjects may believe that refusing to par ticipate in a stud y will negative ly impact their future treatmen t options (if a patient), class standing (if a stud ent), performance evaluation (if an employee), etc . Investigators need to be sensitive to such deference and assess whether the subject is tr uly exercising his/her autonomy and adjust the informed consent process accordingly . In those situations, a suggest ed alteration to the usual consent process might include discussing study participation in the absence of the individual to whom the potentia l subject ordinarily defers . However, this may not always be feasib le, since the PI or investigator with the existi ng working relationship with the patient may be the best person to discuss the study and answer questions ; in those situations, it would not be appropriate to bypass them altogether . For additional informati on about informed consent as well as other relat ed topics, please refer to the HRPP Policy and Procedures guidance page : HRPP Policies and Procedures: Human Research Protection Program (H RPP) - UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX . B. Who Shou ld Conduct the Informed Consent Process? The PI is legally responsible and ethically obligated to ensure an adequate informed consent process and written informed consent is obtained from each research subject before participating in the research study, ev en when delegating the task. The intent of the regulations is to ensure that the person best equipped to answer the prospective subject's que stions is present during the consent discussion. Typically, this mean s the PI . However, the PI may delegate this task to another member of the study team , depending on the complexity of the study, urgency of the medical condition, and involvement of vulner able populations. These are questions that are important to conside r when developing and submitting the protocol to the IRB for review. It may not be necessary for the PI to personally conduct the entire consent process, but if the study involves medical t reatment, a clinical investigator must be available to answer medical , medication, or device questions that are most appropriately answer by a physician. IRBs , PIs, and research sponsors all share responsibility for determining if the informed consent pro cess is appropriate. The IRB application includes a description of th e planned consent process as well as who the PI has delegated to conduct the informed conse nt process. This includes information such as the timing of obtaining informed consent and of an y potential waiting period between informing the subject UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 164 of 270 about the st udy and obtaining the consent. The PI is re sponsible for ensuring informed consent is obtai ned in an adequate manner. It is critical that the research team member obtaining informed conse nt has been appropriately trained and the task has been delegated to them by the PI. This should be documented i n the training log as well as the DOA log. Prior to approaching subjects to discuss their participation in a research study , please consider th e following: Make certain to know the protocol and what is the purpos e of approaching the subject to this specific study . Even if you are not able to thoroughly read the protocol from beginning to end, be familiar enough with the study parameters and the s tudy schedule so that you can easily answer any questions . Tip: the s tudy sch ema and Schedule of Assessments/Events provide important information in an easy -to-understand format! Make certain to review the consent form before presenting it to a subject so that you present it to the subject in a way that conveys a cle ar unde rstanding of the study. Tip: the consent form is another way to quickly grasp the most important elements of the study , including the purpose and requirements , before approaching the subj ect. A quick comment: we recognize that although you may have been tr ained in the protocol in the past and this training was documented, some time may have elapsed since that initial training period . Some studies are so challenging to find patients that it may be months between study activation (and when the training initially occurred) and the first subject enrollment, for instance. In the meantime, you've been busy working o n enrolling subjects to other studies, managing your portfolio of study assignment s, and the important details about a protocol's specific study design may have been forgotten. These tips are being offered to help you quickly get up to speed again. Select an appropriate location to discuss the study . Respect the privacy of the potential participant by choosing a setting that is not open to the pub lic. Th ere should always be time set aside so a private, confidential, and safe setting is afforded to facilitate a constructive dialog ue between the prospective subject and the person(s) involv ed in obtaining informed consent. A physician's office, a cons ultatio n room, or a clinic exam room would be examples of appropriate locations to meet with the subject. On the other hand, a crowded patient waiting room, busy cafeteria, or pre -operative area would be examples of locations that may not be conducive t o conducti ng the informed consent process since your conversation with the subject could be heard by o thers . Ensure enough time has bee n set aside to review the study and the consent form in detail . Approaching prospective subjects on the same day that the research procedure s would UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 165 of 270 need to take place , if they agree to participate, may not provide sufficient time. Participants may need time to think about their decision or to discuss their potential involvement with family, friends, primary care physicians, social wor kers, clergy, a pat ient representative, or other trusted advisors. In the end , all discussions with prospective participants should take place w ith sufficient time for them to carefully consider his or her participation without undue pressure . It can be ve ry difficult to absorb study details in one sitting, especially at a time of emotional distress (e.g., after receiving an initial cancer diagnos is). Whenever possible, subjects should be given the option of taking a copy of the document home so they can review it in their own time to consider whether they want to participate in the future . For the best results, participants shou ld be approached when they are willing to listen and are open and ready to consider the implications of this significant discussion . C. How Should Informed Consent be Obtained? It is important to distinguish between the informed consent document an d the informed consent process. While the informed consent document itse lf is important and is required to contain specific elements and lang uage, \"the procedures used in obtaining informed consent should be designed to educate the subject population in te rms that they can understand\" ( OHRP Ti ps on Informed Consent ). Think of the document as a teaching tool that can be used to guide the informed consent process, reviewing each of the required elements in the docu ment. Clinical research coordinators should act as advocates for study participan ts and ensure that all subjects fully understand the study before agreeing to consent . This involves more than a brief overview of what the study will involve. When speaking to particip ants, remind them that the consent form contains all the information un der discussion and can serve as a reference whenever needed. During the consenting process, each of the required elements of informed consent should be discussed with the sub ject. The required elements of Informed Consent are described below. NOTE: at UT Southwestern, the IRB has already incorporated all these required elements into the Informed Co nsent Form (ICF) template. Additional federal elements may be required, depending on the s tudy's design. Moreover, UT Southwestern has adopted additional element s, all of which are incorporated into the informed consent form template. The IRB can make the final determin ation whethe r any additional elements are necessary. If you believe that you need to delete any of these required sections from your study's ICF , please consult with the IRB first before attempting to make those changes. Required elements of Informed Consent : Explai n that the study involves research UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 166 of 270 Describe the purpose of the r esearch study Describe the duration of the 'subject's participation Explain the procedures to be followed o Review specifics of what participation will involve. DO NOT under estimate the ir time commitment. o Describe: Number of visits (including whether any wil l be done at home, over the phone, etc.) Tests that will be performed, including blood draws and laboratory tests (including any fasting blood draws). This area should thoroughly explain what is required and what may be optional Time commitments. It may be helpful to provide a schedule of visits Data that will be collected fr om procedures that will be done as part of the subject's routine clinical care o If reimbu rsement f or time or travel is provided, it must not be coercive in amount or method of distributi on. The consent form must describe the reimbursement mount and the meth ods and requirements for receiving ( e.g., compensation for each visit completed OR mileage reim bursement to and from the subject's home to the research clinic). If compensation is provi ded to minor subjects, describe who the compensation will be provided t o and how it will be given (e.g., XXX provided to the child by a YYY gift card and XXX amount provided to the parents by a ZZZ gift card for each completed research visit). For addition al guidance on HRPP's rul es regarding compensation, please refer to Policy 4.1 Identification and Recruitment of Participants Identify any procedures that could be considered experimental Explain any rea sonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject. This includes: o Inform ing the subjects of the reasonably forese eable harms, discomforts, inconvenience s, and risks that are associated with the research activities in the study o Using understandable AE terminology or definitions for technical terms Explain the implications o f AEs that may not be familiar . For insta nce, if a study drug may produce a side effect that they have never heard of, explain what this AE will look like if it manifests, the importance of sharing all events w ith the study team, etc. o Convey ing the likelihood of side effects. Terms such as \"like ly,\" or \"uncommon\" aren't helpful by themselves. Instead, use the consent form to help you explain the statistical proba bility of an event occurring. The UT Southwestern consent form template contains UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 167 of 270 language that explains these probabilities in layman's terms, such as, \"in 1 out of 10 subjects...\" o Describ ing any treatments or procedures that may involve risks to the subject (or to the embryo or fetus) if the subject is or may become pregnant . If it is unknown, this should also be described. The subject sh ould also be made aware if there may be unforeseeable risks associated with study participation Descr ibe any benefits to the subject , or to others , which may reasonably be expected from the research. If the subject may not experience direct benefit, but r ather the only benefit may be helping the public at large (also referred to as altruism) , this should also be disclosed Disclose all appropriate alternative procedures or co urses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. This may in clude a description of the standard, routine clinica l care procedures and approved medications that are currently available to address the condition or disease Describe how t he confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained. o The OHRP Tips for Informed Consent further recommends describing those who will receive the results of the rese arch, including if subjects will receive the results of any research pr ocedures. The regulations insist that the subjects be told of the extent to which their personally identifiable private information will be held in confidence. For example, some studies require disclosure of information to other parties. o Some studies inher ently need an NIH Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects/coc.htm ), which protects the investigator from involuntary release (i.e., under subpoe na, which is a court order compelling someone to give testimony of the n ames or other identifying characteristics of research subjects ). If the study has this in place, this should be s hared with the subject so that they will be aware that their identifiab le and sensitive information collected for the purposes of the study cannot be disclosed Describe the compensation available if research -related injury (i.e., physical, psychological, social, financial, or otherwise) occurs and whether any medical treatmen ts are available, what they consist of, and where additional informatio n may be obtained. o Refer to the UTSW HRPP policy regarding language guidelines to describe compensation and resear ch-related injury lang uage : Policy 3.1 Informed Consent Requirements. Describe and show the subjects where in the consent form they can find contact information if they have questions about the research and research subje cts' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research -related injury to the subject. o According to the OHRP Tips in Informed Consent, the regulation s require the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 168 of 270 identification of contact persons who would be knowledgeable to answer questions of subjects about the re search, rights as a research subject, and research -related injuries. These three areas must be explicitly stated and addressed in the con sent process and documentation. o A single person is not likely to be appropriate to answer questions in all areas. Quest ions about the research study and related procedures may be best answered by the investigator(s). However, questions about the rights of research subjects or research - related injuries ( where applicable) may best be referred to those not on the research team. At UT Southwestern , these questions should be referred to UTSW Human Research Protection Program Office at 214-648-3060 Clearly expla in that participation is voluntary. It must be ma de clear to subjects that they can choose not to participate or choose to participate and later withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled o Taken from the Consent Form Templates that can be found on t he HRPP website , UT Southwestern standard langua ge is \" You do not have to participate if you 'don't want to. You may also leave the study at any time. If you decide to stop taking part in this resear ch study, it will not affect your relationship with the UT Southwestern staff or doctors. Whether you participate or not will have no effect on your legal rights or the quality of your health care. If you are a medical student, fellow, faculty, or staff a t the Medical Center, your status will not be affected in any way .\" o If there are procedures that still must be conducted (e.g., for safety reasons) if a subject chooses to withdraw, these should also be discussed Explain any anticipated circumstances unde r which the subject's participation may be terminated by the investigator without regard to the subject's consent must be expla ined. Describe any additional costs to the subject that may result from participation in the research o Review w ho will cover the costs of the research study procedures.

Include the approximate number of subjects involved in the study HIPAA Authorization Form In addition to the informed consent document, th ere are elements in the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization form that mus t be reviewed with the subject. The HIPAA Privacy Rule defines how heal th care providers, staff, trainees , and students in clinical training pr ograms can use, disclose, and maintain identifiable patient information, called Protected Health Information (PHI). The health information privacy requirements went into effect for the use of PHI for research on April 14, 2003, requiring researchers to obt ain writ ten authorization from research participants before using or disclosing participant PHI for research purp oses. PHI is health information or health care payment information tha t identifies, or can be used to identify, an individual patient. The privacy rule very broadly defines identifiers to include, not only patient name, address, and social security number , but also fax numbers, email addresses, vehicle identifiers, URLs, photographs, and voices or images on tape or electronic media. When in d oubt, assume that any individual health information is protected under the privacy rule. In some cases, the HIPAA e lements are embedded in the informed consent document, making it a comb ined informed consent/HIPAA authorization form. In other cases, the H IPAA authorization form is a separate document. Regardless, HIPAA elements must also be discussed with the potential subjects. Describe : How the subject's health information will be used for research What information will be used for research Who will use the subject's health information for research How long the subject's permission will last That the subject's permiss ion is voluntary How health information will be protected For more inf ormation, visit . Prior to Signing the In formed Consent/HIPAA Authorization Form After the potential subject has had ample time to review the consent form and ask questions, assess the subject's comprehension about the materia l present ed, including the nature of the study and voluntary participat ion. This can be done during the informed consent discussions, at the e nd of the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 170 of 270 process or both. This assessment may be done by asking open -ended questions that begin with words such as q uestions provide a platform for the subjects to respond spontaneous ly and encourages them to provide a detailed answer. Subjects should not be asked closed -ended questions that allow si mple \"Yes\" or \"No\" answers since these tend to restrict the flow of the conversation . The teach -back method is an effec tive tool to assess understanding. The person leading the consent process can ask the subject how they would explain the study to their relatives or friends. The interaction should be presented as an assessm ent of how well the person leading the consent discussion explained the study, not as a test for the subject. Areas that the subject did not unders tand are further addressed , such as wi th the use of open -ended questions, and discussed with the subject. A few poten tial open -ended questions include : \"Please describe in your own words the purpose of the study ?\" NOT: \"Do you understand the purpose of this study? \" \"What more would you like to know? \" NOT: \"Do you need any more information? \" \"What are your concern s?\" NOT: \"Do you hav e any concerns? \" \"Please explain to me what we're going to ask you to do?\" \"What are the risks you may experience? \" An open -ended questionnaire type assessment allo ws the researcher to get immediate and direct feedback about what the s ubject recalls from the consent process as well as what information may still need to be clarified . An informed consent assessment is not meant to be a pass/fail quiz, but rather a tool for identifying gaps i n the pers on's understanding of the study and wh at areas may require more discussion. If the subject doesn't seem to understand key points after repeated discussion, there may be other concerns and potential reasons to not enroll the subject. In those latter situati ons, reach out to your Principal Inves tigator for guidance . To help subjects understand the information presented and so they have something to easily refer to later, they may be provided with additional IRB -approved patie nt-facing educational materials , such as brochures about research in ge neral and/or about the specific procedures used in the study for later reference. Signing the Informed Consent/HIPAA Authorization Form When all the subject's questions have been answe red and they have ade quate information to make an informed decision to participate in the study: The subject and/or LAR (legally authorized representative or guardian ; if applicable to the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 171 of 270 situation/study design ), and researcher obtaining consent must sign and date each consent form if there is more than one. Note: the federa l regulations do not explicitly require a signature/date of the person obtaining informed consent. However, a signature/date of the person obtaining informed consent is considered best practice and expected per ICH GCP . Moreover, this is the standard adopt ed at UT Southwestern (See HRPP Policy 3.1 Informed Consent Requirement s) The subject must also sign and d ate the HIPAA authorization form, if the HIPAA authorization form is a separate document and not combined with the consent form. NOTE: At UT Southwestern all studies initiated after 2019 are utilizing a combined informed consent and HIPAA form NOTE: it is unacceptable to sign the ICF in advance of the consent proce ss. The researcher obtaining consent may not sign prior to obtainin g the subject's signatures. Be aware of the timing of events. When indicating the time that the ICF was signed, make sure that on ly AM or PM is clearly marked , not both or missing altogethe r. A considerable time lag between the time that the subject signs the consent and the researcher cosigns will raise questions. Do not back date or back time anything. If a true time lag occurred, clearly document in your research note why this delay occur red (more on Documentation of Informed Consents is reviewed later in this chapter) Follow the instructions as required for all sections of the ICF . If an area does not apply, mark it a s N/A. Any blanks may appear that you forgot to review that section. If you make any errors while filling out the consent , strike through the mistake with one line and initial and date the error . If the subject made an error, instruct them on how to prope rly fix it. Do not assume that they understand that th ey need to initia l and date their mistake. The subject must receive a copy of the consent and HIPAA Authorization form(s). FDA regulations do not require the subject's copy to be a signed copy, although a photocopy with signature(s) is preferred so there is never any conce rn about which version was signed. If the subject is accidentally permitted to leave the premises without their copy, immediately contact them and not ify them about this oversight, make arrangements to provide them a copy ASAP , such as mailing a copy to th em (if they have already left and do not plan to return to campus within the next day or so ). Record this conversation in the subject's research record, then arrange to send a copy of the consent form via certified US mail. The research team must verify t hat there have been no alterations to the consent form document itself before it is signed. The following is an example of a consent form with several mistakes. For your convenience th e issues that were noted have been marked in red. See if you can identi fy the issues without referencing the answers: UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 172 of 270 Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) Obtaining legally effective informed consent of individuals before involving them in research is one of the central protections provided in the re gulations governin g research. Informed consent in research is founded on the Belmont Principle 's \"respect for p ersons .\" When the prospective research subject is a child or an adult w hose own consent would not be legally effective because they lack the capacity to comprehend and give or communicate thei r informed consent, then research may be conducted only with t he consent of the potential subject's parent, guardian or legally authori zed representative (the \"LAR\") , which is also known as \"surrogate consent.\" For more information regarding HRPP 's policy on LARs , including situations where the UTSW IRB may waive th e requirement for obtaining surrogate consent (from a parent, legal guard ian, or LAR) , please review HRPP Policy 3.2 Informed Consent by Surrogate (Parents or Legally Authorized Representatives) . UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 173 of 270 Use of a Short Form and Study Summary The informed consent documentation requirements [ 21 CFR 50.27 , 45 CFR 46.116 , and 45 CFR 46.117 ] permit the use of either a written consent document that embodies the elements of informed consent or a short form stating that the elements of informed consent have been presented orally to the subject. When this meth od is used, there should be a witness to the oral presentation. The following are the signature requirements for the short form, per HRPP Policy 3.4 Informed Consent o f Subjects with Limited Engl ish Proficiency : 1) Short Form (in participa nt's language): a) Signature of participant or legally authorized representative (required by OHRP/FDA) b) Signature of witness (required by OHRP /FDA) 2) English Informed Consent D ocument or summary: a) Signature of person obtaining consent (OHRP) b) Signature of witness (required by OHRP/FDA) A copy of the summary is given to the subject or th e representative (e.g., subject's LAR) in addition to a copy of the short form. Docum entation of Informed Consent/HIPAA Authorization A signature on an inform ed consent/HIPAA authorization form alone is not considered sufficient documentation to demonstr ate that subjects were given enough time to consider participation, received answers to any questions they might have, and were given a copy of the informed con sent document. The informed consent process must be documented somewhere in a place that is sepa rate from the informed consent form . This documenta tion can be done in the research cha rt (e.g., in a progress note in the resear ch chart using an informed cons ent process source document ), a study visit note, and/or in the MyChart electronic medica l record. If consent is obtained the same day that the s ubject's involvement in the study begi ns, it is essential to document the time t hat the consent was obtained to demonstrate that study specific procedures are performed only after obtaining the subject's consent . Remember: if it isn't documented, it didn't happen! The consent form shows that consent was obtained, but documentation tells the story of the process. Storage of the Signed Informed Consent/HIPAA Authorization Form Do cuments The original signed consent document must be retained in the study records. The original signed consent forms can be kept in the subject's research chart or in a binder intended sol ely for storage of original signed consent documents. If the univer sity has adopted an alternate method of storing signed consent UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 174 of 270 forms (e.g., uploading to a secure server) , then work with your ad ministrator to follow whatever are the current guidelines. D. Ongoing Process Obtaining informed consent is an ongoing process. Study staff should regularly consult with subjects throughout their participation in the study to ask if they have any questions , especially when they are required to perform or participate in new activities per the protocol, and if they wish to continue their participation on the study . E. Challenges with the Informed Consent Process The following sections will review situations and populations that may impact a person's ability to engaged in the informed consent process fully (i.e., without chall enges), such as prisoners, persons with diminished autonomy (i.e., decisionally/cognitively impaired), etc. All the following are considered potential ly vulnerable subjects in clinical resea rch: Federal regulations give special consideration to protect ing rights and welfare of certain groups of vulnerable subjects. However, investigators must also consider other individuals or groups as vulnerable, such as those who are economically or educationall y disadvantaged, minorities, the very sick, students, and so forth. Institutional policies are in place that outline the safeguards for these groups : HRPP Policies and Procedures: Human R esearch Dallas, TX . UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 175 of 270 Additional considerations come into p lay when recruiting subjects who are illiterate, have limited reading skills, or do not fluently speak English. This may mean adjusting the reading leve ls of documents provided or translating docum ents and presentations into the language with which partici pants are most comfortable and/or their language of learning . Non-English -Speaking Subjects Non-English -speaking subjects must be provided with an IRB approved consent document translated into their language and the informed consent process must also be delivered in a language that is understandable to the subject. ( 45 CFR 46.116 ). The informed consent process require s a translator to interpret for the person obtaining informed consent in cluding translating any questions the subject may have and their answers. UT Southwestern's UHRI 05 Services to Persons with Limited English Proficiency o r Sensory Impairment (Interpreter) - Hospital Policy , which applies to all individuals working in William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital and the Hospital -Based Clinics , states, \" A qualified interprete r must be used for all informed consents for treatment and procedures .\" For various reasons, a subject may want to use a f amily member rather than the hospital's q ualified interpreter . However, concerns for using a f amily member for translation services include but are not limited to: Inadequate unde rstanding of medical terms and research May not translate verbatim Not unbias ed May not share all information (both directions) May be cul turally/socially inappropriate While a translator will assuredly assist in facilitating conversation with a non -Engli sh-speaking subject, oral translation of the consent document should not be s ubstituted for a written translation. When the study subject population include s non -English -speaking people or the clinical investigator or the IRB anticipates that the consent i nterviews will be conducted in a language other than English, the IRB will require preparation of a translated consent document and assurance as to the acc uracy of the translation. Non -English -speaking subjects must also receive a copy of the informed cons ent document in a language they can understand. If a non -English -speaking su bject is encountered unexpectedly, investigators may use a sh ort form consent document in the language preferred by the subject. The short form is only allowed for use with up to three subject s; after that, then a fully translated consent document must be used. Investigators should carefully consider the ethical /legal ramifications of enrolling subjects when a language barrier exists. If the subject does not clearly understand the information presented, the subject's consent will not truly be informed and m ay not be legally effective. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 176 of 270 Refer to the HRPP website f or guidance on the consent process for Non -English or Limited English - speaking research participants: (HRPP P olicy 3.4 Informed Consent of Subjects wi th Limited English Proficiency ) UTSW HRPP Guidance on Enrolling and Consenting Non -English Speak ing Subjects Illiterate English -Speaking Subjects A person who speaks and understands English, but does not read and write, ca n be enrolled in a study by \"making their mark\" on the consent document . Texas law allows someone to sign by a mark, either an x or some other mark. The r eason could be because of Illiteracy, personal choice, or disability . A person who can understand and comprehend spoken English, but is physically una ble to talk or write, can be entered into a study if they are competent and abl e to indicate approval or disapproval by other means. If the person (1) retains the ability to understand the concepts of the study and evaluate the risk and benefit of being in the study when it is explained verbally (still competent) , and, (2) is able to indicate appro val or disapproval to study entry, they may be entered into the study. The consent form should document the method used for communication with the prospective sub ject and the specific means by which the prospective subject communicated agree ment to partici pate in the study. An impartial third party sh ould witness the entire consent process and sign the consent document. A video tape recording of the consent intervi ew is recommended but is not required . The HRPP has prepared guidance within t heir Informed Consent Policy ( HRPP Policy 3.1 Informed Consent Requirements ) that speci fically addresses how to consent illiterate subjects. Please refer to this policy for additional information or reach out to the HRPP at HRPP@UTSouthwestern.edu or by calling the office at 214 -648-3060 . Subjects with Diminished Autonomy (Decisionally/Cog nitively Impaired) The first ethic al principle in the Belmont Report, Respect for Persons , is made up of two important , yet distinct , requirements. The first is the recognition that people are autonomous and e ntitled to their own opinions and choices unless those opinions an d choices are d eemed harmful to others. The second is the recognition that due to various reasons, not all people are capable of self-determination and instead require protection for their o wn welfare . Autonomy demands that the ability of competent subjects to make the ir own decisi ons be recognized and respected, while also protecting the autonomy of the vulnerable by preventing the imposition of unwanted decisions. However, an individual's autonomy can be affected by factors including age, UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 177 of 270 cognitive impairment, illness , and treatments , among others . With this in mind, an individual's capacity to conse nt to a particu lar study should be assessed based on: The individual's level of capacity The complexity and risks of the study (i.e., the capacity needed for an individua l to be able to understand the study well enough to consent to participate ), and, The Belmont princ iple of respect for persons states that investigators need to make special provisions when including individuals in research who have diminished capacity for making decisions in their own best interests An important distinction should be made about capac ity. Capacity is a functional assessment and can vary over time (i.e., it is not static). Capacity to consent means a person has sufficient mental capacity to understand the information provided, to appreciate how it is relevant to their circumstances, and to make an a utonom ous decision about participation in the study. Determina tions of capacity can only be performed by a licensed clinician who is familiar w ith the patient. If you have any questions about an individ ual's level of capacity, please reach o ut to your Pr incipal Investigator or one of the clinical Co -Investigators on the study. DHHS regulations require that a Legally Authorized Representative (LA R) provide voluntary informed consent for individuals with diminished capacity to parti cipate in research ( 45 CFR 46.116 ). While DHHS regulations allow for LAR to make substituted decisions for indi viduals who need assistance, investigators should obtain consent f rom the participants t o the extent possible. For instance, s ome individuals may be only temporarily or intermittently incapacitated (e.g., due to acute injury or medications ). In these sit uations, investigators should attempt to approach these individuals at a time when they do have the capacity to consent to research. If a participant regains the capacity to consent to research after the research has begun, investigators shou ld stop and obtain the participant's informed consent before continuing his or her participation in the study. If the investigator obtains informed consent from the subject, the origina l informed consent signed by the LAR should still be stored with the pa tient's resear ch record and will be maintained as an important source document. However, the subjects' record will now also contain this second informed consent that has been signed by the subject . Before proceeding to the next section, we should make clear that outpa tient consenting for incapacitated adults looks different than what is described in the Priority for Consent Purposes (outlined in the next UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 178 of 270 section) . In outpatient situati ons, guardianship would be required for proper consent to occur . For additional guidance from UT Southwestern's HRPP on consent ing, including minors , please to the fol lowing group of policies: https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/research/hrpp/policies/#3 . Children Participating in Research are covered in more detail later in this chapter. Priority for Consent Purposes The individuals below are in order of priority for consent p urposes and is ONLY applicable to inpatient settings with patients who are adults . Consult them in the order they appear. Subject with Capacity. If a potential subject has capac ity to consent to the research, informed consent must be obtained from them . Capacity to consent is presumed to exist unless there is evidence to the contrary. If there is a question regarding a poten tial subject's capacity, a clinician will assess and eva luate the potenti al subject. Subject with Variable Capacity. A potential subj ect who has variable capacity may consent during a period of capacity. When the lack of capacity is temporary and likely t o end in a short period of time, the inves tigator should wait, if possible, until the subject regains capacity to seek consent for res earch participation. However, if the research needs to continue , a legally author ized representative (LAR) may be used to o btain consent. Subject with a Guardian . A court -appoin ted guardian of the person, but not a guardian of the estate or guardian ad li tem (i.e., an individual appointed by the court to re present the best interests in legal proceedings only for the duration of the legal action ), may consent to a ward's research participation. Under Texas law, a guardian of the person may consent to resear ch on behalf of the ward, if the rese arch is minimal risk or the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the ward. The guardian of the person may consent to research on behalf of the ward that is more than minimal risk with no prospect of dire ct benefit only if the guardian can s how by clear and convincing evidence that the ward would have elected to participate in such research. Subject with a Medical Power of Attor ney. A Medical Power of Attorney for healthcare may cons ent to a potential subject's participation in research when they are incapacitated to the extent that the agent's decision is consistent with the wishes and preferences of the potential subject as exp ressed in the power of attorney for heal th care instrument. Such determination s must be documented in writing. If there i s any question from the research staff about the validity of a Medical Power of Attorney, please contact the Office of Legal Affa irs: Legal Affairs: UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 179 of 270 Admin istrative Offices - UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX Subject with no Guardian, and no Medical Power of Attorney . If the potential subject is found to lack capacity and is in a home or community support services agency, or a h ospital (i.e., inpatient) or nursing home or municipal jail, then the individuals listed below may consent on behalf of the potential subject . Any next of kin representative of the potential subject should be actively involved in the care of the subject an d can consent in the following order: (1) the patient's spouse (2) an adult child of the patient who has the waiver and consent of all other qualified adult children of the pa tient to act as the sole decision -maker (3) a majority of the patient's reason ably available adult children (4) the patient's parents , or (5) the individual clearly identified to act for the patient by the patient befo re the patient became incapacitated , the patient's nearest living relative, or a member of the clergy The UT South western IRB must approve the inclusion of subjects with diminished capacity to provide informed consent. This applies to adults as well as children. These population s cannot be enrolled unless the study clearly outline s the plan for identifying, recruiting , and consenting these groups and is expressly approved to do so . The HRPP website contains guidelin es when working with subjects with impaired decision - making capacity . Plea se refer to the following for additional information : (HRPP Policy 2.6 Research Involving Individuals with Diminished Autonomous Decision -making Capacity ) Pregna nt Women and Fetuses in Research Additional considerations should be given when th e study is enrolling pregnant women or women who become pregnant during the course of the ir participation on the study. Because research involving pregnant women may affect t he woman, the fetus, or both the woman and the fetus, additional issues must be co nsidered for studies of preg nant women. The following definitions as defined by DHHS are important to review: Dead fetus means a fetus th at exhibits neither heartb eat, spontaneous respiratory activity, spontaneous movement of voluntary muscles, nor pulsation of the umbilical cord. Delivery means complete sep aration of the fetus from the woman by expulsion or extraction or any other means. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 180 of 270 Fetus means the product of conception from implantation until delivery. Neonate means a newborn. Nonviable neonate means a neonate after delivery that , although living, is not viable. Pregnancy encompasses the period of time from implantation until delivery . A woman shall be assumed to be pregnant if she exhibits any of the pertinent presumptive signs of pregnancy, such as missed menses, until the resul ts of a pregnancy test are negative or until delivery. Viable , as it pertains to the neonate, means being a ble, after delivery, to su rvive (given the benefit of available medical therapy) to the point of independently maintaining heartbeat and respiration. The Secretary may from time to time, taking into account medical advances, publish in the FEDERAL REGISTER guidelines to assist in d etermining whether a neonate is viable for purposes of this subpart. If a neonate is viable then it may be included in research only to the extent permitted and in accordance with the requirements of subparts A and D of this part . With the above in mind, the DHHS regulations require the following in re search : Preclinical studies , including studies on pregnant animals, and clinical studies, including studies on nonpregnant women, be completed prior to the involvement of pregnant women and provide data for assessing potential risks to pregnant women and f etuses Consideration of risks and potential benefits for the fetus and pregnant woman . The DHHS regulation s prohibit: Inducements of any kind to terminate a pregnancy Investigators from taking part in decisions about terminating a pregnancy Investigators from determining the viability of a neonate Pregnant women may only be involved in biome dical research if the study regards the health needs of the mother and the fetus will be placed at risk only to the minimal extent to meet the health needs of the mother, or risk to the fetus is mi nimal. For these studies, the father's signature on the in formed consent form is required unless: The study may provide direct benefit to the mother, or Risk to fetus is minimal, or The father is not reasonably available, or The pregnant was the result of sexual assault UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 181 of 270 Investigators, IRBs, and funding agencies must comply wit h requirements described in Subpar t B of the DHHS regulations. For any questions about your study's inclusion of pregnant w omen and/or fetuse s, consent requirements , etc., please reach out to the HRPP at HRPP@UTSouthwestern.edu . Children P articipating in Research Children may not have the full capacity to make decisions in their own best interes ts; and therefore: Children are considered a vulnerable population, and Children are unable to prov ide \"legally effective informed consent\" as requi red by the HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.116 A child is defined as a person less than 18 years of age unless leg ally emancipated. Because children cannot provide informed consent, children provide assent to participate i n research, to the extent that they are able, and parents/guardi ans give permission for a child to participate in research. Per DHHS, assent means, \"a child's affirmative agreement to participate in research. Mere failure to object should not, absent affir mative agreement, be construed as assent ,\" whereas permission means, \" the agreement of parent(s) or guardian to the participation of their child or ward in re search. \" Subpart D \u2014 Additional Protections for Children Involved | HHS.gov . The additional regulatory requirements of assent and permission for research involving children ( 45 CFR 46.408 ) are intended to ensure investigators respect the decisions of both children and their parents. Parental permission must be obtained for resear ch involving c hildren \"in accordance with and to the extent that consent is required by 45 CFR 46.116 .\" The age s, maturity, a nd psychological states of the children involv ed in the research should be taken into account when determining whether children have the capacity to assent. This determination is made by the IRB. The IRB may require that investigators conduct an individual assessment of each child's ability to assent or may make a general determination for all children involved in the study. The content and language of the assent process should be appropriate to the age and education/developmental stage of th e children pro viding assent. In general, in determining whet her assent of children is required in all, some or none of the children in a study the IRB is guided b y the following age ranges: i. Ages 0 -6 - The capability of children of this age group is so lim ited that they cannot reasonably be consulted. Assent is not required. ii. Ages 7 -10 - Children of this age group may be capable of providing assent depending on UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 182 of 270 the maturity and psychological state of the children involved in the research. Verbal or written assent ma y be required but must not be waived by the IR B if the child is unable to provide assent. iii. Ages 10 - 17 - Children of this age group are expected to be capable of providing assent. Written assent is usually required unless waived by the IRB. The UT Southwestern IRBs have additional information regarding the assent/consent requirements for children participating in research . Refer to the HRPP Website f or more guidance on the assent and consent requirements for children: https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/research/hrpp/policies/ Prisoners in Research Research involving prisoners require s approval by an IRB whose membership is specifically constituted to address the concerns of t his vulnerable population per 45 CFR 46.304 . As defined by DHHS, prisoner , \"means any individual involuntarily confined or det ained in a penal institution. The term is intended to encompass individuals sentenced to suc h an institution under a criminal or civil statute, individuals detain ed in other facilities by virtue of statutes or commitment procedures which provide alternativ es to criminal prosecution or incarceration in a penal institution, and individuals detained pending arraignment, trial, or sente ncing. \" Subpart C \u2014 Additional Protections Pertaining to Biomedical and B | HH S.gov . Please note that prisoners can include any person, adult or child, w ithin the criminal or juvenile justice system. The DHHS regulations ( 45 CFR 46, Subpart C ) require additional protection s for prisoners who are involved as participants in research b ecause they may \"be under constraints because of their incarceratio n which could affect their ability to make a truly voluntary and uncoerced decision whether or not to participate as subjects i n research.\" The requirements by DHHS specific to informed consent for prisoners are: \"Any possible advantages accruing to the p risoner through his or her participation in the research, when compared to the general living conditions, medical care, quality of food, amenities and opportuni ty for earnings in the prison are not of such a magnitude that his or her ability to weigh the r isks of the research against the value of such advantages in the limited choice environment of the prison is impaired. \" \"Adequate assurance exists that parole b oards will not take into account a prisoner's participation in the research in making decisions regarding parole, and each prisoner is clearly informed in advance that participation in the research will have no effe ct on his or her parole. \" UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 183 of 270 All the above is not mentioned to discourage the development of all potential research studies that target prisoner populations . In fact, the Secretary of Health and Human Services outlines research scenarios that could ultimately benefit this group , such as (i) the study of the possible causes, effects, and processes of incarceration, and of criminal behavior, (ii) the study of prisons as institutional structures or of prisoners as incarcerated persons, (iii) research on co nditions particularly affecting pris oners as a class (for example, vaccine trials and other research on hepatitis which is much more prevalent in prisons than elsewhere; and research on social and psychological problems such as alcoholism, drug addiction, and sexual assaults) , and (iv) resea rch on prac tices, both innovative and accepted, which have the intent and reasonable probability of improvi ng the health or well -being of the subject. In all these examples, DHHS encourages research with prisoners as long as, \"the study presents no more than minimal risk and no more than inconvenience to the subjects .\" All studies that include prisoners requi re full review by the IRB. IRB membership must in clude a prisoner representative, that is, someone who is knowled geable of prison inmate life. If one is not on the board at the time of study submission, the IRB will locate one to assist with reviewing the study. Students/Employees/Family Members Students, employees, and family members are not considered \"vulnerable populations \" per federal regulations but are co nsidered protected populations since they are susceptible to coercion due to their status as emp loyees/students and/or family members of employees at the site. The IRB will have concerns whether these individu als' participati on is truly voluntary for numer ous reasons , including the individual's desire to appear cooperative or motivated. To include t his population in this study, These individuals have to voluntarily agree to participate in the study Their emplo yment status (if an employee) or family members ' employment status must not be affected /impacted in any way Individuals may not be selected for research solely on the basis of convenience Individuals must not work for the PI Privacy must be protected since these individua ls are susceptible to peer pres sure in the workplace The following are some suggestions that the team can enact to reduce the possibility of undue influence on these individuals: Posting IRB -approved advertisements to recruit from a broad base of subjects. In this situation, the possib ility of the recruiting a student, employee, or family member is left to chance UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 184 of 270 Avoiding persona l solicitations of by any person in an authoritative role (e.g., professor, manager, parent, etc.) If the person is a student, providing alternative and equal m ethods for meeting course requirements other than participating as a research subject For addit ional guidance on this topic, including tips on how t o modify your study so that you do not inadvertently create undue influence for any of t hese populations, please reach out to the HRPP at HRPP@UTSouthwestern. edu. Community Consultation For studies targeting a specific subject population, it is often appropriate to consult with members of their community before conducting research. For example, members of a community may feel stigmatized if members of that c ommunity are recruited as participants in research that may reveal unpopular or dangerous traits. In addition, some cultures believe it is not appropriate to obtain informed consent solely from the individual participants, because the ind ividual's interes ts may be considered to be intimately entwined with their community's interests. The appropriate way to attain community consent may vary widely but is often achieved through meetings with large groups of community representatives or commu nity leaders. UT Southwestern's HRPP has addressed these situations by creating a policy (2.1 Initial Review of Research ) that prov ides guidance on when the IRB can request assistance from a cultur al consultant (e.g., cultural issues , the IRB does not have the appropriate experti se on the topic, etc. ). Additional policies that address spe cific circumstances (e.g., cultural sensitivities during emergency research , addressed in 2.7 Guidance on Planned Emergency Research, Exception from Infor med Consent, and Waiver of Applicability of Informed Consent ), can be found in other sections of the HRPP Depar tmental Policy and Procedure Manual. Please go to this page on the HRPP websit e to access all the cha pters . F. Other Informed Consent Consi derations Waiver of Consent The DHHS regulations ( 45 CFR 46.116(d) ) allow IRBs to waive or alter some or all of the required elements of informe d consent if all of the following conditions are met: \"The resear ch involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects, The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects, The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration, and UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 185 of 270 Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.\" Decisions about waivers of informed consent often concern the issue of practicability . Although practicability is not defined in the DHHS regulations, it is not suff icient for an investigator to argue that seeking consent would be time -consuming or incur additional cost. This decision is not up to the PI, but rather the IRB. In some situations, a waiver of informed consent may be appropriate for a medical record revi ew or for using existing data or specimens that can be linked to identifiable individuals . Specific decisions regarding practicability are made by the IRB. Refer to the UT Southwestern IRB w ebsite ( HRPP 3.3 Informed Consent Waivers and Alterations ) for more information regarding waiver of informed consent. Or, contact the HRPP at HRPP@UTSouthwestern.edu to request a c onsult with an Analyst to discuss whether your study may be eligible for a waiver or cons ent. Correlative or Sub -Studies Some studies include additional procedures to supplement the data colle cted to address the main study objectives. This may include the collection of additional biological samples, additional questionnaires/surveys, or addit ional study procedures. These add itional procedures could be optional or required. If the additional pro cedures are optional, remind participants they can still partic ipate in the main study even if they choose not to consent to the correlative portion. On some occasions, the subject ca n indicate his/her wishes to participate in the sub -study procedures in the body of the main consent form, or they could be described in a separate consent form. If this is the case, ensure that the subject and person obtai ning consent sign and date those consent forms, as well as the primary consent form. There are also co rrelative or sub -studies that include procedures that are not o ptional. In these studies, if subjects do not want to participate in the correlative/sub -study procedures, they cannot par ticipate in the main study. It is important to make this completely cle ar to potential subjects during the consent process. UT Southw estern allows multiple consent forms within a study, but in all situations every consent must contain the required element s of informed consent per federal guidelines. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 186 of 270 Therapeutic Misconceptio n Some research studies include examinations, diagnostic tests, and/or interactions with healthcare providers in addition to research or investigational interventions. While it is often appropriate to include treatment procedures in the conduct of research studies, there is a risk that research participants may misund erstand the benefits of research if they think that potential benefits of participation i n research are certain. Or the person may believe that the purpose of a clinical trial is to benefit the individual patient rather than to gather data for the purpose of contributing to scientific knowledge. These situations are called therapeutic misconce ption . Therapeutic misconcepti on is defined as \" when clinical research subjects fail to recognize the w ays in which research participation may involve the sacrifice o f some degree of personal care \" [Appelbaum, Lidz, Grisso 2004]. Subjects may believe: That the physician would not sugge st participation in the research study unless they feel that it is good f or them The risks must be low because their physician would not recruit them for the study otherwise Frequent confusions subjects have about clinical re search include: Not understanding the difference between personalized clinical care and the impersonal, more global goals of clinical research Not understanding the co ncept of clinical equipoise (i.e., they think that the investigator already knows the tre atment is better ) Not understanding the concept of randomization Overestimating the benefits of clinical research and underestimating the risks Difficulty understandin g percentages and probability statements Any indication of therapeutic misconception dur ing the informed c onsent process is detrimental to the subject's understanding of the study, which is cr ucial for a truly autonomous decision. In order to minimize t he possibility of therapeutic misconception, i nvestigators should thoroughly discuss both the potential ris ks as well as the benefits of research as part of the informed consent process. Pay sp ecial attention to ensuring that any potential benefits of part icipating in the research study are properly characterized to the subject. Where the inve stigator is also t reating physician, there exists a higher risk of therapeutic misconception. If possibl e, you may want to consider having an impartial third party obt ain consent or finalize the consent process in the absence of the individual to whom the potential subject ordinarily defers. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 187 of 270 For more guidance on therapeutic misconception, please refer to th e HRPP 10.0 Glossary of Human Research Terms and review the area under \" Undue Influence .\" G. Updates to the Consent Form/Re -Consenting There are many reasons why a sub ject would need to be re -consented at any point during the st udy. For inst ance, if the original consent form or process was not properly executed, subject reaches age of majority , as required by the UTSW IRB or sponsoring ag ency, and so forth . In additio n to the above, federal regulations require disclosure of si gnificant new findings that develop during the course of a research study that could impac t the subject's willingness to continue participation in the study . CFR 21 CFR 56.115(a)(7) ]. Significant new findings often res ult in changes to the consent form or protocol after subjects have signed the original cons ent document. What Constitutes Significant New Findings Requiring Report to Subjects? According to the HRPP Office , significant new findings generally include, but are not limited to: Changes in potential or actual risks or benef its to subjects including : Changes in standard of care, such that participation in research could increase risk to subjects (e.g., subjects would be deprived of the standard of care by continuing to take part in the research study ) Identification of new risks to subjects currently receiving the study treatment Identification of potential late -term effects for subjects who have complete d study treatment Discovery that life threatening, or severely debilitating side effects occur more frequen tly than previously expected Addition or d eletion of study procedures or change in required number of visits including: Addition of safety mo nitoring procedures Addition of study procedures or new instruments or questionnaires. Collection of new or diffe rent information from subjects Substantive a lterations to the treatment subjects expect to or currently receive, including: o The frequency of dosing is i ncreased or decreased o The route of study drug administration is altered Substantive changes in potent ial costs or payments to subjects, including: A drug previously paid for by the study funds must now be covered by insurance or the subject's personal funds UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 188 of 270 Payment for or costs of study participation is increased or decreased IRB Review of Sig nificant New Findings or Changes In general, IRBs must rev iew the new information to be provided to subjects prior to its dissemination, unless the information must b e provided to subjects to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects or others. In the case where the new findings must be reported to subje cts before IRB approval can be obtained because of a potential immediate hazard, the researcher must report the dissemination of this information to the IRB within 5 business days. These situa tions are known as \"Emergency Deviations ,\" a type of Reportable Event, and are allowed if the event occurred to: Eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects, or For IDE studies only: protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an em ergency For more about the different types of Reportable Events and the different reporting timelines , please refer to Guidance & Resources: Human Research Protection Program (utsouthwestern.edu) . Significant new findings that the resear cher proposes to disseminate can be submitted for IRB review using a modification form. In the case of oral di ssemination of new findings (e.g., over the phone) , the IRB must be provided with a copy of the script that will be followed when contacting the s ubject , or that describes the information that will be conveyed to subjects. If subjects are provided with wri tten materials, these documents should be submitted with the modification for IRB review . Re-Consent When re -consenting is required, it should be performed in the same thorough manner as the initial consenting. The study team should take as much time and care in explaining the change(s) during the re-consent process as when the subjects were initially consented to the study. This includes whether another person was involved, such as a LAR . The goal is to make certain the subject and/or LAR understand the c hange s to make an informed decision as to whether to conti nue participation in the study. Moreover, the UTSW IRB must approve the revised consent. If the subject has reached \"age of majority\" (i.e., turned 18 while on study), then written consent should be obtained if the subject is still an active participant in the study. Consenters should take extra time to outline specifically what has changed, why it has changed, and ensure the subject wants to remain in the study considering the changes. The followin g should be done during this re -consent period: The subjec t and /or LAR person obtaining consent must sign and date the new consent form. A copy of the newly signed consent form must be provided to the subject UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 189 of 270 The subject and/or LAR should be pro vided the l atitude to now decline any further participation ba sed on the ch anges; in the same way they can decline further participation at any time after th e original consent process The re -consent process should be documented in the same way as the initial consent process The presentation of significant new find ings to subje cts can be accomplished through various means, including the following : A telephone call to subjects to report significant new findings. The telephone call can be documented in the research reco rd regarding when and who provided the new information to subjects and/or their LAR . This method is especially encouraged when verification that s ubjects have received this information is needed, and subjects are no longer being seen in person or a signifi cant gap in time exists between when the ne w fin dings are discovered and the next scheduled visit with the subject. At times, a telephone contact may be required prior to the subject's next visit, at which time they will re-consent. A letter to subjects ca n also be used to report significant new fi nding s. This mode of communication may be suitable for information that needs to be communicated to sub jects who are no longer seen by the researcher in person and when the changes are neither life threatening nor time sensitive. Refer to the HRPP Guidance re garding Re -Consenting subjects for nformed.pdf . When Re -Consenting Subjects Shoul d Not be Pursued The IRB is aware that study sponsors often request or require researchers to pres ent revised consent documents to the subjects to sig n (i.e.-cons ent\") when they have been revised, regardless of the significance of the new inform ation or change. In many cases, asking subjects to sign a revised consent form is inappropriate and may resul t in needless burden on the subject, presentation of irrelevant information to t he subjects , and potential dil ution of the impact of significant ne w findings when they occur in the future . Consequently, the IRB generally disallow re -consenting subjects when the revisions to consent documents would not or could not affect the subject's willingness to continue parti cipation in the research stu dy. Examples of situations the IRB would generally not approve re -consenting subjects include: The version number or date on the consent form have been revised and no other changes have been made UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 190 of 270 The expiration date on a consen t form has been updated and no other changes have been made . Note: studies under the purview of UT Southwestern as the IRB of record no longer have an expiration date A minor increase in number of subjects to be enrolled in the study New risk information a bout the study drug is di scovered that is not related to late effects and all subjects have completed study treatment (e.g., are past the relevant period for the new risks) Addition of new study procedures or additions of study visits that do not pertain t o subject s already enrolled in the study (e.g., changes made to screening procedures that only affect new subjects ) H. Subject Retention Begins at t he Initial Contact Retention of enrolled participants is critical to the success of every clinical research st udy. Bu ilding a solid relationship between the research team and the research subject will help ensure good communication and follow through for t he duration of the protocol. Behaviors that can influence subject retention begin before the subject enrolls in the study and throughout their participation. During the informed consent process research staff should establish trust. It is essential to re main unbiased, neutral, and non -coercive. As the subject's participation in the study continues, these communi cation styles should carry through until the end. When in doubt, always choose to be as transparent as possible about what will be done, when, and why. Every patient, whether enr olled on a study as a research subject or not, has a right to know about what will be done before it is performed. Encourage subjects to always contact staff if they have any questions or concerns. Remember: Use open -ended questions when communicating with the subject(s). Open ended questions begin with words such as, \"what, where, how oft en, when,\" and, \"please descri be.\" A few potential questions include: \"What more would you like to know? \" NOT, \"Do you need any more information? \" \"What are your concerns? \" NOT, \"Do you have any concerns? \" The study team should NEVER ask subjects questions in a demeaning or accusatory way: O \"Did you understand what I read to you? \" UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 191 of 270 Chapter 8: Determining Subject Eligibility Participants in clinical research studies can play an active role in their own health care, gain acc ess to new research tre atments before they are widely available and help others by contributing to medical research. Some research participants may depend on the medicat ions and medical care they receive by participating in a study. People pa rticipate in clinical research studie s for many reasons, and it is the responsibi lity of the research team to make sure that only appropriate subjects are enrolled in the research stu dy. A. Eligibility Determination All clinical research studies have require ments describing who may or may not p articipate. The factors that describe who ca n participate in a study are called Eligibility Criteria . Eligibility Criteria , often referred to in t he protocol as the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria, specify the conditio ns that must be present ( Inclusion Cr iteria ) and the conditions that must NOT be present ( Exclusion Criteria ) for the potential subject to be eligible to participate in the study. Following the Eligibility Criteria is an important principle of clinical re search that helps to produce reliable results. These criteria are based on such f actors as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions. Before participating in a study, the research subject must qu alify for the study. Some research st udies seek participants with illnesses or co nditions to be studied, while others require normal volunteers. It is important to note that inclusion and exclusion criteria should never be used to reject people for personal reasons . Rather, the Eligibility Cr iteria is created to define subjects to whom the study questions are applicable and can safely enroll. The criteria are designed so an individual who doesn't meet the criteria for safety reasons ( e.g., study participation may cause unacceptable risk to the subject) is excluded. Study teams may pre-screen potential subjects with permission from the IRB (more on this in the next section) . However, the subject's final eligibility is usually determined or confi rmed after the subject has signed the consent form . Eligibility is determined by following the inclusion/exclusion criteria in the protocol. Subjects must meet all eligibility requirements stated in the protocol. Specific timelines for eligibility criteria must be r eviewed. For example, a subject might ne ed to demonstrate a \"normal \" ECG report within the last 3 months prior to consent . Or, the protocol might state that a n eligibility waiver is allowed for an abnormal ECG , as long as it has been pre-approved by the medical monitor (listed on the protocol ). In all situations, if you are unsure about whether a subject has met the eligibility criteria for the protocol , reach out the Principal Investiga tor. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 192 of 270 To ensure consistency, researchers should use an Eligibility Checklist . An Eligibility Checklist is a systematic list of all eligibility criteria used to indicate the criteria that the subject meets/doesn't meet. The PI must sign and date the eligibi lity checklist prior to the subject being registere d for the study . This signature and date attests that the PI has confirmed the subject's eligibility. B. Pre-Screening Subjects Pre-screening subjects, prior to the informed consent process, is allowed to de termine if the subject may b e potentially eligible based on \"gross\" eligibility criteria, such as disease stat us, disease site, gender, age, etc. This is done primarily through a review of existing medical records when patients are scheduled for a clinic v isit. Potential subjects m ay be identified by clinical care providers or by the study staff using major eligibility criteria ( e.g., the subject has a diagnosis of the diseas e/condition under investigation). The procedures to contact the potential subject or subjects identified mu st be described in the IRB application under the applicable \"recruitment\" activities . An investigator may discuss study availability and/or the possible entry into a study with a prospective subject without first obtaining consent ; however, informed conse nt must be obtained prior to the initiation and conduct of any procedures performed s olely for study purposes, including those to determine study eligibility . The study team may use results from tests and procedures that have been performed as part of the subject's clinical care (i.e., standard of care) if it is described as such in the pr otocol and the IRB application. Identification and Recruitment of Study Participants UT Southwestern patients may be contacted for potential part icipation in clinical res earch unless they have expressly indicated their desire not to be contacted for poten tial participation in clinical research; to \"opt -out\" of such contact. Patients cared for at UT Southwestern Hospitals and Clinics have the opport unity to state their pref erence not to be included in lists of potential research participants to be contacted , which was obtained by review of their electronic health record (opt -out). This does not prevent their treatment providers from informing them of research opportunities o ngoing in their practice. Patients may change their preference to be included or exc luded from potential research participant lists at any time. The method used to contact patients for potential participation in research studies will be described in the recruitment plan. Recruitment methods used to solicit volunteers into human research must be equitable and free of bias, undue influence and coercion. Recruitment methods must respect the privacy UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 193 of 270 of potential research participants. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) must review and approve the methods, materials, procedures, and tools us ed to recruit potential research participants before they are implemented. For additional guidance on best practices for identifying and recruiti ng patients, please refer to HRPP's policy 4.1 IDENTIFICATION AND RECRUITMENT OF PARTICIPANTS . C. Subject Registration/Enrollment After the subject has complete d all required screening procedures and his/her eligibility has been confirmed by the PI, the subject is ready f or the next step in study participation. The next step could be a wash out (i.e., t he length of time that someone enrolled in a trial must not re ceive any treatment befo re receiving the trial's experimental therapy ) or run -in period (period after inclusion , but before randomization to the study team; used to exclude potential ineligible patients) or receiving study treatment. At this point, the sub ject is most often consi dered enrolled and/or registered. At this point, the researcher should: Refer to the pro tocol for instructions on how to register/enroll study subjects Provide each subject with a unique sequence # or subject ID (usually assigned by the sponsor, or designed by the statistician, for instance) Make certain to keep copies of all registration doc umentation in the research chart Please note that different trials will have different registration requirements , or some may have none at all (e.g., once the subject has signed the consent, this person may also be considered \"registered\" for all intents and purposes on that specific study) . Do not assume that once the subject has consented to participate in the study that you have completed all of the initial work required for enrollment . Always refer to the protoco l and/or Manual of Operations to define the specific registration procedures for the study . For any additional questions about study registration, reach out to the study sponsor and/or Principal Investigator. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 194 of 270 Chapter 9: Subject Safety: Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, Unanticipated Probl ems and Other Reportable Events. Ensuring subject safety is a responsibility shared by all members of the study team , not just the Principa l Investigator . The identification and effective management of all types of adverse events is integral to providing h uman subjects protection. Whether licensed as part of the clinical staff or operating as a clinical research coordinator, all team members are o bligated to identify, track, and treat any issues as they arise to human subjects. The licensed clinical researc h staff ha ve an ethical obligation to account for and treat adverse events associated with each subject's participation in a clinica l research s tudy. Meanwhile, the non -licensed research staff maintain timely oversight and thorough documentation o f AEs as they occur during subject's participation in a study . All these activities are considered some of the most impor tant aspects of conducting clin ical research. A. Adverse Events According to US Federal Regulations [21 CFR 312.32(a) ], an Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medi cal occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. GCP [ICH GCP E6 1.2 ] further clarifie s AEs as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investi gation subject who had been adm inistered a product; a causal relationship with this treatment does not necessarily need to be show n. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable sign, including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally asso ciated with the use of an inves tigational product, regardless of whether or not it is considered related to the investigational pr oduct. Gener ally, AEs include: Clinically significant abnormal laboratory results (e.g., elevated liver enzymes) Development of NEW condition s during study participation, such as a new side effect or symptom (e.g., hair loss, tremors, etc.) Worsening of CURRENT condit ions present at study enrollment (e.g., someone who had occasional headaches before starting treatmen t now experiences migraines , or more freque nt headaches) Worsening of the CURRENT PRIM ARY condition or diagnosis of the subject population (e.g., someone w ith elevated liver enzymes at the study outset progresses to cirrhosis) It should be noted that when speaking to patients, a clinical research coordinator can only record information abou t AEs (more about recording in section D of this chapter). It is the PI's and clinical co -UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 195 of 270 investigators' respons ibility to review the informa tion and make clini cal determinations about whether the study caused th e AE (i.e., relatedness), if treatment is necessary , and so forth. Once you receive reports of an y AEs under the criteria above, report them in a timely manner to a clinical member of t he team. Also, it should also be noted that t here is an important dist inction between the terms \"Signs \" and \"Symptoms \" in the medical field . A symptom is considered subjective eviden ce of the disease , which is what the subject will explain when he or she is seen in the clin ic (e.g., \"My head hurts more often now than it did before. The pain is sharp and lasts a few hours after my treatment) . In this example, the research coordinator i s unable to describe the p ain; that is up to the subject on the study . On the other hand, a sign can be observed by anyone and is considered obj ective evidence of the disease. An example of a sign would be elevated blood pressure readings , abnormal CBC lab oratory results, so forth. When recording information in the subject' s research record, make sure that you are appropriately defining terms in y our documentation. B. Serious Adverse Events A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE that results in any of the fol lowing outcomes: Death Life-threatening Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exist ing hospitalization A persistent or significant disabi lity or incapacity Congenital abnormality or birth defects A significant medical incident that, based upon appro priate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and require medical or surgical int ervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above Individual protocols may include additional criteria apart f rom the examples described above that would make an AE serious, for example if the AE occurred during a specific time period after an invest igational treatment was given (e.g., a protocol may state that any AEs that occur within 30 days after the last treatment dose are still considered SAE) . C. Identifying Adv erse Events There are several methods that can be used by the study team to solicit AE reports from research subjects. Keep in mind that the pro tocol ma y describe some types o f AEs that must be solicited, such as those that would require a change in the st udy intervention or additional medical intervention. The following will be reviewed, b ut there may be other methods for gathering this important informa tion, UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 196 of 270 depending on the study's design : Open -ended questions Checklists of symptoms Standardized question naires Open -ended questions: Members of the study team should ask open -ended questio ns to prompt the subject to think of any symptoms that may have occurred. Examples of open -ended questions include: \"How have you been feeling since your last visit?\" \"Hav e there been any changes in medical conditions or medications?\" \"Have you seen a doct or or nurse, or gone to the emergency room since we last sp oke?\" Please note that it can be difficult for all members of the study team to consistently ask the same quest ion(s) and prompt the same responses when engaging with all the research sub jects on a study . To illustrate, one experienced clinical research c oordinator may ask all open -ende d questions and gather more data , includin g AEs, from his or her subject, while a second , less -experienced clinical research coordinator seeing a different subject on the same day may only gather scant data, simply because h e or she did not ask the same questions . To avoid these kinds of inconsistencies in study management , use checkl ists or standar dized Checklist s of symptoms: A checklist can be given to subjects to easily document any symp toms or side effects that they may have experienced since their last study visit. Some important considerations regarding checklists. First, checklists should be used with cautio n so that symptoms are not \"suggested\" to subjects. The study team may consid er adding many potential symptoms, some of which may not be expected, so that the AEs reported are not biased on ly to those that are expecte d. Moreover, once a subject receives a checklist this is considered a source document and needs to be collected by t he study team before that subject's participation ends in the study. Some subje cts may forget to bring this chec klist to their study visits, so the study team should build in time to call in reminders to the subjects prior to their upcoming study visit, to remind him or her to bring this important document. The study team members can also schedule periodic calls in between visits to remind pat ients about the checklist. Doing so will achieve two things: make sure that important information is being captured in a timely manner, but also relay any significant information (e.g. , potentially serious adverse events) to the study team so that the PI c an determine whether the subject needs to come in and be evaluated sooner than what has been mandated by the protoco l. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 197 of 270 Standardized questionnaire s: The use of a standardized question naire helps ensure that all members of the s tudy team inquire abou t AEs in a consistent fashion. Standardized questionnaires have been validated and demonstrated (1) to offer consistent re sponses across all subjects (i.e., reliability), (2) measure what th ey are intended to measure (i.e., validity), and (3) are able to differe ntiate between good and bad qualities (i.e., sensitivity). The questionnaire could include either open -ended questio ns or specific symptoms that are being solicited. If the stud y is sponsored, then the sponsor will provide all o f the questionnaires needed to execute the protocol. If the study is investigator -initiated, the PI will likely either utilize questionnaires utilized as part of standard of care or obtain pre -existing validated questionnaires that have been successfully u tilized for similar types of studies/populations. In addition to the above, t here are other types of study documents that could be used to hel p identify adverse events or prompt the study team to inquire further. These include: 1. Study documents completed by the subject TIP: Subject diaries, questionnaires, and surveys should be reviewed as soon as the subject returns them to the study team to al low the research staff to inquire about any handwritten notes that may require additional discussion. It is much easier to request c larification on an item that is unclear when the subject is still physically present, so that the sourc e of confusion can be reviewed togethe r. 2. Study documents completed by the research staff : Concomitant medication l -g - if the subjec t indicates that he/she took an additional medication for a period of time, or increased/decreased the dose of concomitant medication, it may ha ve been d ue to an AE and should prompt additional discussion. For instance, a patient may report that they're no w taking Tyl enol over the counter (OTC) for headaches. When you review the AE log for this subject, you don't see any mention of headaches in their medical history. A probing discussion may indicate that the headaches are (1) something that is seasonal, and they forgo t to mention it , or (2) enti rely new. In either situation, the appropriate documentation would need to be updated to present a more accurate reflection of this patient's history. Subject medical history - inpatient and outpatient visit notes from th e subject's medical record should be reviewed periodically to determine if any new problems have been reported, or if there were any inpati ent hospitalizations that may be considered a SAE. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 198 of 270 When does the study team start asking about, and documenting Adverse Events? The first- time subjects are asked abou t AEs, and whe n AEs are first documented, could vary from one study to the next. Some st udies begin to inquire abou t AEs after informed consent is obtained , prior to receiving any type of study interv ention, to capture an adequa te \"baseline\" for comparison at future visits. If these symptoms are not identified prior to the study intervention, they could be inaccurately attributed to the investigational product or intervention if they are reported after the subject receives study intervention. Other studies do not be gin inquiring about or documentin g AEs until immediately prior to the subject receiving the study intervention. This method can also serve as a \"baseline\" and allows documentation of symptom s or side effects that are a lso not attributed to the study intervention. Regardless of when you start recording adverse events, documenting an y symptoms the subject is experiencing prior to the intervention will prompt the research team to inquire about the symptom at a later date to determine if has improved, remained stable, or worsened, all of which should be documented. D. Recording Adverse Events Regardless of how the events are initially identified, al l AEs must be documented in the subject chart in the most complete manner possible. An AE log maintained in the research chart is the most efficient and effective method to consistently documen t AEs as they are reported. Be sure to allow an area on each row for the PI signature/initials and date to indica te his/her review and the date that the PI became aware of the event. Each AE record should include: Date reported to the study team Most prot ocols outline how quickly an AE or SAE must be reported to the sponsor upon the PI learning of the event (e.g., within 5 business days of the study team being alerted) . Additionally, if the AE or SAE meets criteria for reporting to the IRB, the timeframe f or reporting is also determined by when the PI learned of the e vent. Adverse Event Description A description of the adverse event must be recorded. The event causing the symptoms should be captured whenever possible (e.g. , tibia fracture as opposed to \"leg pain\") . If the event causing the symptoms cannot be determined , the description should include clinical symptom s, not a general assessment (e.g., \"diarrhea\" or \"nausea\" rather than \"the flu - like symptoms\") UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 199 of 270 Start and Stop (or End) Dates must also be docum ented Outcome of the Adverse Event The outcome of each adverse event must also be documented. There are several ways to categorize the outcomes. Usually, the outcomes are variants of the options; Recovering or Resolving, Recovered or Resolved with sequelae or without sequelae. The protocol should specify how the outcomes will be categorized. It's also important to k now if the adverse events will need to be reported directly to a coordinating center, or the FDA, as there may be specific requirements. Grade, severity, or intensity assessment As discussed in the previous chapters describing the Roles and Responsibilitie s of the Members of the Research team, only the PI or Clinical Investigator can assess the adverse event to determine the grade or severity. The protocol may specify criteria for determining severity, or may direct Investigators to use a particular source , such as the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) maintained by the NCI (https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc .htm) to determine the grade or severity of the AE. Though it was developed, and continues to be maintained by NCI, it is a helpful tool for al l researchers, regardless of the disease/condition under investigation, to use when determining which grade, or severity may be most appropriate. The CTCAE uses the terminology \"Grade\". Non -cancer research studies often refer to the Grade as the Severity of the Adverse Event. The Grades or Severities are categorized as: Grade 1 (Mild) describes mild symptoms that m ay be clinical or diagnostic observations only. Typically, intervention is not indicated for Grade 1 adverse events. Grade 2 (Moderate) describe s an adverse event in which local or noninvasive intervention is indicated. A grade 2 adverse event is one that results in a limitation of the subject's instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ref er to activities su ch as preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, and managing money. Grade 3 (Seve re or medically significant, but not immediately life -threatening ) AEs that fit into this category are considered medically s ignificant but not immediately life -threatening. Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization may be indicated. Grade 3 AEs a re those that result in a limitation of the subject's Self - care Activities of Daily Living. Self -care Activities of Daily Li ving refer to activ ities such as bathing, dressing and undressing, UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 200 of 270 feeding self, using the toilet, and taking medications. Grade 3 AEs could be categorized as SAEs, depending on the outcome. Grade 4 (Life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated) Grade 5 (Deat h related to AE) It's important to point out that not all studies utilize all 5 grades in their Adverse Event r ecords because Grades 4 and 5 are considered SAEs, this information is likely captured by a separate mechanism. Grade 3 could also be considered an SAE depending on the definitions described in your protocol. Seriousness Documenting if an AE is Serious ca n be done by using an Adverse Event Log with a Serious Column allowing you to indicate Yes or No. This may seem somewhat redu ndant, but this fie ld serves as a mechanism to double check that the appropriate documentation is completed as necessary, if the ev ent is an SAE. Severe vs. Serious Severity is the degree to which the AE is affecting the subject, while seriousness is determined by the AE mee ting specified criteria. For example, a subject may have a \"severe\" headache that limits his or her ability to p rovide self -care, but unless the criteria for \"serious\" are met, such as being admitted to the hospital, the condition is not considered serious . Conversely, a subject may experience mild chest pain (not severe) that requires admission to a hospital for ob servation, in which case it is considered an SAE. Attribution Attribution is the determination of whether or not an AE is related to the subject 's participation in the research, including relatedness to an investigational product or intervention. Deciding how to document the Attribution of the adverse event first r equires that you separate intervention from non -intervention studies. If your study is a non -intervention study, you should indicate whether or not participation in the study or study procedures could be responsible or related to occurrence of the adverse event (procedures performed, treatment or drugs provided). See: Guid ance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others and Adverse Events, Section III.B: Assessing whether a n adverse event is related or possibly related to participation in research. If your study involves an intervention, you should refer to the FDA guidance \", \"For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 'reasonable possibility' means there is evidence to suggest a causal UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 201 of 270 relationship between the drug and the adverse event\" (taken from Guidance for Industry and Investigators: Safety Re porting Requirements in 21 CFR 312 . As referenced in the chapter describing the Role s and Responsi bilities of the Members of the Research team, only the PI or Clinical Investigator can make the determination of attribution or relatedness of t he adverse event to the investigational product or intervention. An unlicensed member of the team, such as a cli nical research associate, cannot make these determinations since they have not had the appropriate medical training or experience. It is impor tant that this categorization be taken seriously, as the reporting requirements differ based on th e attribution or relatedness decision. Common options to categorize the attribution or relatedness of the AE are Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, or D efinite. There are studies that do not use all of the categories, or perhaps the exact terminolo gy. The protocol should specify how the a ttribution will be categorized. If the study is evaluating an investigational product, the study participation and rel ated procedures attribution should be assessed separately from the investigational product. Unre lated: An Unrela ted AE is one that is cle arly NOT related . An AE may be considered Unrelated if the subject did not participate in any study procedures or recei ve the study intervention, or if there is another obvious cause of the AE (for example, a car a ccident or other disease/condition) Unlik ely: An Unlikely AE is one that is doubtfully related . The coincidence of the AE with the conduct of study procedures or exposure of the investigational product or intervention should be assessed. An AE that contin ued while the inte rvention was interrupted or stopped, or if the AE resolved while the intervention continued, may be categorized as Unlikely. If there is another more likely cause of the AE, the PI may determine that the AE was unlikely related to the sub ject's participati on in the stu dy or the intervention. Possible: A Possible AE may be related . If the timing of the AE is reasonably consistent with the conduct o f study procedures or exposure to the study intervention, and there is another cause of the A E that could be equally likely , the PI may categorize the AE as Possible. Probable: A Probable AE is likely related . If the timing of the AE is consistent with the conduct of study procedures or exposure to the study intervention, and it is more likely that UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 202 of 270 the AE was caused by the stu dy or the intervention than not, the PI may categorize the AE as Probable. Definite: An AE categorized as Definite is clearly related . If the timing of the AE is consistent with the conduct of study proc edures or exposure to the study interventi on and it is most likely that the AE was caused by the study procedures or intervention such as because a likely occurrence of the AE was expect ed based on the study documents (protoc ol, consent, etc.). In this cas e, the PI may categorize the AE as definit ely related. AE Category, or Toxicity The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) uses standard terminology to prevent comparing free text descriptions that may includ e typographical errors. The CTC AE also categorizes adverse events into ap propriate body systems. For example, an adverse event of diarrhea would be categorized as a gastrointestinal disorder. This categorization allow s the grouping and analysis o f AEs by c ategory. This categorization is also referred to as Toxicity. This catego rization is required for studies under review of the UTSW Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) and the SCCC Data Safety Monitoring Committ ee (D SMC). Expectedness It is necessary to document if the adverse eve nt was expected or unexpected. Expected An adverse event is considered expected if the event is included in the protocol, consent form, investigator brochure, investigational drug brochu re or package insert as a known side effect or risk based on the subje ct population, the study procedures or stu dy intervention. The event is considered expected if it is consistent with the frequency and severity of the risk as described in the documents referenced above. Unexpected An adverse event is considered Unexpected if the event is NOT included in the docum ents referenced above, or if it is occurring at a frequency or severity that is unexpected. Treatment Adverse event records should include docum entation of the treatment the subject received, such as medication or non-medication treatment. If there was no treatment administered, the option of None should be selected. Action Taken Adverse event records should also include documentation related to t he action taken with regards to the investigational product, such as a change in drug dosage, or if the subject was taken off the investigational product for a period of time (interruption). If there were no changes, the option of None should be selected. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 203 of 270 An AE Tracking Log template can be found in the Case Report Form/Sour ce Document Templates section of the Clini cal Research Toolkit https://www.utsouthwestern.ed u/research/hrpp/ass ets/re_tracking_log_upirso.docx E. Reporting Adverse Events All AEs need to be reported to the PI or Clinical Investigator delegated the task of assessin g AEs to determine the grade, severity and attribution; but deciding whether or not t o report an AE beyond the study team can be difficult. Refer to the p rotocol to determine when outside entities , such as the medical monitor, the DSMC, a coordinating center, or the sponsor or funding agency should be made aware of AE. If the study is funded by NIH, reporting requirements and timelines for reporting can var y by instit ute. It is important to note th at the sponsor or protocol reporting requirements are DIFFERENT from IRB reporting requirements. In addition to knowing to whom and when safety reports are made, study staff should be aware of when it is appropria te to inclu de PHI and when it is not. For example, an IRB submission of a reportable event (RE) should not include PHI. UT Southwestern's RE reporting guidelines are available here: Reporta Human Research UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX . Requirements for reporting Adverse Events to th e IRB If the AE is considered an Unanti cipated Problem (UP) , it must be reported to the IRB. An Unanticipated Problem (UP) is an event that meets the fol lowing criteria: The event is PROBABLY or DEFINITELY RELATED The event is UNEXPECTED. As a reminder, an event is considered unexpected if it was not described in the protocol, investiga tor's brochu re, investigational drug brochure, package insert, IRB app lication, or informed consent document. It is al so considered unexpected if the frequency or severity of the event is greater than expected. Another factor to consider is if the event suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk o f harm than was previously known or recognized. However, there are exceptions to every rule and sometimes an AE will be EXPECTED, yet UNANTIC IPATED for other reasons, such as the frequency or sever ity of the event in unexpected. An example of this is that headaches are expected as a side ef fect on a research study , but UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 204 of 270 migraines (which are generally considered more debilitating than headaches) are not. Moreover, UPIRSOs are not limited to FDA regula ted studies and can also occur in non -FDA studies . The FDA provides a helpful example list of unique types of situations in may vary, depending on the IRB of record. An event that is unexpected, probably or definitely related, and immediately life -threatening to study subjects, must be reported to the IRB within 48 ho urs of learning of the event. If it is not immediately life -threatening, but meets the other criteria, it must still be reported to the IRB, but the timeframe for r eporting will be five days. The IRB has developed a decision tool available on their website for study teams to u se to help them determine if the event must be reported. https://www.utsouthwestern. edu/research/hrpp/assets/re_re_reporting_ta ble.pdf Safety Reporting to the FDA It is important to know who is responsible for safety reporting to the FDA. Per 21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)(i) , \"The sponsor must report any suspected adverse react ion that is both serious and unexpected (to the FDA and all participating institutions).\" For an investigator who holds an IND, the investigat or may be a sponsor -investigator assu ming the additional responsibilities of the sponsor. According to the FDA Gu idance on Safety Reporting for AE meets the definition of a suspected adverse reaction is usually t he most difficult determination, but this decision is critical to avoid the submission of uninformative IND safety reports. An AE is a suspect ed adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE, such a s: A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure, e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome. One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug, e.g., tendon rupture; or An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as k nown consequences of the underlying disease or conditio n under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events are occurring more frequently in t he drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 205 of 270 Timelines for reporting to the FDA: The event must be reported no later than 15 days after learning of the even - - If the event is Serious , Suspected and Unexpected The event must be reported no later than seven days (7) after learning of the even - - If the event is Life-threatening or Fatal , Suspected, and Unexpected There are several ways to repor t AEs to the FDA: Annual Progress Reports : The IND or IDE holder is required to submit annual reports to the FDA (21 CFR 312.33 ) on the progress of the clinical investigations. The annual report should include a summary of all adverse events. Safety Report: The IND or IDE holder must report all AE that are caused by or probably caused by the product under in vestigation. If the AE is alarming, the investigator shall report the AE immediately (within 24 hours of the investigator learning of the even t). Final Report: The IND or IDE holder must submit the final report shortly after completion of the investigation (21 CFR 312.64 ) Safety Reporting in Studies with FDA Approved IND Exem ption For an investigational drug study that is not being conducte d under an IND, i.e. t he study meets the FDA IND Exemption criteria, the FDA guidance states that post marketing safety reporting requirements still apply ( 21 CFR 310.305 , 314.80 , and 600.80 ). In this case, the FDA should still be notified by th e manufacturer, packer, and/or distributor of a marketed drug of serious, related, and unexpected adverse drug reaction. External UPIRSO's An External UPIRSO is a repo rt sent by a sponsor or IND holder that details an SAE occurring at another site involvi ng the same study drug. External UPIRSO' s may be routed differently depending on how each department or research program is set up to handle them . PIs are expected to review all External UPIRSO' s and corresponding action letters that relate to their study . If the action letter s tates the AE changes the risk/benefit ratio of the study, it will need to be submitted to the IRB with consent form changes. Reporting External UPIRSO's to the IRB UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 206 of 270 If significant safety issues are identified that alter the risk: benefit ratio, the IRB sho uld be promptly notified via a Reportable Event submission. If the event requires a revision to the informed consent f orm document in response t o an External UPIRSO action letter, a modification must be submitted to the IRB promptly , along with the External UPIRSO . Even if the External UPIRSO does not meet the criteria above, if the information is relevant to the study it may need to be submitted to the IRB using a Reportable Event (RE) Submiss ion through the eIRB . F. Reportable Event s: Noncompliance Noncompliance is defined as the failure to follow the federal regulations, state laws or institutional policies relevant to h uman subjects research, o r the IRB -approved protocol. The most common type of noncompliance occurs is a violation of the conduct of an IRB approved protocol. The research team should not conduct any procedures, visits, or interactions that are not specifi ed in the IRB approved pr otocol. If changes in the research are necessary f or the conduct of the study, a modifica tion must be submitted to and approved by the IRB prior to implementing the change. The one exception to this rule is when an immediate change is necessary to eliminat e an apparent immediate hazard to the study subjec ts. If this occurs, it must be immediat ely reported to the IRB. Failure to follow any of the following protocol activities as they are outlined in the approved protocol would resul t in noncompliance . Here are some examples : Recruitment Plan Informed Consent Process Inclusion/Exclusion (Eligibi lity) Criteria Randomization or Un -Blinding Procedures Procedures & Study Interventions PI / Medical Oversight Data & Safety Monitoring Plan Continuing noncompliance occurs after the initial report of noncompliance, and is defined by the UTSW HRPP as: A pattern of repeated noncompliance (in one or more protocols simultaneously or over time) which continues after initial discovery Includes inade quate efforts to take or implement corrective or preventive actions within a UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 207 of 270 reasonable timeframe For more inform ation on HRPP's policy regarding noncompliance, please go to 9.3 Noncompliance Review , 9.5 Reportab le Events Guidance , or -events/ ). G. Repor table Events: New Information Researchers are expected to report new informatio n to the IRB that affects the risks, benefits, or alternati ves to study participation. New information is a \"catch -all\" category for identification of unanticipated risks or fin dings that may affect a subject's willingness to take part in or continue participating in the study, and which may possibly lead to chang es of protocol. Some examples of new information that would require reporting to the IRB include: Changes in study st atus that are NOT specified in the protocol (e.g., early closure of a study, unexpected halt to enrollment due to safety concerns, etc.) Revised package inserts. Recent publications related to the study, study intervention, or subject population that conta in information that could have an impact on the subject's will ingness to continue participating. For more detailed information on new inf ormation and IRB reporting requirements, refer to the HS IRB website ( https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/research/hrpp/reportable -events/ ) and click on the Reportable Events link on the left side menu bar. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 208 of 270 Chapter 10: Subject Data Collection and Management A. Data Collection and Data Manage ment While the extent of study data collection and management can vary from study to study, study team members often feel that no matter how de tailed they are, it is perceive d as inadequate. That is a common frustration, and often a misperception. Study t eam m embers must focus on the collection of the critical data elements to avoid being overwhelmed collecting unnecessary data. If the critical data is not collected, or colle cted in an inconsistent, unstandardized manner, data integrity could be compromise d, and the study may never meet objectives. The FDA and ICH GCP require accurate, complete, and up to date clinical research documentation an d accurate records of all obser vations of each subject participating in the study. Documentation is the recording of all activities relating to the conduct of the research study and serves to substantiate the integrity of the data, confirm observations tha t are recorded, and verify the existence of subjects. Whether writing notes in a research chart, completing study worksheets and checklists, entering information in an electronic medical record, or collating communications (including email and telephone co rrespondence), documenting thes e activities is of the utmost importance. Without documentation, there is no data . Study documentation serves to verify all activities were completed as described in the protocol, ensure data integrity, and provide critical information to an auditor or monitor. Every step, from initial screening to last contact with a research subject must be verifiable. The research staff should maintain the following records accurately and completely in real time: Records of receipt, use, or disposition of a device or drug. Records of each subject's case history (to be described in more detail late r this chapter) and exposur e to device or drugs. All relevant observations, including records concerning adverse drug or device effects. If it is not documented, it did not happen. Refer to UT Southwestern's policy HSO -253 CLINICAL RESEARCH DOCUMENTATION IN THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD for additional guidance on creating sufficient documentation in the electronic health recor d (EHR). UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 209 of 270 B. Privacy and Confidentiality There are privacy and confidentiality expectatio ns when managing subject data and study rec ords in a healthcare setting. Subject data collected and managed for research can vary depending on the nature of the study. Some researcher s need to work with identifiable information, while others can work with subject data that has been de -identified. Knowing the correct t erminology for the identifiability of subject records is important: De-identified data: Data that has been stripped of a ll subject identifiers, including all HIPAA identifiers. If the data includes an indirect link to subject identifiers, e.g., via coded I D numbers, then the data is considered by the IRB to be coded, not de -identified. Please note that da ta can be considere d de-identified under the Common Rule, while NOT de - identified unde r the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Directly Identifiable Data: Information id entifying subjects is stored directly on data records. Indirectly Identifiable Data: Information iden tifying subjects is linked to data record but stored separately. Coded data: Coded data is stripped of all direct subject identifiers, but each record has its own study ID or code, which is linked to identifiable information such as name or medical record number. The linking file must be separate from the coded data set. The code itself shou ld not contain identifiers such as subject initials or medical recor d number. Anonymous Data: Anonymous data contains no direct or indirect links in the data record. The need to maintain confidentiality of private information, and of information that can be used to identify a particular individual, exists in virtually all studies in which data are collected from or about living individuals. In most research, maintaining confidentiality is a matter of following some established practices, for example: Limit ing access to records and documents that contain identified da -a - It is important to know the measures that will be implemented by your research team to prevent access to the identifiable subject information by unauthorized individuals, including paper and electronic forms of information. Storing research records in locke d cabinets and/or secured databas es - Consideration must be given to how data will be stored, transported, used, or disp layed on laptops or portable devices, on computers, or on servers managed by someone other than the research institution. Additional saf eguards that may need to be in place (e.g., link for coded data stored separately, de-identif ied data) to protect data f rom risk of breach of confidentiality, such as theft of a laptop, or loss of portable device. Staff should consult with IR Services abou t the necessary data security UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 210 of 270 measures to be taken. Taking measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of th ese document -s - When considering record storage needs, ta ke measures to prevent loss of data, or accidental or premature destruction. C. Source Documents The source data is the foundation of all clinical research studies. Not only do the source documents confirm complete and accurate data collection, but they also give tangible evidence that the study was conducted in an ethical manner acco rding to the protocol. Definition : A source document is the first place an observation or data point is recorded. Per ICH GCP E6 1.5 2, source documents are defined as \"Original documents, data, and records (e. g., hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subje cts' diaries or evaluation checklist s, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and rec ords kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, an d at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial)\". Examples of sourc e documents include: Medical records, including inpatient and outpatient clinic visit notes Subject visit notes, flowshe ets, physical exam notes, checklists, and AE lists Vital sign measurement recordings Clinical dictations, or notes taken during interact ions with the subject Signed consent form(s) Investigational product dispensing and administration records CT scans, X -rays, and MRI films and reports Laboratory, patholo gy, and surgery reports Subject -completed diaries, questionnaires, and surveys Inclusi on/exclusion (eligibilit y) checklist -specific worksheets or checklists Electronic Source (eSource) Documentation \"With the use of computerized systems for capturin g clinical investigation data, it is common to find at least some source data recorded electronically. Common examples include, but are not limited to , clinical data initially recorded in electronic health records maintained by healthcare providers and ins titutions, electronic laboratory reports, digital medical images from devices, and ele ctronic diaries completed by UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 211 of 270 study subjects.\" According to the September 2013 FDA guidance entitled, Electronic Source Data in Clinical Investigations , \"When original observations are entered directly in to a computerized system, the electro nic record is the source docum ent\". In some cases, the electronic record may need to be printed, for instance to allow a clinical inv estigator to document the clinical significance of abnormal laboratory findings. It i s important to remember that even if the data from the electronic r ecord is not printed, the investigator is responsible for providing auditors with access to the records that serve as the electronic source data. This statement is true for internal and ext ernal auditors and inspectors, i.e., FDA. D. Case Report Forms A Case Report Form (CRF) is a standard form used to capture protocol -required data in a consistent manner (pap er or electronic, referred to as an eCRF). CRFs are the key document ma nagement tools used in clinical research studies to collect t he protocol -required data in a standardized, consistent format. The data obtained must be usable and it is the responsibilit y of the study team to ensure all CRFs are legible, accurate, and compl ete. They also provide increased efficiency in proc essing a nd analyzing data. When studies are conducted at more than one site, CRFs allow the merging of data between sites. If the CRF is the first place a data element is recorded, it is also serving as the source document. This is common for documents th at are c ompleted by the subject, such as questionnaires, surveys, or diaries. It is also permissible in some circumstances for study s taff to enter data directly into a CRF or eCRF without first recordin g the data elsewhere, e.g., vital signs. This determi nation n eeds to be made prior to IRB submission and described in the protocol. Some research studies will outline how to correct erro rs made in the CRF. It is standard, best practice to correct an error in the CRF by lining through the incorrect data with a single line and write the correct information above. Include your initials, date, and the reason for the change. Correcting data th at is managed in electronic format can vary depending on the softwa re and the monitoring processes in place for the study. Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) The FDA defined eCRFs as instruments that serve as \"an auditable electronic record of informati on that generally is reported to the sponsor on each subject, according to a clinical investigation protocol. The eCRF ena bles clinical investigation data to be systematically captured, reviewed, UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 212 of 270 managed, sto red, analyzed, and reported.\" According to the September 2013 FDA guidance entitled, \"Electronic Source Data in Clinical Investigations ,\" \"Many data elements, e.g., bloo d pressure, weight, temperature, pill count, resolution of a symptom or sign ..., (are) obtain ed at a study visit and can be entered dir ectly into the eCRF by an authorized data originator if the study meets the 21 CFR 11 requirements. You can access th e document here: http://www .fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/U CM328691.pdf) This direct entry of data can eliminate error s by not using a paper transcription step before e ntry into the eCRF. For these data element s, the eCRF is the source. If a paper tran scription step is used, then the paper documentation should be retained and made available for FDA inspection and other au ditors as applicable. E. Case/Medical Histories The FDA refers to subject records and documentation as \"Case/Medical History.\" Regardles s of the format, paper or electronic, \"An inv estigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case hist ories that record all observations and other d ata pertinent to the investigation on each subjec t\" (CFR 312.62 ). Case history is a broad term used by the FDA to describe the CRFs and supporting source documents, including signed and dated consent forms and medical records (e.g., progress notes of the physician, the indivi dual's hospital chart(s), and the nurses' notes ) Case histories could be the only source of t his information Required documentation in clinical research includes records of: Informed Consent Process The case history for each i ndividual shou ld document that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study. This process could be ca ptured on a separate source document or be part of the initial visit progress note Medical history, often used as documentation to con firm that the subject met the study eligibility criteria Physical examination Investigational product accountability recor ds Investigational product dispensation, administration, and accountability records must be maintained Adverse event records (with gra de/sev erity and attribution) Records related to adverse events should be included in the subject's research chart. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 213 of 270 This is most often done using an AE log identifying the grade or severity and attribution, but it could be handwritten observation notes or m edical records if the subject was seen at another location Subject correspondence Correspondence with the subject should b e documented in the subject's research chart. The study records should also include correspondence with other entities about the subje ct, for ex ample communication with the coordinating center, CRO rg, or sponsor Documentation of noncompliance Any deviation f rom the protocol should be documented. This could be done by using a standard deviation form, or this could be documented in han dwritt en notes F. Note to File A Note to File (NTF) is a document that can be used to describe minor discrepancies or deficiencies that document the research staff's acknowledgement and potential explanation of the error or deficiency. Adding an NTF does not corr ect the error or ensure compliance , it simply allows additional information to be provided that would help someone else lo oking at the records to interpret the discrepancy or deficiency. An NTF could be used to document the reaso n for missed procedures, do cuments, or data, or to explain why there were protocol deviations. NTFs should be kept to a minimum. A significant numbe r could be a red flag for an individual not involved in the conduct of the study, giving the impression tha t the study was not conduct ed with the attention it needed. What a Note to File is: Documentation of missing or incomplete data. An NTF does not jus tify the missing data, but rather allows independent individuals to accurately reproduce the trail of the study data. Documentation o f an error in record keeping. An NTF could be documentation of an error in record keeping, or missing records. For example , if the subject didn't return their diary because they lost it. Explanation of how information was o btained or made available. An NT F could be an explanation of how information was obtained or made available. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 214 of 270 Clarify discrepancies. An NTF could clarify discrepancies. For example, if the subject forgot to bring unused study medication to their visit and mailed it instead, the NTF could explain why the date of drug return was a date other than the study visit. Reference to other documentation. An NTF coul d explain that the subject's visit occurred outside the study visit window because the subject was on an extended vacation. The NTF co uld also refer to the email sent by the subject in the correspondence section of the research chart. Explanation that the apparent missing records are stored in a different location. If the clinical investigator identified a problem during the conduct of the physical exam, a NTF could be added to the AE section of the chart to reference the physical exam note. What a Note t o File is not: The source document. An NTF cannot be used in place of the source document. It can be used to explain why the source do cument is missing, or filed in a separate location, but cannot replace the source. Only record of a deviation or noncompl iance event. An NTF does not replace the standard documentation of a deviation or noncompliant event, but rather, could be used to cla rify or explain the deviation in more detail. A Note to File should: Be generated on a case -by-case basis. Templates shou ld not be utilized since each event is unique . Include the date the NTF was written, subject ID, and the study title, with IRB number and PI name. Be legible . The document should be legible if handwritten. Explain the circumstances of the event . Clearly ex plain the reason for the error, omission, or discrepancy and the process it aims to address. CAPA. Include any c orrective and preventi ve action (CAPA) or follow -up, if applicable. NOTE: The purpose of the corrective and preventive action subsystem is to co llect information, analyze information, identify and investigate product and quality problems, and take appr opriate and effective corr ective and/or preventive action to prevent their recurrence. For more information on how to write an effective CAPA, refer to: Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) | FDA Signed. Create a signature section at the bottom of the document. The document should be signed UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 215 of 270 and dated by the individual who is writing it and the PI ( if applicable). Be filed w ith the subject document it refers to. An NTF can help someone, such as an auditor, looking at the records to interpret the discrepancy or deficiency an d to trace the trail of events to recreate the data. An NTF could also be detrimental if not accurate a nd complete. For example, an NTF that only includes a statement that the subject did not receive the study drug could raise more concerns and questions, rather than explain a de ficiency or deviation. G. Electronic Data Management When storing study data elec tronically, there is additional guidance that should be considered. ICH GCP 5.5 (Trial Management, Data Hand ling and Record Keeping) When using electronic trial data handling and/or remote electronic trial data systems, additional system requirements should be met: Ensure and document that the electronic data management system requir ements have been thoroughly t ested for completeness, accuracy, reliability, and consistent intended performance, referred to as validation. Maintain SOPs for using these systems. Ensure that the system has an audit t rail. Ensure that the systems are design ed to permit data changes in such a way that the data changes are documented and that there is no deletion of entered data. This mea ns that an edit record or audit trail must be maintained to demonstrate when the dat a was entered and verified, and all chan ges along the way. Ensure tha t the system prevents unauthorized access to the data. Maintain a list of the roles or individuals who are authorized to make data changes. Maintain adequate backup of the data. Best pra ctices: Electronic data management optio ns should be explored for the reasons mentioned above. Researchers are discouraged from using a spreadsheet program to enter and mai ntain study data. A secure system designed for managing study data, such as a clinical trial management system ( VELOS ) or an electronic data captur e system (REDCap) is more appropriate. If the only option is a spreadsheet, do not include identifiers, such as subject names and medical record numbers. H. Study Drug Dispensation , Administration and Accountability UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 216 of 270 The \"investigator i s responsible for ... th e control of drugs under investigation\" ( 21 CFR 312.60 ). This means the principal investigator must maintain records of the product's delivery to the s ite, the inventor y at the site, the use by each subject, and the final disposition of the study drug, i.e., return to t he sponsor or alternative disposition of unused product. These records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial number s, expiration dates if applica ble, and the unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product(s) and study subjects. Princi pal investigators should maintain records that adequately document that the subjects were provided the doses specified by th e protocol a nd reconcile all investigational product(s) received from ll of the investi gator's/institution's duties for investigational product(s) accountability at the study site(s) to an appropriate pharmacist or anothe r appropriate individual who is under the supervision of the investigator/institution\" ( ICH GCP 4.6.2 ). Per UT Southwestern 's Policy Handbook (RES-161) USE OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS AND STUDY DRUGS IN CLINICAL RESEARCH , \"It is UT Southwestern policy th at all IP, study drugs, and placebo used for clinical research, including Foo d and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved medications and non -FDA approved investigational products, must be overs een by the UT Southwestern Medical Center Investigational Drug Ser vices (IDS) Pharmacy, and must be handled consistently and in accordance with study protocols, as well as with all UT Southwestern policies regarding procurement, storage, inventory control, dispensation, and destruction of investigational products and stu dy drugs. \" Investigators conducting clinical drug studies must contact the IDS in advance for each clinical drug research projec t to obtain an institutional feasibility assessment, Pharmacy/ IDS budget estimate, and to determine drug handling requirements . Study drugs will be handled (defined as receipt, storage, preparation, dispensing, and destruction) by the pharmacy/ IDS or IDS- approved delegate. At its discretion, IDS may delegate study drug handling activities to the investigator if both the study an d investigato r meet specific IDS delegation criteria and sponsor approval. Such delegation will be confirmed in writing and stipul ate the conditions under which the delegation is being awarded. Delegated studies require IDS involvement prior t o subject enr ollment and may be audited for compliance with study drug distribution procedures and institutional policy throughout the study. For additional information about IDS and its services in support of clinical research activiti es at UT Southwester n, please refer to Chapter 1 1: General Support Services. Within this chapter, the terms dispensation, administration and distribution are defi ned as follows: DISPENSATION: Dispensation is the pouring or placing of drugs from stock supplies into UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 217 of 270 bottles or containers; the labeling of such items with the patient's name, medication, dosage and directions; and the giving of such bottles or containe rs to personnel for administering to patients. Dispensing medication requires a licensed pharmacist wh o is responsible for pr eparation and labeling of the medication. After preparation and labeling, the pharmac ist's role in the research setting most commo nly includes providing the medication to either the distributor or licensed personnel who w ill administer the medication. ADM INISTRATION: Administration of medication refers to executing the instructions, i.e., physician orders, for medication delivery. I t is the act of providing medication to the participant and either observing the intake or active delivery of the medication v ia injection or another specified route. If the medication requires delivery through an IV, it requires licensed personnel specifi cally trained in medication administration. The five rights of medication administration a re applicable to all clinical resea rch studies that involve a drug : Right drug Right client ( e.g., research participant) Right dose Right route Right time Most ofte n, a non -licensed CRC does not dispense or administer the investigational product, but rather, distributes the study drug to s ubjects based on the instructions in the protocol (i.e., following blinding and randomization rules ), as applicable. DISTRIBUTION : Distribution of medi cation is the act of providing (packaged) medication to the research partic ipant. For packaged medicatio n, the subject is most often instructed to self - administer the medication at future date(s ). When distributing medications to res earch subjects, it is the responsibility of the individual distributing the study drug to ensure the correct medication is giv en to the correct research subject. The five rights of medication administration (described above) can also be applied during the proces s of medication distribution and will provide the systematic approach needed to ensure safe ty to the participant and adh erence to the research protocol. Using a systematic UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 218 of 270 approach each time and strict adherence to each step cannot be over emphasized . Omis sion of one step may cause an error to occur. LABELING: Labeling of medication will vary d epending on the research prot ocol's specific instructions, but there are some requirements that apply to all investigational drugs. According to 21 CFR 312.6(a) , \"the immediate package of a n investigational new drug intended for human use shall bear a label with the stateme nt \"Caut ion: New D rug - Limited by Federal (o r United States) law to investigational use.\" In addition, \"the label or labeling of an investigational new drug shall not bea r any statement that is false or misleading in any particular and shall not represent that the investigational new drug is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated .\" (21 CFR 312.6(b) During study initiation, it is important to meet with representatives from IDS to discuss the information that will appear on the medication label. This will hel p to determine how best to verify the righ t medication was distributed to the right subject. Tips for Distributing Medication to Research Subjects: The study staff distrib uting medications should: Verify the medication and particip ant's information with another staff member prior to dispensing the medication to the participant. This requires that both staff members check the particip ant's name and/or identification number, medication name, dose, and route of administration. Verify patient information on the label. When medication is distributed to the participant, the participant should state two unique identifiers aloud, while study staff read and re -verify information on t he medication label. Have the participant spell their name , state their subject number, or date of birth. It is important that the subject gives the information aloud instead of verifying a statement by staff. It is not enough to ask the person , \"Is your n ame______ ?.\" If the participant has an arm band , check it against the medication, also. Verify drug information on label inclu ding drug name, strength, formulation, and quantity. Verify protocol number. Verify any drug -specific ID# number (kit# or bottle n umber), if applicable The point of transfer to patient is the last in the line of checks to ensure correct distribution of med ication. If there are any doubts about the correctness of the medication, the process should be stopped immediately and rechecked. Provide wr itten instructions to the participan t regarding dosing time, number of pills or capsules, and route of administrati on. It is good practice to have the participant read through UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 219 of 270 the instructions and repeat the information back. \"The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator/inst itution, should explain the correct use of the investigational product(s) to each subject and should check, at intervals appropriate for the trial, that each subject is following the instructions properly\" ( ICH GCP 4.6.6 ). Appropriate actions should be taken to ensure study drug compl iance. Errors \"The investigator should ensure that the investigational product(s) are used only in accor dance with the approved p rotocol\" ( ICH GCP 4.6.5 ). Medication distribution errors are serious. Such a n error may cause an AE in a study subject, cause the subject to be di squalified, or the subject's data to be eliminated from the analysis. In some instances, it may r esult in the study being suspended. When distributing medications to participants, it is important to ensure the correct medication is given to the correct research participant. It is impossible to be too careful when distributing medications to study par ticipants. When an error occurs, it is the responsibility of the study team to report the occurrence to the PI immediately. He/she is responsible for determining follow -up activities. It may be necessary to report the i nformation to the IRB and the DSM gro up, if applicable, working with the study. In addition, SOP or guidelines for distributin g medications specific to individual programs or departm ents may need to be addressed, as well. I. Data Integrity: Ongoing Complianc e Monitoring Data collection is the p rocess of accumulating and documenting all required study information and observations oc curring during the defined study period. The importance of accurate data collection and documentation cannot be overemphasized. Me mbers of the research team work hands -on gathering data for clinical trials, including recording information, reviewing medica l records, obtaining, processing and storing samples, and much more. Research data and documentation must be accurate. Every stud y should incl ude a series of checks a nd balances prior to, during and after the conduct of a study. The following are common t erminology used in compliance monitoring. Terminology Data Integrity: refers to maintaining and ensuring data is high quality (v alid, accurate, and consistent). Data integrity covers the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data over its entire lif ecycle throughout a study . Data integrity is crucial for any organizatio n as it ensures that UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 220 of 270 the data they rely on to make decisio ns is trustworthy and reliable. Hum an error can have a significant impact on data integrity. For example, data entry errors, s uch as mistyping a number or letter, can cause data to be inaccurate. FDA guidance documents refer to the acronym ALCOA when deter mining data integrity: Attributable : It should be clear who has collected the data /performed the action and when it occurred Legible: It should be readable with identifiable signatures Contemporaneous: The information should indicate the accurate date/time the action was performed OR the data was collected Original: The investigator should have the original source document Accura te: Accurate, consistent and free of errors Complia nce: [ICH GCP E6 1.15 ] Complianc e a dherence to all study -related requirements, GCP requirements, and applicable regulatory requirements. There are several factors, such as excessive workload, that c an help create situations where protocol deviations are more likely. Research p ersonnel should balance their workload, ask for help when needed and delegate responsibilities when possible. Nevertheless, mistakes and the unexpected will happen. Research staff must be r esilient enough to overcome the obstacles that come their way, and not resort to falsifying or fabricating data...the over -all success of the study depends on it. Establishing a process for ongo ing self -assessments can help a study be \"audit -ready\" as well as ensuring that it meets the standards for conduct set by the inst itution, sponsor, and federal regulations. The following are t ips to verify consistency of CRFs with source documentation and to help stay \"audit - ready\": If a subject is taking a medication for a specific indicati on, the indication should be included on th e medical history form If the subject takes a medication to treat an AE symptom, the medication should be included on the conc omitant med ication log with consistent start and stop dates If symptoms are recorde d at one visit they should be followed for the course of the study If a subject completes any kind of diary, the study team should query any handwritten notes to determine i f AEs occurred Data Discrepancy is a difference between the source and the CRF (electronic and/or paper format), within a single document, or across documents (di fferent source documents or CRFs). UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 221 of 270 When the study team finds discrepancies, there are proced ures to follow to resolve the discrepancy in paper format: Draw one horizontal line through the error. Add/Insert the correct data. Initial and date the change. DO NOT retrospectively date the item. Put in the current date when the change occurs. DO NOT ERASE, scribble out, or use correction fluid or any other means that could obscure the original entry. Resolving discrepancies in a n electronic format can vary depe nding on the software and the monitoring processes in place for the study. Study Monitor of Record Upon request by the PI or PI Designee, the Study Monitor of Record (SMoR ) service can be contracted to satisfy independent study monitoring requirements in accordance with FDA and ICH GCP standards. Acting as a SMoR includes ongoing monitoring of st udy data, study documentation and subject safety throughout the life cycle of t he study. At UT Southwestern, this means that for most PI-initiated studies where an IND/IDE is involved , the same monitor will return to the site . However, t he PI (IND/IDE) hol der does have the option to hire an outside source for monitoring. In those latter situations, it is up to the outside source to w ork with the PI for making arrang ements to have th e SMoR return for all reviews . Routine Review (RR) A routine review is usua lly a one -time QA review , although additional on -site review s may be warranted due to findings discovered during the first visit. For instance, s ome initial visits lead to follow -up/additional visits (based on the number enrolled and how many subjects reco rds need to be looked at) , and sometimes a visit is scheduled to observe the consent process if subject s are still being enrolled. Protocols will be selected for routine review and prioritized based on, but not limited to, the level of risk . The level of r isk in a risk assessment score can vary due to many factors including: the population included in the study, the situations encoun tered by the participants, and/ or the experience of the researcher or team , among others . In fact, t wo studies may appear sim ilar, but a few factors could make one inherently riskier than the other. Moreover, p rotocols may be scheduled for repeated audits based on compliance results. For Cause Monitoring A \"for cause\" monitoring visit is a one -time review conducted at the reque st of an administrative UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 222 of 270 official, entity, or agency , alth ough more often than not these initial visits require additional follow - up visits. For-cause monitoring is conducted when concerns regarding research compliance, protocol adherence, or subject safety are brought to the attention of the reviewing IRB and may be initiated by the UT Southwestern IRB or other internal or external s takeholder s. What do auditors in spect? All IRB correspondence (submissions, email correspondence, etc.) Dated, IRB -approved c onsent forms Adherence to inclusion and exclusion criteria via individual subje ct's eligibility in source documents AE, including those reported to IRB as necessar y Whether the study staff is following protocol Whether the team is reporting any procedural changes Ongoing Compliance Assessments Available Through UTSW The following section will now delve into the specific departments that can assist the teams with maintaining compliance at UTSW. Quality Assurance and Monitoring (QAM) The UTSW Quality Assu rance and Monitoring (QAM) Office within the Human Research Prot ection Program (HRPP) focuses on serving the needs of UTSW researc h professionals by ident ifying areas of improvement and providing assistance to address them. The QAM office is vital in promo ting and maintaining ethical research that is compliant with institutional policies, state and federal regulations, and best pract ices for protecting huma n subjects by reviewing and monitoring human research studies as well as conducting QA reviews of the activities of the IRB and HRPP Department. The objectives of the QAM Program are to: Develop and maintain mechanism(s) to receiv e and review requests for compliance reviews Conduct reviews to ensure compliance with GCP guidelines, in conjunction with the provisi ons of IRB -approved protocols, and federal, state, local and institutional regulations Work closely with investigators and research support teams to address areas of improvement that have been identified Develop and distribute clinical research compliance materials to serve as guidance for institutional, investigator, and research support staff UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 223 of 270 Team Responsibilities for the QAM incl ude: 1. Study Monitoring 1. Research studies (routine and for -cause) 2. Institutional Review Board (IRB) records 3. HRPP activities and records 2.

Ongoing Comp liance Assessments within the UTSW Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and support staff operate independently of the CRO rg and PRMC. This committee is responsible for conducting risk -based monitoring for adver se events and protocol compliance and auditing for many UT Southwestern Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCC C) trials based on a risk -level process . The committee UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 224 of 270 accomplishes this through establishing a risk level for all newly activated can cer-related clinical trials; conducting annual comprehensive reviews fo r studies where the Simmons Cancer Center's DSMC is the DSMC of record, including evaluation of ongoing monitoring activities; conducting quarterly safety reviews; and conducting risk -based trial auditing. Some sponsored studies may also get listed for review b y DSMC even if UTSW is not the DSMB of recor d, based on their risk level. In addition, the DSMC staff conducts compliance reviews , known as Internal Audits (IAs). Internal Audit s Internal audits (IAs) are conducted once per year on IITs conducted at the UTSW SCCC and its affiliates. This is usually done only for studies with a pre-determined risk level of moderate or high. Low-risk studies may be reviewed by the DSMC but are usua lly not audited. However, these low-risk studies may be audited if the DOT has not had any other study audited within the past year. During an IA, the compliance team will review: A select number of su bject cases for protocol compliance and documentation . Regulatory documents for adherence to regulatory guidelines, reporting of SAEs, approval of protocol amendments, etc. Drug accountability records. An internal audit report is generated and sent to the PI. If a response from the team is required, a Corre ctive and Preventive Action (CAPA) plan is put together by the PI to address any deficiencies that were cited in the audit. The DSMC reviews it at their next meeting and determines if it is acceptable. Consequences of Improperly Collected or Documented Da ta Inability to answer research questions accurately. Inability to repeat and validate the study. Distorted findings resulting in wasted resources. Dissemination of misinformation may lead other researchers to pursue fruitless avenues of inves tigation. Com prom ised public policy decisions. Potential for harm to human participants and animal subjects. Investigators participating in academic misco nduct or fraud may lead to loss of job, reputation, or legal prosecution. For any questions about quality assurance and monitoring through the SCCC, please go to Clinical UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 225 of 270 Research Office: Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Cent -r - UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX or call : 214-648-7097 . J. Research Sample and Specimen Collection, Handling, Processin g and Management Research samples and specimens should be collected as outlined in the protocol or the laboratory manual of procedures (MOP). If there are questions about specimen collection, they should be resolved prior to initiating the protocol. Coded Private Information Research with cod ed private information or specimens involves human subjects if: The private information or specimens were collected specifically for the curr ently proposed research project through an interaction or intervention with l iving individuals; or The investigator(s) can readily ascertain the identity of the individual(s) to whom the coded private information or specimens pertain. Research with coded privat e information or specimens does not involve human subjects if: The priv ate information or specime ns were not collected specifically for the currently proposed research project through an interaction or intervention with living individuals; and The in vestig ator(s) cannot readily ascertain the identity of the individual(s) to w hom the coded private info rmation or specimens pertain. Sample Quality The quality of any laboratory test result is dependent on many variables, the first of which begins with the tech nician. The technician's care, skill, and knowledge when preparing the patient and specimen are essential to the provision of the highest quality standards for testing and services. The subject must first be properly prepared so that the best possibl e spec imen can be collected. Next, the actual collection of the specimen must be completed. Then, the s pecimen should be properly processed, packaged and transported to the laboratory in a timely manner and under environmental conditions that will not comp romise the integrity of the specimen. Preparing samples for testing is one of the most routine, yet most critical, processes to ensure accurate results in the clinical laboratory. Improperly handled samples can give misleading results and compromise the fu nction of diagnostic instruments. Health and Safety Precautions Use universa l precautions when handlin g specimens containing blood or other potentially infectious material. This includes proper personal protective equipment. This refers to protective clot hing, nitrile or latex gloves, goggles, or other garments or equipment design ed to protect the wearer's body from injury UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 226 of 270 or exposure. Work areas contaminated with biological specimens must be disinfected immediately with 10% bleach (hypochlorite at 0.5% fi nal co ncentration) or other approved disinfectant. In the event of an exposure, administer firs t aid immediately, notify a manager or supervisor, and seek prompt medical attention. Specimens must be handled in a safe manner and according to applicable leg al req uirements or guidance. Information on safe specimen handling ma y be obtained from the U.S . Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In handling human specimens, the goal is to protect healthcar e work ers and ancillary staff, as well as the general public, from ex posures to blood and to ot her potentially infectious body fluids. This includes all individuals involved in the transportation of specimens. All samples must be considered to be infectiou s. Use of \"universal precautions\" handling. Never assume any sample i s \"safe.\" Specimen Labels All specimens should be labeled at the time of collection with patient identifiers (usually a subject ID number), however additional information on the label ma y be s ite, department, or study specific. Be sure to check the MOP di rections fo r proper specimen labeling since some identifiers may not be utilized by the PI . A subject ID (or other unique code) is always required. Date of collection The second patient i dentif ier may be one of the following: o Date of birth (month/date/year ) o Other unique patient identifier also on the test requisition, e.g., hospital, office ID code, or file number o Requisition number or specimen barcode label o Other barcode labels can be use d if barcode matches the unique identifiers on the pr inted requisitio n. The barcode does not need to be human readable. NOTE : Location -based identifiers are generally not acceptable, e.g., hospital room number or street address. If the label is handwritt en, use an alcohol resistant pen. If glass slides are submitted, use a pencil for labeling the frosted end. When transferring a specimen to a container other than the tube used to draw the sample, e.g., transfer vials, also indicate specimen type on the la bel, e .g., serum, plasma, urine. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 227 of 270 Packaging and Shipping Any person w ho offers for commercial transport ( e.g., Fed-Ex, UPS, DHL, etc.) any biological materials (infectious or not) must meet the transport requirements set forth by the Code of Federal Regula tions Chapter 49, and the International Air Transport Association (IA TA). One of these requirements is proper training with regard to packaging and shipping biological specimens . The US Department of Transportation (D oT) and the International Civil Aviat ion Or ganization (ICAO) regulate the shipment/transportation of items classified as Hazardous Materials (HM) or Dangerous Goods (DG). Any University faculty, staff, or students needing to ship hazardous materials or dangerous goods must comply with the tra nsport ation standards esta blished by The Office of Safety and Busines s Continuity (OSBC) . The OSBC, working in coordination with the Chemical Safety Committee (CSC), the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), and the Radiation Safety Advisory Committee ( RSAC), is responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws, r egulations, and best practices in the transport of hazardous materials. More information about this topic can be found in the UT Southwestern Policy Handbook: EHS-102 Intra -Campus Transport of Hazardous Materials .. By law, anyone who packs, ships, transports, or receives dangerous goods must be trained to perform these activities properly. The training is made available thr ough t he UT Southweste rn's OSBC, and the Shipping of Biological Substances (IATA) training , both initial and refresher, are now offered online for UT Southwestern personnel who will be shipping biological materials. Please log into Taleo for access. If you have any questions, please contact Biosafety at biosafety@utsouthwestern.edu or call 214-645-1317. The initial and refresher training courses require annual Bloodborne Pathogen Training before a certif icate of completion can be issued. These courses in Taleo are three hours each and include the following: Pertinent regulatory definitions and shipping classifications covering dangerous goods (including infectious substances) The process to determine whet her a bi ological materi al is exempt from regulation Proper procedures to package and label infe ctious substances for shipment by ground and by air The physical properties and hazards of dry ice The proper usage and packaging of dry ice Question and answer sessions UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 228 of 270 Hands -on exerc ises Exam IATA certification is valid for two years. The OSBC offers a refresher class for personnel who have previously attende d the initial training class through our institution or have a v alid certificate through Saf-T-Pak or DG I. Indiv iduals who have received certification from other online companies or institutions must take our initial training class. REMEMBER: i f you need to ship bacterial samples, viruses, human or animal blood, serum , urine, tissue, cell lines, organs, etc ., with or without dry ice, this training is for you . DO NOT ship biological materials if you don't have a current certification . Finally, it should be noted that the shipper bears ultimate legal responsibility and liability for properly performing these tasks. T he following are the minimum specimen packaging guidelines that should be followed when submitting specimens. The hazardous material to be ship ped must be placed in a securely closed, water tight, leak - proof, primary container with labeled contents. All spe cimen container caps and lids should be properly tightened to prevent leakage Sufficient absorbent material should be included within the seco ndary container to completely absorb the conte nts in case of a spill. Several primary containers can be pl aced in a durable, watertight container that acts as a secondary container Properly complete the requisition or required form, if necessary. An itemi zed list of contents should be placed between the secondary container and the outer package Collect the spe cimen(s) and transfer to a proper transport container, if needed. Double check the specimen container to ensure it is not beyond its stated expirati on date If the specimen has been classified as an \"infectious substance,\" transport in a box designed to wit hstand 9 5kPa of pressure to meet national and federal shipping requirements (i.e., IATA, DoT) Important : Failur e to meet regulatory requirements when shipping hazardous material or dangerous goods may result in citations, fines, or imprisonment. Fines to the univ ersity can range from $250 to $500,000 per violation. Individual resea rchers and shippers may be subject to criminal penalties of up to $500,000 and five years' imprisonment. Do not take any unnecessary risks! If you are unsure whether you are al lowed to perform a specific task related to shipping items, or just require as sistance with packing and shipping biological specimens, please reach out to the OSBC . UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 229 of 270 Information specific to IATA Shipping of Dangerous Goods/Biological Substance Training is located here: IATA Shipping of Dangerous G oods / Biological Substance Training Schedule - Safety and Business Continuity (utsouthwestern.net) . Frozen Specimens Frozen specimens must be transported in insulated containers surrounded by an amount of dry ice sufficient to keep the speci men frozen u ntil it reaches the laboratory. Thawed specimens are almost alway s unsuitable for analysis. Dry ice is considered hazardous during transport for three reasons: Explosion hazard : Dry ice releases a large volume of carbon dioxide gas as it subli mates. If packaged in a container that does not allow for release of the gas, the package may explode, causing personal injury or property damage. Suffocatio n hazard : A large volume of carbon dioxide gas emitted in a confined or poorly ventilated space may create an o xygen deficient atmosphere. Contact hazard : Dry ice is a cryogeni c material that causes severe frostbite upon contact. Packages containing dry ice must allow for: Gas venting : Packages must allow for the release of carbon dioxide gas while in transit . Dry ice must never be sealed in a container with an airtight seal. While in tran sit, as the dry ice evaporates, the courier will replace the lost weight with additional dry ice. Therefore, make sure that the amount of dry ice contained in the shi pment is acc urate. Package integrity : A package containing dry ice must be of adequate strength to withstand the loading and unloading normally encountered in transport. The package must also prevent any loss of contents that might be caused by vibration o r by changes in temperature, humidity, or altitu de. Package materials : Do not use plastics that can be rendered brittle or permeable by the temperature of dry ice. This problem can be avoided by using commercially available packages intended to contain dry ice. The f ollowing are not requirements, but s uggested best practices for o ptimal specimen documentation : While the samples are stored in a freezer, a temperature log should be maintained. Personnel should maintain records of shipping training that must be renewed e very 24 months. Filling in and signing a shipment 's airway bill provides documentation of the shipment. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 230 of 270 Records of shipments should be maintained for two years following the shipment UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 231 of 270 Chapter 11: Clinical Research Resources There are various entities wi thin the UT Southwestern clinical research envir onment that offer additional services to support ongoing efforts in research in the areas of technology support, general support, and governance resources.

Click on the link to go directly to their FAQ section : Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) Office of Clinical Trial Management - Performance Site Review (PSR) Form Protocol R eview and Mon itoring System (PRMS) Regulatory Support Office (RSO) Research Staff Credentialing Office Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC) UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 247 of 270 Institutional Bios afety Committee (IBC) QUESTION ANSWER I am submitting an application for a Principal Investigator and when I try to enter their information, it is not populating. What should I do? Please reach out to Biosafety@utsouthwestern.e du for assistance with updating the system records. I am submitting an application for a Principal Investigator (PI), how do I know the submission has been received? Once an applicant submits an application, the PI will receive a system notification i ndicating that a registration has been submitted on their behalf. The PI needs to log into the system and certify the submission. Once the submission is certified, the certification status will change from \"Pending\" to \"Completed .\" How long is the IBC r eview period? o Human Subject Gene Transfer registration (investigational drug). After an application has been received, the review period is 60 - 90 days. o Human Subject Human Materials registration (sample collection only). After an application has been received, the review period is 15 - 45 days. When will an approval letter be available? Approval letters will be available in the system no later than 5 business days after the IBC authorizes the registration. For any other IBC questions , email Biosafety@utsouthwestern.edu . UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 248 of 270 Office of Clinical Trial Management: Performance Site Review (PSR) Form QUESTION ANSWER Will this form replace the Children's and Parkland performance site re view form as well? No, t his new PSR form is only applicable for clinical research activities done on UT Southwestern premises. This includes hospital -based, ambulatory, and academic spaces. Children's will continu e to use their current PSR form in Velos. P arkland has a separate f orm in REDCap. When should I submit the UT Southwestern performance review form? To ensure timely review of your study and Greenlight activation, you should submit your PSR form to the Off ice of Clinical Trials Management (OCTM) wh en IRB submission is completed and IRB is at \"Waiting assignment stage\" in Velos. Our review process also uses information from the cost coverage analysis (if applicable). Therefore, timely submission of the cost coverage analysis will further enable a fas ter review completion ti meline. My study is conducted by UT Southwestern personnel, but all study related procedures will be performed at Children's Medical Center or Parkland Health and Hospital System, do I sti ll need to submit for UT Southwestern perfo rmance site review? If UT Southwestern is selected as a site in eIRB, limited entry into the PSR form is required. In the scenario described, select UT Southwestern as a site in eIRB, which will cue up the UT Sout hwestern PSR form. If no study - related acti vities will be conducted at UT Southwestern in this scenario, answer only the first question on the form and submit. OCTM will review the submission and if no study - related activities will occur on UT Southwester n premises, the study will be labeled a \": \"Performance Si -e - Appro val Not Requir ed.\" This designation will NOT trigger \"Greenli ght\". Can I leave a question blank? Is entering 'N/A' necessary? If a question does not apply it can be left blank. There is no need to enter 'not applicable.' Why does \"Section 2: Participants \" only ask for the number of subjects at UT Southwestern? We are reviewing and approving only activities conducted at UT Southwestern, therefore only volunteers who enroll and participate in the study at UT Southwestern need to be listed. If your study is also conducted at one of our affiliated institutions, performance site approval is required by those institutions. Even if the only activity at another site is subject recruitm ent, performance site approval is still required. Is the location given in \"Sec tion 3\" the only approved location for the study? YES, you are only approved to perform the tasks noted in the respective areas. Should this information change during the condu ct of the study, an updated form should be submitted for review and approval. What if more procedures are needed than will fit in the space provided? If your study requires more procedures than the form allows, place list all remaining procedures in the last text field. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 249 of 270 What if my study uses an ancillary service not available in the form? For ancillary services not provided in the form you may list the service/test and the detailed location in the Procedure portion of \"Section 3: Locati on\" (Example: Pulmonary function test, echocardiogram, dermatology evaluati on, etc. would be listed in this section) What if coordinators do not have knowledge of where a procedure should be conducted? Please provide as much detail about the procedure as possible and OCTM will assist the team in finding the ancillary service tha t can perform the proced ure. What if the exact procedure is not known ahead of time (for example: biopsy of tumor deposit - cannot predict where the tumor deposit might be located) . Please provide as much detail as known about the procedure in case, and p referably also list the most commonly anticipated situations Isn't asking for the number of tests per participant in the entire study misleading as adverse events would cause chang es to this number? Please list all procedures along with the number of time s it will be performed a s described in the protocol. We understand that unforeseen events can occur which might require additional testing on a case -by-case basis. Do ALL IATA -certified study team members need to be listed? List only the names of the indi viduals who are assigned to ship samples for the respective study. Should all study -related tests and procedures be listed on the PSR form, or only those billed to researc h? You should ONLY list services that are for research -only and thus billed back to the research team. Servi ces billed to insurance/patient (standard of care) should NOT be listed on this form. Why does the Radiology section not ask for the imaging tests requested? The reviewers in the Department of Radiology use the Imaging manual and S tudy Protocol to determi ne the specific study needs. Radiology staff will also consult with you if questions arise. In \"IP maintenance\" section, what if coordinator does n ot know the intensity? Please provide your best estimate based on your understanding of the study. The team reviewing this section will adjust the intensity level if needed. What does the institutional review process entail? The institutional review entai ls several different important aspects geared to ensure your study is conducted in a safe environment and th at all services involved are aware and available to help you perform your study. Examples of our review include: 1. confirm that all research person nel listed on your protocol have completed their annual research credentialing; 2. r eview of your completed PSR form and study protocol to determine what UT Southwestern resources and services will be needed to conduct your study. Those services will be no tified to perform a review and ensure they can conduct your research according to th e protocol; 3. ensure th e location of each research volunteer encounter is adequate and safe; 4. coordinate with the cost coverage analysis team to ensure all research -only UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 250 of 270 procedures/services are correctly identified; 5. create a summary of all approved a ctivities for the respec tive study, along with respective identifiers (CPT codes) or anticipated cost. How quickly can I expect to have my study approved? All studies are reviewed by OCTM as soon as they are submitted. Studies which involve minimal UT Sou thwestern resources (i.e ., chart reviews, retrospective studies, observational studies with minimal testing, etc.) undergo a fast-track review and approval (approximately o ne week). More complex studies which require review, approval, and coordination amon g multiple ancillary ser vices may take up to 3-4 weeks to complete review. OCTM meets twice a month with a review committee comprised of our Medical Director, Associate Dea n of Clinical Research, and representatives from various ancillary services to facil itate the review and coo rdination among ancillary services and minimize time to approval for your study. If the performance site form is not submitted until after IRB submission, will it delay receipt of ancillary pricing? The new performance site review process will have an earlier timeline during the research review cycle, as it is a required component of \"Greenli ght\". Institutional research prices (including the CRU and IDS pricing menu) are published in the Velos library. Study teams should use these published prices for the purpose of budget negotiations. To obtain general information about special research - only testing/procedures not listed in Velos, or if you hav e specific questions about the availability or feasibility of a test/procedure, please r each out either to OCTM or the respective ancillary service to discuss your project. Once you have a final protocol and you are committed to conducting the study, early submission to IRB and Performance Site Review is key to obtaini ng \"Greenli ght\" in a tim ely fashion. Will prici ng still be available in Velos? Yes, the Velos price library is the best place to obtain the most current research prices approved by UT Southwestern. According to UT Southwestern policy, prices for research - related CPT codes should be taken directly from Velos. In Section 3: \"Location\" of the form, how is Cancer Center defined and what areas does it include? This section is focused on whe re study -related activities will be physically conducted. The Cancer Center option is for activities that will physical ly occur on Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) premises, e.g., main SCCC clinics on campus or outlying clinics owned by SCCC. For any other Performance Site Approval questions at UT Southwestern, you may call 214 -648-7553 (OCTM), email OCTM@UTSouthwestern.edu , or attend OCTM's Open Office Hours. The w eekly Virtual Open Office Hours Sessions are Tuesdays & Thursdays 10:00am - 11:00am. Request the virtual meeting link as an outlo ok calendar invite by cont acting the OCTM via email . UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 251 of 270 Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) QUESTION ANSWER Does my study require Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC) review in eIRB ? To determine whether PRMC review is required, we must first determine if the st udy is, \"Cancer Related.\" Cancer -related outcomes or other study endpoints may reflect clinical treatment or quality of life, change in attitudes/beliefs or behaviors, or healthc are delivery for either solid tumors or hematology/ hematologic malignancies. Such studies can occur at any point along the cancer care continuum, including screening and early detection, diagnosis and treatment including palliation and symptom management, through survivorship, as well as end of life and ho spice. These studies then may include enrollment or measurements of any of the following: 1) cancer patients, their caregivers or relatives 2) or cancer clinical care team members, 3) or individuals target ed for cancer prevention activities including lifes tyle change, 4) or the ass essment of cancer epidemiologic, imaging, or biological markers. Thus, to the question, \"Are the primary or secondary outcomes of the study aims cancer -related? \" if your study meets this criteri on answer \"Yes\" to question *7.7 in the eIRB Smartform when co mpleting the study submission questionnaire. Studies that do not meet this criterion should answer \"No\" to question *7.7 in the eIRB Smartform when completing the study s ubmission questionnaire. For any other PRMC questions, plea se refer to: https://www.utsouthwestern.net/intranet/departments - centers/cancer/research/pr mcguidance.html . UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 252 of 270 Regulatory Support Office (RSO) ClinicalTrials.gov Support Program FAQs QUESTION ANSWER Who should register the study in ClinicalTrials.gov? Regulation requires that the \"Responsible Party\" registers and submits results for \"applicable clinical trials\" of drugs and devices. How do I d etermine who is the Respon sible Party for a study? The Responsible Party is defined as an individual who: is responsible for conducting trial , has access to & control over the data from clinical trial , has right to publish results of the trial , AND has abi lity to meet all the requi rements . *For conducted under IND/IDE, regulation requires \"Sponsor Investigator\" (IND/IDE holder) to register and submit results in ClinicalTrials.gov When should ClinicalTrials.gov registration be done? We recommend the Responsible Party to init iate ClinicalTrials.gov registration before eIRB study submission because an NCT # is required for IRB study activation. How long will it take to register a study in ClinicalTrials.gov? NIH estimates registration can take up to 1 0 hours , depending on the complexity of the study and the number of pre-specified outcome measures. When will the NCT number be assigned? Approximately 2 to 5 business days after the record is released Can I update outcome measures after the study has started? To avoid the appear ance of outcome switching ( e.g., publication bias), we recommend keep ing the original outcomes as is and add explanations in the Outcome Measure Description section about the changes in outcome measures (e.g., \"This outcome will n ot be collected as the test is no longer available \"). Will results posting on Cl inicalTrials.gov be considered \"s \"prior publicat ion\"? No, posting of tabular results data to ClinicalTrials.gov is not considered prior publication per International Committe e of Medical Journal Edito rs (ICMJE ) policy Which trials must post consent forms and when? Clinical trials funded or conducted by a Common Rule department or agency, that were either IRB approved on or after January 21, 2019, or voluntarily transitioned t o the Revised Common Rule requirements, must post a consent form aft er recruitment closes, and no later than 60 days after the last study visit by any subject. UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 253 of 270 Can I delete a record from the ClinicalTrials.gov public website? No, once a study earns the NC T#, it cannot be deleted Do I need to submit statistical test results? In general, statistical test result s are optional, but may be required if pre -specified in protocol as primary/secondary outcome measures. Can I get an extension for results reporting ? An extension may be perm itted if the request is submitted prior to the results reporting due date (i.e., day before) with a valid reason. For guidance, reach out to the RSO. Do I need to report results when the study was terminated? Results reporting re quired for a terminated st udy depends on the overall recruitment status and whether data were collected for the purpose of study. For those stud ies terminated prematurely but data were collected, then results reporting of available data are required. Where as those studies withdrawn before stating enrollment, no results are required to be reported because there is no reportable data. Sponsor Investigator Support Program FAQs QUESTION ANSWER How do I know whether an IND or IDE is required for a study? The Regulatory Support Office (RSO) provides comprehensive information to help determine whether or not an IND or IDE is needed for a proposed study. Book a free consultation today. Do I need an IND if I use a lawfully marketed drug for an unlabeled indicatio n? If you prescribe a mark eted drug to treat a patient for an unlabeled indication ( i.e., off-label use), an IND is not required because this use is considered to be within the scope of medical practice and not a clinical investigation. Can a patient be t reated with an investigati onal product outside of a clinical trial? Yes, a treating physician can request a single patient Expanded Access IND/IDE to the FDA. The goal of Expanded Access is treatment as opposed to research. Approval can be expedited in eme rgency situations. Who is considered the sponsor of an IND or IDE s tudy? The sponsor is the individual who initiates the IND or IDE and is responsible for both the oversight of the clinical trial (or Expanded Access treatment IND or IDE) and all communica tions with the FDA. What is a Letter of Authorization (LOA)? An LOA is a permission letter from the sponsor ( i.e., manufacture r of the investigational product) allowing the FDA to cross -reference confidential information of the sponsor's existing IND on f ile to support your new IN D application. Such confidential inform ation may include: Description of the facility where the drug is manufactured Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 254 of 270 Pharmacology, Toxicology information Labeling Previous Human Experience What is the difference bet ween an abbreviated IDE and an IDE? An abbreviated IDE is required for non -significant risk device studies and overseen by the IRB. An IDE is required for significant risk device studies and overseen by the IRB and FDA . Do I firs t submit to the IRB or FDA when submitting protocol modification s? FDA and IRB submissions may occur in any order. However, w e recommend to first obtain the IRB approval so that the sponsor can include the IRB approval letter in the protocol amendment appl ication to the FDA. When is an IND Annual Report/IDE Progress Report is due? The IND Annual Report is required to be submitted within 60 days of the one -year anniversary of the IND effective date. The IDE Progress Report is required to be submitted at regular intervals , but no le ss than yearly for the IDE.

For example, could a radioactive drug be used to image a nonradioactive therapeutic drug's effects on an organ? No, a separate IND is not needed for the radioactive dr ug if there is an existing IND and that IND is amended to label the drug wit h a radionuclide. This may be preferred because the IND already exists. An alternative approach would be to conduct the study using the subject drug separately under the oversight of an RDRC if the data to be collected are basic science information and the study meets all of the conditions of \u00a7 361.1. However, this assumes no pharmacologic effect for the study drug, and monitoring a therapy drug would most probably involve using a t herapeutic dose, which would disqualify this from an RDRC study. If the RDRC conditions were met, and the studies were conducted under RDRC review, the results of the radioactive drug studies should be included in the IND of the nonradioactive drug that is being developed. Is an IND needed if research using a radioactive drug sta rts out as basic science but then changes to clinical research? Yes, an IND would be needed when research goals change to study the clinical safety or effectiveness of the radioact ive drug. For example, the initial investigations to demonstrate the localiz ation of a radioactive drug to a particular organ or fluid space and to determine the kinetics of that localization could be considered basic research. If all other conditions of \u00a7 361.1 were met, those investigations could be conducted under an RDRC. If and when the basic science research evolves into a more formal clinical trial that expands beyond the conditions of \u00a7 361.1, it would have to be conducted under an IND. The IND coul d be submitted at the time that the basic research of the radioactive drug b egins under \u00a7 361.1. I am not sure whether my research will evolve into drug development for use in a clinical setting. Should I submit an IND? Yes. While early research objective s ma y be basic research and may or may not evolve into a formal clinical trial for safety and/or efficacy, if there is doubt as to whether the research is still basic science research, FDA recommends that the drug be studied under an IND. If basic researc h with a radioactive drug does not meet RDRC conditions for pharmacological activity and/or radiation dose limits, but the radioactive drug is a simple, commonly used compound, is an IND needed? Yes. If basic research with a radioactive drug does not meet all the conditions under \u00a7 361.1, including limits on the pharma cological and radiation doses, the research may not be conducted under an RDRC and is subject to the IND regulations. However, some clinical investigations of a drug product that is lawfully m arketed in the United States may be exempt from IND UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 258 of 270 requirements under certain conditions (see \u00a7 312.2 (b), Exemptions). If research is being conducted to identify a radioactive drug to eventually be used in human therapy, diagnosis, or prevention trials, should the investigator begin by submitting an IND, or should a n IND be submitted at the conclusion of the basic science studies? For the initial basic science studies meeting requirements of \u00a7 361.1, the investigator has the choice of conducting the stud ies under the RDRC or under an IND. However, after these initial basic science studies are complete, an IND must be submitted to co nduct clinical trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of the radioactive drug. One type of IND that is intended to be simpler than the traditional IND, the exploratory IND, ** involves limited human exposure and may require less preclinical suppor t than traditional IND studies. ** See the guidance for industry, investigators, and reviewers on Exploratory IND Studies (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplian ceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm078933.pdf ). Please note that the Exploratory IND guid ance d oes not apply to all drugs regulated by CDER and does not apply to CBER regulated drugs. Can I use a radioactive biological product as a radioactive drug under an RDRC? Yes. The term radioactive drug includes radioactive biological products labeled with a radionuclide (21 CFR 310.3(n) and 600.3(ee)). Therefore, basic research studies with a radioactive biological product may be conducted under RDRC review if they meet all the requirements set forth in \u00a7 361.1. However, biological products (e.g., mono clonal antibodies and therapeutic proteins such as cytokine, interferon, interleukin, and enzy mes) that are immunogenic proteins could potentially produce an antigenic response. Therefore, we recommend that only basic research with radioactive biological p roduct s that have been shown to have no immune response be conducted under \u00a7 361.1. Does an e xisting IND for a nonradioactive investigational drug need to be amended if the drug is labeled with a radionuclide? It would be preferable for an existing IND to be am ended if the drug is labeled with a radionuclide, but this may not be required under cer tain circumstances. It would not be necessary to amend an existing IND if the investigator wanted to conduct the research under an RDRC, the radioactive form of t he inv estigational drug met all conditions of \u00a7 361.1, and the research was reviewed and appro ved by the RDRC. The results of the research should be submitted to the IND. If the RDRC requirements were not met (e.g., the research was not basic science in na ture, or the pharmacological or radiation doses were not within the limits specified in \u00a7 361.1), an IND would be required. In that case, to use the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 259 of 270 radioactive form of the investigational drug, the existing IND would have to be amended, or a new IND submi tted. I have an unapproved radioactive drug that I want to use to monitor the progress of the rapy in patients who are given various therapeutic drugs. Do I need to submit an IND? Yes. Because the imaging results from the radioactive drug will provide imme diate diagnostic information about patients, this is not considered basic research and you will need an IND. Can I use an unapproved radioactive drug if I use it for an occasional patient who may be difficult to diagnose, and I'm exploring whether this te st is useful? This type of study requires an IND because you cannot use an unapproved radioact ive drug for diagnosis on humans without an IND. What is the difference between an RDRC and a Radiation Safety Committee? A Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) is m andate d by various Federal, state, and local agencies for the purpose of en suring the safety o f an institution's overall program for the use of radioactive materials and radiation producing equipment. An RDRC is mandated and approved only by FDA for the sp ecific purpose of approving and monitoring basic human research studies using radioactive drug s under the conditions set forth in \u00a7 361.1. A medical institution may involve its RDRC in other matters, such as the review of institutional radiation safety issues or the review of research conducted under an IND, but FDA regulations d o not require that RDRCs perform such activities. Will my study need to be approved by both my RDRC and IRB? Yes. Section 361.1(d)(9) requires that all research on human subjects u nder a n RDRC also have IRB approval. If my study meets all the requirements in \u00a7 361.1, do I need an IND? If your study meets the requirements of \u00a7 361.1 as determined by your RDRC, this means your study does not need an IND. However, your RDRC may prefer that your study be conducted under an IND for a variety of medi cal, ethical, or legal reasons , and may not approve your study under the RDRC authority If the RDRC does not approve my study, do I need an IND? If your study does not meet the requirements o f \u00a7 36 1.1 as determined by your RDRC, your study must be conduct ed under an IND unless it meet s the conditions for IND exemption (\u00a7 312.2(b)). Can I enroll pregnant women in my study for my basic research under an RDRC? No. For a more detailed discussion please see section III.B, What Are the Study Criteria for Resear ch Conducted Under an RDRC, Hu man Research Subjects, (3) Women of childbearing potential, for additional information. (https://www. fda.gov/media/76286/download ). Are studies involving pediatric subjects appropriate under an RDRC? Although RDRC research subjects generally must be 18 years of age or older, exceptions are permitted in special situations. Please refer to sectio n III. B , What Are the UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 260 of 270 Study Criteria for Research Conducted Under an RDRC, Human Research Sub jects, (4) Pediatric subjects, for additional information. Under what circumstances can I use doses of a r adioactive drug that have a pharmacological effect for studies of basic research, metabolism, and pharmacokinetics, and not need an IND for the radio nuclide study? There are no such circumstances. If your radioactive drug has a clinically detectable pharma cologic effect, your studies will not meet the requirem ents of \u00a7 361.1, and you will need an IND. If the mass dose of the unapproved radioactive dru g I'm planning to study has a pharmacological effect, what should I do? You will need to submit an IND. Contact the RSO for assistance. Must I conduct dose -respo nse stud ies to support no clinically detectable pharmacological effect? No, there is no requir ement for a formal dose -response study to define the lower threshold for a clinically detectable pharmacological effect. For example, if the circulating blood lev els or e xcretion rates of endogenously produced substances are well known, it may be possible for the RDRC to conclude that some small fraction of these levels or rates of administration (e.g., administration over a given interval of a low percentage of am ount of a substance that is produced endogenously during the same interval) represents an amou nt without detectable pharmacological effect. Or, if large amounts of substances such as amino ac ids or sugar are regularly consumed as foodstuffs, it may be poss ible for the RDRC to conclude that a small amount of it (e.g., a small percentage of the amoun t usually consumed during a meal), at least by the oral route, would be without detectable pharma cological activity. How do I determine the actual radiation dose for eac h individual subject? In many cases, the actual individual radiation dose can only be estimated using standard adult and child reference models published by organizations such as the Society of Nuclear Medicine's (SNM) Medical Internal Radiation Do simetry (MIRD) Committee, the British Health Protection Agency (formerly the National Radiolog ical Protection Board (NRPB)) for x -ray sources, including CT, and the FDA for conventional x -ray. FDA believes that the determination of radiation dose to speci fic tiss ue or organs using cur rently accepted methods, such as the system set forth by the MIR D Committee, or the system set forth by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), is sufficiently accurate for estimating radiation risk fro m radiol abeled drugs used in R DRC research. Although there are inherent limitations because of differences UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 261 of 270 between standard reference models and actual human subject size and organ geometries, the risks associated with these low radiation doses are suffici ently lo w that the uncertainty associated with these estimates is acceptable for RDRC research . However, these methods alone are insufficient for the determination of radiation doses for radiotherapeutic purposes. The variation and uncertainty in patient s pecific anatomies, and the complexity of the pharmacokinetics and dosimetries, preclude using such standard models for radiotherapeutic purposes. How do I report the radiation dose for each individual subject in my annual report to FDA? Radiation dose mus t be rep orted as the organ dose for select organs and as a whole body dose, as specified in \u00a7 361.1(b)(3)(i) (see Table 1, Limits on Radiation Dose for Adults, of this guidance). Since the promulgation of \u00a7 361.1 in 1975, the ICRP has def ined effective dos e (E) to equate partial body doses to a whole body dose. Therefore, the whole body dose may be reported as E in the annual report to FDA using the most current tissue weighting factors published by the ICRP. However, individual organ dose s must still be re ported. Administered radioactivity is not radiation absorbed dose. What units should I use fo r reporting radiation dose in my annual report to FDA? FDA prefers that radiation be reported using the International System of Units (SI), Becq uerels for radioac tivity, Gray for the physical concept of dose, and Sieverts for the biologically equivalent do se. Units of Radioactivity Units of Physical Absorbed Dose Units of Biologically Equivalent Dose Sievert (Sv ), the biologically equivalent dose, obtained when the physical dose, in Gray, is modified by a radiation weighting factor, wR, previously k nown as a quality factor, which varies depending on the type and energy of the radiation. This is usually 1 for gamm a, x- ray, and electron energies, but varies si gnifican tly for UTSW CLINICAL RESEARCH Version 1.0 Page 262 of 270 some particulate radiations such as alpha and neutron radiations. Sievert = 1 00 rems mSv = 100 mrem Since the radiation weighting factor, w R, is usually 1 for gamma and x -ray photons, typical ly the primary types of radiation used in medi cine, th e terms are often used interchangeably. A 10 mGy (1 rad) x -ray or gamma ray dose is so metimes referred to as a 10 mSv (1 rem) dose. A 10 mGy (1 rad) dose of alpha or neutron radiation will result in a m uch higher equivalent dose, depending on the q uantity of w R. If w R is 10, then the corresponding equivalent dose will be 10 times the absorb ed dose in Gy (rads) (e.g., 1 Gy (100 rad) = 10 Sv (1000 rem)).
