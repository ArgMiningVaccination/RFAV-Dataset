Recent insights indicate that cancer-specific aberrant mRNA processing may significantly expand the repertoire of targetable neoantigens for cancer immunotherapy (Frankiw et al., 2019;Y a 2019). Transcription- induced chimeric RNAs (chiRNAs) are fused mRNA transcripts derived from two (or more) unrelated genes which are generatedbyaberrant'read-through/splicing'or'trans-splicing'(Keetal., 2020;Linetal., 2019;V a rleyetal., 2014;Zha n getal., 2013). Detailed analyses of aberrant mRNA processing events in cancer cells have identified potential new targets for cancer immunotherapy. In this respect, we recently discovered an aberrant transcription-induced exon-intron antisensechimeric RNA ASTN- PAPPA antisense(A-PaschiRNA) that is selectively present in esophageal cancer (EC) tissue (Zhang et al., 2013). The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA of the A-PaschiRNA consists of the full-length coding sequence of the ASTNgene, the subsequent nucleotidesequencecorrespondstotheantisensestrandofpartof18thintronofthe PAPPAgene(Wangetal., 2021).Normally, theASTNgeneencodesforastrotactin2,anintegralmembraneproteininvolvedinneuraldevelopment(Glessneretal., proteins (Bonaca et al., 2012; Conover et al., 2016). Given its selective presence in EC tissue (Zhang et al., 2013), wewonderedwhether A-PaschiRNAcouldbeexploitedforthedevelopmentofneoantigen-basedtherapeuticvaccinetoinduce Tcellsagainst A-PaschiRNA-positiveEC. Dendritic cells (DCs) are highly cells with unique capacity to (cross-) present antigens to naive cognate T cells (Garg et al., 2017). Consequently, DC-based vaccines considerably promising for cancer immunotherapy (Banchereau&Palucka, 2018;Gargetal., 2017;Sabado&Bhardwaj, 2015).However,cell-basedDCvaccineapproachesarehighly complex and require costly good practices (GMP) (Garg et al., 2017; Sabado & Bhardwaj, I, MHC-II and various key co-stimulatory molecules (Pitt et al., 2016). Consequently, DEXs maintain the intrinsic capacity of DCs to present foreign antigens to T cells (Pitt et al., 2016). The lipid bilayer makeup endows DEXs with significant serum stability,longshelf-lifewhenfrozen,andrelativelysimpleGMPhandling(ElAndaloussietal., 2013;Jiang&Gao, we describe a novel therapeutic cell-free anticancer vaccine that is based on EVs derived from DCs transduced with A-PaschiRNA.

Recombinant lentivirus particles encoding the A-P asfusion protein taggedwiththreeFLAGpeptidesequencesattheC-terminal(LV A-P-FLAG)wereproduced,asillustratedinFigure 1(B). In 14 out of 42 EC patients, the transcription of A-PaschiRNA was restricted to cancerous tissues, and was undetectable in the respective adjacent noncancerous tissues of all 42 patients (Figure 1C,a n dF i g u r e S1).

Importantly, in consistent with the subsequent translation into a A-P asfusion protein were confirmed in LV A-P-FLAG- transduced DCs (DC A-P)( F i g u 2A and B ). In immunoblot analysis, A-P asfusion protein could be detected by both mAb A-Pas-16 and anti-FLAG mAb (Figure 2B). Of note, and DC phenotype (Prechtel&Steinkasserer, 2007)(Figure2C).

Importantly, DC A-Pshowed enhanced capacity to prime and activate T cells that selectively targeted and killed HLA- matched LV A-P-FLAG-transduced KYSE140 EC cells (KYSE140 A-P)( F i g u r e 2F to H), but not empty-vector transduced cells (KYSE140 VEC)( F i g u r e 2I). Moreover, DC A-P-primed T-cells selectively killed KYSE140 cells that lack A-P asexpression (Figure S2). Of note, i n eD C 2 . 4 A-Pcells showed a marked upregulation of MHC-I, and ICAM and a moderate upregulation of MHC-II, collectively indicative for a matured DC phenotype (Figure 3A to C). Impor- tantly, DC2.4 A-Pcells showed A-P-primed T-cells selectively killed H-2b-matched LVA-P-FLAG-transduced AKR EC cells (AKR A-P)( F i g u r e 3F to H).

Additionally, compared to controls, DEX A-Pvaccination resulted in an increased presence of CD11c+cells(M1macrophages)andadecreasedpresenceofCD206+cells(M2macrophages)intumourtissues(Figure 6F).The latter suggests that the anticancer activity of DEX A-Pvaccination promotes innate immunity. Taken together, vaccination with DEXA-Pappearstostimulatebothinnateandacquiredimmunitywhichmayreprogramthetumourimmunemicroenvironment toanactivatedstatus. TofurtherevaluatetheeffectofDEX A-Pvaccinationonsystemicimmuneresponses,thespleensofimmunocompetentmice were analysed. DEX A-Pvaccination resulted in an increase in CD8+-a n dad e c r e a s eC D 4+Tc e l ln u m b e ri nt h es p l e e n (Figure7A).Inparticular,thenumberofIFN- -expressingCD8+CTLswassignificantlyincreased(Figure 7B,andFigure S8B) which was accompanied by decreased number of CD4+FoxP3+CD25+Tregs (Figure 7C). In line with this, DEX A-Pvaccina- tion enhanced the production of IFN- and IL-2 (Figure 7D) and reduced production of immunocompromised nude mice (Figure 8A to D) (Van Montfoort et al., 2018). This indicated that the antitumour effect of DEX A-Pvaccination critically relies on the induction and activation of anticancer T cells. To further examine which subset of T cells is responsible for the anti-tumour immunity of DEX A-P, we treated tumour-bearing immunocompetent mice with DEX A-Pin the presence of CD8- and/or CD4-depleting antibodies (Figure 8E,a n dF i g u r e S9). Depletion of CD4+T cells alone had only a marginal effect on therapeutic efficacy of DEXA-Pvaccination to control tumour growth (Figure 8F and G ). In contrast, depletion of CD8+Tc e l l s ,a l o n eo rc o m b i A-P-vaccinatedmice(Figure 8H).Theseresultsindicatedthat antitumoureffectDEX A-PvaccinationiscriticallydependentonCD8+Tcells.

Moreover, DEXs were shown to induce promising immunogenic responses in several phase I/II clinical trials in patients with NSCLC (Besse et al., 2016;M o r s ee highlighted feasibility and safety of the use of DEXs in a clinical setting. Of note, most reports on treating cancer with DEXs focusonDEXvaccinespulsedwithcancertestisantigens,suchasMAGE-1,MAGE-3,NY-ESO-1(Besseetal., 2016;Morseetal., 2005), or onco-fetal antigens like alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (Lu et al., 2017). In the current study, we describe the construction of the cell-free vaccine DEX- A-Pthat is based on A-PaschiRNA-loaded DEXs, and its preclinically evaluation for applicability to treat esophageal cancer (EC), a highly refractory and lethal malignancy. Our results demonstrated promising therapeutic effects of DEX- A-Ptowards EC, both in vitro and in immunocompetent immunogenic neoantigens are rare or even non-existent in subgroups of malignancies (Chan et al., 2019;M a r t i ne ta l . , 2016;S c h u m a c h e re ta l . , 2019;W a n ge ta l . Recent studies revealedthatsomaticmutationsincancer-relatedgenescommonlyoccurinmanynormaltissuesandarecausedmainlybyintrin- sic mutational processes. Interestingly, phenotypically normal cells carrying somatic mutations in cancer-related genes appear to colonize the normal human esophagus with age. In fact, in middle-aged and elderly subjects, clones with cancer-associated mutations covered much of the epithelium. Counterintuitively, the prevalence of NOTCH1 mutations in phenotypically nor- mal esophagus was several times higher than that in esophageal cancers (Chanock, 2018;D a r t ,2018;M a r t i n c o r e n ae transcription-induced chiRNAs (i.e., encoded proteins) may serve as an alternate and potentially more suitable source of immunogenic neoantigens for the development of anticancer vaccines. In particular, cancer-specifictranscription-inducedchiRNAsmaybeparticularlyusefulforcancertypesknowntohavelowmutationburden and in which mutation-based immunogenic neoantigens are rare or even non-existent (Chan et al., 2019;M a r t i ne ta l . , 2016; Schumacheretal., 2019;W angetal., tissue shows aberrant mRNA transcription resulting in a chimeric RNA in which the cod- ing sequence with the full-length coding sequence of the ASTNgene is fused in-frame to the antisense strand EC tissue but not in adjacent non-cancerous tissue. In contrast to most reports that aberrant transcription-inducedchimeric RNAs derived from structural variationsof exons only (Kannan al., 2011;K o v a re tal . , 1999), we identified A-PaschiRNA derived from the coding regions of ASTNf u s e dt ot h ea n t i s e n s es t r a n do fa ni n t r o no f PAPPA, two adjacent genes in a tail-tail orientation.

In contrast, our study indicated that depletion of CD4+T cells only marginally reduced the capacity of DEX A-Pvaccination to control tumour growth. of mice bearing syngeneic A-PaschiRNA-expressing esophageal tumours with DEX A-Ppotently inhibited tumour growth and prolonged survival. Animals vaccinated with 40 g DEXA-Pshowed a prolonged survival rate at 30 days after tumour challenge of up to 100%.
