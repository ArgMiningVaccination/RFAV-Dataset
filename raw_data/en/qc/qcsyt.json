Following the Balinese principal of Sekala-Niskala, which holds that we all live equally in two worlds; the seen or conscious world Sekala, and the unseen or psychic world Niskala, the Balinese healers engage the help of the divine source during each healing session. A healing journey for detoxification and transformation. At Fivelements, Bali we recognise that optimal wellness comes from learning to love and respect the body, mind, and spirit, where health and well-being are a reflection of inner harmony. You can read our personal review from our stay at Fivelements [here](https://www.soulseedmedia.com/2019/08/19/fivelements-retreat-bali/). Retreats are available for individuals, couples and small groups. Fivelements Tri Kaya Parisudha Retreat This is our signature cleansing programme inspired by the ancient Balinese philosophy that promotes living with purity of thought, speech, and action. It encourages us to align our heartfelt goodwill and thinking with consistent speech and action. The retreat includes traditional Balinese healing therapies aimed to detoxify and purify the physical body, sekala, and the non-physical mind and soul, niskala, unifying body and mind towards a natural harmonious state of being, and allowing an organic healing process to unfold. With your needs in mind, we collaborate with you to nurture a new healing path, combining: Balinese Healing Rituals for purification, balance and regeneration. Living Foods for detoxification, nutrition and vitality and Sacred Arts for inner strength, integrity and dedication. As our lives become increasingly demanding, fast-paced and over-stressed, we begin to recognise significant impacts in our body's natural ability to sustain healthy organ productivity, effective toxin elimination and overall health and wellness. Combined with the growing number of harmful chemicals and pollutants to which we are exposed on a daily basis (whether due to impure air or water, food pesticides, preservatives, additives or other non-natural materials), this is causing us to experience poorer health, including chronic aches and pains, lower levels of energy and productivity, frequent illness, decreased memory or concentration, depression, ongoing digestive issues, bloating, excessive weight, dependence upon food or other substances, disease and premature aging. Accommodation The spacious, eco-luxurious bedroom villas, complete with open air bathrooms, ensure an exclusive stay with exemplary personalised service. The nine sleeping suites, five named after each of the five elements in Balinese - Pertiwi (earth), Apah (water), Teja (fire), Bayu (air) and Akasa (ether), two Waterfall suites and two Bidadari (angel) suites, embrace the designs of nature fashioned in the forms of sacred spirals and organic leaves. To fully experience Fivelements, Puri Ahimsa, a stay in one of our nine exclusive suites is a must. Here, each room is enveloped in the hypnotising whisperings of the sacred Ayung River as it carves its way through the valley. Facing a verdant forest hillside with waterfalls and the natural wonders that are often captured in Balinese paintings, each suite features an open veranda poised above the river's swirling currents and a private bamboo enclosure housing a large open-air bathtub hewn from a stone boulder. Customised lighting showcases the seven colours of the chakras, bringing mind, body and spirit in unison with nature. Each has a spacious terrace overlooking Bali's sacred Ayung River, with a healing alfresco bathhouse including chromotherapy lighting, air-conditioning, sound system with iPod dock, Wi-Fi Internet access, safety box, hairdryer and a generous array of amenities. Healing Rituals At Fivelements, Bali healing is inspired by the Balinese way of life, which encourages us to nurture a greater harmony with spirit, the environment and with one another. Similarly, our holistic approach is designed to tune in to the physical, emotional and spiritual levels, allowing an organic healing process to naturally unfold. We collaborate with our guests to activate, facilitate and nurture a new healing path, and this begins by honouring our highest potential. Fivelements embraces holistic Balinese-inspired therapies administered by traditional Balinese healers using ancient wisdoms passed down from direct lineage. Following the Balinese principle of Sekala-Niskala, which holds that we all live equally in two worlds; the seen or conscious world Sekala, and the unseen or psychic world Niskala, the Balinese healers engage the help of the higher divine source during each healing session. Healing rituals include a combination of meditation, deep bodywork and prana energy performed by healers whose gifted talents have been handed down through generations of Balinese families. Energy Healing introduces the powerful Panca Mahabhuta (The Five Elements) in which healer Pak Wayan works to balance the five elements of earth, water, fire, air and ether within the body. Chakra Balancing sessions are for activating and balancing the body's seven energy centres, while in Prana Healing, healer Pak Dewa will scan and clear the aura of imbalances. Massage therapies include Holistic Massage with Prana combination, Deep Healing Reflexology, Acupressure, Invigorating Bodywork and Muscle Release, all of which synchronise intuitive body and energy work to identify, balance and heal. Cuisine At Fivelements, we believe in the power of plant-based, sun-produced, raw vegan, living foods to cleanse and heal the body, mind and spirit. Living foods are vitamin and enzyme-rich, thus, containing high levels of nutrition. A detoxification process with us involving living foods - especially through juice fasting - allows the body to more easily eradicate toxins and other unwanted substances from our bodies, thereby cleansing and promoting effective organ functionality and improving our body's natural ability to sustain positive health. Bringing more and more of these fresh fruits and vegetables into our daily consumption on an ongoing basis will assist in healthy cell regeneration for improved health, beauty and longevity.

You instantly feel a sense of serenity and comfort upon entering this resort. The staff, the food (amazing raw vegetarian food) and the environment were 10 star quality (if that's possible). We received various spa treatments- Flower bath, Facial, Sakti ritual, Fire Ceremony and Body Scrub and nothing was left feeling any less that relaxed. Very old traditions were used, organic products and thoughtful care to each detail. The location was not far from Ubud and the ride was nice and mellow, a shuttle is offered 3 times per day as complimentary to your stay or you can arrange for a private trip that is very appropriate in price. We loved our stay and wish it never ended!.\" Samkrez - Pennsylvania. Stayed July 2016, travelled with friends \"I don't think I've ever stayed anywhere as magical as Fivelements. The room blew me away. It's not everyday you have your own private bath tub next to a river! The room was spacious and luxurious in a simple Balinese way- not over the top. The other end of the room featured a spacious outdoor bathroom I was happy to share with a gecko or two. The grounds themselves were also stunning, sitting along side the river. The vegan food was loving prepared- but I was over it by the end (just not my thing!). All and all highly recommended - especially for honeymooners, as the rooms were very private. Treat yourself!.\" How to get here Fivelements is located 90 minutes drive from Ngurah Rai International Airport where airport transfers will be arranged.
