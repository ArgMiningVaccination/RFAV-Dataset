Only you know your family's lifestyle, health, budget and benefit preferences. Here are some questions to ask yourself as you review the information on the following pages: What is the premium? What choice of providers do I have? Are the providers and facilities I currently use considered in- or out-of-network? Is the medicine I currently take covered? What is my share of the cost? What benefits are available for a catastrophic illness or injury? What will happen if I need care while away from home? Are my special needs covered? How often do I anticipate needing care? Is there a deductible? What is the annual out-of-pocket maximum? Are there any benefit limitations? It's Time to Review Your Health Plan to Review Your Health Plan Options for 2023! This booklet explains the options available to you under the New York State Health Insurance Program (NYSHIP) for your health insurance and other elections. Research your choices carefully. You may not change your option after the deadline, except in special circumstances (see your General Information Book for details). The 2023 option-change deadline will be announced once rates for the upcoming plan year have been approved. If you continue to have questions after you have read this booklet, contact your Health Benefits Administrator (HBA), The Empire Plan program administrators or the HMOs directly. Note: NYSHIP does not offer an open enrollment period. If you and/or your dependents are eligible for NYSHIP coverage but are not enrolled, see your General Information Book for information regarding enrollment and situations in which a late enrollment waiting period applies. 1 Choices 2023/ActiveIf You Decide to Change Your Option If you decide to change your option, submit a completed NYS Health Insurance Transaction Form (PS-404) to your Health Benefits Administrator (HBA) or make the change online using MyNYSHIP* before the Option Transfer deadline announced in the rate flyer. If you would like to newly enroll in the Opt-out Program, you must also complete and submit an Opt-out Attestation Form (PS-409). See page 12 for details. If You Plan to Retire or Vest in 2023 If you continue your NYSHIP enrollment as a retiree or vestee, you may change your health insurance option when your status changes and, thereafter, at any time once during a 12-month period, for any reason. Note: In certain circumstances, you may be allowed to change your option more than once during a single 12-month period. See your General Information Book for details. If you are planning to retire or vest in 2023, take the time now to familiarize yourself with the eligibility requirements for continuing your health insurance coverage. Refer to your General Information Book and ask your HBA for copies of Planning for Retirement and Choices for 2023 for Retirees.Reminders New in 2023 for The Empire Plan For 2023, the maximum out-of-pocket limit for covered, in-network services under The Empire Plan is $9,100 for Individual coverage and $18,200 for Family coverage, split between the Hospital, Medical/Surgical, Mental Health and Substance Use and Prescription Drug programs. See page 23 for more information about how out-of-pocket limits apply to each Empire Plan program. Through LiveHealth Online, enrollees can access board- certified doctors and licensed therapists 24 hours a day, seven days a week via smartphone, tablet or personal computer. Telemedicine visits through LiveHealth Online will continue to be covered by The Empire Plan at no cost. 2 Choices 2023/ActiveLet Your Agency Know About Changes You must notify your HBA of any changes to your enrollment record (home address, phone number, marital status, dependent eligibility) in a timely manner. Changes in your family status, such as the addition or loss of a dependent, may mean that you need to change your health insurance coverage from Individual to Family or from Family to Individual. If you submit a request within 30 days of a change in family status, you may make these coverage changes without being subject to a late enrollment waiting period. See your General Information Book for details. Promptly inform your HBA about any change to ensure it is effective on the actual date of change in family status. If you are registered for MyNYSHIP,* you may also make address and option changes online. * You must be an active employee of a New York State agency and have a personal NY.gov ID to access MyNYSHIP (see page 40 for more information). MyNYSHIP is not available to active employees of Participating Employers (PEs) and cannot be used to elect the Opt-out Program. 3 Choices 2023/Active2023 Health Plan Rates The 2023 health plan rates will be mailed to your home and posted on NYSHIP Online as soon as they have been approved. Note: Participating Employers (PEs), such as the Thruway Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, will notify their enrollees of 2023 rates. The rates flyer announces the option-change deadline and dates on which changes in health insurance payroll deductions will occur. You will have 30 days from the date your agency receives the rate information to submit any changes. The Pre-Tax Contribution Program COBRA and Young Adult Option enrollees are not eligible to participate in the Pre-Tax Contribution Program (PTCP). The following also does not apply to enrollees of PEs. PEs that participate in a pre-tax contribution program will provide specific pre-tax information to their employees. The Pre-Tax Contribution Program (PTCP) is a voluntary program that allows employees to have their share of the health insurance premium deducted from their wages before taxes are withheld, which in turn may lower tax liability. Employees must initially decide whether to participate in PTCP when first eligible for NYSHIP health coverage. Subsequently, they may change their PTCP status each year during the PTCP Election Period.Your current PTCP status is noted on your paycheck. If you are enrolled in PTCP, your paycheck stub shows \"Regular Before-Tax Health\" in the Before-Tax Deductions section. Your health insurance premium is deducted from your wages before taxes are withheld. If you are not enrolled in PTCP, or part of your deduction is being taken after tax (e.g., for a non-federally qualifying dependent), your paycheck stub shows \"Regular After-Tax Health\" in the After-Tax Deductions section. Your health insurance premium is deducted from your wages after taxes are withheld. The PTCP Election Period runs concurrently with the annual Option Transfer Period. Dates will be announced once rates have been approved. Per Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules, this election period is the only opportunity for employees to change their PTCP status; arbitrary, mid-year status changes are not allowed. If you wish to change your PTCP selection for the 2023 plan year, complete and sign a NYS Health Insurance Transaction Form (PS-404) and submit it to your Health Benefits Administrator (HBA) any time during the PTCP Election Period. NO ACTION IS REQUIRED TO KEEP YOUR CURRENT PTCP STATUS. For more information about the PTCP, please consult the Planning for Option Transfer flyer and your General Information Book.Cost of Coverage 4 Choices 2023/ActiveYour Share of the Premium The following does not apply to employees of Participating Employers (PEs will provide premium information), COBRA enrollees, Young Adult Option enrollees or enrollees in Leave Without Pay status (who pay the full cost of coverage). New York State helps to pay for your health insurance coverage. After the State's contribution, you are responsible for paying the balance of your premium, usually through biweekly deductions from your paycheck. Whether you enroll in The Empire Plan or a NYSHIP HMO, the State's share and your share of the cost of coverage are based on the following (salary requirements vary; contact your HBA for more information): Enrollee Pay GradeIndividual Coverage Dependent Coverage State Share Employee Share State Share Employee Share Grade 9 and below* 88% 31% * Or salary equivalent, if no Grade assigned. Contact your HBA to confirm. If you enroll in a NYSHIP HMO, the State's dollar contribution for the hospital, medical/surgical and mental health and substance use components of your HMO premium will not exceed its dollar contribution for those components of The Empire Plan premium. For the prescription drug component of your HMO premium, the State pays the share noted in the table; the dollar amount is not limited by the cost of Empire Plan drug coverage. 5 Choices 2023/ActiveThere are two types of health insurance plans available to you under NYSHIP: The Empire Plan and NYSHIP- approved Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). Additionally, if you have other employer-sponsored group health coverage available to you, you may be eligible to participate in the Opt-out Program (see page 12 for details).

If eligible, you may opt out of NYSHIP coverage in exchange for an incentive payment. Note: Employees who are represented by UUP are not eligible to participate in this program. The State Opt-out Program also is not available to employees of Participating Employers (PEs); however, a PE may offer a similar option or buyout. The annual incentive payment is $1,000 for opting out of Individual coverage or $3,000 for opting out of Family coverage. The incentive payment is prorated and credited through your biweekly paycheck throughout the year (payable only when you are eligible for NYSHIP coverage at the employee share of the premium). Note: Opt-out incentive payments increase your taxable income. It is not necessary to reenroll in the Opt-out Program each year. No action is required for current Opt-out enrollees who are still eligible and wish to remain in the Program for the 2023 plan year. Eligibility Requirements To be eligible for the Opt-out Program, you must: Have been enrolled in the Opt-out Program for the prior plan year or Have been enrolled in a NYSHIP health plan by April 1, 2022 (or on your first date of NYSHIP eligibility if that date is later than April 1) and remained continuously enrolled while eligible for the employee share of the premium through the end of 2022. To qualify for the Opt-out Program, you must be covered under an employer-sponsored group health insurance plan through other employment of your own or a plan that your spouse, domestic partner or parent has as a result of their employment. New York State employees cannot opt out of NYSHIP if they are covered under NYSHIP as a dependent through another New York State employee.An individual cannot be enrolled in more than one NYSHIP option in their own right as an employee. Since the Opt-out Program is considered a NYSHIP option, an individual cannot opt out through one employer and be enrolled in NYSHIP health benefits in their own right through another employer. If the employee is covered as a dependent on another NYSHIP policy through a local government or public entity, they are only eligible for the Individual Opt-out incentive amount ($1,000). Before requesting enrollment in the Opt-out Program, find out whether the other employer- sponsored plan will permit you to enroll as a dependent. You are responsible for making sure that your other coverage is in effect during the period you opt out of NYSHIP. Note: Opt-out Program participation satisfies NYSHIP enrollment requirements at the time of your retirement. The Opt-out Program is not available to retirees. Electing to Opt Out If you are currently enrolled in The Empire Plan or a NYSHIP HMO and wish to participate in the Opt-out Program, you must elect to opt out during the annual Option Transfer Period and attest to and provide information regarding your other employer-sponsored group health benefits for the next plan year. To elect the Opt-out Program, you must complete a NYS Health Insurance Transaction Form (PS-404) and an Opt-out Attestation Form (PS-409) and submit both to your HBA. Your NYSHIP coverage will terminate at the end of the current plan year, and the incentive payments will begin with the first pay period affecting coverage for 2023. Once enrolled in the Opt-out Program, you are not eligible for the incentive payment during any period that you do not meet the requirements for the State contribution to the cost of your NYSHIP coverage. Additionally, if you are receiving the opt-out incentive for Family coverage and your last dependent loses NYSHIP eligibility, you will only be eligible for the Individual payment from that date forward.The Opt-Out Program NYSHIP Code #700 12 Choices 2023/Active1 These benefits are subject to medical necessity and to limitations and exclusions described in the Empire Plan Certificate.Medical/Surgical Program Medical and surgical coverage through: Participating Provider Program - The Participating Provider Program network administered by UnitedHealthcare includes over 1.2 million physicians, laboratories and other providers, such as physical therapists, occupational therapists and chiropractors, located throughout the United States.

If you use an Empire Plan participating provider or facility, you pay a copayment for certain services. Some services are covered at no cost to you.

Please see page 23 for more information.Combined Annual Deductible For Medical/Surgical and MHSU Program services received from a nonparticipating provider or non- network facility, The Empire Plan has a combined annual deductible that must be met before covered services under the Basic Medical Program and non- network expenses under both the HCAP and MHSU Programs can be reimbursed. See the table on page 16 for 2023 combined annual deductible amounts. The Managed Physical Medicine Program has a separate deductible ($250 per enrollee, $250 per enrolled spouse/domestic partner and $250 per all dependent children combined) that is not included in the combined annual deductible. After the combined annual deductible has been met, The Empire Plan considers 80 percent of the usual and customary charge for the Basic Medical Program and non-network practitioner services for the MHSU Program, 50 percent of the network allowance for covered services for non-network HCAP services and 90 percent of the billed charges for covered services for non-network approved facility services for the MHSU Program.

The Managed Physical Medicine Program and HCAP do not have a coinsurance maximum. Basic Medical Provider Discount Program If you are Empire Plan primary, the Plan also includes a program to reduce your out-of-pocket costs when you use a nonparticipating provider. The Basic Medical Provider Discount Program offers discounts from certain physicians and providers who are not part of The Empire Plan participating provider network. These providers are part of the nationwide MultiPlan group, a provider organization contracted with UnitedHealthcare. Empire Plan Basic Medical Program provisions apply, and you must meet the combined annual deductible. Providers in the Basic Medical Provider Discount Program accept a discounted fee for covered services. Your 20 percent coinsurance is based on the lower of the discounted fee or the usual and customary charge. Under this Program, the provider submits your claims, and UnitedHealthcare pays The Empire Plan portion of the provider fee directly to the provider if the services qualify for the Basic Medical Provider Discount Program. Your explanation of benefits shows the discounted amount applied to billed charges.

Advanced Flexible Formulary Drug List The Empire Plan Prescription Drug Program has a flexible formulary drug list for prescription drugs. Designed to provide enrollees and the Plan with the best value in prescription drug spending, the Advanced Flexible Formulary excludes coverage for certain brand-name and generic drugs that have no clinical advantage over other covered medications in the same therapeutic class. View the list on NYSHIP Online. Copayments for Covered Drugs The following copayments apply for covered drugs purchased from a network pharmacy, the mail service pharmacy or the designated specialty pharmacy. Prior authorization is required for certain drugs.Certain covered drugs do not require a copayment when using a network pharmacy: Oral chemotherapy drugs, when prescribed for the treatment of cancer Generic oral contraceptive drugs and devices or brand-name contraceptive drugs/devices without a generic equivalent Tamoxifen, raloxifene, anastrozole and exemestane, when prescribed for the primary prevention of breast cancer Medications used for emergency contraception and pregnancy termination Certain preventive adult vaccines, when administered at a pharmacy that participates in the CVS Caremark National Vaccine Network When you fill a prescription for a covered brand- name drug that has a generic equivalent, you pay the Level 3 or non-preferred copayment, plus the difference in cost between the brand-name drug and the generic equivalent (or \"ancillary charge\"), not to exceed the full retail cost of the drug, unless the brand-name drug has been placed on Level 1 of the Advanced Flexible Formulary. Exceptions apply. 17 Choices 2023/ActiveYou can use a non-network pharmacy or pay out of pocket at a network pharmacy (instead of using your Empire Plan Benefit Card) and submit a claim form for reimbursement. In almost all cases, you will not be reimbursed the total amount you paid for the prescription and your out-of-pocket expenses may exceed the usual copayment amount. To reduce your out-of-pocket expenses, use your Empire Plan Benefit Card whenever possible. Annual Maximum Out-of-Pocket Limit There is a limit on the amount you are expected to pay out of pocket for covered prescription drugs received from a network pharmacy during the plan year. Once you reach the limit, you will have no additional copayments for prescription drugs. Please see page 23 for more information. Specialty Pharmacy Program CVS Caremark Specialty Pharmacy is the designated pharmacy for The Empire Plan Specialty Pharmacy Program. The Program provides enhanced services to individuals using specialty drugs (such as those used to treat complex conditions and those that require special handling, special administration or intensive patient monitoring), including disease and drug education; compliance, side effect and safety management; expedited, scheduled delivery of medications at no additional charge; refill reminder calls; and coordination of all necessary supplies (such as needles and syringes) applicable to the medication. Under the Program, you are covered for an initial 30-day fill of most specialty medications at a retail pharmacy, but all subsequent fills must be obtained through CVS Caremark Specialty Pharmacy. When CVS Caremark dispenses a specialty medication, the applicable mail service copayment is charged. The complete list of specialty drugs included in the Program is available on NYSHIP Online. To get started with CVS Caremark Specialty Pharmacy, request refills or speak to a specialty- trained pharmacist or nurse, call The Empire Plan, choose the Prescription Drug Program and ask to speak with Specialty Customer Care. 18 Choices 2023/ActiveContact The Empire Plan Call The Empire Plan toll free at 1-877-7-NYSHIP (1-877-769-7447) and select the appropriate program.
