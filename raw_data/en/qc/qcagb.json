There's something about bringing a new life into the world that wakes you up to the potential hazards in the world around you. Suddenly you become extra sensitive to every little thing in your new baby's environment - from food and clothing, to items in your home, and even the air they breathe. The shampoos, creams and other baby care products you use on their little bodies are under scrutiny as well....and for good reason. Why Natural Baby Products Matter Pick up a personal care product off a store shelf, and it will very likely contain ingredients linked to hormone-disruption, allergies, or other negative health effects, including cancer. Why? Because current U.S. federal regulations are extremely limited, and untested ingredients are perfectly fine for companies to use. It's one thing to use these ingredients on our grown-up bodies, but another thing altogether for a baby. A baby's tiny body does not detoxify as efficiently as an adult's, so the same chemicals can have a more drastic effect on them. You just don't want to mess around with something like this on your baby. And why take the chance when plenty of chemical free, natural baby care products exist?
