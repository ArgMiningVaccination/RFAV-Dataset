These tools include the standards, assessment anchor documents, Keystone Exams Test Definition, Classroom Diagnostic Tool, Standards Aligned System, and contentbased item and scoring samplers. This 2018 Literature Item and Scoring Sampler is a useful tool for Pennsylvania educators in preparing students for the Keystone Exams by providing samples of test item types and scored student responses. The Item Sampler is not designed to be used as a pretest, a curriculum, or other benchmark for operational testing. This Item and Scoring Sampler contains released operational multiplechoice and constructedresponse items that have appeared on previously administered Keystone Exams. These items will not appear on any future Keystone Exams. Released items provide an idea of the types of items that have appeared on operational exams and that will appear on future operational Keystone Exams. Each item has been through a rigorous review process to ensure alignment with the Assessment Anchors and Eligible Content. This sampler includes items that measure a variety of Assessment Anchor or Eligible Content statements, but it does not include sample items for all Assessment Anchor or Eligible Content statements. The items in this sampler may be used1 as samples of item types that students will encounter in operational testing. Classroom teachers may find it beneficial to have students respond to the constructedresponse items in this sampler. Educators can then use the sampler as a guide to score the responses either independently or together with colleagues. This Item and Scoring Sampler is available in Braille format. For more information regarding Braille, call (717) 9012238. ABOUT THE KEYSTONE EXAMS The Keystone Exams are endofcourse assessments currently designed to assess proficiencies in Algebra I, Biology, and Literature. For detailed information about how the Keystone Exams are being integrated into the Pennsylvania graduation requirements, please contact the Pennsylvania Department of Education or visit the PDE website at http://www.education.pa.gov . Alignment The Literature Keystone Exam consists of questions grouped into two modules: Module 1\u2014Fiction Literature and Module 2\u2014Nonfiction Literature. Each module corresponds to specific content aligned to statements and specifications included in the coursespecific assessment anchor documents. The Literature content included in the Keystone Literature multiplechoice items will align with the Assessment Anchors as defined by the Eligible Content statements. The process skills, directives, and action statements will also specifically align with the Assessment Anchors as defined by the Eligible Content statements. The content included in Literature constructedresponse items aligns with content included in the Eligible Content statements. The process skills, directives, and action statements included in the performance demands of the Literature constructedresponse items align with specifications included in the Assessment Anchor statements, the Anchor Descriptor statements, and/or the Eligible Content statements. In other words, the verbs or action statements used in the constructedresponse items or stems can come from the Eligible Content, Anchor Descriptor, or Assessment Anchor statements. 1 The permission to copy and/or use these materials does not extend to commercial purposes.Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 20182 INFORMATION ABOUT LITERATUREDepth of Knowledge Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) was created by Dr. Norman Webb of the Wisconsin Center for Education Research. Webb's definition of depth of knowledge is the cognitive expectation demanded by standards, curricular activities, and assessment tasks. Webb's DOK includes four levels, from the lowest (basic recall) level to the highest (extended thinking) level. Depth of Knowledge Level 1 Recall Level 2 Basic Application of Skill/Concept Level 3 Strategic Thinking Level 4 Extended Thinking Each Keystone item has been through a rigorous review process and is assigned a DOK level. For additional information about depth of knowledge, please visit the PDE website at http://static.pdesas.org/content/ documents/Keystone_Exams_Understanding_Depth_of_Knowledge_and_Cognitive_Complexity.pdf . Exam Format The Keystone Exams are delivered in a paperandpencil format as well as in a computerbased online format. The multiplechoice items require students to select the best answer from four possible answer options and record their answers in the spaces provided. The correct answer for each multiple choice item is worth one point. The constructedresponse items require students to develop and write (or construct) their responses. There is a single response page in the pencilandpaper and up to 1,000 characters in the online format. Constructed response items in Literature are scored using item specific scoring guidelines based on a 0 to 3point scale. Each multiplechoice item is designed to take about one to oneandahalf minutes to complete. Each constructed response item is designed to take about 10 minutes to complete. The estimated time to respond to a test question is the same for both test formats. During an actual exam administration, students are given additional time as necessary to complete the exam.Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 20183 INFORMATION ABOUT LITERATUREITEM AND SCORING SAMPLER FORMAT This sampler includes the test directions and scoring guidelines that appear in the Keystone Exams. Each sample multiplechoice item is followed by a table that includes the alignment, the answer key, the DOK, the percentage2 of students who chose each answer option, and a brief answer Option analysis or rationale. Each constructedresponse item is followed by a table that includes the alignment, the DOK, and the mean student score. Additionally, each of the included item specific scoring guidelines is combined with sample student responses representing each score point to form a practical, item specific scoring guide. The General Description of Scoring Guidelines for Literature used to develop the item specific scoring guidelines should be used if any additional item specific scoring guidelines are created for use within local instructional programs.

The Palace of the Eagles by Gertrude Landa East of the Land of the Rising Sun there dwelled a king who spent all his days in recreation. His kingdom was on the edge of the world, according to the knowledge of those times, and almost entirely surrounded by the sea. Nobody seemed to care what lay beyond the barrier of rocks that shut off the land from the rest of the world. For the matter of that, nobody appeared to trouble much about anything in that kingdom. Most of the people followed the example of the king and led idle, careless lives, giving no thought to the future. The king regarded the task of governing his subjects as a big nuisance; he did not care to be worried with proposals concerning the welfare of the masses, and documents brought to him by his advisors for signature were never read. \"Don't bother me,\" was his usual remark. \"You are my advisors and officers of state. Deal with affairs as you think best.\" And off he would go to his beloved hunting which was his favorite pastime. The land was fertile, and nobody had ever entertained an idea that bad weather might some year affect the crops and cause a scarcity of grain. They took no precautions to lay in stocks of wheat, and so when one summer there was a great lack of rain and the fields were parched, the winter that followed was marked by suffering. The kingdom was faced by famine, and the people did not like it. They did not know what to do, and when they appealed to the king, he could not help them. Indeed, he could not understand the difficulty. He passed it off very lightly. \"I am a mighty hunter,\" he said. \"I can always kill enough beasts to provide a sufficiency of food.\" But the drought had withered away the grass and the trees, and the shortage of such food had greatly reduced the number of animals. The king found the forests empty of deer and birds. Still he failed to realize the gravity of the situation and what he considered an exceedingly bright idea struck him. \"I will explore the unknown territory beyond the barrier of rocky hills,\" he said. \"Surely there will I find a land of plenty. And, at least,\" he added, \"it will be a pleasant adventure with good hunting.\" A great expedition was therefore arranged, and the king and his hunting companions set forth to find a path over the rocks. This was not at all difficult, and on the third day, a pass was discovered among the crags and peaks that formed the summit of the barrier, and the king saw the region beyond. It seemed a vast and beautiful land, stretching away as far as the eye could see in a forest of huge trees. Carefully, the hunters descended the other side of the rock barrier and entered the unknown land. Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 20187 1 LITERATURE MODULE 1It seemed uninhabited. Nor was there any sign of beast or bird of any kind. No sound disturbed the stillness of the forest, no tracks were visible. As well as the hunters could make out, no foot had ever trodden the region before. Even nature seemed at rest. The trees were all old, their trunks gnarled into fantastic shapes, their leaves yellow and sear as if growth had stopped ages ago. The forest ended abruptly, and the explorers came to a vast open plain, a desert, through which a wide river flowed. Far beyond rose a mountain capped by rocks of regular shape. At any rate, they appeared to be rocks, but the distance was too great to enable anyone to speak with certainty. \"Water,\" said an officer, \"is a sign of life.\" So the king decided to continue as far as the mountain. A ford was discovered in the river, and once on the other side it was possible to make out the rocks crowning the mountain. They looked too regular to be mere rocks, and on approaching nearer the king was sure that a huge building must be at the top of the mountain. When they arrived quite close, there was no doubt about it. Either a town, or a palace, stood on the summit, and it was decided to make the ascent next day. During the night no sound was heard, but to everybody's surprise a distinct path up the mountain was noticed in the morning. It was so overgrown with weeds and moss and straggling creepers that it was obvious it had not been used for a long time. The ascent was accordingly difficult, but halfway up, the first sign of life noticed since the expedition began, made itself visible. It was an eagle. Suddenly it flew down from the mountaintop and circled above the hunters. At length the summit was gained. It was a flat plateau of great expanse, almost the whole of which was covered by an enormous building of massive walls and stupendous towers. \"This is the palace of a great monarch,\" said the king. But no entrance could be seen. The rest of the day was spent in wandering round, but nowhere was a door, or window, or opening visible. It was decided to make a more serious effort next morning to gain entry. However, it seemed a greater puzzle than ever. At length, one of the most venturesome of the party discovered an eagle's nest on one of the smallest towers, and with great difficulty he secured the bird and brought it down to the king. His majesty bade one of his wise men, Muflog, learned in bird languages, to speak to it. He did so. In a harsh croaking voice, the eagle replied, \"I am but a young bird, only seven centuries old. I know naught. On a tower higher than that on which I dwell, is the eyrie of my father. He may be able to give you information.\" More he would not say. The only thing to do was to climb the higher tower and question the father eagle. This was done, and the bird answered: \"On a tower still higher dwells my father, and on yet a higher tower my grandfather, who is two thousand years old. He may know something. I know nothing.\" After considerable difficulty the topmost tower was reached and the venerable bird discovered. He seemed asleep and was only awakened after much coaxing. Then he surveyed the hunters warily. Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 20188 1 LITERATURE MODULE 1\"Let me see, let me think,\" he muttered slowly. \"I did hear, when I was a tiny eagle chick, but a few years old\u2014that was long, long ago\u2014that my greatgrandfather had said that his greatgrandfather had told him he had heard that long, long, long ago\u2014oh, ever so much longer than that\u2014a king lived in this palace; that he died and left it to the eagles; and that in the course of many, many, many thousands of years the door had been covered up by the dust brought by the winds.\" \"Where is the door?\" asked Muflog. That was a puzzle the ancient bird could not answer readily. He thought and thought and fell asleep and had to be kept being awakened until at last he remembered. \"When the sun shines in the morning,\" he croaked, \"its first ray falls on the door.\" Then, worn out with all his thinking and talking, he fell asleep again. There was no rest that night. They all watched to make certain of seeing the first ray of the rising sun strike the palace. When it did so, the spot was carefully noted. But no door could be seen. Digging was therefore begun and after many hours, an opening was found. Through this an entrance was effected into the palace. What a wonderful and mysterious place it was, all overgrown with the weeds of centuries! Tangled masses of creepers lay everywhere\u2014over what were once trimly kept pathways, and almost completely hiding the lower buildings. It was all a terrible scene of desolation. The king's men had to hack away laboriously through the wilderness of weeds with their swords to the central building, and when they did so they came to a door on which was an inscription cut deep into the wood. The language was unknown to all but Muflog, who deciphered it as follows: \"We, the Dwellers in this Palace, lived for many years in Comfort and Luxury. Then Hunger came. We had made no preparation. We had amassed jewels in abundance but not Corn. We ground Pearls and Rubies to fine flour, but could make no Bread. Wherefore we die, bequeathing this Palace to the eagles who will build their eyries on our towers.\" A dread silence fell on the whole party when Muflog read these strange words, and the king turned pale. This warning from the past was making the adventure far from enjoyable. Some of the party suggested a prompt return home. They feared hidden dangers now. But the king remained resolute. \"I must investigate this to the end,\" he said in a firm voice. \"Those who are seized by fear may return. I will go on, if needs be, alone.\" Encouraged by these words, the hunters decided to remain with the king. One of them began to batter at the door, but the king was anxious to preserve the inscription, and after more cutting away of weeds, the key was seen to be sticking in the keyhole. Unlocking the door, however, was no light task, for ages of rust had accumulated . When finally this was accomplished the door creaked heavily on its hinges and a musty smell came from the dank corridor that was revealed. The explorers walked ankledeep in dust through a maze of rooms until they came to a big central hall of statues. \"These must be the effigies of kings,\" said his majesty, and on reading the inscriptions, Muflog said that was so. At the far end of the hall, on a pedestal higher than the others, was a statue bigger than the rest. In addition to the name there was an inscription on the pedestal. Muflog read it amid an awed stillness: Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 20189 1 LITERATURE MODULE 1\"I am the last of the kings\u2014yea, the last of men, and with my own hands have completed this work. I ruled over a thousand cities, rode on a thousand horses, and received the homage of a thousand vassal princes; but when Famine came I was powerless. Ye who may read this, take heed of the fate that has overwhelmed this land. Take but one word of counsel from the last of the mortals; prepare thy meal while the daylight lasts . . .\" The words broke off: the rest was undecipherable. \"Enough,\" cried the king, and his voice was not steady. \"This has indeed been good hunting. I have learned, in my folly and pursuit of pleasure, what I had failed to see for myself. Let us return and act upon the counsel of this king who has met the end that will surely be our own should we forget his warning.\" Scarcely a word was spoken as the king and his hunters made their way back to the land East of the Rising Sun. In all, they had been away forty days when they recrossed the barrier of rocks. They were joyously welcomed. \"What have you brought,\" asked the populace. \"In a little while we shall be starving.\" \"Ye shall not starve,\" said the king. \"I have brought wisdom from the Palace of the Eagles. From the fate and sufferings of others I have learned a lesson\u2014my duty.\" At once he set to work to organize the proper distribution of the food supply and the cultivation of the land. He wasted no more time on foolish pleasures, and in due course the land East of the Rising Sun enjoyed happiness and prosperity and even established fruitful colonies in the plain overlooked by the Palace of the Eagles. 109088Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 201810 1 LITERATURE MODULE 11. Read the sentence from the passage. \"They looked too regular to be mere rocks, and on approaching nearer the king was sure that a huge building must be at the top of the mountain.\" How does the author's use of foreshadowing in the sentence affect the passage? A. It hints that the mountain is the home to a family of eagles. B. It hints that the king is more intelligent than his companions. C. It hints that the climb to the top of the mountain is difficult. D. It hints that the king may be in for a surprise. 701626 Item Information Alignment L.F .1.1.3 Answer Key D Depth of Knowledge 2 pvalue B 10% 66% (correct answer) Option Annotations Students are asked to analyze how the author uses techniques of fiction to effectively communicate an idea. Students must be able to understand the function of foreshadowing as a literary technique and its function within the text. Option D is the correct answer. The foreshadowing of the surprise uncovering of the neglected castle relates to the theme of the king's surprise realization that he has neglected his duties as king. Even though the mountain is home to the family of eagles, the foreshadowing does not relate to this fact; therefore, Option A is incorrect. Even though the king decides that a large structure must be on the mountain, there is no text evidence to suggest that he is more intelligent than his companions; therefore, Option B is incorrect. Even though the climb to the mountain was difficult, this example of foreshadowing does not suggest this fact; therefore, Option C is incorrect. Students may select these incorrect options if they misinterpret textual details or are unable to understand how foreshadowing functions within the text.Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 201811 1 LITERATURE MODULE 12.

Option A is the correct answer. The given sentences indicate that the grandfather bird is \"two thousand years old\" and \"may know something.\" Therefore, using these context clues, the meaning of \"venerable\" as \"worthy of respect because of age and character\" can be inferred. Options B, C, and D are incorrect meanings for \"venerable.\" Students may select these incorrect options if they do not understand how to use context clues or if they misinterpret the context clues in the sentences.Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 201812 1 LITERATURE MODULE 13.

Option A is the correct answer. Clues in the sentence such as \"when we die,\" \"to the eagles,\" and \"who will build their eyries on our towers\" suggest that the palace will be given to the eagles after a passage of time. Options B, C, and D are incorrect meanings of \"bequeathing.\" Students may select these incorrect options if they do not understand how to use context clues or if they misinterpret the context clues in the sentences.Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 201813 1 LITERATURE MODULE 14. Read the sentences from the passage. \"Some of the party suggested a prompt return home. They feared hidden dangers now. But the king remained resolute.\" Why does the king most likely want to continue investigating the palace? A. He wants to get away from his companions. B. He worries about returning home with nothing. C. He feels responsible for learning from the previous kings of the palace. D. He believes that the eagles have an important message waiting for him. 701617 Item Information Alignment L.F .2.1.1 Answer Key C Depth of Knowledge 2 pvalue A 2% pvalue B 23% pvalue D 24% Option Annotations Students are asked to draw a conclusion about the king based on information in the text. Students must be able to use details from the given sentences to draw a conclusion. Option C is the correct answer. The king discovers that \"the dwellers in this palace\" were kings who \"lived for many years in comfort and luxury\" before dying of hunger. Because of this message, the king feels that he has a duty to learn a lesson from their words. There is no text evidence that the king wants to get away from his companions; therefore, Option A is incorrect. Because the palace has been abandoned and neglected, there is little chance of bringing home anything of value. In addition, there is no text evidence that the king is searching for food in the palace; therefore Option B is incorrect. Since the message was written by humans, it is humans, not the eagles, who have a message waiting for him; therefore, Option D is incorrect. Students may select these incorrect options if they misinterpret details from the text. Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 201814 1 LITERATURE MODULE 15.

This option contains the important events: a king has a problem caused by his own actions, he explores an unknown area, and he finds a solution to his problem. Even though the king has had a life of \"easy living,\" Option A is missing how his finding the eagles leads to a solution; therefore, Option A is incorrect. Option B is vague and does not specify how finding the palace helps the king; therefore, Option B is incorrect. Option C does not indicate how the discovery of the new land helps him; therefore, Option C is incorrect.

Students must understand the concept of first person point of view and how it can impact the meaning of the passage. Option B is the correct answer. If the passage were written from the first person point of view of the king, the reader would know the king's internal thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. His change of character would be more apparent because the reader would know how his thoughts, feelings, and beliefs changed as a result of his discovery of the palace. The theme would most likely be more apparent to the reader if the king expressed his thoughts, feelings, and beliefs; therefore, Option A is incorrect. The setting would most likely not be affected by a change in point of view; therefore, Option C is incorrect. The impact of the king's companions would be more apparent if the king expressed his thoughts, feelings, and beliefs; therefore, Option D is incorrect.

Analyze the significance of the passage as it relates to the value of conserving resources. Use information from the passage to support your analysis. The passage shows that forethought is necessary to make good use of resources. In the kingdom, the land is fertile, and no supplies are laid aside as backup. This is significant, as it shows how the kingdom took their fortune for granted. Everything was perfect, so no one thought ahead or prepared for possible emergency. Conservation of resources is wise even when conditions seem fine. The King also sees the value in conservation when famine strikes unexpectedly. He was never concerned for domestic affairs in his realm, living day to day. So when the consequences hit and people begin to starve, he doesn't know how to help them. Good leadership is key in conservation. In the passage, the King visits an abandoned castle that serves as a lesson in making good use of resources. This lesson is significant as the King and his men realize that the castle failed because of squandering resources.

Then answer questions 1-9. Rails to Trails by David Gluckman Our pace is so fast. In the everchanging and evolving world of technology, we literally cannot keep up with the times. Once upon a time the train seemed like the epitome of the modern world. Sleek and bold trains were our nation's pride and joy and symbolized the possibilities of a world beyond the one in which we lived. Connecting large cities and small towns, used for transportation and for the shipping of goods, the train was the pulse of the nation. But times change. With the advent of the car and the building of mass highways, trains became a secondary form of transportation. Railroad tracks were abandoned. Nature took over and where once a track split through the woods, only a shadow of the track remained. Enter the RailstoTrails Conservancy (RTC), a group of outdoor enthusiasts who in 1986 began the arduous task of transforming abandoned railroad tracks into nature trails. Banding together with other conservation groups, RTC removed tracks and molded the trails into wonderful paths running through urban and rural areas. There is something remarkable about traveling the nation in pursuit of the abandoned railroad track now converted to greenways, bicycle paths, and nature trails. What better way to see the country than by traversing these rail beds? The History of the RailstoTrails Conservancy The beauty of RTC is that by converting railroad rightsofway for public use, it has not only preserved a part of our nation's history but also allowed a variety of outdoor enthusiasts to enjoy the paths and trails. Bicyclists, inline skaters, nature lovers, hikers, equestrians, and paddlers can enjoy the trails, as can railroad history buffs. All of Florida's railtrails are wheelchair accessible. Throughout Florida, there are thirty active RTC trails, and each year more are added. You can find trails near cities and rural trails far from the madding crowd. In many ways we have come full circle. By preserving part of our history, we can enjoy the trails as if time stood still. The concept of preserving these valuable corridors and converting them into multiuse public trails began in the Midwest, where railroad abandonments were most widespread. Once the tracks came out, people started using the corridors for walking and hiking while exploring railroad relics ranging from train stations and mills to bridges and tunnels. Although many people agreed with the great new concept, the reality of actually converting abandoned railroad corridors into public trails was a much greater challenge. From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, many railtrail efforts failed as corridors were lost to development, sold to the highest bidder, or broken into pieces.Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 201843 2 LITERATURE MODULE 2In 1983 Congress enacted an amendment to the National Trails System Act directing the Interstate Commerce Commission to allow abouttobeabandoned railroad lines to be \"railbanked,\" or set aside for future transportation use while being used as trails in the interim. In essence this law preempts rail corridor abandonment, keeping the corridors intact for trail use and any possible future use. This powerful new piece of legislation made it easier for agencies and organizations to acquire rail corridors for trails, but many projects still failed because of short deadlines, lack of information, and local opposition to trails. The RailstoTrails Conservancy was formed in 1986 to provide a national voice for the creation of railtrails. RTC quickly developed a strategy to preserve the largest amount of rail corridor in the shortest period of time: a national advocacy program to defend the new railbanking law in the courts and in Congress, coupled with a direct projectassistance program to help public agencies and local railtrail groups overcome the challenges of converting a rail into a trail. The strategy is working. In 1986 the RailstoTrails Conservancy knew of only seventyfive railtrails and ninety projects in the works. In 2001 there were more than 1,000 railtrails, and many additional projects under way. The RTC vision of creating an interconnected network of trails across the country is becoming a reality. The thriving railstotrails movement has created more than 7,700 miles of public trails for a wide range of users. People across the country are now realizing the incredible benefits of railtrails. Benefits of RailTrails Railtrails are flat or have gentle grades, making them perfect for multiple users ranging from walkers and bicyclists to inline skaters and people with disabilities. In urban areas railtrails act as linear greenways through developed areas, efficiently providing muchneeded recreation space while serving as utilitarian transportation corridors. They link neighborhoods and workplaces and connect congested areas to open spaces. In many cities and suburbs, railtrails are used for commuting to work, school, and shopping. In rural areas railtrails can provide a significant stimulus to local businesses. People who use trails often spend money on food, beverages, camping, hotels, bedandbreakfasts, bicycle rentals, souvenirs, and other items. Studies have shown that trail users have generated as much as $1.25 million annually for a town through which a trail passes. Railtrails preserve historic structures, such as train stations, bridges, tunnels, mills, factories, and canals. These structures shelter an important piece of history and enhance the trail experience. Wildlife enthusiasts can enjoy the railtrails, which are home to birds, plants, wetlands, and small and large mammals. Many railtrails serve as plant and animal conservation corridors, and, in some cases, endangered species can be found in habitats located along the route. Recreation, transportation, historic preservation, economic revitalization, openspace conservation, and wildlife preservation\u2014these are just some of the many benefits of railtrails and the reasons why people love them. The strongest argument for the railstotrails movement, however, is ultimately about the human spirit. It's about the dedication of individuals who have a dream and follow that vision so that other people can enjoy the fruits of their labor.Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 201844 2 LITERATURE MODULE 2How to Get Involved If you really enjoy railtrails, there are opportunities to join the movement to save abandoned rail corridors and to create more trails. Donating even a small amount of your time can help get more trails up and going. Here are some ways you can help the effort: Write a letter to your city, county, or state elected official in favor of protrail legislation. You can also write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper highlighting a trail or trail project. Attend a public hearing to voice support for a local trail. Volunteer to plant flowers or trees along an existing trail or spend several hours helping a cleanup crew on a nearby railtrail project. Lead a hike along an abandoned corridor with your friends or a community group. Become an active member on a trail effort in your area. Many groups host trail events, undertake fundraising campaigns, publish brochures and newsletters, and carry out other activities to promote a trail or project. Virtually all of these efforts are completed by volunteers, and they are always looking for another helping hand. Whatever your time allows, get involved. The success of a community's railtrail depends upon the level of citizen participation. How to Use RailTrails By design, railtrails accommodate a variety of trail users. While this is generally one of the many benefits of railtrails, it also can lead to occasional conflicts among trail users. Everyone should take responsibility to ensure trail safety by following a few simple trail etiquette guidelines. One of the most basic etiquette rules is \"Wheels yield to heels.\" Bicyclists (and inline skaters) yield to other users; pedestrians yield to equestrians. Generally, this means that you need to warn users (to whom you are yielding) of your presence. If, as a bicyclist, you fail to warn a walker that you are about to pass, the walker could step in front of you, causing an accident that could have been prevented. Similarly, it is best to slow down and warn an equestrian of your presence. A horse can be startled by a bicycle, so make verbal contact with the rider and be sure it is safe to pass. Here are some other guidelines you should follow to promote trail safety: Obey all trail rules posted at trailheads. Stay to the right except when passing. Pass slower traffic on their left; yield to oncoming traffic when passing. Give a clear warning signal when passing. Always look ahead and behind when passing. Travel at a responsible speed. Keep pets on a leash. Do not trespass on private property. Move off the trail surface when stopped to allow others to pass. Yield to other trail users when entering and crossing the trail. Do not disturb the wildlife. Do not swim in areas not designated for swimming. Watch out for traffic when crossing the street. Obey all traffic signals. 107731Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 201845 2 LITERATURE MODULE 21. Read the sentences from the passage. \"But times change.

The passage states that a bicyclist should \"slow down and warn an equestrian of [his or her] presence.\" Although a bicyclist should look ahead, this is not what a bicyclist should do first when trying to pass a person on horseback; therefore, Option B is incorrect. Although a bicyclist should move to the left to pass a person on horseback, this is not the first step; therefore, Option C is incorrect. Although a bicyclist should signal to a person on horseback of his/her desire to pass, the passage does not mention the need to wait for the rider to move aside; therefore, Option D is incorrect.

Students must use details from the passage to draw an inference about the overall purpose. Option D is the correct answer. The focus of the passage is on informing readers of the recreational, economic, and environmental values of railtrails. Even though the passage does discuss how railtrails were once occupied by tracks for trains, the emphasis of the passage is not on the history of the railtrails, but on the present and future of these trails; therefore, Option A is incorrect. Even though there is a section of the passage that discusses how to safely use railtrails, this is not the main purpose of the passage; therefore, Option B is incorrect. Although the author clearly values railtrails, the purpose is not to convince readers to frequently use railtrails; therefore, Option C is incorrect.

Then answer questions 10-18. Give Your Body a Boost\u2014With Laughter by R. Morgan Griffin Some researchers think laughter just might be the best medicine, helping you feel better and putting that spring back in your step. \"I believe that if people can get more laughter in their lives, they are a lot better off,\" says Steve Wilson, MA, CSP , a psychologist and laugh therapist. \"They might be healthier too.\" Yet researchers aren't sure if it's actually the act of laughing that makes people feel better. A good sense of humor, a positive attitude, and the support of friends and family might play a role too. \"The definitive research into the potential health benefits of laughter just hasn't been done yet,\" says Robert R. Provine, professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and author of Laughter: A Scientific Investigation . But while we don't know for sure that laughter helps people feel better, it certainly isn't hurting. Laughter Therapy: What Happens When We Laugh? We change physiologically when we laugh. We stretch muscles throughout our face and body, our pulse and blood pressure go up, and we breathe faster, sending more oxygen to our tissues. People who believe in the benefits of laughter say it can be like a mild workout\u2014and may offer some of the same advantages as a workout. \"The effects of laughter and exercise are very similar,\" says Wilson. \"Combining laughter and movement, like waving your arms, is a great way to boost your heart rate.\" One pioneer in laughter research, William Fry, claimed it took ten minutes on a rowing machine for his heart rate to reach the level it would after just one minute of hearty laughter. And laughter appears to burn calories too. Maciej Buchowski, a researcher from Vanderbilt University, conducted a small study in which he measured the amount of calories expended in laughing. It turned out that 10-15 minutes of laughter burned 50 calories. While the results are intriguing, don't be too hasty in ditching that treadmill. One piece of chocolate has about 50 calories; at the rate of 50 calories per hour, losing one pound would require about 12 hours of concentrated laughter! Laughter's Effects on the Body In the last few decades, researchers have studied laughter's effects on the body and turned up some potentially interesting information on how it affects us: Blood flow. Researchers at the University of Maryland studied the effects on blood vessels when people were shown either comedies or dramas. After the screening, the blood vessels of the group who watched the comedy behaved normally\u2014expanding and contracting easily. But the blood vessels in people who watched the drama tended to tense up, restricting blood flow. Immune response. Increased stress is associated with decreased immune system response, says Provine. Some studies have shown that the ability to use humor may raise the level of infectionfighting antibodies in the body and boost the levels of immune cells, as well. Keystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 201862 2 LITERATURE MODULE 2 Blood sugar levels. One study of 19 people with diabetes looked at the effects of laughter on blood sugar levels. After eating, the group attended a tedious lecture. On the next day, the group ate the same meal and then watched a comedy. After the comedy, the group had lower blood sugar levels than they did after the lecture. Relaxation and sleep. The focus on the benefits of laughter really began with Norman Cousins' memoir, Anatomy of an Illness . Cousins, who was diagnosed with a painful spine condition, found that a diet of comedies helped him feel better. He said that ten minutes of laughter allowed him two hours of painfree sleep. The Evidence: Is Laughter the Best Medicine? But things get murky when researchers try to sort out the full effects of laughter on our minds and bodies. Is laughter really good for you? Can it actually boost your energy? Not everyone is convinced. \"I don't mean to sound like a curmudgeon1,\" says Provine, \"but the evidence that laughter has health benefits is iffy at best.\" He says that most studies of laughter have been small and not well conducted. He also says too many researchers have an obvious bias: they go into the study wanting to prove that laughter has benefits. For instance, Provine says studies of laughing have often not looked at the effects of other, similar activities. \"It's not really clear that the effects of laughing are distinct from screaming,\" Provine says. He says that the most convincing health benefit he's seen from laughter is its ability to dull pain. Numerous studies of people in pain or discomfort have found that when they laugh they report that their pain doesn't bother them as much. But Provine believes it's not clear that comedy is necessarily better than another distraction. \"It could be that a compelling drama would have the same effect.\" One of the biggest problems with laughter research is that it's very difficult to determine cause and effect. For instance, a study might show that people who laugh more are less likely to be sick. But that might be because people who are healthy have more to laugh about. Or researchers might find that, among a group of people with the same disease, people who laugh more have more energy. But that could be because the people who laugh more have a personality that allows them to cope better. So it becomes very hard to say if laughter is actually an agent of change, or just a sign of a person's underlying condition. Laughing It Up for Quality of Life Laughter, Provine believes, is part of a larger picture. \"Laughter is social, so any health benefits might really come from being close with friends and family, and not the laughter itself.\" In his own research, Provine has found that we're thirty times more likely to laugh when we're with other people than when we're alone. People who laugh a lot may just have a strong connection to the people around them. That in itself might have health benefits. Wilson agrees there are limits to what we know about laughter's benefits. \"Laughing more could make you healthier, but we don't know,\" he tells WebMD2. But we all know that laughing, being with friends and family, and being happy can make us feel better and give us a boost\u2014even though studies may not show why. So Wilson and Provine agree that regardless of whether laughter actually improves your health or boosts your energy, it undeniably improves your quality of life. \"Obviously, I'm not antilaughter,\" says Provine. \"I'm just saying that if we enjoy laughing, isn't that reason enough to laugh?\" 1 curmudgeon\u2014grouch; difficult person 2 WebMD\u2014a Web site covering various aspects of health and wellnessKeystone Literature Item and Scoring Sampler\u2014September 201863 2 LITERATURE MODULE 210.
